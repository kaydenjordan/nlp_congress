 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the REINS  Act. I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for  taking charge of this bill in the 115th Congress and Judiciary Chairman  Goodlatte for quickly bringing it to the floor.   This week and next, the primary focus of debate here in the House is  the stranglehold of regulation on the economy and its intrusion into  the everyday lives of Americans. These onerous burdens are well-known  to Members of Congress on both sides.   Over the past several years, I have spent countless hours traveling  across the nearly 6,600 square miles of my district. I have met with my  constituents in their homes, in their workplaces and social halls. They  have pleaded with me for release from the regulations that limit their  ability to prosper, innovate, and grow.   Unlike the nameless, faceless, ever-growing bureaucracy here in  Washington, we have listened to the people's concerns. We have made  regulatory reform a priority and the focal point for jump-starting our  economy. By placing final approval of major regulations in the hands of  Congress, the REINS Act is an important launch point in our efforts to  dismantle the administrative state and make government more accountable  to the American people.    Our Founders vested in Congress--and Congress alone--the power to  write the laws. Unfortunately, over our history, we have delegated much  of that power away. The Founders could not have imagined our current  scenario where the complaints of many fall on the deaf ears of an  unelected few in Washington.   Thinking over the past 8 years, the REINS Act could have prevented  numerous regulations that the American people knew were threats to  their very way of life. Perhaps a trillion dollars in costs could have  been avoided. I cannot even imagine how many jobs might have been saved  or created if we avoided the regulatory barrage brought on by the Obama  administration.   For example, we could have prevented the waters of the United States  regulation that impacts the farmers near my home in rural Pennsylvania.  The FCC's net neutrality rule might have been overturned, a classic  rulemaking bait and switch where the FCC ignored the mountains of  public comment to achieve its own political ends. An unaccountable sum  of environmental regulations might have been avoided before destroying  large swaths of our industry and imposing huge costs on taxpayers.   Our prime takeaway from these instances and others is that the  runaway regulators issued wide-ranging and economy-destroying  regulations with complete disregard for the hardworking American  citizens whose livelihoods were at stake.   Today we take an important step to reassert the voice of the American  people in our government. The REINS Act reestablishes the Congress as  the final judge of whether or not any particular regulation actually  does what the Congress meant it to do.   Returning this responsibility to the branch of government most  attentive and accountable to the people adheres to the principles of  our Nation's founding. It is an effort that all elected to Congress  should support.   I urge my colleagues to support the REINS Act.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  eloquence of the gentleman from the great State of Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen), my friend out of the great city of Memphis.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The gentleman from Pennsylvania is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment renders congressional  findings on climate change and requires that agencies report to  Congress on greenhouse gas impacts associated with a rule. It also  requires agencies to report on a rule's effect on low-income and rural  communities.   Further, the amendment expands the definition of major rule to  include rules that allow increases of carbon emissions by more than  25,000 metric tons per year or that might increase the risk of certain  diseases in rural or low-income communities.   I oppose this amendment.   The REINS Act is not designed to address one or two subjects of  regulation with heightened scrutiny but not others. It is to restore  accountability to the people's elected representatives in Congress for  the largest regulatory decisions, whatever subject is involved.   Further, and consistent with that, the addition of congressional  findings in one policy area--climate change--but no other, has no place  in the REINS Act.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment exempts from the bill any  rule reducing the incidence of cancer, premature mortality, asthma  attacks, and respiratory diseases in children. But do not be fooled.  This amendment is not about reducing these maladies. It is about  transferring the power to decide how best to do so from elected  representatives to unaccountable bureaucrats.   For example, government could substantially reduce teenage mortality  by barring teenage drivers off the road. Of course, there would be a  substantial cost to that policy, and there are surely less burdensome  ways to achieve the same reductions in mortality. The right decision  requires a delicate balancing of interest. Agencies can provide  valuable expertise, but, when there is a lot at stake, the ultimate  decision on how best to strike that balance is properly made by elected  officials accountable to the people.   That is the intuition behind the REINS Act and the fundamental point  that is lost on those who oppose it.   Reducing the incidence of mortality and serious disease is a goal  that all Members share. This bill does not frustrate that goal. It  merely ensures that elected representatives decide how best to achieve  that policy so that our Republic remains a government by the people as  the Constitution designed.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, of course, this legislative body  has all the power to go back to policymaking after an administrative  agency makes a determination, but we are not micromanagers. We are  legislators. And I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Castor  amendment to protect children's health.   If you won't create an exception for children's health, I wonder, you  are not willing to really recognize the fundamental constitutional  basis of this government. It is one that relies on checks and balances  as the basis of our government.   I urge my colleagues then to also support the Castor amendment but  oppose the REINS Act in the end.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Cicilline    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in House Report 115-1.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment exempts from the bill any  rule pertaining to health or public safety.  [[Page H139]]    Health and public safety regulations done properly serve important  goals, and the bill does nothing to frustrate the effective achievement  of those goals; but Federal health and public safety regulations  constitute an immense part of total Federal regulation and have been  the source of many of the most abusive, unnecessarily expensive, and  job- and wage-destroying regulations. To remove these areas of  regulation from the bill would severely weaken the bill's important  reforms to lower cumulative regulatory costs and increase the  accountability of our regulatory system and the Congress to the people,  so I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to carve out from the  REINS Act's reforms regulations that would reduce the amount of lead in  public drinking water.   But, like other amendments, this amendment is not so much about  achieving a particular health or safety result. It is about taking the  decision on how best to do that away from elected Representatives and  handing it down to unaccountable bureaucrats. Agencies can provide  valuable expertise, but when there is a lot at stake, the ultimate  decision on how best to strike that balance is properly made by elected  officials who are accountable to the people. This is the intuition  behind the REINS Act, and the fundamental point is lost on its  opponents.   Preventing dangerous levels of lead in our drinking water is a goal  all Members share. This bill does not frustrate that goal. It merely  ensures that elected Representatives decide how best to achieve that  policy so that our Republic remains a government by the people, as the  Constitution designed.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just to reiterate what our position is, it  is about time that we in D.C.--in Congress--take our responsibility  back from unelected bureaucrats and make these decisions. We have seen,  over the past 8 years, what overburdensome regulation has done to this  country as far as crushing jobs.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, the amendment seeks to carve out from the  REINS Act's reforms regulations intended to protect young children and  infants from harm.   Child safety is a goal all Members share, but to shield bureaucrats  who write child safety regulations from accountability to Congress is  no way to guarantee a child's safety. The only thing that would  guarantee is less careful decisionmaking and more insulation of  faceless bureaucrats from the public.   The Constitution entrusts to Congress the authority to protect  children--and all citizens--from harmful products flowing in interstate  commerce. The public should be able to trust Congress--and we should  trust ourselves--to make sure that Washington bureaucrats make the  right decisions to protect child safety when we delegate legislative  authority to regulatory agencies.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the faceless, nameless, deadly  bureaucrats out here who mean the public harm, those are our relatives.  Those are our mothers, our fathers, who work for the Federal  Government. They are the civil servants that serve us. They are not  nameless and faceless people of bad will and bad intent. They are good  people who go to work every day and try to protect us and protect our  children.   All we are asking for with this amendment is for there to be a carve- out to protect the most vulnerable among us, our children.   This legislation is based on the faulty premise that the cost of  regulations outweigh the benefits. What is the cost of a benefit when  it comes to the health, safety, and well-being of a child?   The people who promulgate these rules mean to protect these children,  and this amendment goes to that ability of the regulators to do that.  Sometimes regulation is good.   Even though a couple of jobs might go away because of the regulation,  isn't it worth the health, safety, and well-being of our children that  a couple of jobs could not reach fruition? Everything is not a cost- benefit analysis. Sometimes there is some humanity in the mix that we  have to consider.   I urge my colleagues to think about it one more time and be in favor  of the very reasonable Jackson Lee amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the REINS Act doesn't prevent the  bureaucracy, the agencies, from making recommendations and suggestions  to Congress. It simply says Congress will have the last word and not a  handful of bureaucrats, and many of them don't even have experience in  these areas.   I urge my colleagues to not support this amendment but to support the  REINS Act.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will  be postponed.              Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8  printed in House Report 115-1.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I offer an amendment to H.R. 26.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         In paragraph (2) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert after ``means any rule'' the following: ``(other than       a special rule)''.  [[Page H141]]         In paragraph (3) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert before the period at the end the following: ``, and       includes any special rule''.        Add, at the end of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill, the       following:        ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule that pertains       to improving employment, retention, and earnings of workforce       participants, especially those participants with significant       barriers to employment.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment  to H.R. 26, which would exempt from the bill rules that improve the  employment retention and wages of workforce participants, especially  those with significant barriers to employment. Since one of the  justifications, or the main justification, for this underlying  legislation is to promote job growth from corporate titans at the  expense, by the way, of health and safety of Americans, at least, we  could exempt from the bill rules that improve the employment,  retention, and wages of workforce participants, especially those with  significant barriers to employment.   When President Obama took office in 2009, he inherited the worst  economic crisis since the Great Depression. This economic quagmire was  created by misguided Republican policies that put profits ahead of  people, resulting in reckless decisions on Wall Street that cost  millions of Americans their homes and jobs. In other words, the Great  Recession was caused by the collapse of the financial markets due to an  unreliability and instability of the predatory lending market, which  had taken hold. There was so much paper out there on Wall Street that  was worthless because it was based on these homes that people couldn't  pay the notes for, and all of that was caused by deregulation, lack of  regulation.   Now we have a period with Dodd-Frank coming into play and the  financial markets improving, the protection and economic security of  American families increasing, being strengthened.   Now, at the beginning of this Congress, we get legislation to gut the  Dodd-Frank regulation and other regulations that would protect people  from excesses of the corporate community. I am just asking, in this  amendment, that we don't let it apply in the case of situations where  the bill improves employment retention or wages or workforce  participants, especially those with barriers to employment.   So, according to leading economic indicators, private-sector  businesses have created more than 15.6 million new jobs. The  unemployment rate has dropped to well below 5 percent to the lowest  point in nearly a decade, and incomes are rising faster, while the  poverty rate has dropped to the lowest point since 1968. This has all  occurred during an administration that is proenvironment, proclean  energy, and proworkplace safety.   In fact, during this time, our Nation has doubled our production of  clean energy and reduced our carbon emissions faster than any other  advanced nation. And the price of gas is down to roughly $2 a barrel,  despite all of these cumbersome and oppressive regulations by the Obama  administration that the other side complains about.   Notwithstanding this progress that has been made, there is still much  work to be done for the millions of Americans who remain out of work,  underemployed, or have not seen significant wage growth postrecession.   Congress should be working tirelessly across party lines to find  solutions to persistent unemployment and stagnant wages, such as a  public investment agenda that will increase productivity and domestic  output while turning the page on our historic underinvestment in our  Nation's roads, bridges, and educational institutions.   Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, this bill, the REINS Act, is not a jobs  bill. It is a legislative hacksaw to the critical public health and  safety protections that ensure our Nation's air is clean, our water is  pure, and our workplace vehicles, homes, and consumer products are  safe.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, the amendment carves out of the REINS Act's  congressional approval procedures regulations that attempt to improve  employment, retention, and earnings, particularly for those with  significant barriers to employment.   The danger in the amendment is the strong incentive it gives agencies  to manipulate their analysis of a major regulation's jobs and wages  impacts. Far too often, agencies will be tempted to shade the analysis  to skirt the bill's congressional approval requirement.   In addition, regulations alleged to create new job prospects often do  so by destroying real, existing jobs and creating new, hoped-for jobs  associated with regulatory compliance. For example, the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act rules have shut down existing  power plants all over the country, throwing myriads of workers out of  work. EPA and OMB attempt to justify that with claims that more new  green jobs have been created as a result.   In the end, this is just another way in which government picks the  jobs winners and the jobs losers, and there is no guarantee that all of  the new green jobs will ever actually exist.   The REINS Act is not intended to force any particular outcome. It  does not choose between clean air and dirty air. It does not choose  between new jobs and old jobs.   Instead, the REINS Act chooses between two ways of making laws. It  chooses the way the Framers intended in which accountability for laws  with major economic impact rests with Congress. It rejects the way  Washington has operated for too long in which there is no  accountability because decisions are made by unelected agency  officials.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).   The amendment was rejected.                    Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Nadler    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9  printed in House Report 115-1.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment carves out of the REINS Act's  congressional approval procedures all regulations that pertain to  nuclear reactor safety standards. REINS Act supporters believe in  nuclear safety. We want to guarantee that regulatory decisions that  pertain to nuclear reactor safety are the best decisions that can be  made.   That is precisely why I oppose the amendment. By its terms, the  amendment shields from the REINS Act's congressional approval  procedures not only major regulations that would raise nuclear reactor  safety standards, but also regulations that would lower them.   All major regulations pertaining to nuclear reactor safety standards,  whether they raise or lower standards, should fall within the REINS  Act. That way agencies with authority over nuclear reactor safety would  know that Congress must approve their major regulations before they go  into effect.   That provides a powerful incentive for the agencies to write the best  possible regulations, ones that Congress can easily approve. It is a  solution that everyone should support because it makes Congress more  accountable and ensures agencies will write better rules. All Americans  will be safer for it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, this administration has proven  how thousands of regulations have crushed jobs for the middle class  people in this country. The REINS Act does designate and allows and  wants agencies to make decisions as far as what they think the law  should be and send it to Congress.   We do have the time. We have the resources and the knowledge. That is  why we have full committees. That is why we have subcommittees and we  have experts come in and testify. Yet, we still need to get back--that  the 535 Members of Congress, the House and the Senate, make the final  decision and not a handful of unelected bureaucrats.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to carve out from the  REINS Act's reform regulations that concern natural gas or hazardous  materials pipeline safety or the prevention of pipeline spills and  their adverse impacts.   We all support pipeline safety and the prevention of harm from  pipeline spills, but there is no assurance that the amendment would  guarantee the achievement of those goals. On the contrary, the  amendment would shield from congressional accountability procedures,  regulations, that actually threaten to decrease safety. They also would  shield from the bill's congressional approval requirements new,  ideologically driven regulations intended to impede America's access to  new sources of cheap, clean, and plentiful natural gas.   The legislative body is the legislative body. We are trying to have  oversight over the bureaucracy. The House and the Senate is not a  bureaucracy. It is a legislative body, according to the Constitution  that represents the people of the United States. Therefore, the House  and the Senate and the President should have the last say in whether  something becomes law or not.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, my opponent is right. It is the duty of  Congress to provide rules and to provide guidelines and for the  agencies to go into the details in creating these rules.   I know that the other side is opposed to the rules. They have been  touting about regulations, but poor regulations reduces jobs, too. It  creates monopolies. It creates pollution. But that is not what we are  talking about.   What we are talking about is public safety. I think what we need to  do is look at what is going to benefit the public safety and what is  going to protect people, lives, property, and the environment. That is  what this amendment does. It is simple. It exempts pipeline safety from  H.R. 26.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, what better group, such as the Committee on  Energy and Commerce or other committees here, the full committees, the  subcommittees, would be looking out and should be looking out for the  public safety and the welfare than the 535 Members of Congress?   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.              Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Scott of Virginia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11  printed in House Report 115-1.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Section 804(4) of title 5, United States Code, as proposed       to be amended to read by section 3 of the bill, is amended in       subparagraph (B), by striking ``or'' at the end.        Section 804(4) of title 5, United States Code, as proposed       to be amended to read by section 3 of the bill, is amended in       subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; or''.        Section 804(4) of title 5, United States Code, as proposed       to be amended to read by section 3 of the bill, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(D) any rule that pertains to workplace health and safety       made by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or       the Mine Safety and Health Administration that is necessary       to prevent or reduce the incidence of traumatic injury,       cancer or irreversible lung disease.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  [[Page H144]]    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from  coverage under the REINS Act any rule which pertains to workplace  health and safety made by the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, OSHA, or the Mine Safety and Health Administration,  MSHA, that is necessary to prevent or reduce the incidence of traumatic  injury, cancer or irreversible lung disease.   I am offering the amendment because we should not be creating  obstacles to the protection of life and limb. We should be concerned  about repealing such workplace rules. Actually, this concern is not  theoretical. There was a report from the chairman of the Freedom Caucus  that actually calls for the repeal of multiple safety and health rules.                                time  1700    One OSHA rule, for example, will reduce slip, trip, and fall hazards,  which are actually a leading cause of worker deaths and lost workday  injuries. We found that this rule had not been updated since 1971, and  OSHA has calculated that over 10 years the rule will prevent nearly 300  worker deaths and more than 58,000 lost-time injuries. The net benefit,  cash benefit, of the rule is projected to be over $3 billion over 10  years.   Another rule at risk is the modernization of OSHA's beryllium  exposure limit, a 70-year-old standard that was obsolete even before it  was issued. Workers who inhaled beryllium can develop debilitating,  incurable, and frequently fatal illnesses. One known as chronic  beryllium disease also increased lung cancer.   In the 1940s, workers at the Atomic Energy Commission plants were  contracting acute beryllium poisoning. To deal with the problem, two  scientists agreed to set the exposure limit at 2 micrograms per cubic  meter of air while sitting in the back of a taxicab on their way to a  meeting. This discredited standard is often called the taxicab standard  because there was no data to support it, and there is now significant  scientific evidence that show that it has failed to protect workers.   One cost of keeping the so-called taxicab standard is estimated at  the loss of nearly 100 lives a year. So we need to make sure that this  rule is updated. It is in final stages after 18 years of development.  The finalized rule is expected to come out soon. Other rules involve  mine safety and other safety and health concerns.   The REINS Act would make it harder to protect workers' health and  safety. The bill would create more bureaucracy by requiring that any  major rule receive bicameral resolution of support within 70  legislative days prior to the rule taking effect.   This bill even provides for a reach back to consider rules issued  last spring. Under this bill, a single House of Congress could block a  rule. That raises significant constitutional concerns. By allowing a  one-House veto, the bill violates the presentment clause of the  Constitution of the United States.   My amendment ensures essential workplace safety protections are not  jeopardized by this flawed legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment carves out of the REINS  Act's congressional approval procedures any workplace safety rules  issued by OSHA or the Mine Safety and Health Administration to reduce  traumatic injury, cancer, or lung disease.   But please do not be fooled. This amendment is not about reducing  these maladies. It is about transferring the power to decide how best  to do so from elected Representatives, being House Members and  Senators, to unaccountable bureaucrats.   Arriving at the right decision requires a delicate balancing of  interests. Agencies can provide valuable expertise, but when there is a  lot at stake, the ultimate decision on how best to strike that balance  is properly made by elected officials accountable to the people. That  is the intuition behind the REINS Act and the fundamental point that is  lost on its opponents.   Preventing workplace injury is a goal all Members share. This bill  does not frustrate that goal. It merely ensures that elected  Representatives make the final call about major decisions so that our  Republic remains a government by the people as the Constitution's  Framers designed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.

The text of the amendment is as follows:         Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, as proposed to be       amended by section 3 of the bill, is amended by adding at the       end the following (and conforming the table of sections       accordingly):       ``Sec. 808. Review of rules currently in effect         ``(a) Annual Review.--Beginning on the date that is 6       months after the date of enactment of this section and       annually thereafter for the 9 years following, each agency       shall designate not less than 10 percent of eligible rules       made by that agency for review, and shall submit a report       including each such eligible rule in the same manner as a       report under section 801(a)(1). Section 801, section 802, and       section 803 shall apply to each such rule, subject to       subsection (c) of this section. No eligible rule previously       designated may be designated again.        ``(b) Sunset for Eligible Rules Not Extended.--Beginning       after the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment       of this section, if Congress has not enacted a joint       resolution of approval for that eligible rule, that eligible       rule shall not continue in effect.        ``(c) Consolidation; Severability.--In applying sections       801, 802, and 803 to eligible rules under this section, the       following shall apply:        ``(1) The words `take effect' shall be read as `continue in       effect'.  [[Page H145]]         ``(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), a single joint       resolution of approval shall apply to all eligible rules in a       report designated for a year, and the matter after the       resolving clause of that joint resolution is as follows:       `That Congress approves the rules submitted by the __ for the       year __.' (The blank spaces being appropriately filled in).        ``(3) It shall be in order to consider any amendment that       provides for specific conditions on which the approval of a       particular eligible rule included in the joint resolution is       contingent.        ``(4) A member of either House may move that a separate       joint resolution be required for a specified rule.        ``(d) Definition.--In this section, the term `eligible       rule' means a rule that is in effect as of the date of       enactment of this section.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.   Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to say that I have been  a long and strong supporter of the REINS Act. I want to compliment  Congressman Geoff Davis of Kentucky for introducing and crafting that  legislation. While he was doing that, I was drafting a bill that I  named the Sunset Act, and I looked at this from the broad scope of  this, that we have a lot of regulations that exist and have existed for  decades. Some of them are burdensome and some of them are not.   The effect of the REINS Act, which I certainly will support on a  final passage, hopefully with the King amendment adopted in it, but the  REINS Act de facto simply grandfathers in existing regulations. So it  is only prospective. It addresses the major regulations going forward,  but not those that we are stuck with, such as the Waters of the United  States, the Clean Power Plan, the overtime rule, the fiduciary rule,  the net neutrality rule, the Dodd-Frank rules, and, heaven forbid, the  ObamaCare rules if we should fail to repeal ObamaCare.   So what the King amendment does is it directs and allows the agencies  and the executive branch of government to send a minimum of 10 percent  of their regulations to the Congress each year for the duration of a  decade encompassing a full 100 percent of all the regulations in place  at the time of passage and enactment of the underlying legislation.   That gives Congress, then, authority and a vote over all of this. It  gives us an ability to amend that legislation. We can pass them all en  banc, we can amend them accordingly, or we can do what our Founding  Fathers envisioned we should do. That is the essence of this.   By the way, President-elect Trump has made some strong pledges on  dramatically reducing regulation in the United States. He doesn't have  the tools without the King amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  King amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, which  establishes an idiosyncratic process establishing an automatic sunset  of public health and safety protections. It requires that agencies  conduct an annual review of current rules to designate 10 percent of  its existing rules to be eliminated within 10 years of the bill's  enactment unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of approval for  eligible bills.   Now, I understand to the listening public that sounds kind of  complicated, but the bottom line is they want to do away--my friends on  the other side of the aisle--with net neutrality, which is something  that a Federal agency requires. So if you want the Internet, which we  all built and paid for through the Federal Government through our taxes  and then we turned it over to the private sector, but we still have a  public interest in the net being neutral so that all traffic flows  equally over the Web without some being slower than others according to  how much you can afford to pay. That is not fair.   So this King amendment is a part of a regulatory scheme proposed by  this legislation, the REINS Act, which is going to hurt Americans. It  is going to hurt the health, safety, and well-being of the people when  you are not able to have clean water, clean food, edible food, safe  products, clean air, and clean water. These are the things that the  REINS Act gets at. It doesn't want Americans to be healthy. It doesn't  want the Internet to be neutral. Why? Because corporate America and  Wall Street put people in office to do their bidding. That is what the  REINS Act is all about. This King amendment will make it worse.   Under current law, Federal agencies already conduct an extensive  retrospective review process of existing rules and have already saved  taxpayers billions of dollars in cost savings. Since 2011, the Obama  administration has made a durable commitment to ensuring retrospective  review of existing regulatory protections. Under Executive Orders 13563  and 13610, the administration has required that of agencies.   According to Howard Shelanski, the administrator of the Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs under the Obama administration, the  Obama administration's retrospective review initiative has achieved an  estimated $37 billion in cost savings, reduced paperwork, and other  benefits for Americans over the past 5 years.   Furthermore, as the Obama administration has stated in the context of  a veto threat of a similarly draconian antiregulatory proposal in a  previous Congress, ``It is important that retrospective review efforts  not unnecessarily constrain an agency's ability to provide a timely  response to critical public health or safety issues, or constrain its  ability to implement new statutory provisions.'' That is what the King  amendment would do.   In fact, because agencies are already committed to a thorough review  process to identify and eliminate regulatory burdens, it may be  impossible for agencies to make additional cuts without severely  affecting public health and safety.   Lastly, while the majority has repeatedly noted that H.R. 26 is  forward-looking legislation, this amendment would make the bill apply  retroactively to protections and safeguards that exist at the bill's  date of enactment, a bald attempt to gut protections adopted by the  Obama administration, including net neutrality.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.                     Statement of Administration Policy     h.r. 427--regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of                 2015--rep. young, r-in, and 171 cosponsors         The Administration is committed to ensuring that       regulations are smart and effective, and tailored to further       statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient       manner. Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes       House passage of H.R. 427, the Regulations from the Executive       in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015, which would impose an       unprecedented requirement that a joint resolution of approval       be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of an       Executive Branch agency could have force or effect. This       radical departure from the longstanding separation of powers       between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay       and, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory       mandates and execution of duly-enacted laws, create business       uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the       American public, and cause unnecessary confusion.        There is no justification for such an unprecedented       requirement. When a Federal agency promulgates a major rule,       it must already adhere to the particular requirements of the       statute that it is implementing and to the constraints       imposed by other Federal statutes and the Constitution.       Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the       agency issue the particular rule. The agency must also comply       with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative       Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.). When an agency issues a       major rule, it must perform analyses of benefits and costs,       analyses that are typically required by one or more statutes       (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded       Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act) as well       as by Executive Orders 12866 and 13563.        In addition, this Administration has already taken numerous       steps to reduce regulatory costs and to ensure that all major       regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to society.       Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis,       public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across       agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory       retrospective review. In addition, Executive Order 13610       further institutionalizes retrospective review by requiring       agencies to report regularly on the ways in which they are       identifying and reducing the burden of existing regulations.       Finally, agency rules are subject to the jurisdiction of       Federal courts.        Moreover, for the past 19 years, the Congress itself has       had the opportunity, under the Congressional Review Act of       1996, to review on an individual basis the rules--both major       and non-major--that Federal agencies have issued.  [[Page H146]]         By replacing this well-established framework with a blanket       requirement of Congressional approval, H.R. 427 would throw       all major regulations into a months-long limbo, fostering       uncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to       economic growth. Maintaining an appropriate allocation of       responsibility between the two branches is essential to       ensuring that the Nation's regulatory system effectively       protects public health, welfare, safety, and our environment,       while also promoting economic growth, innovation,       competitiveness, and job creation.        If the President were presented with H.R. 427, his senior       advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I would inquire as to how much time  may be remaining for each side.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 3\1/2\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has half a minute remaining.   Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I fully support Congressman  King's amendment. It improves the viability of the REINS Act and makes  sure that the responsibility of legislation is in the hands of we  legislators.   Let me just ask this simple question. My good friend on the other  side says that we should let the agencies and departments regulate and  make rules. Let me ask this: How has it been going in the last 20 years  in this country?   We are $20 trillion in debt, and 20 million people are out of work or  underemployed.   Are we going to continue to let bureaucrats make these decisions that  crush jobs?   No, I don't think so. It is our responsibility in the House and it is  our responsibility in the Senate. We can hear from those individuals,  as I have repeatedly said here, in those agencies. We need to make the  final decision because just look at the track record over the last 20,  30 years of unelected bureaucrats making these rules, laws, and  regulations.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, we can't blame a $20 trillion  deficit or debt on nameless, faceless bureaucrats. We can blame a lot  of that debt on the George Bush administration and the legislators who  voted for tax cuts for the wealthy that were not paid for and funded  two wars that were not paid for. That is what we can blame that $20  trillion debt on.                                time  1715    Again, if you are in favor of net neutrality, you should oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chairman, first, I would say that yes, we can blame a lot of debt  and deficit on a burden of regulations. We can blame it because there  is a huge cost to our executive branch of government. That cost, much  of it, the unnecessary component, all that goes against our debt and  deficit.   We saw, as Barack Obama came in as President, we had a $10 trillion  debt, which he was very critical of throughout his campaign in 2007 and  2008. Now, as he leaves office here, thankfully, in a couple of weeks,  it is a $20 trillion debt, and we can start to ratchet this thing back  down.   Looking at the Obama administration and their reports on the costs of  regulation, they come up with this number reported to the Heritage  Foundation that the annual cost of regulations to the United States,  according to the Obama administration, is $108 billion, Mr. Chairman.  So that is what we are looking at here for costs.   But I want to get at the real meat of this. Article I of the  Constitution says Congress shall make all law. Yet, we have the courts  making laws across the street, and we have regulations coming at us at  a rate of--and I expressed to the gentleman from Georgia--ten-to-one.  For every law we passed in the 114th Congress, there were at least 10  regulations that were poured over our head, and we are sitting in a  place where we don't have the tools to undo them.   Now we have a President that is ready, and he wants to undo these  regulations. If we make him march through the Administrative Procedure  Act, it is heavy, it is burdensome, and it is time-consuming. But the  King amendment gives the tools for the next President of the United  States to work with Congress to trim this regulatory burden down. And  the most important part is, it makes all of us in the House and the  Senate accountable then for all of the regulations.   The APA was allowed to dish off this legislative responsibility to  the executive branch. Congress took a pass. They ducked their  responsibility of being accountable for all legislation and found a way  to be producing less than 10 percent of the legislation that exists  even in a given year.   The King amendment says that over the period of a decade, 10 percent  a year at a minimum, Congress will have to review all the regulations.  The people from across America--we the people--will weigh in on that  regulation. And then an even better part is not only will we be  accountable here in Congress--and we should be--but when the nameless,  faceless bureaucrats are across the desk from our constituents and they  refuse to listen to our constituents, there is going to be a little bug  in the back of their ear that is going to be saying to them: You know  what? This constituent that may be losing their business over this  regulation, the next stop they make is going to be with their  Congressman. These regulations that we promulgated are going to be  subject then to being repealed by the United States Congress, as they  should be.   Support the King amendment. It puts the authority back into the hands  of Article I, we the people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be  postponed.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Byrne) having assumed the chair, Mr. Poe of Texas, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 26) to  amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major  rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a  joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
