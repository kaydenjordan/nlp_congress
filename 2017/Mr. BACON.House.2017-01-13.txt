 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 84 today to do this  one-time exception so that we can have General Mattis as our next  Secretary of Defense.   Today our Nation is confronted with a complex array of transregional  threats. We exist in one of the most dynamic and dangerous periods in  our history, and this list of threats grow more vast and more  dangerous. In the meantime, our military readiness is at dangerous lows  and our modernization falls behind. Amidst these dangers, we are  fortunate to be presented with a historic opportunity to select and  elevate one of the most distinguished military leaders in our Nation's  history to the position of Secretary of Defense.   General Mattis is many things. He is an infantry marine, a decorated  warrior, an experienced combat leader, and a respected commander who  has fought our Nation's wars and knows firsthand the human costs of war  and the consequences of operating unguided by strategy.   James Mattis is also a strategic thinker who understands that true  strength and security results from coordinated application of all  elements of national power: our diplomatic influence, our economic  wealth, our values, and, only when absolutely necessary, our military  force.   Mr. Speaker, not since George Marshall have we had a nominee whose  distinguished military service record and mastery of operational art is  matched by his intellectual prowess and grasp of strategy. One thing  else is clear: not since General George Marshall have we needed this  type of leader as our Secretary of Defense.   We need a Secretary of Defense Mattis on day one of the Trump  administration. A vote ``no'' means we won't have him on day one. It  could be day 3 or day 30.   Our men and women in uniform deserve General Mattis as their  Secretary of Defense on day one. These are extraordinary times, and  General Mattis is an extraordinary leader. We need him on day one. I  urge support for the one-time exception.
