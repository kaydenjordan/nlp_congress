 Mr. Speaker, for a long time Republicans spent so much time  saying they were going to address the economic anxiety families were  feeling, but overnight, they dreamed up a dangerous economic bill that  would plunge families into economic depression.   Republicans say they want to grow the economy, but their bill will  destroy 8,000 jobs in my district alone and 7 million across this  country.   They say they want to invest in children, but this bill eliminates  childcare access for 4,000 kids in my State and 180,000 nationwide.   They talk nonstop about rail safety, yet this bill would cut at least  160 rail inspection days in Minnesota and 7,000 nationwide.   They are not repealing the Bush-Trump tax cuts because what their  bill is going to do is do wealth transfer from working and middle-class  families to billionaires and millionaires.   This is hypocrisy, and it is full of lies. Corporations should not be  put ahead of our families.
