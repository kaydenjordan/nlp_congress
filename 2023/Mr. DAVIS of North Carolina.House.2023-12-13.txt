 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Steve Tripp  for his 30 years of service to the residents of the town of Ayden,  North Carolina, including the past 20 years as mayor.   Mayor Tripp has been instrumental in addressing critical housing  needs and growth while reducing the town's utility rates. He is also  known for his faith.   Mayor Tripp's dedication has set up the town of Ayden for decades and  decades of success, and we are so grateful for him and his many  contributions to eastern North Carolina.   I extend my most profound blessings to him and his wife, Susan.                            ____________________
