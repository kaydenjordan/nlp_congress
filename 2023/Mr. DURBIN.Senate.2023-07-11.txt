 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to  confirm Rosie Hidalgo as Director of the Office on Violence Against  Women, OVW. Ms. Hidalgo is a proven champion for victims of domestic  violence and sexual assault, and her extensive experience, as well as  her longstanding commitment to justice, will make her an outstanding  Director of OVW.   Ms. Hidalgo received her B.A. from Georgetown University and her J.D.  from New York University School of Law. She began her legal career  providing direct representation to survivors of domestic violence, as  well as assisting them in securing custody of their children. She then  joined the nonprofit Esperanza United, where she advocated on behalf of  victims of gender-based crimes and promoted policies designed to  improve public safety. Ms. Hidalgo is particularly equipped to lead  OVW, having worked there as deputy director for policy. In this  capacity, she implemented Violence Against Women Act--VAWA--related  grants and engaged with relevant agencies and stakeholders to devise  new ways to improve the law.   Today, Ms. Hidalgo serves as a Special Assistant to the President and  Senior Advisor on Gender-Based Violence at the White House, where she  played a key role in securing the bipartisan reauthorization of VAWA.   After more than a decade without a Senate-confirmed Director, OVW  will benefit from Hidalgo's expertise, leadership, and unwavering  commitment to aiding survivors of gender-based violence.   I strongly support her nomination and urge my colleagues to do the  same.

A native of Longview, WA, Ms. Evanson received  her bachelor's degree from Seattle University and her law degree from  Georgetown University Law Center. Ms. Evanson began her legal career as  an associate with K&L Gates, where she practiced for 2 years before  joining her current firm, the Seattle-based Pacifica Law Group.   At Pacifica, Ms. Evanson has a varied practice with an overarching  focus on public interest legal work, including on behalf of legal  municipalities and municipal agencies. She has handled cases that touch  on a broad range of issues, from the State constitutional amendment  process and federalism to immigration, trade secrets, and clemency. Her  work also includes two briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court. The  American Bar Association rated Ms. Evanson ``well qualified,'' and she  has the strong support of Senators Murray and Cantwell.   Given her breadth and depth of litigation experience, as well as her  commitment to equal justice and the rule of law, Ms. Evanson will make  an outstanding addition to the Western District of Washington.   I strongly support her nomination and urge my colleagues to join me  in voting for her confirmation.
