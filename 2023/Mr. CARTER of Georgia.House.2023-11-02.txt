 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  retirement of Police Chief Rod Ellis, a man deeply committed to public  safety and national security. He has proudly served Georgia's First  District and his country in vital security roles.   During his 36 years of service, Chief Ellis served with the Glynn  County Police, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Law  Enforcement Division, Homeland Security, and several other law  enforcement entities.   In 2013, Chief Ellis was chosen to travel to Israel to network and  train with Israeli Police and Security Services to identify and stop  terrorists. The knowledge he learned in Israel and security  publications he has contributed to about counterterrorism have  significantly reinforced not just Georgia's security but the United  States as a whole.   I praise Chief Ellis for his service to the First District and to the  American people, and I hope he enjoys this well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
