 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment, which would block the Biden administration's proposed rule  titled: ``Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System  Principles,'' which would help prevent any future administration from  reinstating the so-called schedule F.   The gentleman who is the author of this amendment says all we are  asking for is flexibility. Balderdash. We already know that the Trump  putative Presidency in exile have plans for moving 50,000 Federal  employees initially into this new schedule F not authorized by  Congress.   That is not flexibility. That is gutting civil service protection  that has been in place since the 1880s. Congress created by statute a  politics-free professional cadre of Federal employment to protect  Federal employees and the public from the previous corrupt spoil system  and political interference of President after President, irrespective  of party.   Going back to that system is an enormous step backward and a huge  disservice to Federal employees and to the public they serve and we  serve.                                time  1800    If we are going to do this, then Congress has to be consulted. No  President should have the unilateral authority to create a new profound  schedule for the civil service. If it was created by statute, then a  change to it this profound must also be heard by Congress and acted on  by statute.   Schedule F would be a destructive instrument at the whim of any  President. The gentleman says: Well, Obama could have had it if this  were in place.   So could Trump and so could Biden. That is the problem. No President  should have this kind of breathtaking power. I think the time is ripe  for Congress to stand up for its own prerogatives and protect the  original legislation creating a nonpartisan political service and  protect the Federal employees who serve our public.
