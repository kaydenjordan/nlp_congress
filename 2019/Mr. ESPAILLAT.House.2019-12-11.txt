 Mr. Speaker, New York City is recognized for both its  tenacity and its profile as an incubator of elite talents. Perhaps no  one embodies these Big Apple virtues more than chef Kwame Onwuachi, a  Bronx native.   Chef Kwame's early life was branded by adversity, his early career  marked by missteps. However, as a true New Yorker and as a true son of  the Bronx, he bounced back.   A fusion of Bronx grit and culinary acuity has catapulted this young  man, chef Kwame, from a subway candy salesman to winning a James Beard  Award, perhaps the most prestigious award in the culinary world.   Now, as executive chef of the renowned Kith and Kin restaurant right  here in Washington, D.C., at The Wharf here in our Nation's Capital,  chef Kwame is a shining example of perseverance, prestige, and promise  bred in the Bronx.   Go try his curry goat. Go try his oxtails. You will go back again.   Chef Kwame is an exceptional individual, and he continues to make us  all proud. He is an inspiration to many.    He is right here with us, Mr. Speaker, in the gallery, and I welcome  him to the House of Representatives. He is a Bronx native and now  resides here in Washington, D.C. We are proud to have him. He is a  young talent. You will be hearing a lot about him in the future, not  only in written media, but you will be tasting his fine cuisine in many  places around the world.   I congratulate him for having won the James Beard Award and for being  a true example of how a young man of color from the Bronx can get up  and shine. As the former great champion of the world Muhammad Ali said,  he shook up the world.   Congratulations, chef Kwame.
