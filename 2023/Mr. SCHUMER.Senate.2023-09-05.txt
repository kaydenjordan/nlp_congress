 Mr. President, welcome back to you and our great staff,  and it is good to be back.   Leader McConnell will speak after me here on the floor, and I am glad  to see him back and doing well.   Mr. President, let me begin by welcoming back all of our Senators  from the August work period. August was a busy month for all of us back  home, a time to listen to constituents about what is on their minds,  like lowering costs and increasing paychecks.   It was also a time for ribbon cuttings and groundbreakings as the  historic investments that Democrats made come to fruition; and, of  course, it was a time to prepare for the very busy month in front of  us.   On the implementation side, August was a month of action, of  groundbreakings, celebrating new factories and new good-paying jobs  that will stick around for a long, long time. When a parent sees his or  her son or daughter get these jobs, they know they are going to be  around for a long time; they are not going to be gone in 2 or 3 years.  It is a great thing for optimism and the future of America.   And it was even nice to see Speaker McCarthy in my home State of New  York, celebrating the new jobs secured by Democrats, when he visited  JMA Wireless last month. I have been there many times too. In fact, it  was from my own visits there and to other companies across New York  that I saw firsthand the opportunity to invest in companies like JMA by  buy-in-America provisions that we added to the legislation, and it  helped us shape the Inflation Reduction Act.   As the Speaker saw with his own eyes, Democrats' investments are  already bearing fruit. In just one year alone, the Inflation Reduction  Act alone has resulted in over 200 new clean energy jobs and created  170,000 new good-paying jobs, and it is projected to create another 1.5  million jobs over the next decade. Pick any region of the country, and  you will have no trouble seeing Democrats' agenda in action.   One of the amazing visits I went to was in Allegany County in Upstate  New York. It is in Appalachia. By income levels, it is one of the  poorest counties  [[Page S3870]]  in our State. And there, the Inflation Reduction Act is blowing new  life into Ljungstrom. This is a company that used to make coal  technology equipment and has transitioned to making parts for wind  turbines and is hiring 150 new workers, all in a place where people  thought they didn't have much of a history, because they knew the coal  industry was declining.   It has happened all over America. In Georgia, Hyundai and LG  announced they are increasing their multibillion dollar investment  towards a major EV and battery manufacturing plant, one that will be  the State's largest project ever, creating thousands of good-paying  jobs in years to come. And in New Mexico, Arcosa broke ground on a new  wind tower production facility expected to create 250 new jobs. These  jobs will help fill the over $1 billion worth of wind tower orders they  have received since President Biden signed the IRA into law. These  investments, and many others, are supporting the whole of America, red  and blue States, rural and urban, everyone, everywhere. And you can be  sure the best is yet to come.   Last month, we saw other examples of implementation, too. Over the  past few weeks, President Biden made groundbreaking announcements on  lowering the cost of prescription drugs, on prevailing wage, and more.  Many of these are a direct result of the work that we have done in the  Congress.   So Democrats are very proud of the agenda now taking hold across  America, and we intend to keep going.   Now the Senate gavels back into session with a lot to do, but there  is one clear place to begin: Keep the government open. As we all know,  government funding is set to expire on September 30. By the end of this  month, the House and Senate--Democrats and Republicans--all must get on  the same page about keeping the government open and avoiding a  pointless shutdown--a shutdown that will hurt just about every single  American; a shutdown that, of course, shouldn't happen.   To accomplish that, the answer is very simple: All sides must work  together in good faith, without engaging in extremism or all-or-nothing  tactics.   Look no further than the example we have set here in a bipartisan way  in the Senate: Democrats working with Republicans on a bipartisan  basis; chairs, Democratic chairs, engaging fruitfully with Republican  vice chairs and ranking members. All 12 appropriations bills have been  reported out of committee with bipartisan support, some of them  unanimously--unanimously. Both sides avoided dragging the process down  with unseemly tactics. It sets a very good template for how things  should work in Congress.    I want to thank all my colleagues, but especially Appropriations  Chair Patty Murray and Vice Chair Susan Collins, for their tremendous  work thus far on the appropriations process. They truly deserve a lot  of credit.   When the House returns next week, I hope House Republicans--I implore  House Republicans to recognize that time is short to keep the  government open and that the only way--the only way--we will finish the  appropriations process is through bipartisanship, the idea of both  parties working together, not one party, particularly if it is a party  governed by an extreme 30 or 40 Members filling out a wish list that  they know can't pass. They can't do that.   So let me repeat. Let me say it again. The only way to avoid a  shutdown is through bipartisanship. So I urge--I plead--with House  Republican leadership to follow the Senate's lead and pass bipartisan  Democrat and Republican appropriations bills supported by both parties.   As we work to fund the government, there are plenty of other things  we must do, too, both on and off the floor. We will, for one, continue  laying a foundation for bipartisan congressional action on AI. Next  Wednesday, along with Senators Rounds, Heinrich, and Young, I will host  the Senate's inaugural AI Insight Forum, a first-ever convening of the  top minds in AI here in the Congress. Voices from business and the  civil rights community, researchers, worker advocates, and many more,  all in one room having an open discussion about how Congress can act on  AI: where to start, what questions to ask, and how to build a  foundation for safe AI innovation.   These AI forums are vital. Artificial intelligence is unlike any  topic we have undertaken in Congress. It moves faster; it is more  complex; and there is little precedent for this kind of work.   This is not going to be easy. In fact, it will be one of the most  difficult things we undertake, but in the 21st century, as technology  moves forward with or without us, we can't behave like ostriches with  heads in the sand when it comes to AI. We must treat AI with the same  level of seriousness as national security, job creation, and our civil  liberties.   Now, ultimately, of course, the real legislative work will come in  committees, but the AI forums will give us the nutrient agar, the facts  and the challenges, that we need to understand in order to reach this  goal.   Of course, next week's forum is just the start. The Senate will  continue hosting AI forums throughout the fall on a variety of topics,  including finding ways to promote AI innovation, IP issues, workforce  issues, privacy, security, alignment, and many more.   We will also move the ball forward on other items on our agenda  wherever we can, but of course they will need Republican help to reach  the necessary 60 votes to move forward, like lowering the cost of  insulin and prescription drugs, something Members on both sides of the  aisle are hard at work on. We did it in the IRA for insulin for  Medicare for people over 65. We should do it for everybody else.  Insulin is too vital and becoming too expensive for too many Americans.  And making progress on cannabis through the SAFE Banking Act, as well  as commonsense rail safety, which I said in July would be a big  priority.   We also must build on the work we did during the NDAA to outcompete  the Chinese Government, to keep the American people safe, to protect  American businesses, and ensure that American innovation and technology  leads the way this century.   We also must continue standing with our friends in Ukraine, now more  than ever, as the counteroffensive against Putin's forces is in full  swing.   And we must stand with our fellow Americans in places like Hawaii,  Florida, Vermont, and other regions battered by storms and fires and  flooding.   The topics continue: from advancing a farm bill to kids' online  privacy, to reauthorizing the FAA, and to holding bank executives  accountable for irresponsible behavior.   Our committees have done excellent work to move all of these issues  along, but we are under no illusion that we can make progress on the  Senate floor unless we get bipartisan cooperation. None of this will be  easy either. The bills will require a lot of work and compromise, but  if we can progress on these items, we will greatly improve the lives of  average Americans.   Finding bipartisan compromise on issues like these is never easy, but  that is what it will take to get things done, and our efforts to do  precisely that have already led to significant accomplishments under  this majority. As we gavel back in, we will keep going to reward the  trust the American people have placed in us.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  legislative session and be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 327.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.

For the information of the Senate, there will be two  votes at 11:30 a.m., two votes at 2:15 p.m., and two votes at 5:15 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:50 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, September 6, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
