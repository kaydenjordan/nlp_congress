 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         In paragraph (2) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended to read by section 3 of the       bill, insert after ``means any rule'' the following: ``(other       than a special rule)''.        In paragraph (3) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended to read by section 3 of the       bill, insert before the period at the end the following: ``,       and includes any special rule''.        Add, at the end of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended to read by section 3 of the       bill, the following:        ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule pertaining to       nuclear reactor safety standards.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from the bill any  regulations that pertain to nuclear reactor safety. In other words, my  amendment would allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the NRC to  continue to issue rules under the current system, thereby making it  easier to protect Americans from potential nuclear disaster.   The underlying legislation, the REINS Act, would grind the gears of  rulemaking to a halt by requiring all major rules to be affirmatively  approved in advance by Congress. A regulation would be blocked from  being implemented if even one Chamber declines to pass an approval  resolution. The goal of this legislation, quite simply, is to stop the  regulatory process in its tracks, regardless of the impact on public  health and safety.   One example that highlights the risks and dangers of this legislation  is  [[Page H142]]  the subject of this amendment: Nuclear power.   The world watched in horror when an earthquake and resulting tsunami  devastated the area around Fukushima, Japan, a few years ago. That  disaster then caused its own disaster--the meltdown of three reactors  at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The meltdown led to the release  of radioactive isotopes, the creation of a 20-kilometer exclusion zone  around the power plant, and the displacement, consequently, of 156,000  people. Just last month, seaborne radiation from Fukushima was even  detected on the West Coast of the United States.   The same year as the Fukushima meltdown, Virginia was struck by a  relatively rare but strong earthquake, felt up and down the eastern  seaboard. While the region was spared a similar disaster, the  earthquake required a nuclear power plant near the epicenter to go  offline as a precaution and served as a wake-up call that our nuclear  reactors needed additional safety protocols.   For me, this concern hits close to home. A nuclear power plant,  Indian Point, which has suffered numerous malfunctions in recent years,  lies just less than 40 miles away from my New York City district, about  30 miles away from the city. Twenty million people live within a 50- mile radius around the plant, the same radius used by the NRC as the  basis for the evacuation zone recommended after the Fukushima disaster.                                time  1645    Indian Point also sits near two earthquake fault lines and, according  to the NRC, is the most likely nuclear power plant in the country to  experience core damage because of an earthquake.   Because of the catastrophes that can result from disasters, be they  natural or manmade at nuclear power plants, prevention of meltdowns is  absolutely vital. Since Fukushima, the NRC has issued new rules  designed to upgrade power plants to withstand severe events like  earthquakes, and to have enough backup power so as to avoid a meltdown  for a significant length of time.   The NRC must retain the ability to issue new regulations to safeguard  the health and well-being of all Americans. However, this bill is  intentionally designed so that new and important regulations, including  those to prevent a nuclear power plant meltdown which could affect  millions of American, will likely never be put in place, thwarted by  either chamber of Congress.   Congress delegates authority to executive agencies because we do not  have the expertise or time to craft all technical regulations  ourselves. We should defer to the engineers and scientists at the NRC  who determine, after careful study, that a particular regulation is  critical to our safety and to the safe operation of a nuclear power  plant. This bill, however, would all too easily allow Members of  Congress to substitute their own judgment or, most likely, the wishes  of a narrow group of special interests.   This week we began a new Congress. Later this month we will have a  new administration, all controlled by Republicans. Between this bill  and the Midnight Rules bill we passed yesterday, they have chosen to  make their first order of business the dismantling and destruction of  the regulatory process, regardless of the impact on public health and  safety. This gives us a good idea of the priorities we should expect to  see in the next 2 years.   The least we can do is to try to ensure that the antiregulatory  agenda of the Republicans does not have devastating consequences such  as a nuclear meltdown. I urge my colleagues to support the Nadler  amendment to exempt nuclear safety regulations from the onerous  requirements of the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, nuclear meltdowns are a tremendous danger  to the life and safety of millions of Americans. The Congressional  Review Act provides if the NRC makes such a regulation, Congress can  say no. That is appropriate. But to say Congress has to approve any  regulation in advance, when there may be thousands of regulations or  hundreds of regulations from different agencies, they may not get to  it. We may not have time to study it, and lives are at stake. It does  not make sense. That is why this amendment at least cuts out nuclear  meltdown regulations, nuclear safety regulations, to say Congress can  veto them if they don't agree. But the agency should be able to  promulgate it in the absence of congressional veto.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. McNerney    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10  printed in House Report 115-1.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 10 as the  designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         In paragraph (2) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert after ``means any rule'' the following: ``(other than       a special rule)''.        In paragraph (3) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert before the period at the end the following: ``, and       includes any special rule''.        Add, at the end of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill, the       following:        ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule intended to       ensure the safety of natural gas or hazardous materials       pipelines or prevent, mitigate, or reduce the impact of       spills from such pipeline.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman  [[Page H143]]  from California (Mr. McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, recent pipeline incidents have raised  serious concerns about the condition of the Nation's pipelines that  threaten the safety and health of American citizens. This amendment  will ensure that any rule intended to guarantee the safety of natural  gas or hazardous material pipelines is not considered a major rule  under this bill and would, therefore, be easier to create.   Pipeline safety is a bipartisan issue. Congress has shown that  issuing regulations related to pipelines is a priority, as evident with  the enactment of the PIPES Act last year.   However, the bill before us today, H.R. 26, contradicts this historic  precedent and would have the effect of delaying or preventing any rule  on pipeline safety from going forward. Pipeline accidents cause major  property damage, serious injuries or deaths, and harms the environment.   There are approximately 2.9 million miles of pipeline in the United  States. They travel through rural and urban areas, Republican and  Democratic districts, coastlines, inland areas. Everyone is impacted.  Quality control measures, new infrastructure, and oversight are  paramount.   Unfortunately, we have seen the devastating impact of pipeline  incidents throughout the country, including several accidents and  spills in California in recent years, such as the spill in Santa  Barbara that released more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil.   We have also seen how liquid spills can devastate the people and  economies in places like Michigan, and the irreplaceable natural  resources like the Yellowstone River in Montana, or the precious  coastline of Santa Barbara. Additionally, these explosions and spills  cause shortages and price increases that impact Americans far from the  site of the accident.   A Colonial Pipeline accident this past September in Alabama leaked  roughly 8,000 barrels of gasoline and saw prices increase by up to 31  cents a gallon in metropolitan areas in the Southeastern States.   I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we  want effective and efficient government. But, in reality, pipeline  safety regulations are already subject to duplicative and time- consuming analyses, including a rigorous risk assessment and cost- benefit analysis required by the pipeline safety statute. These already  duplicative review requirements are among the top reasons why the  Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration increasingly  lags behind the congressional mandate to issue rules that protect  Americans from dangerous pipeline incidents.   In fact, this was the subject of a great deal of discussion when the  Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the pipeline safety  reauthorization bill last year. I worked with Chairman Upton and  Ranking Member Pallone to address this issue, as both sides of the  aisle agreed that the duplicative reviews currently required are  already slowing down these critical safety laws to a degree that is  frustrating and dangerous.   While we make progress in the PIPES Act, I believe we can and should  do more. The last thing we need is one more layer of bureaucracy to  further slow down implementation of these critical protections for  public health, safety, and the environment. We should work together to  prevent spills and work to minimize impacts when spills or other  incidents do occur. This includes automatic shut-off valves, leak  detection, and technologies to reduce clogging and rupture.   A vote for this amendment is a vote for the safety of the public and  the environment. It is a vote to protect the land and water that are  threatened by oil spills. It is a vote for industry that wants  certainty and clarity and doesn't want to--or benefit from--wait years  for rules to be finalized. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
