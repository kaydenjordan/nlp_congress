 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  concern with H.R. 1918, the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act of  2017.   Today, I stand with the people of Nicaragua and the people of south  Texas. Nicaragua has been our partner to the south. They work with us  to combat drug trafficking, limit irregular migration, and make our  region and our world a safer place. Nicaragua today is the safest  country in Central America.                                time  1500    I agree, we must be vigilant in monitoring Nicaragua's transition to  democracy. However, we must recognize that enacting this bill could  have serious consequences on the region.   NICA could strain our alliance with Nicaragua, and it could lead to  instability, irregular immigration to the United States, to my border  district, and an increase in criminal activity. My district was ground  zero for the last immigration surge, and I would like to prevent that  from happening again.   Nicaragua has its economic and political challenges, but it has taken  steps to address poverty, climate change, and to grow its economy. How  can we, in good conscience, support a measure that would punish the  poorest country in Central America and the second poorest in the  Western Hemisphere?   Moreover, Nicaragua stands with America and our allies against the  rogue nation of North Korea. We cannot compare Nicaragua to Venezuela.   While we must hold countries accountable, we should bring them in  rather than shut them out. We have the ability to guide these nations  to embrace democracy and condemn bad actors.   Lastly, I want to make clear that this is not an endorsement of the  Sandinistas or any other regime. Today I speak for the less fortunate  in Nicaragua who suffer the most from NICA.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to find a  solution to this complex issue.
