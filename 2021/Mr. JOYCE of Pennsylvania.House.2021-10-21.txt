 Madam Speaker, in my home State of  Pennsylvania, a woman was brutally raped by an illegal immigrant.   In Congress, one of our primary duties is to protect the American  people. By allowing illegal immigrants who have committed crimes to  remain within our borders signifies that we are failing. Allowing an  illegal immigrant who has committed acts of sexual violence to remain  in our country shows that we are failing.   Congress must move immediately to pass legislation ensuring that any  immigrant who commits acts of violence is deported. What happened in  Philadelphia this week was a failure of American leadership. It showed  clearly that the Biden crime crisis is escalating.   Now, as apprehensions at our southern border hit record highs,  President Biden is taking away the vital resources that our Border  Patrol agents need to do their job. The answer to stopping our border  crisis and our crime crisis is not to defund the police. The answer is  not to be more lenient on illegal immigrants who have committed violent  crimes against Americans.   We must put the safety of the American citizens first, and we must  put the security of the American citizens first.  [[Page H5735]]                                ____________________
