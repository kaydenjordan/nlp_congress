 Mr. President, we are ensuring with this amendment  that there will be resources for survivors of domestic violence, sexual  assault, and child abuse. Senator Shaheen has pointed out that our  shelters are very, very much in need of our support.    We urge you all to protect the most vulnerable in their time of need.  We ask for your support on this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 834     Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 806 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this one is pretty simple and,  hopefully, it can be pretty agreeable and we move quickly.   What I am aiming to do today is to prevent the executive branch from  taking actions that increase our country's reliance on foreign sources  of oil and gas or hard rock minerals. We are going to keep using oil  and gas for a while here. I think we recognize that.   The EIA, Energy Information Administration, forecasts consumption of  oil and gas will rise by 5.6 million barrels per day this year and  continue rising in the future. So what we are doing--what we are at  risk of doing is to limit resource development in this country, put  good-paying jobs at risk, including in my State, making States more  dependent on fossil and mineral resources from overseas, oftentimes  from our foreign adversaries.   We have great resources in this country, folks--from natural gas that  powers our homes; minerals like graphite and lithium, which we need in  our renewable technologies, and we produce them here in this country in  a more environmentally responsible manner--   --and with higher labor standards than elsewhere in the  world.   I would urge my colleagues to accept, and I would ask for a voice  vote.
