 Madam Speaker, this is the day the Founding Fathers  feared when they granted Congress the power of impeachment, where we  have a political party so dead set against the President that they will  do anything to impeach him. And they are about to get away with it,  simply because they have the votes. But that is not how this process is  supposed to work.   It is not meant to be dictated by a thin partisan majority, nor is it  meant to be used when an election is just around the corner.   No one understands that better than our Speaker, for whom I have  great respect. And I agree with the comments she made on March 6 of  just this year: ``Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless  there is something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I  don't think we should go down that path because it divides'' the  Nation.   That is exactly what has happened.   When we walk out of here tonight, we all know how this result is  going to go. The Democrats are voting for this. Not one Republican is  breaking. This is not bipartisan.   The American people are disgusted with the United States House of  Representatives, and we bring shame upon this body today by moving  forward with this impeachment.
