 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of S. 920, the  National Clinical Care Commission Act, sponsored by Senator Shaheen.   This legislation has been around for a while. It has been championed  in the House by our good friend and fellow Texan, Representative Pete  Olson, as H.R. 309. This bill has strong bipartisan support. It passed  this House unanimously earlier this year.   Diabetes and other endocrine disorders have been a great cost burden  on Medicare and, in fact, our Nation's healthcare system in general.  Thirty million Americans have diabetes, 84 million Americans have  prediabetes, and three out of four Americans on Medicare have diabetes  or prediabetes. And $1 out of every $3 Medicare spends is spent on  diabetes.   This bill will establish a clinical care commission to evaluate and  recommend solutions for better coordination and use of Federal programs  aimed at improving care for people with diabetes and other related  endocrine disorders. This commission will be tasked with identifying  gaps where new approaches are needed, eliminating duplication across  Federal agencies, and leveraging the Federal resources and tools  available to enhance the quality of patient care.   I am confident their work will improve the lives of tens of millions  of Americans living with diabetes and with other endocrine disorders  while beginning the process of reducing the staggering impact of these  diseases.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to thank and commend our colleague,  Representative Pete Olson, for spearheading this important initiative.  I want to thank him for bringing it to the floor of the House as many  times as he has. This has been a lengthy process, but today, with the  passage of this bill, we are voting on final passage, and this bill  will be sent to the President's desk for signature. Mr. Speaker, Mr.  Olson's long and arduous journey now will be completed with the passage  of this bill, and we should all look forward to that.
