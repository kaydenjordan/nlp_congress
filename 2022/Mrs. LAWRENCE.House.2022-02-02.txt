 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  America COMPETES Act.   I am proud to represent the Big Three automakers State and a district  where GM is headquartered. I know how important it is to fix our supply  chain. Semiconductors power our economy--everything from smart phones  to computers to cars. We have to start making them here in America.   This legislation will make sure of that while increasing American  innovation, manufacturing, and R&D. And I am proud to offer two  amendments to ensure that our efforts in the America COMPETES Act is  centered around equality so that all Americans will benefit from the  significant R&D investment of our critical goods while creating good  jobs.   Let's get this done so we can ensure that our economy is secure and  strengthen our global competitiveness.
