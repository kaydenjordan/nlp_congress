 Mr. Speaker, when I learned of the death of my very  close friend, Dr. James Billington, the 13th Librarian of Congress, it  hit me pretty hard. That was about 3 weeks ago. Dr. Billington's  passion for the institution that he led for 28 years, his scholarly  nature, and his gentlemanly demeanor were a tremendous inspiration to  me and to so many Members of this body. I so admired him.   First, I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to Marjorie and the  entire family. May God grant him peace.   During his 28 years at the Library of Congress, from 1987 to 2015,  Dr. James Billington led the institution in a remarkable period of  accomplishment. He once referred to the Library of Congress--I like to  call it America's Library--as the largest, most wide-ranging collection  of world-recorded knowledge ever assembled on our planet. He strove  mightily to preserve the Nation's cultural patrimony and open the  Library's collections to the American people and to people around the  world.   Dr. Billington doubled the size of the Library's holdings to more  than 160 million items, including books, manuscripts, newspapers, maps,  music and film recordings, and prints and photographs.   Simultaneously, he also created a massive online library, digitizing  materials so that the historic and cultural resources of the Library-- being historic and cultural resources of the world, I might add--which  were once only available to persons visiting the Library now would be  instantaneously accessible to anyone anywhere in the world.   Mr. Speaker, Dr. Billington also looked to the future, but he never  lost sight of our connectedness and the treasures of the past. During  his tenure, he acquired the only copy of the 1507 Waldseemuller world  map, which is known as America's birth certificate. He reconstructed  Thomas Jefferson's original library for permanent display, and he  obtained the papers of hundreds of great Americans ranging from jurist  Thurgood Marshall to the songwriter Irving Berlin.   Mr. Speaker, I can't emphasize enough that he was a remarkable man--a  Russian scholar with a brilliant mind. He accompanied 10 congressional  delegations to Russia and the former Soviet Union. In 1988, he was  invited to join President Reagan in traveling to the Soviet Summit in  Moscow.   Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the House Appropriations Committee's  Legislative Branch Subcommittee, and now I am its chairman. I got to  know Dr. Billington from his regular appearances before the  Appropriations Committee to talk about the budget.   I often enjoyed the many events he held at the Library, the  dialogues, the displays, and the exhibits he organized to engage  Members of Congress in their Library.   Dr. Billington went out of his way to accommodate our needs. He once  graciously hosted a small British delegation on my behalf that included  a member of the royal family and a member of the House of Lords, both  with an interest in Charles Carroll, one of the original signers of the  Declaration of Independence. Despite the government shutdown at that  moment a little while back, which forced us to move the forum into this  building, the Capitol, Dr. Billington ensured that the Library's prized  displays were in place and were on time, and that he was present to  deliver welcoming remarks.   With his retirement, leaving the great institution he served  faithfully for nearly three decades, Dr. Billington left an indelible  imprint, having created programs and services that continue to benefit  Congress and the American public.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, before he retired, in a conversation with his  wife, Marjorie--and I knew his retirement was imminent--I told him: Dr.  Billington, now it is time to write two books, the book that you want  to write that is in your mind, and the book for the rest of us to read  to make accessible your life story and your brilliant insights.   Long live his memory.   Again, Mr. Speaker, let me say, may God comfort Dr. Billington's  wife, Marjorie, their four children, and their 12 grandchildren in  their moment of grief.   I extend to them, as well as the entire Library of Congress  community, my heartfelt condolences.   Jim Billington, well done, my friend. Well done, good and faithful  public servant.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 12 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, December 13, 2018, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
