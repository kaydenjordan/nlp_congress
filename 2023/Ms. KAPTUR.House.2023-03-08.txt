 Mr. Speaker, I rise to say hurray and recognize a  northwestern Ohio institution, Hirzel Canning Company and Farms, on its  100th anniversary.   Headquartered in Northwood, Ohio, the Hirzel family rose from humble  beginnings to become a major player in the national canned produce  market, particularly canned tomato products. They are the best you will  ever eat.   Carl Hirzel was a Swiss immigrant who lost his job as a brewer during  Prohibition and moved to northwest Ohio to find opportunity. In 1923,  he began farming a 60-acre plot in what is now Northwood.   He initially had trouble selling fresh products in the established  produce market, until a local butcher who liked his sauerkraut told him  there was an untapped canned vegetable market.   As their CEO, Joe Hirzel, always says, ``Whatever you guys do, do not  forget quality.'' That is the Hirzel way.   So today with plants in Northwood, Pemberville, and Ottawa, and a  farming operation near Luckey, Hirzel now distributes in 36 States  nationwide. Their company is top quality, grown right in northern Ohio,  and especially top quality are the people who operate and work there.   I just want to congratulate Hirzel again. Our entire region is so  very, very proud of them and all of their accomplishments.                            ____________________
