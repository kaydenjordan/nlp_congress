 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  valued member of my team, Charles Bolden, who recently departed my  office for a new challenge.   Charles began working in my office in 2016 and has proven himself  time and again to be a vital and integral part of the team. He started  out as a staff assistant in the office enthusiastically greeting guests  and savoring every conversation with constituents. His dedication to  serving the people of Illinois' Second Congressional District, which is  also his home, stood out.   Charles handled the gun violence portfolio for the office, which is  personal to him as he personally lost close friends to gun violence.  This is an issue that is so important to both Charles and me, and I am  grateful for his many years of service working to save lives and bring  gun violence prevention resources to the people of Chicagoland.   While I am so sad to see Charles Mackie Bolden, aka Charlie, to me,  move on, I am very grateful for his years of service, and I wish him  the best in his next endeavor.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc No.  2, which includes three amendments I worked on.   Amendment No. 217 establishes a pilot transition assistance program  for military spouses, offering similar services to those available for  members of our Armed Forces.   This includes mental health first aid training since military spouses  are well positioned to notice warning signs for any mental health or  subsequent abuse struggles a new veteran might experience.   Amendment No. 218 will improve interagency communication as the low  Earth orbit becomes more crowded with defense, civil, and commercial  space assets.   Finally, amendment No. 158 with Representative Gonzales will create a  National Digital Reserve Corps to bring private sector talent into the  Federal Government to work on short-term projects. We need more  cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and developer expertise in the  Federal Government if we are going to meet the challenges of the 21st  century.   I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc.  [[Page H4988]]
