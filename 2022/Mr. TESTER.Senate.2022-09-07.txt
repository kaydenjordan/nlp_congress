 Madam President, I would like to share a few words today  to honor the life and service of Private John Shaughnessy, a first- class Montanan and World War I veteran.   A native son of the Treasure State, John was born and raised in  Missoula. His father, John A. Shaughnessy, was one of Missoula's  pioneer builders who constructed a portion of the original buildings at  Fort Missoula.   Never one to shy away from service or sacrifice, John answered the  call to duty at the outbreak of World War I by enlisting in the U.S.  Army. He was a member of the 339th Infantry and served in the American  North Russia Expeditionary force, more commonly known as the Polar Bear  Expedition.   During that expedition, Private Shaughnessy sadly contracted and died  [[Page S4471]]  of pneumonia in Archangel, Russia, on September 15, 1918. He was buried  in the American cemetery in the town until his body was able to be  removed and returned to Missoula in 1929.   While Private Shaughnessy was finally laid to rest in his native  land, he never received the proper military headstone he deserved and  earned.   It is my honor to say today, 104 years after his passing, Private  Shaughnessy will at last receive his long-overdue military headstone in  Missoula.   While our debt of gratitude to him can never be fully repaid, this  military honor rightly ensures his sacrifices in service to our Nation  will never be forgotten.   He is an American hero who has made Montana proud, and our country  would not be what it is today without him and others in uniform who put  their life on the line in return for our freedoms.   On behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I extend our deepest  appreciation to him and his family.                            ____________________
