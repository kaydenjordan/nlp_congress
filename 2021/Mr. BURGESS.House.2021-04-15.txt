 Madam Speaker, I am happy to join my fellow Republicans  tonight to talk about the state of energy and the very dangerous Biden  ban on energy production in this country.   This country needs a reliable, affordable supply of energy, but the  Biden executive orders reduce access to energy sources.   America has only very recently achieved energy independence through  innovation, lower regulations, and a free market, but these executive  orders go the other way and will make us dependent on foreign energy  producers.   Make no mistake about it, the energy will still be produced, maybe  just not in the United States. But year over year, since 2005,  America's carbon emissions have declined, in spite of increased  production.   I draw attention to the data shared with the Congress by the Texas  Oil and Gas Association: Reduction of flaring in the Permian Basin has  really brought carbon emissions down.   We can't strangle ourselves. We need to have American energy. We need  American energy independence.                            ____________________
