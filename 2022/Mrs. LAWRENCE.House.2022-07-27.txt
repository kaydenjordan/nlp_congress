 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Susan  Muffley Act. This bill would restore pension benefits to over 20,000  Delphi salaried retirees, including over 5,000 Michiganders.    When GM filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession, these  families lost up to 70 percent of their earned benefits. They need and  deserve the attention and action of this body.   This bill is named after Susan Muffley, whose husband worked at  Delphi for 31 years and could not seek medical treatment when their  family lost the pension.   Mrs. Muffley spent years fighting to have all these pensions  restored.   Let me be absolutely clear: Michiganders and all Americans who have  worked hard their entire lives to support their families deserve the  right to retire with dignity and financial security. This is simply the  right thing to do.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Kildee, for  introducing this bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.'' In America we are better than this, and we need to pass this  bill.
