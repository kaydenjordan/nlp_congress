 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  thank her and the ranking member for their leadership in bringing this  legislation to the floor. It is legislation that makes an immediate and  substantial difference to what is happening in Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, 10 days ago, it was my solemn and extraordinary  privilege to lead a congressional delegation to Kyiv, where we met with  President Zelenskyy. In the heart of his war-torn nation, our  delegation expressed our deep admiration for the courage of the  Ukrainian people as they fought for their democracy against autocracy  and our endless respect for his great, heroic leadership.   In return, really just from the start, President Zelenskyy expressed  his gratitude to the American people, which I conveyed to this Congress  and, therefore, to the American people for the extraordinary support  that we have so far supplied--and now, tonight, more to come.   He praised our President for being such a source of hope as well as  support to the people of Ukraine--not only for our support but for the  unifying force he has been in this fight.   Mr. Speaker, as Putin desperately accelerates his campaign of horror  and brutality in Ukraine, time is of the essence. That is why we are so  pleased to hear that we could proceed immediately with this bill today  so that it goes to the Senate and to the President's desk so that the  assistance can reach the people of Ukraine and Eastern Europe. We  cannot afford to wait. Again, time is of the essence.   The aid package we will pass today will be pivotal, and others have  addressed what is in there in terms of weaponry and security issues, in  terms of government and their economy, in terms of humanitarian  assistance.   I was very pleased for the delegation to be joined by Chairman  Jim  McGovern, chair of the Rules Committee, but the chair always of the  food security initiatives in the Congress. He made very clear the link  between what Putin is doing in Ukraine and the impact it will have on  the rest of the world in terms of starvation because Ukraine has been  the breadbasket of Europe and the world. All of the product--whether it  is sunflower oil, whether it is wheat, corn, whatever--going to Africa  and other places in the world is essential to their food security.   The brutality of Putin is not just what he is doing in Ukraine but  the impact that it is having on food for the world. So when you are  home thinking of what this is all about, just think: ``When I was  hungry, you fed me,'' the Gospel of Matthew.   I also was so pleased that Mr. Meeks, the chairman of the Committee  on Foreign Affairs, was with us because we talked about sanctions,  which are a product of his committee. I mention that because he knows  his subject very well, as did President Zelenskyy. But the fact is,  what we want to see is an end to war. If we could end war by using  economic sanctions, all the better, all the better to spare human life  on both sides of it.   But President Putin has initiated hostilities into a sovereign  country with a band leading it, thinking that he was going to be well- received with a band. What could he have been thinking?   Again, Mr. Meeks, in terms of negotiations, in terms of sanctions and  the rest, led our visit very well.   Mr. Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, had a very clear  conversation with President Zelenskyy, the speaker of their parliament,  and the Foreign Minister about how respectful of what the Ukrainians  are doing with their own security--and not to be misled into thinking  that anything but their own security has led to some of the successes  they have had.   Barbara Lee, who we just heard from, the chair of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee, just so remarkable in  our visit to Poland to talk about how we have not only economic  assistance or humanitarian assistance but accountability, as well as  help for children who are suffering so much there.   Mr. Keating, a member of both the Committee on Foreign Affairs and  the Committee on Armed Services, was very much into the accountability  piece. He is chair of the committee that is Europe, Eurasia,  environment, global issues across borders and understood the need for  us to have public support and accountability for what we give.   Jason Crow, a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed  Services Committee, spoke with great authority about weapons systems  and the rest with President Zelenskyy and his team, about what they  need, what we can convey back, and what judgments are made in that  regard.   What is interesting about Mr. Crow is that he was a member at another  time, earlier in his life--which wasn't that long ago--he was a member  of the 82nd Airborne. When we met with the 82nd Airborne in Poland,  they were happy to welcome one of their former members. They spoke the  same language, some hoots and hollers of some kind. I don't know. But  nonetheless, his participation there was beneficial, especially when it  came to comparing notes on weapons systems.   What I think is important for the American people to know is that  what Putin has done is not only an act of brutality; it is an act of  cowardice.   Who but a coward would pretend he is going to war and bomb a  maternity hospital?   Who but a coward would have his soldiers resort to the cruelty of  rape of children or their parents in front of them--boys and girls?   Who but a coward would pile these children in trains and take them to  Russia?   All of this will be a matter of coming to justice at some point, but  right now, we have to have it come to a conclusion that you don't do  that. It is outside the circle of civilized human behavior.   Putin: Coward.   In any event, what we are doing here is very important. It is buying  weaponry and security assistance, government and economic assistance,  humanitarian assistance.   I thank Congresswoman Lee and Mr. McGovern for their focus on all of  that, for the refugees, for the displaced within Ukraine, and for those  who are trapped under fire without food or fresh water or anything  because their civilian communities are being attacked by the coward  Putin.   So, we are very proud of this effort today. We should all be very  proud that we had the opportunity, when Putin decided whatever it is he  decided, to be brutal and cruel and a coward, that we were there to  help.   It is about democracy versus dictatorship. Democracy must prevail.  Ukrainian people are fighting the fight for their democracy and, in  doing so, for ours as well. We must help them win so that we can have  bread for the world and feed the hungry, so we can stop the horrible  behavior that they are doing in treating women and trafficking women  and girls. This is unbelievable.                                time  2100    It is horrible, and the world needs to know why this is important.  The world needs to know why we have decided to go forward with this as  soon as possible.   This package builds upon the strong, ongoing support already  delivered by the United States, thanks to the bipartisan, bicameral  unity in the Congress and with the administration.   In our government funding legislation last March, we delivered $13.6  billion in humanitarian, security, and economic assistance. These  resources are already reaching communities on the ground, helping the  Ukrainians protect their people and repel Russian forces.   Just yesterday, President Biden proudly signed into law one of our  consequential legislative initiatives, the revival of the historic  lend-lease program. Lend-lease helped turn the tide in the fight  against fascism in World War II, and it will be essential in our  mission to rescue democracy from dictatorship today.   The House also passed one that I like to call seize and freeze: seize  the Russian assets, freeze them, and then, to punish the Russian  oligarchs funding this diabolical war, use the assets, when they thaw,  to rebuild Ukraine.  [[Page H4781]]    At the same time, America has continued to move together with our  allies to level a historic punishment against Putin for his senseless  aggression, isolating Russia and devastating its economy.   I wish the people of Russia knew what he was doing to them, but he  does not allow the truth to be heard by the Russian people.   I want to say one more thing about all of this, and that is, when we  talk about our partners in NATO and the European Union, I want to sing  their praises because they have seen that their dependence on Russian  oil is a weapon of war for the Russians. They have seen that unless  they diversify away from Russian oil, they will always be enslaved by  needing that oil.   I am so pleased that they have made the decision that, in an  appropriate timetable, they will be withdrawing from that, as we did in  the House a number of weeks ago when we said--and the Senate did as  well--we won't be purchasing any more Russian oil.   So again, for these and other reasons, it is just an honor to be  associated with the courage of the people of Ukraine and the generosity  of the people of Poland and other European countries that are receiving  these refugees. They have opened their homes and their hearts to them,  and we need to be helpful in every way that we can.   So, I salute our bipartisan leadership in bringing this to the floor.   I also thank Mr. Rogers. He was chair of the committee when I was on  the committee, and I appreciated his remarks earlier.   Again, I thank Rosa DeLauro for the efficiency and directness with  which she was ready to bring this to the floor the minute the President  said we can proceed with it as a single measure.   I urge a strong bipartisan vote for this act of mercy.
