 Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities, but  rising costs and inflation have brought increased challenges to Main  Street establishments across our State. This holiday season, I am proud  to relaunch Support Local Gems All Season Long, a holiday revival of  the statewide Support Local Gems initiative, which encourages Idahoans  to do their holiday shopping at the small businesses that make the Gem  State special. As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Council  Mountain Coffee & Laundromat as one of Idaho's Local Gems.   Council Mountain Coffee & Laundromat is a staple in the Council  community. Owned and operated by Jacob and Samantha Sturlin since 2021,  the coffee shop and laundromat are popular among locals for daily cups  of coffee and visitors passing through town. The Sturlins moved to  Council and bought Council Mountain Coffee & Laundromat in pursuit of a  more rural lifestyle and an opportunity to get involved in the  community. Council Mountain Coffee features an eclectic menu of  coffees, teas, Italian sodas, pastries, seasonal specials, and all are  served by the friendliest staff.   The Sturlins' passion for the community shines through in their  sponsorship of the local rodeo, vacation Bible school, and the annual  Fourth of July fireworks show. They encourage even the youngest  community members to get involved, allowing Council Elementary School  students to decorate coffee sleeves to brighten customers' morning joe.   Congratulations to Jacob and Samantha Sturlin and the employees at  Council Mountain Coffee & Laundromat. You are an outstanding example of  what it means to be one of Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State  proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities, but  rising costs and inflation have brought increased challenges to Main  Street establishments across our State.

As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor 2nd South  Market as one of Idaho's Local Gems.   Idaho's first food hall was born in 2019, when owners Dave and Lisa  Buddecke purchased the historic 1926 Krengel Machine Company building.  Paying homage to its location in Twin Falls' historic warehouse  district, 2nd South Market hosts six locally owned food vendors and  full bar, which together employ more than 50 people. The food hall  features 14,700 square feet of outdoor space, known as the Yard, which  provides additional seating, live music, cornhole, firepits, and space  for private events. 2nd South Market is a space where the Magic Valley  can gather, work, socialize, and eat--a place where the Magic Valley  can build community.   The Buddeckes embraced the history of the former blacksmith,  boilermaker, welding, hardware, and most recently, thrift store  building, to create a vibrant epicenter for the Magic Valley. During  the restoration of the building, original wood and metal paneling,  doors, windows, signage, and old whiskey bottles dating back to  Prohibition were recovered. A wall at the entrance of the food hall  highlights many of these materials and shares the land and building's  unique story since 1907.   Congratulations to Dave and Lisa Buddecke and the vendors at 2nd  South Market. You are an outstanding example of what it means to be one  of Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities, but  rising costs and inflation have brought increased challenges to Main  Street establishments across our State.

As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Seven  Ridges Ag Service LLC as one of Idaho's Local Gems.   Tad and Kayce Brown, of Kendrick, opened Seven Ridges Ag Services in  2019. After working as a service technician for a John Deere dealer for  more than 11 years, Tad decided to explore his own off-road equipment  repair service for the local agricultural, construction, and forestry  industries. Seven Ridges originally operated out of a single truck and  garage. Each year of operation, demand grew. The Browns continue to  find new facilities to accommodate their customers' demand. Most  recently, Tad and Kayce joined Jimmie and Cindy Breckenridge to  purchase a local parts and repair shop--Kendrick Ag & Supply--where  Seven Ridges Ag Services can grow and expand.   Aside from Seven Ridges' service repairs, Tad and Kayce actively  support Kendrick's youth through the JK Baseball Association and the  Kendrick FFA. The Browns proudly support the annual Juliaetta  Blackberry Festival Car Show and the University of Idaho Vandal Cheer  Team.   Congratulations to Tad and Kayce Brown at Seven Ridges Ag Service  LLC. You are an outstanding example of what it means to be one of  Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State proud, and I look forward  to your continued growth and success.

As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Royal  Theaters as one of Idaho's Local Gems.   With two locations in Idaho Falls and one in Blackfoot, Royal  Theaters is beloved by southeast Idaho's moviegoers. Kent and Ingrid  Lott purchased the Centre Theater, originally a 1913 Vaudeville  Theater, in 1993. Once a single-screen theater, the Lotts turned the  balcony into a second theater 3 years after its opening. Royal  Theaters' second Idaho Falls location boasts four screens, while the  Lotts' Blackfoot location houses seven.   The Lotts' passion for the movie business is evident in their  renovation projects throughout the years. In 2013, Royal Theaters  upgraded the 35mm film projectors to digital projectors. In their  latest project, the Lotts remodeled both Idaho Falls locations with  stadium seating and VIP seats. For more than 30 years, Royal Theaters  has offered a special moviegoing experience for southeast Idaho.   Congratulations to the Lott family and the employees at Royal  Theaters. You are an outstanding example of what it means to be one of  Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State proud, and I look forward  to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities, but  rising costs and inflation have brought increased challenges to Main  Street establishments across our state.

As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Vickers  Western Store as one of Idaho's Local Gems.   Vickers Western Store has outfitted southeast Idaho cowboys and  cowgirls since 1976. Bill Vickers, an Idaho State University alum,  opened the western wear store in Pocatello, which offers a vast  inventory of apparel, accessories, home decor, a pawn shop, and boot  repair operation. Vickers' 22 employees offer the highest quality  customer service, enticing customers to come back time and time again.  In 2001, Vickers' booming success encouraged Bill to expand and open a  second store in Idaho Falls.   Bill Vickers operated Vickers Western Store until he passed away in  2013. Bill enjoyed rodeo, winning All-Around Champion at the Idaho  State High School Rodeo Finals, and announcing rodeos throughout the  West. Bill was later inducted into the Idaho Cowboy Hall of Fame. In  memory of Bill, the Vickers family founded the Billy D. Vickers  Memorial Endowment for Idaho State University students passionate about  rodeo. Even after Bill's passing, Vickers continues to provide the  high-quality, phenomenal customer service he championed and founded the  store on. Bill's memory lives on through his family and his store. The  Vickers family continues to operate the store in southeast Idaho.   Congratulations to the Vickers family and all of the employees at  Vickers Western Store. You are an outstanding example of what it means  to be one of Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great state proud, and I  look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities, but  rising costs and inflation have brought increased challenges to Main  Street establishments across our State.

As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor White  Cross Pharmacy and Compounding as one of Idaho's Local Gems.   In 1922, White Cross Pharmacy opened its first location in Priest  River. In its 101-year history, only five owners have ever operated the  store, which shows their strong commitment to helping keep our  communities happy, healthy, and well-informed. Since 1922, the pharmacy  has grown to serve Sandpoint, Oldtown, and Spirit Lake. Today, Gary de  Blaquiere, Rich de Blaquiere, and Shannon McGlashan own and operate the  pharmacy, which truly stands out by providing student work positions  under hard-working pharmacy staff, who diligently serve the community.   Due to its rural Idaho location, White Cross Pharmacy, like many  rural pharmacies, plays a vital role in providing healthcare for  residents, including the elderly. Rural pharmacies are often the only  healthcare facility for miles around. In these towns, the pharmacy  employees treat customers like family, and in turn, customers trust  pharmacists with critical healthcare services. This is the niche filled  by White Cross Pharmacy in Oldtown, Priest River, Spirit Lake, and  Sandpoint.   White Cross Pharmacy offers patient services ranging from treatment  protocols for minor and self-limiting ailments to advice on over-the- counter remedies to guidance on prescription medication. But the  pharmacy is not stopping there because it is looking to add new  services to better serve the community. It works to help those in need  by donating money to assist those who cannot afford their medications  and actively participating in community events and donating to local  food banks.   Congratulations to de Blaquiere Enterprises, Inc., and all of the  employees at White Cross Pharmacy. You are an outstanding example of  what it means to be one of Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State  proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
