 Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from  Missouri and his remarks about how we need the other side to work with  us. And that is so very true because this administration, the Biden  administration, has refused to drag themselves away from the political  posturing and move toward actually governing and  [[Page S8326]]  addressing the problems that the American people would like to see  addressed. They have sent this economy into the gutter.   Now, think about it. Just a few years ago, we had the best economy  that we had had in decades. Unemployment for women, for African  Americans, for Hispanics hit an alltime low; wage growth at an alltime  high. Now the economy is in the gutter. Our southern border is now in  shambles. The hearing we had yesterday with Secretary Mayorkas was so  dissatisfying because he did not have facts and figures and answers,  and we see a country that is incredibly divided.   But at least the American people now know just how in denial the  White House is about what is takes to be living in the real world.  Their constant attempts to downplay the mess they have made have had  the opposite effect, and now everyone knows just how out of touch they  are with anyone who regularly pulls in at the gas station to fill up  their own car or darkens the door of a grocery store to buy the  groceries that they need.   Yesterday, I came to the Senate floor and asked the question: What  will it take for the Biden administration to take the threat of Chinese  aggression seriously?   The evidence is staring them in the face, and yet they refuse to  acknowledge that there is a danger; that China is our adversary.  Certainly, the President's phone call did not give us any comfort in  knowing that he understands they are an adversary.   And today, I have a similar question: What will it take for the Biden  administration to take the American people seriously when they  repeatedly warn us that the economy is in trouble? They are living the  warning signs every single day.   But try as they might to convince us otherwise, this administration's  talking points are all about happy talk, better jobs numbers, and the  pockets of growth. But this is not anything that is representative of  the economy at large.   Still, every policy that they proposed this year assumes that the  costs of inflation are a myth; that inflation is concocted by  Republicans; that it is there as a talking point to scare American  families.   How completely out of touch can this administration be? They are  proving the point that they are elitists; that they live in a bubble.   What they keep saying to people is: Oh, you know, it is a dollar  here. It is a dollar there. It doesn't really matter that much.   But, of course, it does matter.   Anyone who has taken the time out of their life to rear a family and  any mother who gets up in the morning and she is trying to feed the  kids and get them to school and shuttle kids into the minivan and then  she is off to work and then they are off to activities in the  afternoon, she knows that pennies add up to dollars, which adds up to  hundreds of dollars, and it goes quickly--in a hurry.   I talked to someone last weekend. They were talking about how a  manageable trip to the grocery store now has the potential to just blow  their budget. They are somebody who likes to use cash, not credit  cards. They put it all in envelopes, and they plan out their  expenditures. They are seeing firsthand what this budget is doing to  their monthly budget for their family.   The sad thing is, this is all happening just in time for  Thanksgiving, just in time for the Christmas holidays.   But, you know, you don't need to take my word for it. My colleagues  don't need to take my word for it. Let's look at the Bureau of Labor  Statistics to tell the story. This is a Federal bureau, and they keep  this data. Their data is telling quite an interesting story.   I have a poster here that actually shows you the percentage increase  you are going to see. The Thanksgiving turkey will cost you 6.1 percent  more this year than last. If you want to get a ham, that is going to be  an extra 12 percent. If you are serving veggies with the turkey and  ham, that is an extra 8.2 percent. The price of a cup of coffee for  after dinner, that is up 5.7 percent. And the grand finale, the  homemade apple pie is up 5.1 percent. And I hope that you weren't  planning on driving out of town for your Thanksgiving dinner because  gas prices are up $1.23 a gallon since last October. Think about that,  $1.23 a gallon--a gallon.   Now, this is sticker shock every time you pull into the gas pump. It  is sticker shock every time you go to the grocery store. And, as you  can see what it was last year, you are seeing these stickers on gas  pumps all across Tennessee.   Yes, the Biden administration, they can say: I did that.   Decisions that the President has made--stopping the Keystone  Pipeline, moving us from being energy independent and exporting oil to  making us dependent on OPEC, of all things, so that we can drive our  cars and heat our homes--it outrageous.   I would encourage President Biden and my Democratic colleagues to  remember that, when it comes to budgets and families managing their way  through this inflation, they can't have it both ways.   Back in January, they told congressional Republicans that their  bipartisan bailout bill was the only thing standing between the average  American family and financial ruin. Now, the very idea that pricing and  spending power matters seems extremely unpopular with our friends on  the left. Suddenly, they expect the American people to put on a brave  face, to treat shortages like a minimalist trend, and to cut back where  they can.   Do you know what, Madam President? The American people don't want to  live in austerity; the American people want to go to the grocery store  and find the food that they need. It is stunning, the attitude of the  left. It is stunning, the disregard that they have for average American  families who are working hard every single day.   Of course, people who are now struggling to make ends meet could stay  home. They could stay right at home this holiday season. They could  park the car, cook a small meal, and swallow their disappointment. But  do you know who won't be doing that this holiday season? President Joe  Biden. You won't see him making sacrifices to sustain the narrative.   I have a feeling I won't see many of my Democratic colleagues passing  on Thanksgiving dinner to show solidarity with families who couldn't  stretch their paycheck far enough for that Thanksgiving turkey.   I would hope that something here in all of this data would remind  you. The Bureau of Labor Statistics--that is where I am getting the  data. I am hoping it would remind my friends across the aisle that this  is not about proving a point. This is about the average American's  growing inability to put food on the table.   You may not have to worry about an extra $30 or $40 on the grocery  bill, but most Tennesseans do worry about that. And for some people  spending more isn't even an option.   It is time to adjust the priorities of the Democrats. It is time for  this administration to adjust their priorities. It is time for them to  meet the people where they are and not where they think that the people  should be forced to go by their socialist agenda.   I would encourage my colleagues: Pay attention to what the people of  this country are telling you. Govern accordingly. People are depending  on it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is my privilege to finally  congratulate the 2020 Country Music Hall of Fame members-elect Dean  Dillon, Marty Stuart, and Hank Williams, Jr. With the postponement of  their medallion ceremony until this coming Sunday, I can tell you that  Music City is ready to welcome them into the Circle.   Dean Dillon, this year's songwriter inductee, is the heart and soul  behind some of country music's most iconic hits. With imagery as vivid  as a golden sun-drenched memory and melodies as smooth as Tennessee  whiskey, Dean captured the attention of music fans and earned the  admiration of the industry's most well-respected artists. In Nashville,  the good word is that ``it all begins with a song,'' and in Dean's  case, his songbook has inspired generations of young writers to give  themselves up to the art of storytelling.   Marty Stuart, this year's modern era artist inductee, is a jack of  all trades and an undisputed master of each of them. He started his  journey to the Hall of Fame at the age of 13 and, over the course of  his career, earned the respect of his peers with his skills as a  musician, singer, songwriter, producer, and television host. Today, he  is recognized not only for his contributions to his craft, but for his  role as one of the foremost custodians of country music's legacy.   Hank Williams, Jr., this year's veterans era artist inductee, bridged  generations and genres with his own special blend of family tradition,  outlaw swagger, and a singular disregard for the rules. Over the course  of five decades and more than 100 appearances on the charts, Hank  proved that what many insiders foolishly dismissed as the underbelly of  country music was in fact home to musicians and fans alike who  preferred to create their own absolution rather than seek it within the  glittering confines of the mainstream.   On behalf of the entire Tennessee delegation, I thank Dean, Marty,  and Hank for their passion and artistry. Your talents are a gift,  gentlemen. Thank you for sharing them with us.                            ____________________
