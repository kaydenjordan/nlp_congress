 Madam President, it was a few weeks back that I was on the  Senate floor visiting with my colleagues about the Federal Reserve's  response to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and I again am here  today, this time to, in more specific terms, indicate there needs to be  a pause in any new banking regulations until an independent  investigation of the Fed's response to the failure at Silicon Valley  Bank.   I asked for and would again reiterate the importance of an  independent review and indicate that that review should be done prior  to the enactment of new capital requirements in order to ensure that  these new regulations are properly tailored. Led by a nonpartisan  financial expert uninvolved in the Federal response, an independent  investigation would allow a clear picture of what reforms are truly  necessary. Instead, new capital requirements are largely based upon the  Fed's ``holistic review,'' the origins of which are vague at best.   Regulators have now proposed a host of new requirements and rules for  midsized banks to conform to the same capital standards of the  country's largest lenders. Lumping regional lenders in with global,  systemically important banks ignores the congressional intent laid out  in the bipartisan piece of legislation S. 2155. Independent oversight  might reveal these regulations to be an overprescribed or plainly  unnecessary response to SVB's failure.   While some measured regulations may be in order, implementing new  capital requirements on healthy, well-run financial institutions will  do little to prevent a similar crisis. Healthy levels of capital are  necessary for strong banks and their ability to lend, but the lack of  attention paid to downstream effects of higher capital requirements in  the proposal is concerning. This is a sentiment that is shared--my  sentiment, and it is shared by multiple Federal Reserve Board  Governors.   Meaningful oversight from regulators requires objectivity and must be  done without having a predetermined outcome in mind. It should come as  no surprise that the Fed's remedy does virtually nothing to address the  root cause of recent bank failures, poor bank management, and lacks  supervision. Instead, I worry that the regulations set in motion will  serve as an opportunity for regulators to push a preestablished  regulatory agenda that will dry up lending.   It is widely acknowledged that the increase in capital requirements  go hand in hand with a reduction in credit availability, and with  interest rates near a 20-year peak, access to credit for families and  businesses is already shrinking.   The draft proposal from the Federal Reserve would drive up the cost  of home ownership for low-income households, underserved borrowers, and  those unable to afford large downpayments. Affordable housing is in  short supply, and with midsized lenders forced to pull back on home  loans, mortgage lending will continue to be pushed outside the highly  regulated banking system. With continued labor shortages, elevated  input costs, and supply backlogs, less credit availability is the last  thing--the last thing--our housing market needs.   To put it simply, there should be no new regulations until an  independent review of Silicon Valley Bank's failure is completed. We  need to know what we are doing before we attempt to do it. Regulation  this significant warrants increased transparency from the Fed. We need  that transparency.   An additional review would alleviate concerns about impartiality of  the ``holistic review'' and ensuing capital requirements. The Federal  Reserve itself recognized in its recent ``Financial Stability Report''  that American banks as a whole were already well-capitalized.   Tightening capital requirements at the expense of lending will not  prevent another SVB-type failure. A comprehensive response from  policymakers and regulators would address the glaring supervisory  shortfalls that preceded Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.   I yield the floor.
