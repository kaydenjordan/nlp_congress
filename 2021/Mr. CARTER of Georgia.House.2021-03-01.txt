 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  American Red Cross for celebrating 140 years of service.   Since their founding by Clara Barton in 1881, the American Red Cross  has been paramount in preventing and alleviating human suffering in the  face of emergencies.   As an organization, they aspire to turn compassion into action so  that countless individuals affected by disaster receive care, shelter,  and hope. They are part of the world's largest volunteer network found  in nearly 200 countries. The American Red Cross developed the first  nationwide civilian blood program in the 1940s, and they still provide  more than 40 percent of the blood products in this country.   As we continue to navigate this health crisis, they remain steadfast  in their commitment to delivering much-needed services to communities  across the Nation. I am extremely grateful for the work the American  Red Cross has done to uplift those in need.                            ____________________
