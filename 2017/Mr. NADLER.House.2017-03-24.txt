 Mr. Speaker, for seven years, the Republicans have tried  and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So now, with a  Republican-controlled House, a Republican-controlled Senate, and a  Republican in the White House, what have they presented us to vote on  today? Republicans complained that premiums were skyrocketing, so they  offer a bill that raises premiums. They complained that deductibles  were too high, so they propose allowing insurance companies to charge  more. They complained that too many people were losing their insurance,  so they have embraced a plan that will take away health care from 24  million Americans.   This bill imposes a devastating age tax on older Americans and does  next to nothing to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. It  gives nearly $900 billion in tax cuts to the insurance companies and  the wealthy, while refusing coverage for services as basic as  hospitalization. It's simple: Americans will pay more and get less  under this bill.   In New York, 2.7 million people will lose insurance and the state  will lose $4.6 billion in Medicaid funding. Compounding those cuts is a  cynical so-called deal several upstate Members made to secure their  votes on this bill. Under the bill, New York State, and ONLY New York  State, will no longer be allowed to ask counties to provide a portion  of state Medicaid funding.   Don't be fooled--this is no deal at all for New York and will  actually gut the State's Medicaid program, forcing hundreds of  hospitals to close and rationing health care for millions of New  Yorkers.   But my colleagues who have traded their vote for this provision have  made an empty bargain. This provision is flatly unconstitutional and  will never be enacted. They are giving away health insurance for  millions of New Yorkers for an empty promise.   My Republican colleagues claim we need to pass this bill to give  people ``freedom'' to buy health insurance. Let me tell you, freedom to  buy health insurance and actually being able to afford health insurance  are two very different things.   They keep talking about ``access'' to health care. Access is not  coverage. When they talk about access and freedom, they are conceding  that this bill does nothing to ensure that Americans have affordable,  comprehensive health insurance to cover them no matter what their  health care needs are.   The Republicans so clearly believe that Americans just need freedom  to buy insurance, that when asked what a pregnant woman should do if  her state no longer requires insurance companies to cover maternity  care, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said she can ``figure out a way to  change the state [she] lives in.'' How callous are my Republican  colleagues to believe that is a real option for Americans?   This bill is a cowardly, cynical effort to lower taxes on the rich  and dismantle Medicare and Medicaid as we know it. I urge my colleagues  to oppose this bill.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further  consideration of H.R. 1628 is postponed.                            ____________________
