 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, January 20, 2022, is a  day that will live in infamy and marks 1 year since Joe Biden was sworn  in as President.   I remember saying: This is the most important election of our  lifetime.   Unfortunately, I was right.   In 1 year--under one-party rule and in just 1 year--it has been one  huge, continuing debacle and crisis.   We went from energy independence to energy crisis, Madam Speaker;  from a rebounding economy to the highest inflation in 40 years; from  international peace through strength to increased tensions with our  greatest adversaries; and might I add, losing the confidence of our  allies.   We went, Madam Speaker, from border security to 2 million illegal  alien crossings; from the end of the pandemic to the never-ending  pandemic, particularly with unconstitutional mandates.   What is the cause?   One Democrat disaster after another, and Americans are losing faith  not only with the performance of the current administration, but also  with our governmental agencies: the FBI, the DOJ, and the CDC. You name  it. The list is endless.   Democrats are showing who they are: Socialists, police defunders,  open border advocates, and anti-parents who just want a say in their  child's schooling. Is that too much to ask?   That is what Democrats are. This is their brand, and that Democrat  brand, I might add, is a disaster. We Republicans need to point it out  every day in every way.   So to my Republican colleagues I say, let's go brand `em.
