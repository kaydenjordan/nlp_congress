 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his  courtesy. I think this will take about 7 or 8 minutes, I would say to  my colleague from Illinois.   I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business.    Mr. President, last week I was heartbroken to learn that  a dear friend and great fighter for freedom, Vladimir Kara-Murza, had  been hospitalized in Moscow. Those of us who know the work of this  brave Russian patriot could not afford to hope or assume that he was  suffering some ordinary illness. Just 2 years ago, under mysterious  circumstances, Vladimir grew very ill and fell into a coma.   Many suspected he was poisoned, to intimidate him or worse. That is  why last week's news signaled another shadowy strike against a  brilliant voice who has defied the tyranny of Putin's Russia.   Many Americans are not familiar with the life of Vladimir Kara-Murza,  but it is one that reflects the best qualities of leadership, courage,  selflessness, idealism and patriotism, and it is a life dedicated to  the principles we all hold dear: truth and justice, freedom and  fairness, human rights and human dignity.   All his life, Vladimir has been a brave, outspoken, and relentless  champion for the Russian people. He is a deputy leader of the People's  Freedom Party, Russia's leading pro-democracy party. He is a leading  coordinator of Open Russia, a foundation that promotes civil society  and democracy in Russia. In 2011, he helped mobilize the largest anti- Kremlin demonstration since the early 1990s, leading tens of thousands  of Russians to march in protest of widespread fraud and corruption in  the parliamentary elections.   In the United States, Vladimir was one of the most passionate and  effective advocates for passage of the Magnitsky Act, legislation that  gives the Federal Government powers to punish human rights violators in  Russia. Most recently he has eloquently and persuasively campaigned to  expand the Act to impose sanctions on those Russians journalists who  were so cowed and corrupted by the Kremlin that they become  indispensable to propagating the lies and atmosphere of hate, fear, and  violence the Putin regime relies on to maintain power.   Vladimir's family has a long history of heroism for years, dating  back to the early 1900s. Vladimir once described the experience of  visiting the KGB archives in Moscow where he reviewed the thin file on  his great grandfather who was executed. It contained the scant evidence  required for a death sentence in Stalin's Russia. He recalled the  weight that fell upon him when he read the modest document to which the  executioners affixed the date and their signatures to signify that the  judgment had been carried out.   Vladimir also learned what it takes to be a revolutionary from our  mutual friend Boris Nemtsov. Vladimir and Boris struggled together for  years in the cause of freedom and democracy. Vladimir once called Boris  the best President Russia never had.   Boris was one of the first to warn of the incoming Putin  dictatorship, even when many of his fellow liberals could not see it.  He told the truth about Putin's reign of terror, rampant corruption,  and his illegal invasion of Ukraine. For the crime of telling the truth  in Putin's Russia, Boris Nemtsov was murdered in the shadow of the  Kremlin in 2015.   He died a martyr. He died a martyr for the rights of people who were  taught to hate him but who will one day mourn his death, revere his  memory, and despise his murderers. After Boris's assassination, many  urged Vladimir not to return to Russia. He had every reason not to. He  knew his own family's history with tyranny. He knew what happened to  Boris Nemtsov, and he knew all too well about the culture of impunity  that Putin has created in Russia, where individuals are routinely  persecuted and attacked for their beliefs, including by the Russian  Government, and no one is ever held responsible.   He knew about Sergei Yushenkov, who was investigating the Kremlin's  potential role in the 1999 apartment bombings in Russia when he was  shot and killed at the entrance of his apartment. He knew about  American journalist Paul Klebnikov, who was investigating Russian  Government connections to organized crime when he was shot to death in  Moscow in 2004.   He knew about Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist, human rights  activist, and fierce critic of Putin's brutal war in Chechnya, who was  murdered in the stairwell of her apartment building on Putin's birthday  in 2006.   He knew about former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who exposed  the Putin regime's massive corruption tied to organized crime and  involving assassination and murder. He was poisoned to death in 2006  with a radioactive isotype in a brazen act of nuclear terrorism.   He knew about Sergei Magnitsky, that most unlikely of heroes in the  cause of freedom, the humble tax attorney who blew the whistle on tax  fraud and large-scale theft by Russian Government officials, only to be  charged with their crimes and die in a squalid cell inside the prison  that once held the political opponents of the Czars and the Soviets.   In short, Vladimir knew that Putin is a killer--and he is a killer.  He might very well be the next target. Vladimir knew that there was no  moral equivalence between the United States and Putin's Russia. I  repeat: There is no moral equivalence between that butcher and thug and  KGB colonel and the United States of America, the country that Ronald  Reagan used to call a shining city on a hill. To allege some kind of  moral equivalence between the two is either terribly misinformed or  incredibly biased. Neither can be accurate in any way.   Knowing all this, knowing that his life was at risk, Vladimir  returned to Russia. He continued to speak truth to power. He kept faith  with his ideals and was in confrontation with a cruel and dangerous  autocracy. He kept faith honorably and bravely with the example of his  friend and comrade Boris Nemtsov.   Now it appears that Vladimir has once again paid the price for his  gallantry and integrity, for placing the interests of the Russian  people before his own self-interest. He is very ill, but I am  encouraged to learn his condition is now stable.   So today, speaking for so many Americans, I offer my most heartfelt  prayers for the recovery of Vladimir Kara-Murza and for the success of  the cause to which he has dedicated his life: truth and justice for the  Russian people. And I do so with the confidence Vladimir himself once  expressed: ``I am sure that in the end, we will win, because even when  dictators prevail for some time, sooner or later, freedom wins.''   I thank my colleague from Illinois for his indulgence.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, last week, we celebrated the 100th  birthday of an American for whom my family  [[Page S866]]  and I have always had the greatest personal respect and admiration: ADM  Lloyd R. ``Joe'' Vasey.   Joe Vasey was my father's dear friend and comrade for so many years.  As he marks a century of life well lived, I send him the warmest wishes  and convey to him thanks of a grateful nation for embodying the very  finest qualities of patriotism and for his constant service to a cause  greater than himself.   From the Naval Academy to dangerous duty in the Second World War to  five commands at sea to service in the highest councils of military  command, Joe Vasey's was a most distinguished and honorable Navy  career. But he did not believe that his retirement from active duty  relieved him of the responsibilities of patriotism. He continued to  serve the national interest by founding the Pacific Forum to promote  security and stability in the critically important Asia-Pacific region.   The only elaboration of this illustrious life I can offer are  reminiscences of a friendship, some of which I was privileged to  personally observe, which for me served as emblematic of a tradition;  that of service as an officer in the U.S. Navy and the bonds of respect  and love that unite good officers in shared sacrifice and devotion to  their service and their country. It is the tradition upon which, in the  most difficult moments of my life, I relied for the strength to  persevere for my country's honor and for my self-respect.   Very late in his life, my father was interviewed for an oral history  of our officers in the post-World War II Navy. ``There's a term which  has slipped somewhat into disuse,'' he remarked in the interview,  ``which I always used to the moment I retired, and that is the term: an  officer and a gentleman.'' Had my father been asked to identify a  contemporary who personified the virtues he considered essential to the  life of an officer and a gentleman, I have no doubt he would have  thought first of his friend Joe Vasey.   My father's respect and affection for Joe Vasey was unlimited. Their  friendship was forged in the crucible of war and strengthened to last a  lifetime by their shared experiences aboard the USS Gunnel as it  prowled the Pacific from Midway to Nagasaki in search of the enemy. And  find them they did. On one occasion, the ship sank a Japanese freighter  and destroyer, but was then forced to submerge for 36 hours while  avoiding Japanese depth charges. With the temperature on the submarine  reaching 120 degrees and oxygen running low, my father decided to  surface and try to fight the remaining Japanese ships. But he offered  his torpedo officer, Joe Vasey, and the rest of his officers the option  to abandon ship. To a man, they agreed with my father and rejected that  course. When the Gunnel surfaced, its weary crew found the Japanese  destroyers had given up and were steaming away. My father, Joe Vasey,  and their comrades lived to fight another day.   My father and Joe Vasey were proud veterans of an epic war. They  never felt the need to exaggerate their experiences, extraordinary as  they were. But they did talk about the lessons of leadership they  learned and how they could be applied to new circumstances. And they  had many occasions to do so. They were together when my father became  commander-in-chief of Pacific Command during the Vietnam war and  Admiral Vasey served as his most trusted adviser as head of strategic  plans and policies. They were together when they argued to Washington  for a strategy to win the war rather than just continue the bleeding.  And they were together when my father gave orders for B-52s to bomb the  city in which his son was held a prisoner of war. They were the best of  friends and exemplified that noblest of traditions: brothers in arms.   I count myself immeasurably fortunate to have benefited from their  example early in life so that I could derive the strength I needed to  survive later misfortune from their stories, their courage, and their  honor.   So to Joe Vasey, a great patriot, a good man, an officer and a  gentleman, and a brave defender of this Nation, I wish a very happy  birthday, fair winds, and following seas.                            ____________________
