 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  from Texas for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this resolution about the fiscal state of the Nation  is an important step in the right direction. Now more than ever,  Congress needs to take an honest look at government spending and the  role it is playing in this inflation crisis.   All across America, families are struggling. Consumer prices rose 5.4  percent in September year over year. Inflation is on pace to hit the  highest level in 40 years, and the Congressional Budget Office has  confirmed that inflation has eroded the purchasing power of families.   Is it any wonder now that only 35 percent of Americans say that the  economy is good? I will note that is just a bit smaller than the 37  percent of Americans who believe that President Joe Biden is competent  as President.   Make no mistake, the high prices Americans are paying at the grocery  store and at the gas pump are a direct result of the Democrats'  reckless spending agenda. So it is a little laughable that my Democrat  colleagues would bring up this resolution now when for the last 9  months they have rammed through trillions in new spending and debt. As  we speak, they are trying to pass the largest tax-and-spending bill in  the history--in the history--of our country without even a score from  the Congressional Budget Office.  [[Page H6136]]    Here is a tip: Be honest with the American people about the price tag  of your agenda and the higher prices that will be inflicted. Then a  hearing on the state of our Nation's fiscal health will be much more  successful.
