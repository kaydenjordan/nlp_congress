 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share an uplifting  story about a young man from my congressional district.   Jake Wegner, a senior at Central College in Pella, Iowa, took his  first at bat after beating cancer twice.   Jake's first battle with cancer began when he was diagnosed with  neuroblastoma before the start of his high school senior baseball  season.   After recovering from surgery, Jake enrolled at Central College,  where he finished his first semester, but upon returning home for a  checkup, he learned that the cancer had relapsed.   Jake kept his faith strong and family close while he endured  chemotherapy for the next 15 months, and in January of 2018, he was  ready to begin classes again.   In yesterday's game against Simpson College, after 3 years of being  cancer-free, Jake took his first at bat for senior night.   Jake, your story of following your dreams and overcoming adversity is  an inspiration to all of us, and I couldn't be prouder to represent you  in Congress.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Ranking  Member Bost and Chair Takano, for their leadership, and I thank  Representative Bost for yielding me time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my bipartisan GI  Bill National Emergency Extended Deadline Act, which I was proud to  introduce with a fellow veteran, Congresswoman Sherrill.   Our legislation would protect veterans' educational benefits from  expiring due to institutional closures or other factors caused by the  COVID-19 national emergency.   This important legislation will allow the Department of Veterans  Affairs to pause the time limit currently placed on the use of GI bill  benefits and to permit them to restart the clock after it is safe for  veterans to return to school.   I am pleased to see that our legislation was amended in the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs, to include my Veterans Readiness and Employment  National Emergency Extended Deadline Act, which I was also proud to  introduce with Congresswoman Sherrill.   The VR&E NEED Act would ensure disabled veterans get the support they  need to enter the civilian workforce through the VA's VR&E program. Our  legislation will allow the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pause the  12-year time limit to use VR&E benefits during national emergencies and  other crises when eligible, disabled veterans are prevented from  leveraging those benefits through no fault of their own.   The VR&E program is an excellent path for our veterans to receive the  education and training they need to reenter the workforce. By pausing  the timer on their benefits when programs are closed, we preserve the  opportunities veterans have earned through their service to our  country. Our disabled veterans sacrificed greatly in service to our  country, so now it is our turn to serve them.   It is critical these benefits are not reduced due to no fault of the  individual veteran. Over the past year, we have seen the COVID-19  public health emergency force universities and colleges across the  country to temporarily close their doors. As a 24-year Army veteran, I  know how important being able to use GI benefits is to ensure that our  veterans can find meaningful employment. In fact, I used the GI bill  benefit throughout medical school.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sherrill for her partnership on  both of these commonsense bills to help our veterans to access the  benefits they have earned.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the bipartisan GI  NEED Act.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague,  Representative Bost, for yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Congressman Gallego's  bipartisan Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities Pilot  Program Act.   I am proud that this legislation was amended by the Veterans' Affairs  Committee to include my bipartisan VET TEC Enhancement Act. This  legislation, which I proudly introduced with a fellow veteran,  Congressman Kahele, would increase the amount authorized to be  appropriated for the Veteran Employment Through Technical Education  Courses program.   VET TEC is a 5-year pilot program that allows eligible veterans to  use GI Bill-style benefits to attend innovative job training programs  to prepare them for future employment in the technology industry.   My bill to support our veterans would increase current funding for  the VET TEC program from $45 million to $90 million per year to allow  the VA to enroll more veterans in this popular program. This program  ensures that our veterans have the tools they need to gain meaningful  employment.   To date, over 1,800 veterans have completed the VET TEC program and  found well-paying jobs with an average salary of $57,000 per year.   I have spoken to veterans' groups in my district and across the  country, and there is overwhelming support for this commonsense  program.   This is another highly successful avenue to assist veterans  reentering the civilian workforce, and I am proud to see the House  taking action to support our veterans.   In closing, I would like to thank Congressman Kahele for his  partnership on this important issue, and Congressman Gallego for his  support.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bipartisan  Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities Pilot Program  Act.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois  for yielding me time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the bipartisan  Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act, which I was proud to  introduce with the Iowa House delegation.   This legislation was named in honor of the memory and service of  Sergeant Brandon Ketchum of Davenport, which is in my congressional  district. Sergeant Ketchum died by suicide in 2016 after being denied  access to much-needed mental health services for PTSD at the VA  facility in Iowa City.   Our legislation would establish new Rural Access Network for Growth  Enhancement, or RANGE, programs throughout the VA and support  additional research on rural veteran mental healthcare needs.   The case of Sergeant Ketchum is tragic and shows us that we must do  more to serve our veterans. Expanding healthcare services in rural  America and among our veterans are two of my top priorities in  Congress, so I am proud to join the entire Iowa delegation in this  effort. We simply have to do better for our veterans. There is no other  option.   I would like to thank my colleagues in the Iowa delegation,  Congresswoman Axne, Congresswoman Hinson, and Congressman Feenstra, for  their partnership in this simple legislation to help veterans. I urge  all of my colleagues to support the bipartisan Sgt. Ketchum Rural  Veterans Mental Health Act.
