 Mr. President, we have come down to the floor multiple  times in the last few weeks trying to push the passage of our  bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.   For those who are not familiar with it at this point, it basically  says that you can't import products into the United States that are  made by slave labor in Xinjiang or entities that are associated with  the government of that region. If you are a company that is  manufacturing in that area, you need to prove that slaves didn't make  it; the presumption is on you.   It is already illegal, by the way, to bring goods made with slave  labor. It has been that way since the thirties. Yet it still happens,  and we know it is happening at an alarming, horrific rate, with the  genocide that we now witness being carried out by the Chinese  Government in the Xinjiang region.   This bill, which we hope, here in a few moments, passes today, will  head to the President and will become law, and it will help  tremendously in stopping that from happening.   Many companies have already taken steps to clean up their supply  chains, and, frankly, they should have no concerns about this law. Yet  for those that have not done that, they will no longer be able to  continue to make Americans--every one of us, frankly--unwitting  accomplices in the atrocities and genocide that are being committed by  the Chinese Communist Party.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6256, which was received  from the House; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Mr. President, I have no objection to the modification.
