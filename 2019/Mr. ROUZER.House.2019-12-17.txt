 Mr. Speaker, after months of delay, the House is on the  cusp of approving the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a landmark trade  deal that fulfills President Trump's promise to renegotiate and improve  NAFTA.   This agreement reduces tariffs, cracks down on unfair trading  practices, and removes other barriers to American-grown and -made  products. This is particularly true for many North Carolina products.   Mexico and Canada are North Carolina's most important trade partners.  North Carolina exported nearly $10.5 billion in total goods to Canada  and Mexico in 2018, and our agriculture industry is particularly  dependent upon trade with these two countries as well.   My home State exported more than $3.5 billion in agriculture products  in 2017. Under this agreement, North Carolina farm families can expect  to export even more.   Ratification of this trade deal means stability and more prosperity  for our farm families as well as for North Carolina's economy as a  whole.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ambassador Lighthizer and his entire  team at USTR, as well as the fine professionals at USDA, for their  tireless work to make this achievement possible.   This is a great win for America.                            ____________________
