 Mr. Speaker, many in this body continue to say that no  words can describe the horror that the Israeli people are facing. That  is not true. There are words to describe it and they have to be said.  Some of those words are simply the facts, the real information that we  are not seeing. One of them is that we are constantly hearing from pro- Palestinian groups that in fact you have a right to resist occupation.   I have been in this body since 2001. I was in Israel under Ariel  Sharon when he withdrew every single settler and every soldier from  Gaza. Gaza has not been under occupation, just the opposite. When they  didn't like the control they had after an election, Hamas seized, by  violence, the control of Gaza, killing their fellow Palestinians. Since  that time, they have been a war-making machine that has in fact been  financed by Iran, equipped by Iran, and today it is Iran that owes an  apology to the world, and the Palestinian people need to discount  forever their association.
