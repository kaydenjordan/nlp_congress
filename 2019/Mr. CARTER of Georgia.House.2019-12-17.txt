 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Pierce County High School competition cheerleading squad for winning  the 2019 AAA State championship.   Located in the First Congressional District of Georgia, this is the  fifth straight year that Pierce County has won the State championship.  It is the seventh time the team has posted a 97.5-point performance.   This year was a unique challenge for a team that lost nine seniors  from the previous year and had 12 new members on the 2019 squad.  However, they proved they were up to the challenge on the State's  largest stage.   Congratulations, Pierce County. You have made the First Congressional  District of Georgia proud.                            ____________________
