 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee  heard testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett  Kavanaugh about Dr. Ford's account of an attack on her by Judge  Kavanaugh and a friend when they were all teenagers.   Dr. Ford acquitted herself with grace and courage in her recounting  of the terrifying experience that has had a lasting effect on her life.   In his own testimony, Judge Kavanaugh dropped the polite veneer he  presented at his confirmation hearing when he complimented all of the  Senators he had met with and had told the committee ``the Supreme Court  must never be viewed as a partisan institution.'' That was then. Last  Thursday, he launched into a partisan political screed that  contradicted everything he had ever professed to believe about the way  judges should behave. He said: ``This whole two-week effort has been a  calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up  anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, a fear that has been  unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the  Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing  opposition groups.''   It reads like a fever dream, a paranoid fantasy. It is simply not  true. It arguably violated the Code of Conduct for United States Judges  that binds him as a sitting judge on the Federal appeals court for the  DC Circuit.   Dr. Ford's own words undercut Judge Kavanaugh's assertion that a vast  leftwing conspiracy is out to get him. In her deeply moving testimony,  Dr. Ford said: ``I thought it was my civic duty to relay the  information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh's conduct so that those  considering his nomination would know about this assault.''   She went on: ``My hope was that providing the information  confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr.  Kavanaugh's serious misconduct without having to make myself, my  family, or anyone's family vulnerable to the personal attacks and  invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public.''   Dr. Ford was trying to do her civic duty. She was not motivated by  revenge on anyone's behalf. She had no part in any organized  opposition. She was not fueled by pent-up anger or resentment. In  deciding to come forward, Dr. Ford was just a person who thought that  if she could only let the President know what Brett Kavanaugh did to  her, he would choose someone else.   Yet Kavanaugh attacked and tried to turn Dr. Ford's honest effort  into some sort of a dark, ugly ambush. At least he didn't accuse Dr.  Ford of being part of the alleged conspiracy that sought to derail his  nomination. In fact, when Senator Booker asked Judge Kavanaugh if he  blamed Dr. Ford for a coordinated effort against him, Judge Kavanaugh  said he bore Dr. Ford no ill will and that people in the hearing room,  not Dr. Ford, were against him.   We all saw something about Judge Kavanaugh's temperament and  character that day that should disqualify him from serving on the  Supreme Court of the United States. He was angry. He was belligerent.  He was partisan. He went on the attack against the Senators who were  questioning him.   These are not qualities we look for in a Supreme Court Justice or in  a judge for that matter. But don't take it from me; listen to Judge  Kavanaugh himself. In 2016, in the Catholic University Law Review, he  wrote about the importance of judges steering clear of politics. He  told his readers that ``a good judge, like a good umpire, cannot act as  a partisan.'' He said that while it is good for some judges to come  with a background in politics or policy, ``federal judges have to check  any prior political allegiances at the door. You have to shed them.''  Based on Judge Kavanaugh's testimony last week, it certainly doesn't  sound like he has shed his partisan convictions and connections.   In the same law review article, Judge Kavanaugh wrote:         To be a good judge and a good umpire, it's critical to have       the proper demeanor. It's important to . . . keep our       emotions in check and be calm amidst the storm.    He is not wrong. Indeed, the Code of Conduct for United States Judges  backs him up.   Canon 2 of the code reads:         A Judge Should Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of       Impropriety in All Activities. . . . A judge should respect       and comply with the law and should act at all times in a       manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and       impartiality of the judiciary.    It further explains in commentary:         An appearance of impropriety occurs when reasonable minds .       . . would conclude that the judge's honesty, integrity,       impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge is       impaired. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by       irresponsible or improper conduct by judges.    Canon 3 explains that ``a judge should be faithful to, and maintain  professional competence in, the law and should not be swayed by  partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism.''   We need to consider the rules and norms that argue against the kind  of intemperate behavior we saw from Judge Kavanaugh because of the  allegations brought against him by several sources, all of which  deserve a full and fair investigation by the FBI.   I was heartened to see Senators Flake and Coons both in agreement to  hold off on a floor vote for at least a week while the supplemental  background investigation can be completed to look into these  allegations. Since the agreement, questions have arisen about the exact  nature of that investigation. Is it limited? If so, how? Will all leads  be followed, or will the FBI be hamstrung in some way by instructions  from the White House?   In the ensuing firestorm, there has been a lot of debate about  whether the FBI investigation will be credible and professional and not  a perfunctory effort. There are some indications now that the FBI will  be allowed to do its job. I hope that will be the case. I expect the  FBI to exhaust all possible avenues of investigation that are relevant  as to whether Judge Kavanaugh had a pattern of drinking that resulted  [[Page S6408]]  in aggression and belligerence toward women.   Some have said that Judge Kavanaugh deserves the benefit of the doubt  and that unless Dr. Ford's account can be proven, he should be  confirmed, but that confuses the issue. No one is entitled to be on the  Supreme Court. The burden should be on Judge Kavanaugh to show he is  fit for the job.   Now the Republicans' hired gun prosecutor, whom they hid behind while  Dr. Ford was questioned, has published a memo in which she concludes  that she could not bring a case based on the evidence heard at the  second hearing. Frankly, this conclusion is meaningless. I am sure that  in her previous job as a specialist in sex crimes, she would never have  proceeded to a trial before an investigation, and she would not have  excluded key witnesses. There was no investigation. Key witnesses were  not called. I hope this is not the way she would prepare a case.   I have said many times that Democrats didn't need to manufacture  reasons to oppose Judge Kavanaugh's elevation to the Supreme Court.  Based on his record, his opinions and dissents, his academic writings,  and his speeches, I have concluded that he will not be a fair and  objective Justice of the Supreme Court. His views on reproductive  rights, Native rights, on legal protections for workers, consumers, and  the environment, not to mention his very broad views of Presidential  protections, are all of deep concern to me.   Now that we have heard Dr. Ford's account and have seen Judge  Kavanaugh's angry and combative reaction, it is evident that he should  not serve and should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court. We can do  better, and the American people deserve better.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
