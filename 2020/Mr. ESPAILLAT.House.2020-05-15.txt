 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of heroes.   $15 billion for transit agencies, including $3.8 billion for the MTA,  that is a good thing.   $2 billion for deep cleaning for public housing, such as NYCHA, that  is a good thing.   Another round of stimulus checks, $1,200, plus another $1,200 for  children, and the inclusion of taxpaying immigrants and their families,  that is a good thing.   $10 billion for additional grants for small business, that is a good  thing.   $7 billion for childcare, that is a good thing.   $2 billion to help employers provide hazard pay to essential workers,  like hospital workers, transit workers, supermarket workers, and  critical property service workers like janitors, security officers,  residential door persons, and others who are often overlooked but are  so crucial to keeping key buildings and facilities like the hundreds in  my district up and running, that is a good thing.   $100 billion for emergency rental assistance, that is an extremely  good thing. Help for New York State and New York City.   I rise in support of our heroes. This is a good thing.
