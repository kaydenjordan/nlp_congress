 Mr. President, the Senate is at a crossroads. Senate  Democrats at the behest of far-left activist groups are leading the  charge to break a 230-year-old precedent of confirming Supreme Court  nominees by a simple majority vote. Why?   Well, when you go down the list, there is only one reason. That  reason is not based on substance or reality; it is purely partisan.  Judge Gorsuch is eminently qualified. That does not seem to be in  dispute. His credentials are exceptional. His resume is impressive. His  judicial demeanor, professional competence, and integrity all exceed  what you expect in a nominee for the highest Court in the land.   Judge Gorsuch checks every box, so much so, that the American Bar  Association gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating. The ABA's  assessment, mind you, has been referred to by the minority leader as  the ``gold standard'' when it comes to evaluating a nominee's fitness  to serve on the Court. Senate Democrats must be concerned about Judge  Gorsuch's past then. Again, that is not the case. No one was able to  dig up anything remotely resembling a scandal in Judge Gorsuch's past  during this process. You can't manufacture a controversy where none  exists. Nothing about Judge Gorsuch has come to light during this  confirmation process that could conceivably merit blocking a vote on  the nominee.   I have heard some Democrats try and argue that Judge Gorsuch is out  of the mainstream. That hasn't stuck, either. This is a judge who has  been with the majority of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals 99 percent  of the time, and 97 percent of his decisions were unanimous. Judge  Gorsuch is about as mainstream as you are going to find.   Editorial boards from newspapers across the country, including USA  Today, have written in support of his nomination. Does anyone honestly  believe that USA Today, which is far from a conservative newspaper,  would support confirming Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court if he were  out of the mainstream?   Now Senate Democrats are seemingly creating new standards out of thin  air to justify this blatantly partisan action. According to the talking  points, the nominee is now expected to tell the Senate and the American  people exactly how he or she would rule on matters that may come before  the Court, especially the instances where the activist base has a very  keen interest. As the Judiciary chairman rightly pointed out, the  standards set by Justice Ginsburg in her confirmation hearings that it  would be inappropriate for a nominee to offer hints or make commitments  on matters that may come before the Court have been adhered to ever  since.   This leaves Senate Democrats with a filibuster that lacks a reason.  The minority leader has suggested that the Senate abandon Judge  Gorsuch's nomination if cloture is not agreed to and ask the President  to submit a new nominee. This demand rings hollow. Here is the truth:  If this nominee cannot get the Senate Democrats' blessings for a vote,  then no nominee put forward by the President can.   Again, we are talking about a top rung in his profession. Judge  Gorsuch is well qualified, and he was unanimously confirmed to the  Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. As I mentioned earlier, he received the  highest possible rating after an exhaustive evaluation from the  American Bar Association.   Senate Democrats failed to create outrage and controversy over Judge  Gorsuch's nomination because there is simply none to be found, but that  didn't stop them. They made this amazing 180-degree turnaround. Senate  Democrats who just last year pushed for an immediate vote at the height  of a contentious Presidential election now appear to be fine with  leaving that seat vacant literally for years. Just last year the  minority leader sounded the alarm about the judicial chaos a deadlocked  Court could lead to. He appears to be no longer concerned about that.  By this logic, a vacancy on the Supreme Court for a few months would be  a devastating blow to democracy, but one held vacant for years would be  acceptable. This makes absolutely no sense. The only explanation for it  is that Senate Democrats expect to be voting on a nominee put forth by  a Democratic administration, not one put forth by President Trump.   Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed to the Supreme Court this week. It is  unfortunate that we may have to break longstanding precedent to do so,  but Senate Democrats actually are to blame for that.
