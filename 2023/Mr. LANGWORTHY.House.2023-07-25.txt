 Madam Speaker, this week, in this great House, we are  set to consider this year's agriculture appropriations bill, a piece of  legislation that will impact not only our farmers but every American  across this great Nation.   This legislation put forward by my colleagues on the House  Appropriations Committee represents a critical step forward in  safeguarding our Nation's food and drug supply, supporting our farmers,  and ensuring that all Americans, including those in rural communities  and low-income families, have access to essential nutrition programs.   If we learned anything from the pandemic, it is that we should have a  strong domestic supply chain so that we aren't relying on foreign  countries for things like food and medication. This bill demonstrates  our commitment to strengthening our national security and food supply  by making strategic allocations for agricultural research, rural  broadband, and programs focused on animal and plant health.   These are not just budgetary allocations. They are investments in the  future of our Nation. By providing sufficient funds for a strong supply  chain and for safe food, drugs, and medical devices, we reaffirm our  dedication to the well-being of every American.   This legislation further protects our national security by ensuring  that agricultural land remains out of the hands of foreign adversaries,  such as Communist China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran, safeguarding our  national interests.   Our efforts to rein in wasteful spending and bureaucracy are  paramount. This bill would redirect funds from partisan bills, such as  the Inflation Reduction Act, and utilize them to support our producers  in our rural communities.   I personally met with dairy farmers, grape growers, and other  agricultural producers in my district to understand the unique  challenges faced by our farmers in our rural communities.   I am proud to support this year's agricultural appropriations  legislation and to demonstrate our commitment to our hardworking  farmers, rural communities, and all Americans who rely on a safe and  secure food and drug supply.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand together in support of  this critical legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we must never forget the debt of  gratitude we owe to our Nation's heroes.   This year's Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies appropriations bill does just that.   First and foremost, this bill ensures that veterans' healthcare  programs receive full funding. We have an obligation to provide them  with the best medical care and support they deserve without compromise.   This initiative also aims to make the VA more efficient, which will  give our  [[Page H3906]]  veterans improved access to the care and resources they need to lead  fulfilling lives after their service.   Beyond funding, we recognize the need to address the challenges our  veterans face as they transition back to civilian life. Our focus  remains on preserving and strengthening programs that assist veterans  in finding meaningful employment, educational opportunities, and mental  health support.   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to  show our veterans the same unwavering dedication that they have shown  to us.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4368, the agricultural  appropriations bill, which includes funding to combat the spotted  lanternfly invasion in the Northeastern United States of America.   This provision invests $19 million to protect our farmers, safeguard  our crops, and preserve the future of our agricultural communities from  the devastating effects of this pest. The spotted lanternfly, native of  Asia, has proven to be an aggressive and destructive pest that  threatens our specialty crops, including grapes and apples, in areas  like western New York and the Southern Tier of New York that I  represent.   This invasive species also puts thousands of agricultural jobs at  risk. We owe it to our farmers to ensure that their hard work, their  dedication, their blood, their sweat, their tears is not in vain due to  a destructive pest.   By investing in research and development of creative solutions, we  can find effective strategies to combat the spotted lanternfly and save  our agricultural economy from a potential disaster.   I am proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in  addressing this pest, and encourage the rest of my colleagues to  support the fiscal year 2023 agricultural appropriations bill to help  protect our farms, our crops, and our agricultural heritage.
