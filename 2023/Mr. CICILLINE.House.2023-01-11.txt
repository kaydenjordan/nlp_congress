 Madam Speaker, I unequivocally condemn all acts of  violence, vandalism, and destruction of property. However, these acts  are not all the same.   Graffiti on the side of a building is not comparable to the stalking  of doctors and nurses and the assaulting of patients who try to access  healthcare.   Yet, 38 of the 39 incidents listed in this resolution concern attacks  on property, not people.   In fact, the lone act of assault mentioned in this resolution took  place when an individual targeted a healthcare facility for providing  abortions and then attacked police officers, striking them multiple  times.   So, yes, the only threat to human life mentioned in this resolution  was an attack on abortion providers and on patients who are seeking  care and the law enforcement officers defending their right to provide  and seek such care.   Today, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join me  in condemning the countless acts of violence against abortion providers  and patients that they face every single day accessing care in this  country.                            ____________________
