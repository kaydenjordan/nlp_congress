 Mr. Speaker, tonight I want to discuss the importance of  NATO to our Nation and to Europe.   In 1949, the United States and 11 other countries created NATO.  Today, 29 countries make up this alliance.   At the heart of NATO is article 5, which says that an attack on one  ally is attack on all allies.   On September 12, 2001, for the first time ever, article 5 was  invoked. 9/11, an attack on America, was an attack on all.   Most recently, the country of Montenegro joined the NATO Alliance.  And last week, sadly, the President expressed doubt that the U.S.  should come to Montenegro's defense. This is disturbing.   The only time article 5 has been invoked has been for America. When  our Nation was at its most vulnerable point, NATO stepped up and had  our back. We must uphold our commitment to this critical alliance.                            ____________________
