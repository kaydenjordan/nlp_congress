 Mr. President, I rise to recognize an excellent  member of my staff, Melissa Bonine, who is moving on to a new  challenge. For the past year, Melissa has coordinated daily operations  in my office, helping to create order out of the chaos of my schedules.   Having worked for Congressman Rick Boucher, Senator Jim Webb, and  Secretary Castro at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  Melissa has many friends on Capitol Hill, and she was an immediate  asset to my office. With a cool head under pressure and excellent  diplomatic skills, Melissa has kept the trains running on time and put  out the occasional fire. She has worked with the rest of my staff to  manage priorities and coordinate each day efficiently while assisting  in long-term planning.   Our entire team will miss her counsel and sense of humor. I am sure  she will make a tremendous impact on her next project, an exciting new  advocacy group where she will continue to fight for progressive values.  I hope her new job will also give her some more time with her husband,  David, daughter, Penny, and cats, Rex and Willie Nelson, and I look  forward to hearing about the extraordinary work she does next.                            ____________________
