 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  accomplishments of Dr. I.M. Singer, one of America's most influential  mathematicians.   The son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, Dr. Singer had an unquenchable  thirst for knowledge and graduated from the University of Michigan with  a degree in physics in just 2\1/2\ years before joining the United  States military during World War II.   Upon returning, Dr. Singer earned a doctorate degree in mathematics  from the University of Chicago. Later, he chaired committees at the  United States National Academy of Sciences, was a member of the White  House Science Council, and cofounded the Mathematical Sciences Research  Institute in Berkeley.   Dr. Singer's most prominent contribution was the Atiyah-Singer index  theorem, which created a link between mathematical analysis and  topology and, ultimately, led to a new field of mathematics. For his  work, Dr. Singer received the most prestigious award in mathematics,  the Abel Prize.   As a fellow mathematician, I deeply admire Dr. Singer's contributions  to theoretical physics and mathematics, which have revolutionized the  way we understand the universe.                            ____________________
