 Mr. President, I would like to reflect on my trip to  Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change  Conference. I was fortunate to have 18 Senate colleagues join me to  bolster President Biden's agenda and the United States' leadership role  on the world stage.   Six years ago, I had the privilege of leading a congressional  delegation to COP21, which produced the Paris Agreement in 2015.  Countries from all across the globe collectively agreed that the  threats and effects of climate change were too damaging to ignore.  Unfortunately, the previous administration's fraught decision to  withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement jeopardized our  credibility.   The global effort suffered another setback last year, when the UN  Climate Change Conference was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic  and it was not safe to gather. These major setbacks were costly, but  this time, we went to Glasgow resolved to make up for lost time. One of  President Biden's first actions when he took the oath of office was to  rejoin the Paris Agreement. Since then, President Biden has brought the  United States back to the negotiating table and made unprecedented  commitments and investments to tackle the climate crisis.   The overarching goal of this year's UN climate conference was to  rally countries toward action that would reduce emissions enough to  keep the goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius  within reach.   Without a doubt, Glasgow raised ambition. Ninety percent of the  world's GDP now has net zero commitments, and 154 countries put forward  new climate action plans to cut emissions. The Glasgow Climate Pact  established a clear consensus that all nations need to do much more,  immediately, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.   In April, President Biden announced our Nationally Determined  Commitment--NDC--will target reducing emissions by 50-52 percent by  2030, compared to 2005 level, consistent with achieving net zero  greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050. The combined impact of  the Senate's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that President  Biden signed into law on Monday and the Build Back Better Act framework  announced last month will put U.S. emissions on a path to meeting the  new target. The target is consistent with President Biden's goal of  achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050 and  of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Time is not slowing  down. According to NOAA, last month was the fourth warmest October in  142 years of recorded measurements.   Scientists have sounded the alarm that, if we fail to act a  catastrophic rise in global temperatures will result, and some of the  changes in the climate will be irreversible. Recognizing the urgency,  the Glasgow Decision asks world leaders to submit stronger NDCs to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the end of next year, instead of in  2025. It would be the first time nations offer new emissions pledges 2  years in a row, in 2021 and 2022. Although there were qualifiers, the  express mention of fossil fuels in the text of the Glasgow Decision is  notable since prior negotiations have referred to warming and emissions  rather than the source of that pollution, most of which comes from  coal, oil, and gas.   COP26 marks a significant step forward in our global resolve, and the  commitment to reduce private sector global carbon emissions by  significant amounts is especially noteworthy. But there is more work to  do. As Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry remarked in  his closing press conference, a gap remains. Even if we implement all  our renewed commitments, we are now on track for somewhere between 1.8  and 2.4 degrees of warming. I do not take this as a sign of failure;  however, the COP26 outcome was never the goal, nor is it the end. If  anything, COP26 marks the end of the beginning in which we now know  that the Paris Agreement is durable and, in fact, provides a reliable  framework and set of processes for the world to center its cooperative  efforts.   The story of Glasgow isn't just about the National Determined  Commitments--NDCs. There was also greater attention paid to adaptation.  The Adaptation Fund received $356 million in new support from  contributing national and regional governments, including our first  ever U.S. contribution of $50 million. Pledges nearly tripled the  fund's 2021 resource mobilization goal of $120 million for climate  change adaptation and resilience projects and programs in developing  countries.   Ahead of the dialogue, President Biden announced the launch of the  President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience--PREPARE--a  whole-of-government initiative that will serve as the cornerstone of  the Federal Government response to the increasing impacts of the global  climate crisis on vulnerable communities worldwide. Resources are a  pillar of the plan, which calls for $3 billion in adaptation finance  annually by fiscal year  [[Page S8759]]  2024, the largest U.S. commitment ever made to build capacity in  developing countries to adapt to and manage the impacts of climate  change by 2030.   Congress must meet the moment and deliver robust appropriations for  adaptation finance. As one of the wealthiest and most developed  countries, we have a moral obligation to act. We cannot back away from  our promises, as acting on climate is a matter of life or death.   COP26 succeeded in renewing developed countries' climate finance  commitments and helped catalyze increased private sector climate  finance commitments at levels never seen before. Climate finance refers  to the local, national, or transnational financing that supports  mitigation and adaptation actions to address climate change. In 2009,  parties with more resources collectively committed to unlock $100  billion per year from public and private sources between 2020 and 2025  to support those that are less resourced and more vulnerable cut their  emissions and adapt to climate impacts. A report by Germany and Canada  commissioned by the U.K., the host of this year's COP, found that  developed countries are not set to meet the climate finance target  until 2023--3 years late.   In April, President Biden said the U.S. would double its contribution  to $5.7 billion, and in his first speech to the United Nations as  President, he pledged in September to ``double that number again,''  bringing the Nation's commitment to $11.4 billion per year by 2024.  Consistent, strong support for the U.S. contribution to the Green  Climate Fund--GCF--is indispensable in financing global endeavors to  achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. U.S. contributions to the GCF  and other multilateral and bilateral partnerships have the potential to  mobilize additional public and private sector funds, highly leveraging  the impact of our investments.   As Congress works to pass transformative legislation for a clean  domestic economy, COP26 provided a chance for the United States and our  global partners to reevaluate and negotiate new objectives, strategies,  and commitments to tackle climate change through various lenses.   Each day of the climate conference explored a new theme. Our  delegation had the opportunity to attend the entirety of ``Nature  Day.'' Agriculture, forestry, and other land use account for nearly  one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. They also support  global food security and millions of jobs. At the same time, ecosystems  protect us; healthy forests absorb emissions, and wetlands defend our  coastlines against storm surges. On November 6, 26 nations committed to  sustainable farming policies, such as reducing low carbon practices  that would in turn scale back emissions and prevent unnecessary  pollution.   At home, the Build Back Better Act will provide major financial  support to farmers and ranchers who adopt ``climate smart agriculture  and forestry'' practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and  sequester additional carbon stocks in soils and vegetation. The  delegation met with a range of foreign officials and civil society  leaders, received a briefing from Secretary John Kerry, conducted a  side event at the U.S. Center on Congress' climate agenda--in which  nine Senators participated--and held a press conference at the COP site  to share our views with the public.   That same day, U.S. Agency for International Development--USAID-- Administrator Samantha Power and the Rockefeller Foundation signed a  memorandum of understanding forming the basis of a strategic  partnership between USAID, Power Africa, and the newly launched Global  Energy Alliance for People and Planet.   Senator Coons and I were honored to give remarks during the official  signing ceremony in the Sustainable Development Goal 7--SDG7--Pavilion  as original sponsors of the Electrify Africa Act of 2015. The  partnerships will advance the goals of ending energy poverty in Africa,  combating climate change, and strengthening the enabling environment  for clean energy.   Alongside the events marking Nature Day, our trip marked the end of  Week One of COP26, with negotiations gathering pace and work focusing  on Week Two. After our delegation departed, the parties completed the  Rulebook, after 6 years of discussions. These guidelines to implement  the Paris Agreement rules include transparency rules to report on  emissions and measure our collective progress toward achievement of  NDCs.   After more than 5 years and with the processes mostly in place, the  global community is clearly committed to tackling the climate crisis.  We must now enter the next phase with a laserlike focus on  implementation of the agreement wherein we meet our commitments through  urgent and ambitious action.   I wish to applaud my colleagues for joining the delegation to Glasgow  and beyond and thank Senate Democratic leadership for recognizing and  supporting our work abroad. COP26 put us on a clear path with discrete  steps to achieve our 2030 goals and set a much closer course to  achieving a clean economy with net zero emissions by mid-century. I  urge the U.S. Senate to turn the ambition achieved at COP26 into action  in this decisive decade.                            ____________________
