 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to lay bare the calamity that  is the shutdown. From phones ringing off the hook, to folks I talked to  at my townhall meeting on Monday, we have heard from far too many of  our fellow citizens struggling because of government inaction.   Take the Coast Guard, who I met with in Saugerties last Friday. They  are providing an invaluable service to our community up and down the  Hudson River, not only search and rescue, but ice cutting, which is  critical to our local economy.   They are out there working in the freezing cold and not being paid.  This is the first time in history U.S. Armed Forces servicemembers are  not being paid during a lapse in government funding.   I repeat: Because of the shutdown, members of the U.S. military are  working without pay.   Government dysfunction of any kind is not good for the well-being of  our democratic order. We are now approaching levels of dysfunction that  ought not be tolerable for anyone who cares to preserve the dignity of  our citizenry. We must open the government now.                            ____________________
