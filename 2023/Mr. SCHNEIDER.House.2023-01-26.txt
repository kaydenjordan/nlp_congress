 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No.  131.    Mr. Chairman, the Great Lakes are a national treasure  and a regional economic driver for all of us in the Midwest. The lakes  account for more than 90 percent of our Nation's surface water and 20  percent of the surface freshwater on the planet. More than 30 million  Americans rely on the Great Lakes for their drinking water.   For generations, there has been a deeply held bipartisan consensus on  the need to protect the Great Lakes: from invasive species, from  environmental challenges, and from irresponsible development. Look no  further than the broad bipartisan support for the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative.   I want to work with my colleagues in making progress to protect our  Great Lakes, not to open the door--even the slightest crack--for  dangerous development. That is why today I offer an amendment to  clearly reiterate our vital protections of these Great Lakes.   My amendment ensures that H.R. 21 would continue the bipartisan  consensus that there will be no exploration, development, or drilling  for oil and gas in the Great Lakes.   With nearly 1 in 10 Americans relying on the Great Lakes for drinking  water, we must ensure that a disaster like the Deepwater Horizon ever  happening in Lake Michigan is not only unfathomable, but impossible.  This amendment ensures that that is the case.   Today, we must say with one unified bipartisan voice that there will  never be drilling in the Great Lakes.  [[Page H412]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
