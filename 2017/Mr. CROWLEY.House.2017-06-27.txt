 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding me this time.   I also want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the  Natural Resources Committee here in the House of Representatives for  moving this bill and helping to put this bill on the floor today in a  bipartisan spirit. I would also like to acknowledge the majority and  minority staff who have been very helpful to my office in this effort.   True, this is not the first time this measure has been considered. It  passed the House during the last Congress, but the session ended before  it could be moved forward in the Senate and into law. It was then, as  it is now, a bipartisan bill. I would like to acknowledge all of the  Members who are cosponsors. In substance, the bill would, as has been  said, name a small parcel of the land in Washington, D.C., as Robert  Emmet Park.   Emmet was honored by the United States over 100 years ago when a  statue of his likeness was donated to the Smithsonian Institution. That  statue was welcomed by no less than President Woodrow Wilson himself.   After 50 years, the museum moved the statue to the land where it  rests now, an unnamed parcel of land. The rededication committee  counted many key leaders, including then-Speaker of the House John  McCormack, Senator Everett Dirksen, and Senator Mike Mansfield. Even  President Lyndon Johnson conveyed his pride in Emmet, stating: ``We  Americans are proud to accord a place of honor here in the Nation's  Capital to Robert Emmet, whose struggles and sacrifices bespeak the  yearnings of mankind throughout the ages.''  [[Page H5206]]    So it is clear that, on a bipartisan basis, Congress has long  recognized the significance of this statue and its role in keeping  alive not only the memory of Robert Emmet, but the ideals for which he  stood.   At present, the statue of Emmet is the only statue on this small  piece of land. This bill would take the next logical step by naming the  land for Emmet. It is a fitting tribute since, for generations, many  American schoolchildren learned the words of Emmet's famous speech,  which became known as the ``Speech from the Dock.''   I often wonder what Abraham Lincoln was taught as a boy. We all  learned the Gettysburg Address, but, in fact, Abraham Lincoln could  recite the ``Speech from the Dock'' by memory. It couldn't have been an  easy speech for Emmet to give when one considers that he was expected  to be executed after giving that speech.   Emmet had been an Irish independence leader who was deeply influenced  by George Washington and the struggle for American independence. He was  inspired by the American fight for democracy and self-determination.  But after a failed effort to achieve independence, he was captured by  the British, as were many others over centuries of struggle.   In his speech, Emmet said:         Let no man write my epitaph; for as no man who knows my       motives dare now vindicate them, let not prejudice or       ignorance asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and       peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in       oblivion, until other times and other men can do justice to       my character. When my country takes her place among the       nations of the Earth, then, and not till then, let my       epitaph be written.    Shortly after giving that speech on September 20, 1803, Robert Emmet  was hanged, drawn, and quartered. But Emmet's words lived on. In fact,  groups named the Emmet Monument Association were founded in the United  States. Their stated purpose was to build a burial monument to Emmet,  one that would, of course, include an epitaph.   But because Emmet called for Ireland to be free before his epitaph  was written, these groups were actually Fenian freedom organizations.  They and other American groups were quite active in the United States  for many years all across our Nation. They came before subsequent  American roles in the struggle for Irish independence, and their  presence played a major role in American political life for many  decades.   So I respectfully urge the passage of this bill. It does not require  spending funds, and it does not alter the park or the park system. It  would basically include the name Robert Emmet Park to a small piece of  land where the Emmet statue rests.   Many Americans, as well as our government, have long recognized the  significance of the park and statue in keeping alive not just the  history of Robert Emmet, but what he stood for. I am glad that  continues today.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again thank the majority and the  minority members of the Natural Resources Committee as well as their  staffs. Their support made it possible for this measure to once again  be on the floor today.   I would like to thank the hardworking staffs of the Smithsonian  Institution and the National Park Service who have taken care of the  Emmet statue and park for these many, many years.
