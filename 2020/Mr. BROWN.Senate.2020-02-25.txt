 Madam President, I rise to express my appreciation for the  work of Securities and Exchange Commission: Robert J. Jackson, Jr.  Commissioner Jackson stepped down earlier this month from the SEC,  having served with distinction since December 2017. He returns to  teaching, having made many valuable contributions to policy debates at  the SEC and beyond.   Mr. Jackson is no stranger to public service. Prior to his work at  the SEC, he served in the Treasury Department as the Nation emerged  from the financial crisis. Mr. Jackson has led by example, working  diligently to ensure the SEC fulfills its three-part mission,  particularly the protection of investors in an increasingly complex  marketplace. As an outspoken voice on behalf of investors, Mr. Jackson  stressed the importance of clear and sensible rules that put investors  first, combined with a pragmatic understanding of how markets work.   Mr. Jackson brought a law professor's analytical approach to his  responsibilities as a Commissioner. His careful and thoughtful work  digging through data, developing original research, and presenting it  in a clear and insightful manner provided the SEC and other  policymakers with critical information and a valuable perspective with  which to consider some of the most difficult questions in securities  laws.   Over the years, Commissioner Jackson has been a leader on the issue  of corporate political spending disclosure. He has helped to focus the  conversation on how to think about reasonable and material disclosure  as our political system has become awash in dark money. Similarly, Mr.  Jackson's study of trends in stock buybacks and the potential for abuse  by corporate executives raised many issues that merit additional  consideration by regulators and lawmakers.   I would like to lead my colleagues in wishing Mr. Jackson the best of  luck as he returns to academia. I expect that he will continue his  insightful research and scholarship to benefit investors and make  markets more efficient. The SEC benefited from Commissioner Jackson's  tenure, and we know his students will benefit, too.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I rise to honor Kimberly Hazelgrove  for her service and sacrifices for our country and her successful  efforts to advocate for families like her own who lost loved ones  serving our Nation.   Kimberly Hazelgrove is a former sergeant first class in the U.S.  Army. In 2004, her husband, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Brian Hazelgrove  was killed in a helicopter crash near Mosul, Iraq. That loss was  devastating enough, but after his death, Ms. Hazelgrove also lost the  military benefits her family earned serving the United States and that  she needed to support her family. They lost those benefits because of a  1970s-era law that causes Gold Star families to lose out on financial  benefits that their spouses paid into and earned.   For 16 years, Ms. Hazelgrove advocated on Capitol Hill for the repeal  of that law, the Survivor Benefit Plan-Disability and Indemnity  Compensation offset, while raising her family as a single mother. She  said, ``I was angry . . . Very angry for the inequities that I was  seeing, not only for myself, but for a lot of my friends going through  it and it just lit a fire, and I found a stronger voice than I had  before.''   My office and I met with Ms. Hazelgrove and took up her cause. Gold  Star families like hers have sacrificed so much for this country and  nothing should get in the way of providing them with benefits that they  have paid into and earned. We worked together with colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to write legislation that will fix this, and this  past December, because she never gave up, we got it done. We passed a  fix in the Senate, and the President signed it into law. Because of Ms.  Hazelgrove's perseverance and strong advocacy, 67,000 military spouses  will now get the benefits they have earned to support themselves and  their families.   Thank you, Kimberly, for raising your voice and for all the work you  do to fight for fellow Gold Star families. I am sure my Senate  colleagues will join me in honoring Ms. Kimberly Hazelgrove for her  exemplary efforts.                            ____________________
