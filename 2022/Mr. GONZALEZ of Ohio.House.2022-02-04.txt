 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our  bipartisan amendment that includes both the JOBS Act and the College  Transparency Act.   Since I first ran for Congress, the number one issue that I hear in  my district from employers is the lack of good quality candidates for  good-paying jobs. From those days, I set out to try to find a way to  close this skills gap and provide more opportunities for our local  businesses and workforce. The JOBS Act does just that.   The JOBS Act expands Pell grant eligibility to qualified short-term  programs in high-demand jobs. This will help Americans access these  programs and learn critical skills that lead to these good-paying jobs.  This will be a collaborative process with our States working with local  employers and community colleges to make sure that only quality  programs that lead to wage increases qualify to make sure that  Americans can find jobs after completion of these programs.   On my way in this morning, I was actually speaking to an employer in  my district, and I ran through the bill with him. And I said, what do  you think of this? Would this help you? And his immediate response was,  I have over 15 truck drivers that I am trying to hire, and I can't find  anybody.   These are the types of programs that the JOBS Act will enable. This  is why I think it is a commonsense--and I am thrilled to say-- bipartisan component of the bill, and I hope that everybody will  consider supporting it.
