 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this that I am proposing today would be  the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send  it back to committee.   If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended, and this amendment would offer a more targeted approach to  improve FDA's expanded access program that allows patients access to  experimental drugs that can possibly save their lives, which is the  goal of all of us.                                time  1645    The FDA ensures that expanded access requests are safe, and it  approves nearly 100 percent of all the requests that are made, and most  in a matter of hours, if necessary.   The right-to-try legislation we are considering today presents a huge  risk to patients and is much worse than the House bill we passed in  March, as our ranking member explained.   If this bill is so good, why are 104 patient groups--these are the  groups that represent the sick and dying people--opposed? And PhRMA,  the big pharmaceutical companies, are not supportive because this gives  open license to snake oil salesmen.   This bill exposes far more patients to serious risks through a  dangerous and unnecessary pathway for experimental treatment.   FDA Commissioner Gottlieb noted this legislation is not limited to  patients with terminal illness anymore: ``We are certainly going to be  exposing patients with potentially less severe conditions to a risk.''   It is troubling that, in some States, patients using an  investigational drug can lose their hospice coverage and, in other  States, that they can be denied home care. These are the very people  who need this care.   Why should we put more patients at risk when the current process does  work? FDA already approves, as I said, nearly 100 percent of the  requests for experimental therapies through the expanded access  program. If a person is denied treatment, it is because the  manufacturer will not provide it. It also isn't going about giving the  terminally ill hope.   If that were true, then why would these 104 patient groups, including  the American Cancer Society, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the  Vietnam Veterans of America also oppose this bill?   The main reason that this bill is being pushed is to remove FDA  oversight of the safety and effectiveness of our drugs. It allows  manufacturers to serve as the gatekeeper and protector of patients. It  opens the door for bad actors to prey on people desperate to save their  lives or the lives of their children.   Imagine if someone like Martin Shkreli, the infamous pharmaceutical  bad actor, promised a cure to save a child's life provided that the  parents pay whatever price he might charge, under this bill, FDA would  play no role in determining if that drug were safe and effective.   Bad actors do exist, and this Republican bill gives them the  opportunity to prey on desperate people who are looking for any  treatment that might help to save their lives.   Unlike S. 204, this motion to recommit is not based on the false  premise that the FDA approval is a barrier to investigational  treatments; rather, it provides clarification of the liability and how  FDA will utilize clinical outcomes.   With this motion to recommit, the FDA would provide manufacturers  guidance to clarify how FDA will consider clinical outcomes associated  with treatments under expanded access when making a decision about  whether or not the drug should be granted full approval. It also  provides transparency as to how many patients are making expanded  access requests and how often these requests are granted or denied by  the FDA and manufacturers. It also offers to provide manufacturers or  sponsors liability protection if they comply with the requirements of  the expanded access program.   I believe that these legislative fixes facilitate patient accessing  of experimental treatments while ensuring critical FDA oversight to  protect public health.   In conclusion, patients already have the right to try. Rather than  creating an unnecessary pathway that puts patients at risk by allowing  the sale of  [[Page H4365]]  snake oil, I would urge my colleagues to join the over 100 patient  groups, organizations that care about their neighbors and their friends  and people who have these diseases, in support of the expanded access  program.   These targeted improvements are one way to achieve that goal, so I  urge my colleagues to support my motion to recommit and oppose the  dangerous Republican proposal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
