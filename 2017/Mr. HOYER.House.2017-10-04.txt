 Mr. Chairman, the Budget Act, adopted in 1974, requires  that the House complete work on its budget for the next fiscal year by  April 15. That is 172 days ago.   Yet we now have a budget resolution on the floor, already into the  fiscal year for which the budget supposedly is planned. Some may ask  why. The answer is a simple one.   This is, first of all, not a realistic budget which could or should  stand as a budget resolution. No, this budget is not about putting our  country on a sustainable fiscal path, and--this is indisputable--it is  not a budget to inform the appropriators of budget priorities and  constraints.   No, the Appropriations Committee will not be informed. Why? Because  we have already passed the appropriations bills. This budget doesn't  have anything to do with the appropriation bills. They are passed. they  are gone. They are in the Senate.   This is merely a vehicle for achieving partisan tax reform of the  kind that President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress outlined  last week. Despite what this sham of a budget pretends, their plan is  to push through tax changes that massively increase deficits--I call it  the granddaddy of all debt increases--while shifting even more wealth  from middle class and  [[Page H7783]]  working families to people like Donald Trump.   According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, 80 percent of the tax  cuts in this proposal would go only to those who make over $900,000 a  year. Hear me. The tax cuts mainly go to those making, in this Nation,  over $900,000 per year.   Despite promises from President Trump and Republicans here in the  House, their plan actually raises taxes--hear me--while cutting taxes  on those over $900,000, it actually raises taxes on 1 in 3 middle class  families who earn between $50,000 and $150,000.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Even though Republicans continue to assert the discredited  supply-side mantra that tax cuts pay for themselves, no responsible  economist believes that, not one--responsible is the operative word.  The Tax Policy Center's analysis found that their tax cuts would add  $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.   The previous speaker said this balances the budget in 9 years. That  is Alice in Wonderland balance. It will never happen. I have been here  for 36 years; I have heard those comments all the time. It never  happened.   But it is even worse, Mr. Chairman. The budget resolution also  proposes to disinvest in job creation, pretends Republicans were able  to repeal the Affordable Care Act--it hasn't been repealed, yet they  pretend it has been repealed--to kick 23 million off their coverage and  make those with preexisting conditions uninsurable.   It guts Medicaid and would end the Medicaid guarantee.   Furthermore, it would severely cut programs that reduce poverty and  provide the kind of job training proven to get more people back into  the workforce.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.    This resolution is a grab bag of all the worst Republican  policies: partisan tax cuts for the wealthy that leave the middle class  behind, the cruelty of TrumpCare, and draconian reductions in domestic  investment. The product is just as bad as the sum of its parts; indeed,  it is worse.   Instead, we ought to be working together to enact bipartisan tax  reform that is fiscally responsible and focused on the middle class.   I urge my colleagues to defeat this resolution, and I ask  Republicans, who believe that tax reform must be permanent and,  therefore, bipartisan, to join us in doing so.   Only one person can stop spending; that is the President of the  United States. He can veto spending bills.   The debt under Ronald Reagan increased 189 percent. Under Bush I, 55  percent; he had 4 years. Under Clinton, 37 percent; under Bush II, 86  percent; and under Obama, who was dealing with the deepest recession of  our lifetimes, 87 percent.   A budget is supposed to inform the Appropriations Committee of how it  ought to proceed. This budget comes after the fact, and it is only for  tax cuts for the wealthy.                                time  1500
