 Mr. Speaker, I ask all of you to join me in praying for  Eric Morgan. Eric Morgan is a constituent of mine in Arizona, and he  also served as the former Republican chairman for the legislative  district in my congressional district.   On April 5th, Eric was involved in a very serious motorcycle  accident. They thought he was going to die. Fortunately, with the help  of the doctors and nurses and multiple surgeries, he has now been  released out of the critical care unit in a hospital in Arizona, but he  has a long road for recovery.   Mr. Speaker, the prayers have helped Eric and his wife, Heather, and  their family. I want Eric and Heather to know that all of us here in  the U.S. House of Representatives and the people in the gallery are  praying for Eric's total and complete healing.                            ____________________
