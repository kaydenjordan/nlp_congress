 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Whitesboro Police  Officer Kevin Crossley. Officer Crossley tragically lost his life on  Wednesday night in a car accident while on patrol in his hometown in  the village of Whitesboro in Oneida County, New York.   He was a 7-year member of the Whitesboro Police Department, after  being hired full time in 2011, while first serving there as an intern.  He also worked part time as an officer for the Whitestown Police  Department, and previously served in the Whitestown Fire Department.   Growing up in Whitesboro, Officer Crossley knew almost everyone in  the village. The community loved and trusted him. His whole life's  dream was to protect and serve the community and its residents. He  arrived at work every day with a smile on his face and a positive  attitude.   Through numerous local and county police salutes, community  processions, and testimonials from friends and family, it is clear how  much Officer Crossley was beloved by his colleagues and our entire  community. Officer Crossley's service, dedication, and love for our  community was unparalleled, and we cannot thank him enough for his  honorable service.   Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to  ensure the safety of our families and our communities. We are eternally  grateful for their dedication and service to our Nation.   Officer Kevin Crossley is a hero, and the village of Whitesboro and  all of us were blessed by his honorable service to us. We offer our  deepest condolences to his family and friends and colleagues on the  loss of a dear friend and a wonderful community servant.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Zeldin) for hosting tonight's really important Special Order.   I might just add, as a side note, that Mr. Zeldin and I are very  aware of corruption firsthand; I, as a former member of the Assembly,  and him as a former member of the New York State Senate. Today is  actually the day of former speaker Sheldon Silver's second trial. He is  being tried for corruption in New York, so we know what it is like to  fight the good fight on that.   But I want to just highlight why it is so important and why I agreed  to sign on to Mr. Zeldin's letter appointing a second special counsel.  Recent evidence has emerged raising serious concerns about decisions  and activities at the Department of Justice, the DOJ, and the FBI  regarding FISA abuse.   I keep saying FISA, but for everyone, so they should know, it is the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and it is why the Clinton probe  ended and why the Trump Russia probe began. It appears that, for  political gain, key Federal employees at the FBI and the Department of  Justice deliberately misled our FISA courts and pursued a partisan  political agenda.   The FISA memo detailing these abuses of power stated: ``Top Obama  administration officials knowingly used unverified information paid for  by the Hillary Clinton campaign, some of which came from Russian  intelligence, in a secret court document to justify a  counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign during the 2016  Presidential election. This corrupt process was later the basis for a  campaign to sabotage the incoming Trump administration and to fuel a  witch hunt against the President.''   The American people deserve to know if our government is misusing  powerful surveillance methods to exact political revenge, especially if  it is before a FISA court. This behavior by those entrusted to  impartially serve the public threatens to the core the integrity and  vibrancy of our constitutional republic.   The American people are starting to get it. A recent Harvard CAPS- Harris Poll survey concluded that 67 percent of Americans support a  second special counsel; 75 percent of those are Republicans, 60 percent  are Democrats, and 69 percent are independents. This is a significant  majority of Americans ranging from all sides of the political spectrum.   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I stand alongside my distinguished colleagues  to encourage Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a second special  counsel. Simply appointing Attorney John Huber to lead an internal  Justice Department review of Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a step  in the right direction, but I don't believe it is far enough.   The American people deserve nothing less than full transparency.  Working alongside congressional leaders, I will continue to fight to  ensure these serious matters are investigated, and encourage  investigations where necessary to restore the public trust.   We must demand accountability across the board. It is the only way we  are going to restore public trust in our institutions of government and  to restore the rule of law and order in our communities.   I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue as a member of  the Financial Services Committee, but also, importantly, as a member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, and also serving honorably as a  distinguished member of our Armed Forces in the Army.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Joe Wilson. He has been  a terrific mentor for me, and I am grateful for his allowing me to  recognize this really important experience.   As we are remembering, there is a really important person in my life  who has inspired me in many of the things that I do, and her name was  Helen Sperling. She was born in 1920. She is a Holocaust survivor. She  survived a Nazi death camp.   She was actually liberated on April 18, 1945--just a couple of days  away from that anniversary date. She had to be hospitalized in Germany  for 3 years before she was finally able to immigrate to the United  States with, eventually, her husband, who was also a Nazi survivor.   But Helen was a special person, and she was someone whom I got to  know. As Congressman Gohmert just mentioned, as a student in New  Hartford, New York, she was a resident of our town, and a very tiny  woman, wonderfully positive and very excitable and really just a warm  person.   I was a seventh grade student, and she came and spoke to our class  about the Holocaust and explained to us the horrors of what happened to  her and her family in Nazi Germany, and it was just so impactful. Helen  basically spent her life telling this story.   As Congressman Gohmert alluded to a moment ago, this wonderful  person--one day, my son, 30 years later, came back from seventh grade  and said: Mom, I met this incredible woman. She spoke in my class, and  she told us all about the Holocaust and the horrors that occurred  there, where the Jewish people were annihilated and killed and murdered  in millions, and she told us her story. And at the end of the story, I  asked her if I could hug her, and she said of course.   He said he was so moved by her as well. And I just turned to him, and  I said: Oh, my God, Helen Sperling is back. She is still talking about  it.   Helen, sadly, died a couple of years ago, and we gave honor and  tribute to her as my constituent when I was a member of the New York  State Assembly.   But also, I got to meet Helen on a number of occasions afterwards.  She was wonderful in speaking to Boys State, you know, the American  Legion's hosted events.   I just want to read a little bit from Helen's obituary, because I  think it is really important to understand this woman who survived this  and really devoted her entire life to educating children and people. I  just want to read a little bit from this, and here is where it started  from her obituary from 2 years ago.   ``The anguish of the Holocaust scarred Helen for life, and she tried  to turn her pain into a positive instrument for education. In March  1967, the Annual Holocaust Lecture series was begun, and it was later  named for Helen and Leon,'' her late husband. ``This annual program,  endowed by the Sperlings, will continue to provide Holocaust education  for many generations to come.''   That was a dream of Helen's.   ``From 1968 until her death, Helen had shared her life and her  Holocaust experiences with tens of thousands of people, lecturing  tirelessly at schools, colleges, churches, prisons, and clubs, in the  fervent hope that both young people and adults would remember, learn,  and build a better, more peaceful world. She will always be remembered  by her challenge to `Never Be A Bystander.'   ``Helen believed that the worst part of being in the concentration  camps was the feeling of being powerless. She tried to teach people  never to abuse power and to protect those who could not protect  themselves.   ``As a result of the mutual love and respect between Helen and the  generations of audiences that have heard her, Clinton and New Hartford  Senior High Schools,'' in my district--and New Hartford Senior High  School, which is my alma mater--``have each developed scholarship  awards in her name to honor those seniors who exhibit the character  that Helen believed would help make a better, more humane, and peaceful  world.   ``These scholarships, as well as the many other tangible gifts given  by `her schools,' in her honor, touched Helen deeply. She was moved and  grateful for the hundreds of lilacs planted by her friends and students  in memory of her father.''   The lilacs were her symbol.   But I also want to mention something really important about Helen. I  got to meet her, and actually one of the last times I got to speak with  her was we were speaking together at Boys State in my district in 2012  and she got a little modern. One of the things she was handing out to  the young men who were at Boys State learning how to potentially be  serving our Nation as members of our military or in government, she  handed out these lovely little, as you can see, one of these wristbands  that are so common today. And on this wristband--this is the very  wristband that was handed to me by Helen back in 2012. It says: ``Thou  shall not be a bystander.''   Helen handed these out to everyone she spoke with, to remember, and  to remember to stand up and not let these horrors of events like the  Holocaust happen again in our time.  [[Page H3341]]    I just wanted to pay tribute to her tonight.   I thank Congressman Wilson for this great honor to be able to speak  and to mention an outstanding member of my district and what she stood  for, and that we shall not be bystanders and that we shall always  remember and not let this very horrific part of human history be  forgotten and make sure that it never gets repeated again.   I just want to say thank you, and may God rest her soul, Helen  Sperling, an amazing inspiration to me and so many thousands of others  in my community. I just want to thank you for giving me a moment to  recognize the great Helen Sperling from New Hartford, New York.
