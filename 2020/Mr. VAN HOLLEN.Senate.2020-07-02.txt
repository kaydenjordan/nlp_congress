 Mr. President, I want to salute my friend and  colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Toomey, for his remarks  and for his leadership on this very vital issue of standing up for the  rights and freedom of people in Hong Kong and, as he said, sending a  signal to others around the world who would seek to stamp out human  rights and political freedom.   When Senator Toomey and I saw that the Chinese Communist Party was  taking its more recent steps to crack down on freedom in Hong Kong, we  introduced the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. That act just passed the U.S.  Senate unanimously last week and was sent to the House of  Representatives.   This is a very fast turnaround from either of the Chambers in the  U.S. Congress. I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and her Republican  partner and all the Democrats and Republicans in the House of  Representatives for coming together so quickly on this legislation.   The legislation before us made a technical fix to the bill that  Senator Toomey and I introduced in which this Senate passed out last  week a technical fix to comply with the constitutional requirements as  to where a bill that might generate revenue begins.   With that technical fix, Speaker Pelosi and the Republican leadership  sent it right back. Why did they send it right back so quickly? Because  this is an urgent moment. In fact, our timing could not be more  critical. On Tuesday, President Xi imposed a national security law on  Hong Kong by fiat. It was only after the law was passed that Beijing  unveiled its provisions. Even Hong Kong's Chief Executive and President  Xi loyalist, Carrie Lam, said she hadn't been allowed to see a draft  before the law's passage.   As Senator Toomey indicated, this law is written broadly enough that  it will criminalize speech and peaceful assembly. Anybody who publishes  anti-Beijing viewpoints could be punished by life in prison. Saying  anything seen to be undermining the ruling Communist Party's authority  would be a violation.   This is consistent with mainland China's approach, which has  virtually eliminated independent journalism and severely restricted  NGOs.   Here are some highlights of the law that was just passed--I should  say, imposed. It now mandates that the Hong Kong Government undertake  ``national security education'' in school, social organizations, and  media outlets. The law mandates that anyone entering public office in  Hong Kong swear allegiance to Beijing.   What is more, the law applies to anyone, anywhere. It can even apply  to offenses committed outside the region by a person who is not a  permanent resident of the region. That means a U.S. citizen penning an  editorial that argues for sanctions against China could technically  fall afoul of the new law for ``inciting hatred'' against Beijing.  Legal experts believe this is even broader than the Chinese criminal  law applied in mainland China.   Senator Toomey said, despite this--despite this threat, despite  passage of a law that would punish people for up to life imprisonment  for expressing their views, thousands of protesters took to the streets  yesterday and staged the largest rally in Hong Kong this year. Hundreds  of Hong Kong police officers moved in swiftly to quash dissent and  implement the law. Police fired tear gas, pepper spray, and water  cannons to disperse the protesters.   The police then issued a statement that noted some protesters were  chanting ``Hong Kong independence, the only way out.'' The statement  said such slogans are ``suspected to be inciting or abetting others to  commit secession'' and may violate the new law.   The United States must stand with the people of Hong Kong. That is  what this bill says. This bill says we stand with the people of Hong  Kong.   As Senator Toomey indicated, it would impose mandatory sanctions on  individuals in firms who violate China's obligations to the people of  Hong Kong under the joint declaration and the basic law--rights of  freedom of speech and equality before the law, freedom of association,  and the right from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention, and  imprisonment. It goes beyond that to impose mandatory sanctions on  banks that do business with individuals who are complicit in  undermining these freedoms and the rights of the people of Hong Kong.   I am glad we acted quickly. As you can see, the Government of China  is moving by the day to squash the rights and freedoms of the people of  Hong Kong. We need to move with urgency to send a statement that we  stand with the people of Hong Kong.   In a moment, I am going to be joining my colleague, Senator Toomey,  in asking for unanimous consent. Before I turn it back over to him, let  me just say, assuming we get that--and it looks like we will--I hope  President Trump will sign this immediately--immediately.   As a country, Republicans and Democrats together need to send a  strong signal that we will not stand for the actions of Beijing,  undermining their own agreements--agreements under international law,  which they are bound to, and we will not stand still in silence and do  nothing while they crack down on freedom in Hong Kong.   I yield to Senator Toomey from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss  what I believe is an important and consequential matter at this moment:  the way ahead for U.S. relations with our friend and partner, Israel.   The pending legislation before us includes a plan to codify and  extend a multiyear commitment of American security assistance to  Israel. Specifically, it would codify a memorandum of understanding  reached during the Obama administration to provide $38 billion over 10  years in security assistance to Israel. That is $3.8 billion a year.  That is a significant promise. In fact, on an annual basis, that $3.8  billion represents over half of current U.S. foreign military funds  around the world.   It is a big commitment, especially at a time when we are struggling  to invest in supporting our workers, our businesses, and our economy  here at home during this global pandemic.   While it is a sizable commitment, it is one I have supported because  Israel is a close ally and friend that lives in a very dangerous and  volatile part of the world. It is surrounded on many fronts with  enemies who would like to destroy it, including Iran, Hamas, and  Hezbollah.   Moreover, Israel and the United States have a variety of shared  interests. Most importantly, in my view, the United States has an  enduring obligation to support a secure homeland for the Jewish people  after the horrors of the Holocaust.   Under normal circumstances, I would not even come to the Senate floor  today. I have consistently supported the security assistance, and I  still do. So why am I here today?   I am here because while I remain strongly committed to the security  of Israel and providing security assistance, I am also strongly opposed  to Prime Minister Netanyahu's declared intention to unilaterally annex  parts of the West Bank starting this month.   The unilateral annexation of parts of the West Bank would totally  undermine what has been, at least until the Trump administration,  bipartisan American policy in support of a two-state solution that  would ensure the security and the rights of both Israelis and  Palestinians.   Under the leadership of President Harry Truman, the United States  championed the establishment of the State of Israel as a homeland for  the Jewish people, and that remains a steadfast American commitment.  But the right to a secure homeland for the Jewish people does not  include the right to unilaterally annex territories on the West Bank  and deny the Palestinian people a viable state and homeland of their  own.   So I will say it again: The United States should support and continue  to support the legitimate security needs of Israel, but we also need to  stand up for a just two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict and for the rule of law and international order that the  United States has championed ever since the end of World War II.   Now, as I said before, the bill before us would codify and extend the  memorandum of understanding between the United States and Israel on  security assistance signed on September 14, 2016. You can be sure that  that memorandum of understanding for security assistance never  contemplated Israel's annexing parts of the West Bank.   In fact, the opposite is true. Part of the American rationale for  providing Israel with robust military assistance has been to give  Israel the confidence to seek a secure peace based on a two-state  solution.   Here is what National Security Advisor Susan Rice said in the Treaty  [[Page S4208]]  Room at the White House at the time of signing that MOU.   She first pointed out that it represented ``the single largest pledge  of military assistance to any country in U.S. history.'' She reinforced  the message that the United States remains absolutely committed to  Israel's security.   Then she said this:         That's also why we continue to press for a resolution to       the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--two states for two peoples       living side by side in peace and security. As the President--    She was referring to President Obama--       has said, the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a       Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an       independent and viable Palestinian state.    That is what she said at the signing of the same MOU that we would be  codifying in the bill before us.   Lest anyone think that was simply the position of a Democratic  President and a Democratic administration, it was not.   Susan Rice and Condoleezza Rice have more in common than just their  last names. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice attended the signing  ceremony for the previous memorandum of understanding that took place  on January 16, 2009, and, on that occasion, she too highlighted the  need to achieve ``a two-state solution building upon previous  agreements and obligations.'' She said: `` . . . two-state solution,  which is the only way, ultimately, to secure a future for Israelis and  Palestinians alike over the . . . long term.''   So the Bush administration and the Obama administration, at the  signings of the memorandums of understanding for security assistance,  both said the only way forward was through a viable two-state solution  that recognized the rights, dignity, and aspirations of both peoples.   Now, the unilateral annexation of West Bank land that Prime Minister  Netanyahu has proposed would blow away, would destroy, any real  prospects for a viable two-state solution. It would make a mockery of  the statements made by both National Security Advisor Susan Rice and  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. It would make a mockery of the  tenets of a bipartisan U.S. foreign policy up until the Trump  administration.   Make no mistake, those most in favor of unilateral annexation are  those most opposed to any viable two-state solution.   Now, I am under no illusions that a viable two-state solution is a  near-term prospect. It is not right around the corner. The Palestinian  Authority has been weak, and, until recently, because of the one-sided  actions of the Trump administration, has decided not to negotiate. But  even though the near-term chances of a negotiated two-state solution  remain remote, we must preserve--we must preserve--that option, and  preserving that option means strongly opposing the unilateral  annexation of West Bank territory.   Now, the unilateral annexation by Israel of all or any part of the  West Bank will unleash a cascade of harmful consequences.   One, if we become complicit in this action, it will harm our national  security interests and credibility by undermining the fundamental  principles of international law that we in the United States have  championed since the end of World War II.   Two, it will further isolate Israel in the international community,  and many countries--including in Europe--are likely to respond with  different forms of sanctions. Some are already moving in that  direction.   Three, it will harm both our position and Israel's interests in the  Middle East, by weakening allies like Jordan, and threaten to unravel  the warming relationships Israel has built with the Sunni Gulf States  to counter Iran.   The bottom line is that unilateral annexation will greatly strengthen  the hand of our common enemies--Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah--and hurt  friends like Jordan.   Four, it will harm Israel's security by completely undermining the  credibility of the Palestinian Authority and its capacity to  effectively govern the Palestinian areas on the West Bank.   Five, unilateral annexation will ultimately lead to one of two  outcomes. Either all the people in the annexed areas will be extended  equal democratic rights and Israel will risk losing its Jewish  identity, or Palestinians on the West Bank will be relegated to small,  disconnected enclaves with no viable future--what two former Israeli  Prime Ministers have warned is ``slipping toward apartheid.''   Six, if the current Netanyahu government heads down the road of  permanently denying the Palestinian people their right to self- determination and denies them their basic human rights, then Israel  will increasingly alienate itself from America. That is not in the  interest of either of our two countries.   So those are at least six of the harmful results of unilateral  annexation. I am going to elaborate on each of those points.   No. 1, any American acceptance of unilateral annexation will  undermine the very principle of international law that we have fought  to uphold in the international community since the end of World War II.  The United States has been the architect of the rules-based  international order, as reflected in the U.N. Charter of 1945, as well  as in the Declaration on Principles of International Law, based on the  U.N. Charter, that were signed in 1970 and found in many other  universally agreed-to documents and commitments.   It is well established that one country cannot take territory gained  from another in war. Now, I know the Trump administration has done all  sorts of mental and verbal gymnastics to abandon this long-held  American international principle to create an exception for Israel, but  they look very foolish.   We all recognize that some of the territory proposed to be annexed by  Prime Minister Netanyahu's plan would ultimately be included within  Israel's official boundaries through a process of negotiations. Land  swaps have been a regular feature of the talks, but there is a world of  difference between a negotiated settlement and one imposed by illegal,  unilateral annexation.   If we, the United States, aid and abet this effort, we will lose all  our credibility in condemning other instances of unilateral annexation.  I have with me a wrath of angry statements from Senators of both  parties made here on the floor of the Senate--outraged by Russia's  unilateral annexation of Crimea; outraged by Russia's efforts to extend  its sovereignty over other parts of Ukraine--and Secretary Pompeo  stating that the United States ``does not and will not ever recognize  Moscow's annexation of Crimea.''   I agree. He was right to say it. We, on the Senate floor, were right  to say those things. Those were violations of international law. In  fact, not only did we condemn those actions; we rallied other countries  to impose sanctions on Russia.   But what will Secretary Pompeo say next time? What is Mr. Pompeo  going to say if Turkey, which currently occupies northern Cyprus,  should decide one day that it will unilaterally annex that territory?  That would give Turkey more direct claims to the undersea gas fields  between Cyprus and Israel.   What about China's claims to the islands of the South China Sea, or  other disputed territories in many parts of the world that are claimed  by multiple parties?   The whole reason to abide by a rules-based system is to say not only  no to your adversaries; you must also say no to your friends.  Otherwise, it is not a rules-based system at all; it is the global  jungle.   That is why President Eisenhower said no both to our British and  Israeli friends when they tried to seize the Suez Canal in 1956.   If we accept Prime Minister Netanyahu's unilateral annexation, we  will not have any credibility the next time around when an adversary  does so.   In fact, here is what President Eisenhower had to say at that time:         There can be no peace without law. And there can be no law       if we were to invoke one code of international conduct for       those who oppose us and another for our friends.    That is what President Eisenhower said, and, of course, it makes  sense. On February 20, 1957, President Eisenhower broadcast an address  to the American people about the need for Israel to withdraw from  territories it captured during the 1956 war. In that case, he said we  would not consider occupation of another country as a  [[Page S4209]]  `peaceful means' or proper means to achieve justice and conformity with  international law.''   This is a well-established principle that the United States has  championed in the international arena.   No. 2, the unilateral annexation of parts of the West Bank will  further isolate Israel in Europe and across the world. The EU's foreign  policy chief, Josep Borrell, said recently that annexation ``would  inevitably have significant consequences'' for the EU's relationship  with Israel, and already an array of European parliaments are preparing  responses, including sanctions.   In a joint statement issued on June 24 by the current and incoming EU  members on the U.N. Security Council--that is Germany, Belgium, France,  Estonia, and Ireland--together with the UK and Norway, they together  said: ``We also share the Secretary-General's assessment that if any  Israeli annexation of the Occupied West Bank--however big or small--is  implemented, it would constitute a clear violation of international  law.''   They went on to say ``that following our obligations and  responsibilities under international law, annexation would have  consequences for our close relationship with Israel and would not be  recognized by us.''   None of this should be surprising. Unlike the Trump administration,  they are being consistent in how they react to violations of  international law, applying the same standards to adversaries and  friends alike.   Israel has often been unfairly singled out and unfairly treated and  criticized at the United Nations, and the United States has, on many  occasions, properly exercised its veto to defend Israel against unfair  treatment. But in this case, if Israel moves forward with unilateral  annexation, strong opposition at the U.N. would not be the result of  the world treating Israel differently or unfairly; it would be a self- inflicted wound. Again, the Trump administration may shield Prime  Minister Netanyahu's government from U.N. action, but don't count on  future administrations to defend illegitimate actions.   Three, unilateral annexation will undermine our security interests in  the Middle East and those of Israel. It will put our friends in the  region in great jeopardy and weaken our coordination with Gulf States  against Iran.   King Abdullah of Jordan very recently emphasized that annexation is  ``unacceptable'' and recently warned the Senate of a ``massive  conflict'' if unilateral annexation proceeds.   Here is what the widely respected retired Israeli Defense Force Major  General Amos Gilahd said on June 8 when asked about annexation:         It is a disaster. Why do we need to do it? It is       unnecessary. It is a threat to Israel. We might endanger our       security cooperation with Jordan that is so valuable that       most Israelis can't even imagine.    Arab leaders from the Gulf States, who have been strengthening  cooperation with Israel in recent years, issued similar warnings. The  Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the United States, Ambassador  Al-Otaiba, headlined a recent article, ``It's either Annexation or  Normalization.''   He said: ``Once it is clear that there is no longer a realistic  chance of a viable, sovereign state of Palestine being created, it  becomes more difficult for Arab leaders to justify publicly their plans  to further develop strategic cooperation with Israel.''   I know it is fashionable in some places these days to discount these  warnings from Arab leaders. After all, it is true, they have cried wolf  before when it comes to following through on their warnings about  certain Israeli actions. We are told: Don't worry. Don't worry, they  don't really mean it; they are just making these pronouncements to  placate the Arab street.   Maybe so, but there is a point where the Arab street will rebel, when  it will explode. And that may be the day when Israel signals that it  will unilaterally annex territory in the West Bank and eliminate any  prospects for a peaceful two-state solution.   What will be the result? The result will be to strengthen Iran, to  strengthen Hamas, to strengthen Hezbollah, handing them a very potent  weapon against Israel and the United States. They will say they have  been proved right, that Israel never intended to negotiate a just  settlement and that the United States has been complicit.   Four, unilateral annexation will jeopardize American-Israeli  cooperation with the Palestinian Authority to provide security and  stability in the West Bank. Unlike Hamas, the Palestinian Authority  long ago recognized Israel's right to exist as part of a dialogue for  peace and a just settlement.   As former IDF Major General Gilead pointed out, the leader of the  Palestinian Authority, President Abbas, ``believes that terror does not  serve the best interests of the Palestinians.''   He went on to say: ``We have a very satisfactory security cooperation  relationship with the PA.''   He predicts: ``The moment there is unilateral annexation, the PA will  lose its legitimacy. If they do, sooner or later they will not be able  to show their faces in the Palestinian street. And who will pay the  price? Our soldiers.''   A respected group known as the Commanders for Israel's Security--a  group of over 220 retired Israeli generals and equivalent ranked  individuals--expressed similar fears, saying that the prospect of  unilateral annexation, like the coronavirus, was an ``ominous  development'' and spelling out the risk of the full collapse of the  Palestinian Authority and its security agencies.   Hamas has always argued that the Palestinian Authority had been  played the fool when it recognized Israel's right to exist. They argued  that Israel would never agree to a just settlement if Palestinians  first gave up armed resistance and first recognized Israel. If Israel  proceeds with unilateral annexation, the legitimacy of the Palestinian  Authority will be diminished and Hamas will be the beneficiary   Five, unilateral annexation and the abandonment of any viable two- state solution will lead to one of two possible outcomes, neither of  them meeting the goals of the parties. Those two different paths have  been described by Israeli leaders themselves.   Here is the way former Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister  Ehud Barak explained the situation in a Haaretz interview in June 2017.  He said: ``If we keep controlling the whole area from the Mediterranean  to the river Jordan where some 13 million people are living--8 million  Israelis, 5 million Palestinians--if only one entity reigned over this  whole area, named Israel it would become inevitably--that's the key  word, inevitably--either non-Jewish or non-democratic.'' That is from a  former Israeli Prime Minister.   In the event of a scenario in which Palestinians living in an annexed  West Bank are given full rights and allowed to vote, Barak predicted  Israel would quickly become a ``binational state with an Arab majority  and civil war.''   The second option, if you abandon a two-state solution, according to  the former Prime Minister, the second option is the current path, he  said, ``a slippery slope toward apartheid.''   Because those two outcomes are undesirable, he pointed out that  Israel has a ``compelling imperative'' to pursue a solution of two  states for two peoples.   Another former Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, has also  repeatedly warned that Israel is on a path to apartheid if the two- state solution collapses. He said, if that happens, Israel will ``face  a South African style struggle for equal voting rights, and as soon as  that happens, the state of Israel is finished.''   Just recently in the New York Times, former Israeli Ambassador to the  United States Sallai Meridor said: ``If we take steps that make  separation from the Palestinians impossible, we may destroy the very  root of the entire Zionist enterprise.''   Six, I believe unilateral annexation will have all the harmful  impacts I have discussed on the Senate floor today and many more that  so many Israelis have warned about. I hope Prime Minister Netanyahu  will pull back from the brink. But hope and prayer are not a policy. In  normal times, an American President from either political party would  have made clear that such action is unacceptable to the United States  of America, but these are not normal times. We actually have an  American Ambassador to Israel now who is promoting this unilateral  annexation plan and who opposes a two-state solution. Here is what now- Ambassador Friedman said in November 2016:   [[Page S4210]]              There has never been a ``two state solution'' only a ``two       state narrative.''    He describes it as:         an illusion that serves the worst intentions of both the       United States and the Palestinian Arabs. It has never been a       solution, only a word narrative. But even the narrative       itself now needs to end.    That is from the current U.S. Ambassador in 2016.   In 2016, our current ambassador also said that he is in favor of  extending permanent Israeli control and sovereignty over the entire  area from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, clearly snuffing  out any prospects for a two-state solution and the viable way forward.   Ultimately, of course, the government of Israel will make its own  decisions, and then, we here in the United States will have to make  ours. The United States must have a position that reflects our values  and our ideals--our ideals of democracy, of human rights, of equal  justice and rule of law and self-determination.   God knows we are far from perfect here, and we can see that clearly  during this moment of national reckoning around racial justice and  equity. But we have set those principles as our goals, as our North  Star, and until this Trump administration came along, we have also made  human rights and the right of self-determination a key pillar of our  bipartisan American foreign policy.   It is those principles that have led us to support a secure and  democratic Israel as the home for the Jewish people and the  establishment of a separate viable state as the homeland for the  Palestinian people.   The American people support a two-state solution and significantly  the American Jewish committee in the 2019 survey of American Jewish  opinion shows overwhelming support for a two-state solution among the  American Jewish community and a large majority who say Israel should be  willing to dismantle all or some of the settlements as part of a peace  agreement. The next generation--this younger generation--of Americans  and of American Jews is even more focused on issues of human and  political rights for all peoples, Israelis and Palestinians.   There are many who have said that the possibility of a two-state  solution disappeared long ago, with the expansion of settlements and  outposts and the network of roads and checkpoints. They have called the  prospects for a two-state solution a delusion, a mirage; yet, even as  the facts on the ground have made a two-state solution harder to  realize, many of us continue to see that as the vision for the future,  one that brings hope to both peoples.   Make no mistake the unilateral annexation of parts of the West Bank  would be the final nail in the coffin of that idea. So what happens  then? What do we do? Once any remaining hope for that vision is  extinguished, I think we are in unchartered territory. As President  Obama noted in one of his speeches, ``The situation for the Palestinian  people is intolerable.'' And he drew parallels to the struggle of  African Americans for full and equal rights.    Secretary of State John Kerry has said that if the choice is one  state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic; it cannot be both.  ``You would have millions of Palestinians permanently living in  segregated enclaves in the middle of the West Bank, with no real  political rights, separate legal, education and transportation systems,  vast income disparities, under a permanent military occupation that  deprives them of the most basic freedoms. Separate and unequal is what  you would have.''   Nelson Mandela often talked about the need to ensure a secure State  of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people and the rights of the  Palestinian people. He said: ``We know too well that our freedom is  incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.'' There is a  memorial statue to Nelson Mandela in Ramallah.   What do we do? What do we do--those of us who are committed to a  vibrant, secure, and democratic Israel that is a home for the Jews but  are also concerned about the abandonment of the vision of a two-state  solution that also respects the aspirations and rights of the  Palestinians?   As I said at the beginning of these remarks, I have strongly  supported security assistance for Israel, and I continue to do so. I  also pointed out that National Security Advisor Susan Rice and  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice both indicated in their comments at  the signing ceremony of the MOUs for security assistance that a viable  two-state solution was the only--their words--only way to permanent  peace.   For all the reasons I have stated today, I do not believe that the  U.S. Government, the U.S. taxpayer should be aiding and abetting Prime  Minister Netanyahu's plan to unilaterally annex the West Bank. The  American Government and the American taxpayer must not facilitate or  finance such a process. That is why today a group of 12 Senators has  filed an amendment to the bill to make that position clear--the  position that we fully support the robust $38 billion security  assistance to Israel but also make it clear that those funds should not  be used to facilitate and promote unilateral annexation.   There are many who say that this does not go far enough, and there  are others who oppose annexation but say: Pass the security assistance  without making any statement about annexation or without taking any  action. To them, I am reminded of former Israeli Defense Minister and  Commander Moshe Dayan's statement saying: ``Our American friends offer  us money, arms, and advice. We take the money, we take the arms, and we  decline the advice.''   We are friends, the United States and Israel. We have many common  interests, but we will also have our differences. This is a moment  when, yes, we should provide the security assistance, the military  assistance. Yet, in doing so, we should also make clear that it should  not be used in any way to promote unilateral annexation.   Our view in filing this amendment is that the only way to reconcile  our strong support for a safe and secure Israel and our commitment to  establishment of two states for two peoples living side by side is what  we proposed.   I hope and pray that Prime Minister Netanyahu will not move forward  with his unilateral annexation plan. I hope we can continue to say that  the U.S.-Israel relationship is built not only on shared interests but  also on shared values.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I voted against the motion to table  Senator Paul's amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act not  because I support his amendment as written, but because I believe this  Senate has a responsibility to fully debate the question of our policy,  strategy and plans for Afghanistan. Tabling an amendment cuts off all  debate on this important matter. We should not be ducking these  decisions. We should confront our policy directly, take stock of where  we are, and set a responsible course for the future.   I strongly support ending the war in Afghanistan and the responsible  withdrawal of our men and women in uniform. However, I believe that  mandating the total unconditional withdrawal on a 1-year timeline will  result in the further destabilization of an already volatile region.  Unconditional withdrawal divorced from a diplomatic process to achieve  political reconciliation between the warring parties will make it  harder to achieve a peaceful outcome that serves our national security  interests.   Despite my disagreement with much of the substance of the Paul  amendment, the Senate should deliberate on these matters, not run away  from the discussion. The decision to table the Paul amendment prevented  the Senate from performing this essential function.                            ____________________
