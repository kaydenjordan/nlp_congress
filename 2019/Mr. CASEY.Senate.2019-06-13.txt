 Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to  celebrate 100 years and four generations of McGregor Industries, an  outstanding metal fabrication firm based in Dunmore, PA.   Since its establishment 1919, McGregor Industries has been renowned  for its production of quality railings, staircases, and iron and steel  works. The company's roots in Scranton's South Side neighborhood firmly  placed McGregor Industries at the center of the highly competitive iron  and steel trade market of the Northeast. Their many high-profile  projects have built our businesses, our churches, our schools, and even  our airports in northeastern Pennsylvania and across the Commonwealth.   When the company faced hardship in a changing market of the early  2000s and again in the 2008 financial crisis, Robert R. ``Bob''  McGregor readily took on the challenge to save his grandfather's  enterprise. Bob's engineering background encouraged McGregor Industries  to evolve and thrive in changing times through innovations in  engineering and development, eventually resulting in the McGregor Stair  Tower and Stair Systems. McGregor Stair Systems soon became prominent  features of many Philadelphia area building projects. Under the  leadership of a fourth generation McGregor and Wharton graduate, Grace  McGregor Kramer, the company's high-rise stair towers have expanded to  the Boston area. Contracts with MIT and the Encore Boston Harbor casino  are among the largest construction projects in Massachusetts history,  with McGregor Industries securing contracts for over 4,000 workers.   This family-led operation upholds its reputation as a reliable and  innovative leader in its industry that architects, engineers,  contractors, and construction managers can depend upon. McGregor  Industries and its devoted employees possess the focus and innovation  required of steel industries in the 21st century, while maintaining the  spirit of a family business committed to its community. McGregor should  take great pride in its decades of growth and tradition of excellence  passed from generation to generation.   McGregor Industries remains a testament to American-made ingenuity.  Their commitment to service and the betterment of communities across  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and beyond is inspirational. I wish  their leadership and employees success for many years to come.                            ____________________
