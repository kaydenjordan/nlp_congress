 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Elza Tucker,  a World War II veteran who dedicated his life to serving his community  and country.   Elza Richard Tucker was born July 13, 1918. Born and raised in the  Lowell, AR, area, Tucker was passionate about his community and  demonstrated that through his decades of selfless service.   He enlisted in the Army in 1941, where he served with the 2nd Armored  Division, ``Hell on Wheels,'' under the command of General George S.  Patton. He first set foot in France on Omaha Beach in Normandy 3 days  after the initial D-day landing.   He recalled his first days in combat with local media in 2016 when he  was presented the French Legion of Honor, France's highest honor for  military service. ``The Germans were coming from the back of me and I  could see them and I set a big barn on fire so I could see them as they  came through,'' he said. He shared how he used a machine gun to defend  his fellow soldiers in that same battle.   Tucker also saw combat in Africa, the invasion of Sicily, and the  Rhineland campaign. For his service, he was awarded the Bronze Star,  Good Conduct Medal, Presidential Unit Emblem, Croix de Guerre, American  Defense Service Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal,  and WWII Victory Medal.   His commitment to service continued long after he left military life.  He poured his heart and devotion into his faith and his beloved town,  earning him the affectionate nickname ``Mr. Lowell.'' Tucker served  faithfully at his church, First Baptist Church of Lowell, as both a  deacon and Sunday school teacher. His resume includes elected offices  on the Benton County Quorum Court and the city council, as well as  civil roles as a rural route mail carrier and post master of Lowell. He  also volunteered with the Lowell Fire Department and was a member of  the Lowell Planning Commission. In order to preserve the history of the  community he so dearly loved and served, he established the Lowell  Historical Museum.   The community grew to know and love Tucker, honoring him in 2004 when  Elza R. Tucker Elementary and Middle School opened in nearby Rogers.   Tucker never let old-age slow him down, either. He was a familiar  face at the Lowell Historical Museum, where he served as a greeter  until June 30, 2017, and he also spent much time at the Lowell branch  of Arvest Bank, handing out popcorn to customers.   Sadly, Tucker passed away on July 30, 2018, at the age of 100.   A member of the ``greatest generation,'' who spent his life in  service to the community, Elza Tucker was a true neighbor, friend, and  humanitarian. I extend my sincere condolences to his family and  friends, and I hope that they find comfort in the incredible legacy of  he leaves behind.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate and  recognize Rev. Richard Price on 40 years of ministry in Arkadelphia,  AR. This is a tremendous milestone, and I join with many others in  extending my sincere thanks and appreciation to Reverend Price for his  faithful service over so many years.   Reverend Price was born in Barberton, OH, and also lived in  Frankfort, IN, growing up. He went on to attend Apostolic Bible College  and, upon graduating, began an evangelistic ministry where he preached  revivals over the course of 5 years.  [[Page S5616]]    Price--or ``Brother Price'' as he is affectionately known--married  Debbie Rutledge of Pine Bluff, AR, and the family moved to Arkadelphia  in 1978. He is currently the pastor of the Pentecostal Church of  Arkadelphia.   The Prices have four children and seven grandchildren. They are  loving, devoted parents and grandparents, in addition to being leaders  within their congregation and in the Arkadelphia community. I am  grateful they have answered the call placed on their lives to serve  their friends and neighbors by faithfully preaching, teaching, and  shepherding their church for so many years.   Again, I would like to say congratulations to Reverend Price, his  wife, Debbie, and their entire family and congregation on a legacy of  ministry, faithfulness, and service that now spans four decades. This  truly is a special milestone that is worth celebrating and rejoicing  over.   I wish Reverend Price blessings and success in his ministry and pray  he continues to be used to reach people with the message of the  Gospel.                            ____________________
