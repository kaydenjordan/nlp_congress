 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an inspiring group  of middle school students from Heath Middle School and Calloway County  Middle School.   The First District of Kentucky was well represented at the Future  Problem Solving Program International's 2018 conference at the  University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Teams from these two schools  competed against their peers from across the globe.   Both teams placed in the top 10 internationally, with the team from  Heath Middle School placing eighth and the all-girls team from Calloway  County placing ninth.   Throughout the conference, the students experienced new cultures,  enjoyed trading keepsakes from around the world, and socialized with  students from many countries and States.   I am grateful for the efforts of all involved in helping these  students achieve their goals and for encouraging them to pursue  interactive, holistic learning to prepare themselves for the future.   I join with their family, friends, and teachers to congratulate these  exceptional students on their outstanding efforts and look forward to  their continued contributions to the First District of Kentucky.                            ____________________
