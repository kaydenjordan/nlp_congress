 Mr. President, I admit I wasn't here during the entirety  of the comments from our friend, and I saw his to-do list. The only  thing missing from that to-do list was to fund our military--or at  least I didn't see it on there. In all fairness, maybe he mentioned  that in his comments.   We now have 9 days to reach an agreement to keep the government  funded, to keep the lights on, to keep paying the salaries of our  government employees, and, of course, to fund our military, which ought  to be our No. 1 priority. If we think about things that government must  do, funding our national defense is the only thing that we can do and  that government can do. There are a lot of other things that government  does that are optional or maybe things we would like to do, but funding  our military is the No. 1 priority--or should be.   As the Senate majority leader mentioned earlier this week, our  Democratic colleagues persist in the notion that we should only  increase defense spending if we increase nondefense spending by the  same amount. The parity that the minority leader and the other  Democrats call for doesn't make any sense, though. It is apples and  oranges. They act as though all government spending is exactly alike  and enjoys or should enjoy the same priority, and that is just not  true. We know that from our own family budgets or from a small  business. There are things we must do, things we want to do, and things  we will do if there is money left over. But our friends across the  aisle, who are obstructing our ability to get to negotiated budget caps  and fund our military, act as though all of that is the same, that must  do, want to do, and what you will do if you have money left over--that  those are all exactly the same, and that is just not the case. It is  not the case in our family budgets, in our small business budgets, nor  is it the case for the Federal budget. Not everything is a priority.  But we do know that the No. 1 priority must be the safety and security  of the American people by making sure our military is adequately  funded.   The Budget Control Act signed into law in 2011 was what I would call  a necessary evil. The Budget Control Act provided that we would have a  bipartisan, bicameral negotiation and try to come up with a grand  bargain.   That was what President Obama liked to talk about a lot--the grand  bargain. But some people suggested that was kind of like a unicorn,  something that people describe but no one has ever seen--a grand  bargain. I wish it weren't true.   The Budget Control Act said that in the absence of a grand bargain,  we would have budget caps or sequestration imposed on discretionary  spending above certain levels. It proposed separate budget caps for  defense and nondefense, and if the budget caps are exceeded, there is  an automatic enforcement mechanism called sequestration which imposes  across-the-board cuts, which I mentioned a moment ago.   The purpose of this sequestration--or these across-the-board cuts--is  to do something in the absence of us doing what we should do; in other  words, we should take it upon ourselves to figure out what the  appropriate spending levels should be for defense and nondefense, and  then we should act to appropriate that money. But this is basically a  fail-safe mechanism, which operates as a result of our failure to deal  with this in a proactive way, and it has hit our defense spending much,  much harder than domestic spending.   As we know, neither our defense spending nor tax cuts are the cause  of our deficits and debt. It is the 70 percent of spending that happens  in the Federal Government on autopilot. It is the entitlements that  have been going up well in excess of 5 percent a year and are causing  instability and unpredictability in those important programs, such as  Medicare and Social Security, but at the same time racking up huge  deficits and debt that future generations are going to have to pay  back. Somebody is going to have to pay it back, and it won't be the  present generation because we won't be around then. It is simply  immoral to continue to see this happen without trying to deal with it.    But back on the matter of the Pentagon, as one op-ed writer put it in  the Washington Post last month--he said:         The Pentagon and the welfare state have been locked in       brutal combat for decades, and the Pentagon has gotten       clobbered. . . . Welfare programs--Social Security, Medicare,       food stamps and other benefits--dwarf defense spending.    In the 1950s and 1960s, defense spending was roughly 8 to 10 percent  of our economy. In 2016, it was just 3 percent. That is a huge change.   James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, said  that in his 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a  more diverse array of threats confronting the United States around the  world--never in his  [[Page S117]]  50 years of experience. So we are simply asking our military and our  national security personnel to do too much with too little.   It is no surprise that Secretary of Defense James Mattis said last  June that ``for all the heartache caused by the loss of our troops  during [our] wars [abroad], no enemy in this field has done more to  harm the readiness of our military than sequestration.''   More recently, General Mattis said that so far our continuing  resolutions have not done even greater damage to our readiness thanks  to certain additional or supplemental funding that we voted on. But at  the same time, he soberly cautioned that there could be real impact-- and it won't be positive, it will be negative--if the problem persists  and if the Department of Defense doesn't have a real budget sometime  this month.   His remarks echo that of practically every service chief. Together,  their views mean we have to act. I don't know who else we would listen  to if we are not going to listen to the Secretary of Defense and our  service chiefs when it comes to national security because that is their  job, and we ought to take their advice and heed their counsel.   Cuts in defense spending have real consequences. Much less money is  available for training and necessary maintenance, for example. The  length of deployments for our troops grows, and our soldiers are  stretched thin. Our military is forced to operate beyond its normal  capabilities.   The former Air Force Chief of Staff recently described the Air Force  as the smallest, oldest equipped, and least ready force across the full  spectrum of operations in our service history. Those are chilling  remarks--or should be. More than half of all Marine Corps fixed and  rotary-wing aircraft were unable to fly by the end of 2016. I have no  doubt that we can turn that around very quickly if Congress were to  step up to its responsibilities and adequately fund the military, but  that is the status quo unless we act. The Navy fleet currently stands  at 275 of the 350 ship requirement. Of our 58 Army brigade combat  teams, only 3--3 out of 58--are ready for combat.   Our enemies shouldn't take any comfort in these numbers because, as I  said, the United States always pulls together and Congress always acts  when they see a national emergency. But it shouldn't take an emergency  for us to do our job and to make sure that our military is adequately  funded and is ready to fight. As General Brooks in Seoul, South Korea,  said, their motto is ``ready to fight tonight.'' That is the kind of  world we live in.   Last summer was the perfect example of why, when we draw attention to  these numbers, we are not just blowing smoke. Operational accidents in  the South Pacific exposed our readiness failures in a dramatic fashion  and in a tragic fashion. Ten sailors died when the USS John S. McCain  collided with a 600-foot merchant vessel off the coast of Singapore.  Seven sailors died when the Fitzgerald collided with another vessel off  the coast of Japan. And the USS Lake Champlain collided with a boat  near Korea--although thankfully that time no lives were lost. This  ought to be a wake-up call to all of us.   Many have drawn credible correlations between these accidents that  have taken the lives of our military servicemembers and our readiness  failures, citing studies like the 2015 independent investigation by the  Government Accountability Office. That study determined that the Navy's  mandate to keep ships afloat in the Pacific was shortchanging crew  training and degrading the condition of our ships--in other words,  additional readiness failures.   These accidents, by the way, are happening at the same time our  national security threats are not going away, as General Clapper's  comments would indicate.   We have seen North Korea continue to improve its nuclear and long- range ballistic missile capabilities beyond the estimates of our  intelligence community--much faster--and detonate what is widely  considered to be a hydrogen bomb recently.   We have seen large-scale protests in Iran--and I hope they continue-- exposing the instability of a regime that continues to use its proxies  to advance its aims throughout the broader Middle East; in other words,  the No. 1 state sponsor of international terrorism--Iran. We ought to  encourage the people of Iran to continue to rise up in protest and to  change the regime there into one that does not prey on its neighbors in  the region.   We have seen a growing China--something that more and more people are  realizing is a threat. I know that when we deal with countries like  China, frequently we deal with them in the commercial context where we  see a business that hires people and we see investments here in the  United States. But what we need to recognize is that they don't do  business the way the United States does business. Sitting at the top of  every company in China, in the board room of every Chinese company, is  the Communist Party. They operate on an all-of-government basis. And it  is not just the government; it is also what we would consider the  private sector. But, in truth, there is no private sector in China; it  is all an arm of the government. It is posing a rising threat to  American wages and labor as they erode our industrial base by stealing  our technology. And because of loopholes in the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States--the so-called CFIUS process--they are  now able to tailor financial arrangements through joint ventures and  others in a way to capture our dual-purpose, cutting-edge technology.  They then copy it in China and erode our defense industrial base here  in the United States, along with the jobs that go with it. So it is a  very real and present threat to American wages and workers. It is a  threat to our intellectual property edge and the innovation that we are  the best in the world at, but they are all too eager to steal it, copy  it, and to harm the jobs and the investment in those businesses here in  the United States.    Of course, when it comes to China, there is the threat to human  rights in nondemocratic nations like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, which  China often has no qualms supporting.   With this diverse array of dangers, we simply can't afford to  straitjacket our military by arbitrarily cutting the amount of money we  appropriate to fund it. But that is what is going to happen unless we  act--and act quickly. The current continuing resolution expires on the  19th of this month.   The truth is, even if we are able to come up with negotiated budget  caps for defense and nondefense spending, we are probably going to have  to have a short-term continuing resolution to give the Appropriations  Committees time to put that into bill text. In other words, we can't  just snap our fingers once the decision has been made. It is going to  take some time to actually put it on paper.   The bottom line is, if we want to return to having the strong  military that we have always had, if we want to continue to lead in the  world, if we want to continue to be a force for peace and stability, we  have to maintain our military strength. That was the lesson we had to  learn again during the last administration when we saw America retreat  from its leadership in the world.   There are countries, tyrants, bullies, and dictators all too willing  to fill the void left by American retreat, and one way we retreat is  when we don't fund the readiness of our military, when we are not  ``ready to fight tonight,'' as General Brooks has said, and we need to  start with ending this cycle of continuing resolutions and defense  sequestration.   So I come to the floor today to call on my colleagues from all across  this Chamber, but specifically across the aisle, to quit holding our  military hostage to other unrelated demands, and I urge this body to  come together in agreement on new budget caps as soon as possible.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
