 Mr. Speaker, as we heard last night in the  President's State of the Union, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act is a once-in-a-lifetime investment in our Nation's economic  foundation and our Nation's competitiveness.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act makes it possible for us  to invest in passenger rail expansion and restoration; rebuild our  roads, our bridges, our water systems, and our sewer systems; reclaim  abandoned mine lands and reduce pollution; and so much more. It is the  solution to improving our competitiveness on the world stage and  recovering from the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.   After years of talking about passing an infrastructure bill and week  after week of infrastructure weeks, we have finally done it. We will  begin seeing the benefits quite soon.   Thank God for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, here is the deal. When we send our  servicemembers into harm's way the deal is that we are going to take  care of them when they get back home. It is more than a deal; it is a  pact. It is something sacred. But for far too long Congress and the  Department of Veterans Affairs have been slow in acting on that pact  citing the high cost or the lack of science. The result is a disability  claims benefit process that is cumbersome and places the burden on the  veteran himself or herself to prove toxic exposure.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment which streamlines this  process. It helps ease the burden of the disability benefit claims  process on servicemembers and their families by, number one, requiring  the Secretary of the VA to share a list of resources for toxic-exposed  veterans, caregivers of toxic-exposed veterans, and survivors of toxic- exposed vets, national veterans service organizations, and other  veterans' groups.   Number two, it requires the VA Secretary to share an outreach program  with those VSOs. I believe we have to take every step possible to  ensure that we offer the best care to those who have served our Nation.  My amendment is a step forward in reaching the goal that servicemembers  and their families should be made aware of every resource, and that  includes the resources included in the Honoring our PACT Act.
