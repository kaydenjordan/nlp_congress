 Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Troy Witt, of Garfield County, for his selfless actions  in helping those in need.   Troy, a rancher and commercial trucker of Sand Springs, spearheaded  an effort to send much needed donations to farmers and ranchers  impacted by record flooding in Columbus, NE, in March of 2019. He was  inspired by Montanans who came to his aid following the Lodgepole  Complex fire, Montana's largest fire of the 2017 wildfire season. After  losing 85 percent of his ranch, Witt was overwhelmed by the outpouring  of support and supplies he received from those he had never met.   When the opportunity presented itself, Witt decided to pay it  forward. He planned to load up his 53-foot trailer with as much hay,  fencing material, water and other supplies as he could and drive the  700 miles to the drop-off site in Columbus. After the Garfield County  Disaster and Emergency Services echoed Witt's plans, farmers from  around Montana offered to donate supplies. His efforts helped bring  hope to a region where hundreds had lost homes and businesses.   Witt's act exemplifies the spirit of compassion and selflessness that  Montanans embody. I and many others thank Mr. Witt for his good  deed.                            ____________________
