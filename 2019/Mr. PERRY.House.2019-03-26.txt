 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the United States'  recognition of Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.   Now is a critical and appropriate time for the United States to  formally recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel. At a time when  Iran and terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah, are using the  turmoil created by the civil war in Syria to expand their presence in  the region, it is clear they hope to seize the Golan Heights to then  launch attacks against Israel.   Recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights is vital to  the security interest of the United States and Israel.   I co-led a letter last December to Secretary Pompeo outlining the  critical nature of recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan and  encouraging the administration to do so. This recognition should have  occurred under several previous administrations, but the strong  leadership needed was not present.   I am glad that we finally have a President that is taking the  necessary steps to foster stability and peace in the Middle East. I  applaud President Trump and his administration for issuing the  proclamation recognizing the Golan Heights as part of the State of  Israel.
