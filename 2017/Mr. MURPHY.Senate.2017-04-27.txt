 Mr. President, I thank the leader for his remarks,  especially with respect to the new addition of the healthcare bill. It  is a disaster for Americans. It is immoral. It doesn't work. It doesn't  address any of the problems that remain in the underlying healthcare  system. Hopefully the Senate can rise above it and work together to do  something better for the American people.
