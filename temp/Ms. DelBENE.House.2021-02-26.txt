 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the American  Rescue Plan.   This bill contains critical support for our communities, including a  provision that I fought for in expansion of the child tax credit. The  child tax credit is the largest Federal investment we make in our  children, but it still leaves behind one-third of all children who are  in families who earn too little to get the full credit.   Those left behind include half of Black and Hispanic children,  families with young children, families in rural areas, and families  headed by women. This bill will provide an increased credit and monthly  payments to help families pay bills and buy essentials. An estimated 8  million people have fallen into poverty during this crisis, making the  current need even greater.   Today, my colleagues have the opportunity to vote to crush the virus,  get our economy back on track, and transform the lives of impoverished  children. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  critical legislation.
