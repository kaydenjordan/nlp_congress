 Madam Speaker, at last night's State of the Union,  President Biden had every reason to cite his extraordinary job creation  record, the fastest job growth in U.S. history. After only one year in  office, the President's American Rescue Plan was at the center of this  achievement. Our economic growth was the fastest in nearly 40 years. As  a result, the United States had a faster recovery than every other  advanced economy in the G7.   This progress has been made even while the United States is trying to  defeat COVID-19. As chair of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit,  I was particularly pleased to hear the President emphasize  infrastructure, making goods move faster and cheaper, because this can  only add to the historic job creation record he has achieved.                            ____________________
