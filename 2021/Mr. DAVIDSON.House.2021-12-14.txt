 Madam Speaker, it is not compassionate to bankrupt  America. That is exactly what this plan does. It equips this country  with more debt to pay for the past debt with no plan to pay for the  future debt. The only thing is more debt. It is a debt bomb, and it is  something that this body has an obligation to stop.   This country is on auto pilot for a crash site, and the only plan is  to keep riding on auto pilot right into the crash site. The whole point  of the debt ceiling is to force this body to do its duty and to come up  with a plan to not default.   The only question isn't whether we default tomorrow, which we  shouldn't, of course we should pay our debts, but we shouldn't default  in the future either. And unless we come up with a different course of  action, this is going to ride all the way to the crash site.   I will oppose this, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the  same, and we should continue to oppose it until there is a plan to  avert the crisis in the crash that is coming.   Don't bankrupt America.
