 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for her  continued leadership on the Community Reinvestment Act.   Over the last several weeks, our Nation has been gripped by the  uprisings against anti-Black racism and systemic racial injustice  across the United States. But there is a difference between saying that  we believe in the inherent dignity, equality, and value of our Black  brothers and sisters and actually committing to it. The Community  Reinvestment Act is one such commitment.   Our Nation has an unconscionable racial wealth gap that is directly  rooted in the racist financial practice of redlining, whereby Black  communities had red lines drawn around them on a map and were  systematically denied banking, housing, and economic opportunities.   As a result, generations of White communities were given a head start  at homeownership, which was the foundation of generational wealth,  while Black communities were denied.   This fuels a runaway generational wealth gap that haunts the United  States today. It is a practice that continues, with over 60 metro  areas, in this very moment, having banks that deny Black applicants at  significantly higher rates than they do White applicants.   Now, the CRA is an antiracist, antipoverty policy that seeks to  remedy some of the damage done.    Yet, while this administration and the Republican Party paid lip  service to Black and Brown communities with toothless policing  legislation, behind everyone's back, the OCC made moves to gut rules  around the CRA and advance the continued economic oppression of Black  people in the United States. In fact, these rule changes advance  gentrification and value luxury housing over investment in Black lives.   Well, to that move, we have four words: Not on our watch. That is  because, in this House, in the 116th House, under the leadership of  Chairwoman Waters, we will value Black lives.
