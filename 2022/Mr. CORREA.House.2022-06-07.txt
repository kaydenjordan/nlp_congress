 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Anaheim High School's  Jillian Albayati, the young athlete making history for women in men's  high school baseball.   Jillian became the first girl to pitch in a CIF-Southern Section  men's baseball final, allowing one run on eight hits in nine innings in  a Division 6 championship for the Anaheim High School Colonists.   She can also hit the ball. At the championships, she drove in the  Colonists' run with an RBI single and finished the season with an  average of over 300. And she plays first base.   Jillian was also the first girl to be selected to play in the Orange  County Men's All-Star Baseball Game. One of her goals is to play for  the USA National Baseball Team, and she will be trying out for that in  July.   With a high school career of 60 strikeouts in 79 innings, 11 wins in  the regular season, and four CIF baseball wins, we can say that Jillian  plays like a girl.   We are proud of Jillian and congratulate her.   Go Colonists.                            ____________________
