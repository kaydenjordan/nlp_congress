 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Police Week, it is  important that we remember the innumerable sacrifices that are made  every day by the men and women of law enforcement.   In communities across America, they serve as the gatekeepers of law  and order. Even as the far left calls for defunding the police, these  dedicated heroes will not hesitate when called upon to serve.   I believe that their hard work should be recognized every day  because, without them, law and order would cease to exist and  criminality would reign.  [[Page H2205]]    May God bless the proud women of law enforcement. Under your watch,  the American people remain protected.                            ____________________
