 Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day and a difficult day for the  House of Representatives and for our country. I have had the great  honor of serving this body for 40 years and in that time, I have never  encountered a situation like the one before us now, where a Member has  made such vile and hurtful statements, engaged in the harassment of  colleagues, and expressed support for political violence. None of us  should take any pleasure in what we must do today.   But to do nothing would be an abdication of our moral responsibility  to our colleagues, to the House, to our values, to the truth, and to  our country.   A great forebear of legislators, Edmund Burke, famously declared:  ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to  do nothing.''   Yesterday, the Republican Conference chose to do nothing, so today,  the House must do something.   I have heard some condemnation from across the aisle of the contents  of Representative Greene's statements. Some have condemned the white  supremacist and anti-Semitic things she said and posted online. Some  have condemned the falsehoods she shared about 9/11 and the horrific  school shootings.   But I have heard little from Republicans about the horrific  statements made by their colleague making threats of violence against  Democratic elected officials and her threatening conduct toward  Representative Bush and others.   Indeed, Mr. Speaker, there seems to be much silence when it comes to  her incitement of political violence.   In The Washington Post yesterday, columnist Greg Sargent wrote:         Whatever happens to Representative Greene, the truth is       unavoidable: Republicans have yet to offer a clear and       unambiguous declaration that political violence is       unacceptable and has no place in their ranks.    And I have heard too much about process and not enough about  accountability.   No Member ought to be permitted to engage in the kind of behavior  that Representative Greene has and face zero consequences. This vote  can be a first step in correcting the error of those who, so far, have  chosen to do nothing.   A short while ago, Representative Greene came to this floor to defend  her indefensible conduct. I heard no apology.   She claimed that we are here today only because of some things she  wrote online before she ever ran for Congress, as if one's moral slate  is wiped clean when one becomes a candidate for office.   Regardless, the conduct we are judging today continued to occur even  after Representative Greene became a candidate, and even after she was  elected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to look at this image.   I heard about motherhood today. Two of those women between them have  six children. They are mothers. One of them does not have children, and  she has come to this body asking for more housing for people, for more  healthcare for people, for more income for people. How awful.   And they are not the Squad. They are Ilhan, they are Alexandria, and  they are Rashida. They are people. They are our colleagues.   And yes, you may have disagreements, but I don't know anybody,  including  Steve King, who you precluded from going on committees for  much less--and this is an AR-15 in the hands of Mrs. Greene. This was  on Facebook just a few months ago.   Is that a message of peace and reconciliation and peaceful democratic  dialogue--The Squad's worst enemy, AR-15 in hand.  [[Page H356]]    I have never ever seen that before. Is this a precedent-setting  event? It is, because the conduct, the tweeting, the QAnon  association--I heard the disavow of QAnon. I learned more.                                time  1745    AR-15, ``Squad's Worst Nightmare.'' Is that what it was intended to  do, that each one of these ladies would have a nightmare about somebody  with a gun, an AR-15 that can carry a clip of up to 60 bullets?   I urge my colleagues to look at that image and tell me what message  you think it sends.   Here she is, armed with a deadly assault rifle, pointing it toward  three Democratic Members. Now, the pictures were put together, you  understand. They were not present; I understand that. And she captioned  it ``Squad's Worst Nightmare.''   Yes, some people are having nightmares and fear. And some people who  wanted to give other people nightmares committed sedition and broke  into the House of Representatives and tried to stop us from electing a  President of the United States.   These three faces are real people. They are three reasons we are  here. But there are many other reasons we are here today.   In 2019, during the same election cycle in which she ran, she showed  support for comments online that the quickest way to remove Speaker  Pelosi from power would be ``a bullet to the head.'' Did any of you  hear Steve King say anything like that? You removed him from all of his  committees.   But as I said, you did nothing. As a matter of fact, you gave a  standing ovation, as I understand. I wasn't there. What message does  that send? What message does it send to have a standing ovation to give  these three women nightmares?   Indisputably, these are clear threats to commit or incite political  violence, not from years ago but just months ago. Imagine the pain that  these Members' families must be experiencing when they see pictures  like this one. Imagine what their children think when they know their  loved ones are walking the Halls of Congress and may encounter  harassment, as it happened to Representative Bush?   So I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when they take  this vote, imagine your faces on this poster. Imagine it is a Democrat  with an AR-15. Imagine what your response would be. Would you think  that that person ought to be held accountable?   But when acquiescence to the suggestion of violence of any kind is  allowed to go unchecked, it is a cancer that metastasizes on the body  politic of our Nation, as we saw just a few days ago on January 6.   Cancer, that is how Senate Republican Leader McConnell described it.  He said: ``Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the  Republican Party and our country.'' Should we stand silent in the face  of that kind of activity?   He continued: ``Somebody who has suggested that perhaps no airplane  hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre- staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.'s airplane is not living  in reality.''   That is not me talking. That is not a Democrat talking. That is  Senator McConnell.   ``This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families  or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.''   My colleagues across the aisle have an opportunity today to reclaim  their party from the dangerous cancer of QAnon and violent conspiracy  theories that promote and have demonstrably resulted in sedition and  insurrection.   Senator Romney--you remember Senator Romney. He was a candidate for  President of the United States on the Republican ticket, nominated in  the Republican convention. He said of his party this week: ``I think we  should have nothing to do with Marjorie Taylor Greene and think we  should repudiate the things she said and move away from her.'' ``Our  big tent is not large enough to both accommodate conservatives and  kooks.''   Not my words, his words, a Republican Member of the United States  Senate. Now, he is not a big buddy of Trump's, so apparently he didn't  have to do what Trump suggested he do.   And Senator Ernst, a conservative woman from Iowa: ``She doesn't  represent the party. I don't want her to be the face of our party. I  think this is a great time for us to really talk about what we want to  see in the upcoming years and continue to build. We don't need people  that are promoting violence or anything like that.'' That is a  Republican conservative Senator.   Republican Senator and former Governor of Florida Rick Scott said--a  conservative Republican Senator--``That is not what the Republican  Party stands for.''   Let me suggest to you, if it is not, vote with us. Vote with the  House, not Democrats. Vote with the House of Representatives. Vote with  good order and peace.   Furthermore, Senator Young from Indiana said: ``There ought to be no  place'' in the Republican Party for the kind of views espoused by  Representative Greene.   That is what McCarthy said when you kicked King off of all his  committees. This is not something you haven't done. However, sadly, you  left it to us to do your job.   Representative Cole called her statements ``extraordinarily  disturbing.'' He said that yesterday; it is an old quote.   And Senator Thune asked his fellow Republicans in the House: ``Do  they want to be the party of limited government''--I think the answer  to that is yes--``or do they want to be the party of conspiracy  theories and QAnon?''   Furthermore, Senator Young from Indiana said: ``There ought to be no  place'' in the Republican Party for the kind of views espoused by  Representative Greene.   That is what your Republican colleagues have said. This is not  partisan. This is about principle.   And you can shake your head as much as you want. This is not about  party. It is about whether or not you will vote for decency and truth,  not the Members' worst nightmare.   I hope we can do it together, all of us, embracing our humanity and  our basic adherence to the Constitution.   Edmund Burke, who I quoted earlier, said: The only thing necessary  for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.   Let us not do nothing.   I often share another passage shared so long ago by Edmund Burke when  a new Member arrives to serve in the House. It concerns a duty a  representative has to his or her constituents. His conclusion on that  matter is that we owe them our unbiased opinion, mature judgment, and  enlightened sense of conscience.   What does your conscience tell you to do in light of this kind of  assertion? Nothing?   Burke told his own constituents that these virtues of a  representative ``does not derive from your pleasure,'' ``nor from the  law and the Constitution. They are a trust from providence, for the  abuse of which'' you are ``deeply answerable. Your representative owes  you, not his industry only, but his judgment, and he betrays, instead  of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.''   This is not about polling. This is not about your base. This is about  your conscience and your moral judgment.   In other words, each of us ought to look inside our hearts to the  answer that we know is right and is best for the House and for our  country.   If the Republican Party for less toxic language took committee  assignments away from Steve King, should they do less in this instance?   There is no doubt that if somebody came to the Congress and had said,  before they came to the Congress, ``I am for violent revolution against  the Government of the United States of America,'' your party would say  that is not somebody we want to be associated with.   That is not what she said; I do not assert that. But should we do  less than you did for Steve King for far less toxic language?   Let us not do nothing. Mr. Speaker, let us do the right thing.
