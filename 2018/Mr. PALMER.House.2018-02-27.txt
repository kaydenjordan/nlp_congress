 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Mr.  Hultgren, for arranging this opportunity to honor Billy Graham.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow will we witness something that we have never  seen before: the laying in honor of the body of an American who was not  a government official, didn't lead a political movement, and wasn't a  war hero or social movement hero.   The Nation will mourn a man who was single-minded in his devotion to  one thing, whose life and vocation centered on one thing and one thing  only: proclaiming the saving grace of God through Jesus Christ.   I hope we pay close attention to this. We will most likely never see  it again.   In Mark, Jesus tells his disciples to ``go into all the world, and  preach the Gospel to every creature.'' Few people followed this  instruction more faithfully than the Reverend Billy Graham and with as  much success and impact.   Billy Graham has been called America's Preacher. But the fact of the  matter is that he was, for many decades, the most recognized and  respected evangelical in the world.   Reverend Graham preached the Gospel to more than 200 million people  during his more than 400 crusades and rallies in more than 185  countries and territories. The impact of those reached through TV,  radio, video, and the internet is unquantifiable.   Reverend Graham did this sacrificially, giving up opportunities for  other, much more lucrative opportunities that most people would have  jumped at were they given the opportunity. Moreover, Reverend Graham  estimated that he was gone from home for about 60 percent of his  children's adolescence.   Despite being a pseudo-single mom, his wife, Ruth, understood the  importance of the sacrifice. She once said: ``I'd rather have a little  of Bill than a lot of any other man.''   At a time when Christians are so often shunned and ridiculed,  particularly those who have major followings, Billy Graham was almost  universally regarded as a steady and well-respected voice. He appeared  on Gallup's list of most admired men in America 60 times since 1955.  That is every year since the research firm began asking the question.   He counseled and covered in prayer every President, from Truman to  Trump. Former President Clinton said: ``When he prays with you in the  Oval Office or upstairs in the White House, you feel he's praying for  you, not the President.''   That is the magnitude of this man: no matter how big or small you  were, he cared about you, not your position. Titles and wealth and  social status didn't matter to Reverend Graham. The only position of a  person that mattered to him was their eternal position before God. Race  did not matter either.   Reverend Graham was courageous. When other church leaders remained  silent, he was an outspoken advocate for racial equality, consistently  stating: ``Christ belongs to all people.''   In 1951, he called for the Southern Baptist Convention to accept  Black students at their colleges. At a 1953 crusade in Tennessee, he  personally took down ropes segregating the audience. In 1957, during  his crusade in New York, he invited Martin Luther King, Jr., to open  one night with a prayer. Despite his actions, he later said he wished  he would have done more to help Dr. King.   In 1964, just months after the bombing at the 16th Street Baptist  Church, Reverend Graham brought his crusade to Birmingham, Alabama.  Before he agreed to come, Reverend Graham insisted that the audience be  integrated. Over 30,000 people attended, making it, at the time, the  largest integrated audience in the history of Birmingham.   The next year, he spoke to an integrated audience in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama, with University of Alabama President Frank Rose and head  football coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant with him on the stage.   Mr. Speaker, I don't believe there is or will be anyone else in our  lifetime who so clearly and effectively called people out of spiritual  darkness into the light than Billy Graham.                                time  1900    Untold millions were exposed to the saving message of the Gospel  through his ministry. I mourn the void of moral and spiritual authority  that, with his death, has been left in this world, but I rejoice in  knowing that he is finally at home and at rest with God.   As it is written about David in Acts 13:36, so it can be said of  Billy Graham. He served God's purpose for his generation.
