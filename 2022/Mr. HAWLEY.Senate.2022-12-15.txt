 Madam President, last night, the Senate took the  important step of unanimously, on a bipartisan basis, passing  legislation to ban TikTok on all Government devices.   Now, this has been a longtime coming. I first introduced this piece  of legislation almost 3 years ago. But last night's legislation is  vitally important because never has the security threat to the American  people from the Chinese Communist Party been more grave and never has  the determination on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to  leverage every possible asset, every possible platform to gather  information--personal information--from the American people been more  serious than it is now. That is why last night's action by this body is  so critical.   Let's talk about TikTok for a moment, the most downloaded app in the  world for the last 2 and 3 years running. Back in 2020, over 100  million Americans--100 million--used TikTok, and that was over 2 years  ago. Since 2022, TikTok's average monthly users--and this year, every  quarter of this year--has increased by 234 percent. It is incredible  growth. You can see why. It is a fun app to use.   Here is what Americans don't know because TikTok doesn't want them to  know. It is that the app runs continuously in the background of your  phone or device. It collects your keystrokes. It has access to your  email, access to your calendars, access to the notes and clipboard  functions of your computer or iPhone or tablet or device. It, of  course, tracks your geolocation. It is essentially an evidence- gathering, data-gathering machine that runs on your phone.   Can you turn it off? Can you stop it from doing these things? No, you  can't, not if you want to use the app.   What is the connection to Beijing? Only this: that TikTok is owned by  ByteDance. Under Chinese law that company must--must--provide all data  to the Chinese Communist Party that the party wants upon its request.   We know that there are Chinese Communist Party members in TikTok  leadership. We know that the Chinese Communist Party has held so-called  training sessions for ByteDance and TikTok  [[Page S7221]]  employees. We know that this data--Americans' data--is available to the  Chinese Communist Party, to Beijing, because of TikTok, and it is time  we did something to protect American users.   We have been warned repeatedly by our own intelligence Agencies that  TikTok is a security threat. Heck, the Director of the FBI has  testified under oath that TikTok poses major security risks. That is  why the Pentagon, the State Department, the Department of Homeland  Security, TSA, the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, and  the Marine Corps have already banned the use of TikTok on Government  devices. The only sensible next step is for this Congress to act to  make that ban across the board for all Federal devices.   Now TikTok has tried to get in on the act. They issued a statement  this morning admitting that there may be national security concerns  with their platform, after denying it under oath for years on end to  Congress. But they also begged Congress not to do anything rash like  actually take action. They said: No, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Negotiate  with us.   Well, I just say this: The time to wait to secure the privacy of  American citizens is long past, and the least we can do, the very first  step we can take, is to ban this app and its use on Federal Government  devices.   I hope that now the House and the Senate will act together to move  this legislation quickly to the President's desk and we can take the  further historic step of seeing this legislation enacted into law,  protecting the privacy and the security of every single American.   It is within our reach. Let's act now and get it done.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
