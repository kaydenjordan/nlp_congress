 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, as a proud member of the House Committee on Armed  Services and the Representative for critical military installations in  Alabama, I take very seriously my responsibility to ensure that our  servicemen and -women get the tools and support that they need to keep  our Nation safe.   This year's NDAA, as it is currently written, does just that. The  bill will help modernize Alabama's Air National Guard facilities and  support leadership training at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery,  Alabama.   It also includes record funding to support research at HBCUs and  makes significant investments in the health and well-being of our  servicemen and -women and their families.   While I voted to pass the NDAA out of committee last month, I remain  very concerned that my Republican colleagues are trying to push poison  pill amendments--amendments focused on culture wars; not unity, but  division, and not Social Security or Medicaid or our national security.   For 61 years, Congress has passed the NDAA with bipartisan support. I  implore my colleagues across the aisle to not break this tradition of  national importance.   Mr. Speaker, every year since I came to Congress, I have been proud  to vote for the NDAA. I am not sure that I can vote in favor of it this  year if those poison pills are included.  [[Page H3228]]    Mr. Speaker, I implore my Republican colleagues to keep the NDAA  intact as it was from the committee. I will vote against the rule, but  I hope to be able to vote in favor of the bill.
