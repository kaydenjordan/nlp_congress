 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  March 13 as K-9 Veterans Day, an opportunity to commemorate the working  dogs that support our men and women in uniform.   This year marks the 78th anniversary of the establishment of the K-9  Corps.   After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army began training for the K-9  Corps in 1942, originally known as the War Dog Program. In the years  that passed, the K-9 Corps has become a vital part of our Armed Forces  operations.   Though military working dogs initially served as morale boosters for  our soldiers, they were eventually trained and incorporated into  combat. A dog's sense of smell is 5 to 10 times stronger than a  human's, which has made them expert counterparts in detecting explosive  devices.   More than 1,500 dogs served in the Korean war, 4,000 in Vietnam, and  many more in Afghanistan and Iraq.   Like their human counterparts, our military K-9s eventually retire.  Many dogs and their handlers develop a strong bond during their service  together.   Sadly, prior to the year 2000, military working dogs were considered  ``equipment'' and were either left behind or euthanized at the end of  their service.   Today, retired military working dogs are put up for adoption, and  their personal handlers get first priority to give them a home.   To further this effort, the American Humane Society works to unite  our four-legged heroes with their handlers by raising funds to ensure  their safe transport home.   Oftentimes, these retired dogs will serve as support animals to  servicemembers who may be suffering from PTSD and other disabilities,  both mental and physical. Our veterans can greatly benefit from the  assistance and the companionship that a dog provides, and our K-9  veterans benefit from their newfound forever homes.   Our K-9 veterans have served our country, and they, too, deserve to  be honored for their service.                     Recognizing National Red Cross Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  March as National Red Cross Month.   This tradition began in 1943 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt  issued the proclamation to designate the month of March to celebrate  Red Cross volunteers, donors, and instructors.   The history of the Red Cross, however, goes back even further into  American history. In 1881, Clara Barton established the organization  right here in Washington, D.C., to better serve people in need. On June  5, 1889, Clara Barton and five volunteers came to Johnstown to respond  to the Johnstown Flood.   For more than 100 years, the American Red Cross has worked to support  those in need, whether they are men and women in uniform or victims of  natural disaster.   Perhaps the organization's best-known program, the American Red Cross  established the first nationwide civilian blood donation program in the  1940s.   According to the organization, someone in the United States needs  blood every 2 seconds. There are regular blood donation drives right  here on Capitol Hill, where we can all volunteer to donate blood that  has the potential to save a life.   Less than 38 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to give  blood, and only 3 percent of those individuals donate annually.   The critical need for blood and the lifesaving potential that comes  from a donation cannot be overstated.   The American Red Cross has always been a leader in this effort, and  today, they still provide more than 40 percent of the blood products in  the United States.   The success of the Red Cross relies on the generosity of the American  spirit.   This month and all year long, I am thankful for their service to our  Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life of Ms. Bonnie McWhorter Duvall. Bonnie recently lost her  battle with cancer at just 61 years of age.   Bonnie was the matriarch of a strong farm family from Greensboro,  Georgia. She was a member of the Green County Farm Bureau Women's  Committee, a mother of four, and a wife to American Farm Bureau  Federation President Zippy Duvall.   Bonnie and Zippy spent more than 40 years together, and she enjoyed  traveling the country by his side to meet with many of our Nation's  farmers over the years.   Though it is a comfort to know that Bonnie is no longer suffering, it  is a great sadness that she was taken from her family and friends far  too soon.   I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Zippy and the rest of  the Duvall family at this difficult time. They are, and will continue  to be, in my prayers.                            ____________________
