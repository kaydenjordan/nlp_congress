 Mr. President, earlier this year, we lost a  treasured consumer, public health and safety advocate. Allison Kennedy  passed away on May 10, 2023, after suffering a brain aneurysm. She was  36 years old. A devoted mother, beloved wife, and cherished daughter,  Allison was full of life and love.   Allison was born in Visalia, CA in February 1987. Although Allison  was an only child, she grew up surrounded and supported by her large  and loving extended family in Washington, anchored by her Nana and  major role model Nita King. Life for Allison revolved around her  family. She loved her grandfather Jim beyond words. She especially  loved the precious time she spent with her father outdoors or working  on household projects together, even FaceTiming her dad 3,000 miles  away to help her put a table together. She loved traveling with her  family, including to the off-road races in Baja, especially with her  Uncle David.   She attended Washington State University, graduating in 2010, and  received her master's degree from American University in Washington,  DC, in 2014.   After starting her graduate studies at Washington State University,  she began a 3-month internship in Washington, DC. Within weeks of  moving to DC, she fell in love with the city, the politics, and a man  named Brian. Their love started on their first date as they sat talking  in her apartment until 3 in the morning. Allison and Brian were engaged  in December 2014 and married in November 2015. They first lived in  Northeast Washington, D.C., then moved to Maryland in 2019, and finally  found their dream home in Burke, VA, in 2022.   Allison longed to be a mother. Allison and Brian tried for nearly 5  years. In 2021, they received the gift of Christopher ``Kit'' Colm,  through adoption, who blessed their home with the fullness of love and  joy. Allison thrived as a mother. In every way, she knew how to care  for Kit and help him blossom. In 2022, Brian and Allison found out they  were pregnant. Callahan ``Cal'' was welcomed into the world in January  2023. The final months of Allison's life were filled with happiness and  contentment as she thrived as a mother of two.   Allison also served as the director of government relations for  Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. She was well known and well  respected on Capitol Hill as an ardent champion for safe roads, safe  vehicles and safe road users. During her more than 10 years with  Advocates, she cultivated a safety legacy that will continue to prevent  crashes and save lives for years to come.   Under the leadership of her professional mentors, Cathy Chase and  Jackie Gillian, Allison grew into a fierce and successful advocate  whose work led to the adoption of critical safety-minded policies,  including many of the key safety provisions of the 2021 Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act. For generations to come, Allison's legacy will  be measured in the countless lives of children, teen drivers,  pedestrians, and motorists that her work helped to save. She loved and  was adored by all her colleagues at Advocates.   Allison's untimely passing is a monumental personal and professional  loss for the Advocates' team and for all those who work closely with  the organization. She will be remembered as a dedicated public health  and safety activist, wonderful colleague, caring friend, cherished  daughter, devoted wife, and dedicated mother.   I send my condolences to her husband Brian, their two young sons  Christopher ``Kit'' and Callahan ``Cal,'' her parents Erin and Michael,  her entire family, and all her loved ones.                            ____________________
