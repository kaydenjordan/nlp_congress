 Mr. Speaker, the United States' debt has grown by $2.5  trillion over the last year. Over the last 20 months, thanks to Biden- led policies, $4.8 trillion. This is a massive driver of inflation and  lack of credit on the market out there for regular people.   On top of the omnibus bill done a year ago and many other big  spending ideas that were gotten through in the previous Congress, now  the President wants to add $6 billion more for high-speed rail in  California, $3 billion for the project, that is already 15 years late  and four times its budget price, and $3 billion more now for what was  going to be a private concern from LA to Las Vegas, the gambler  special.   We need highways to be rebuilt. We need less debt causing people to  not be able to make ends meet. Why are we putting it on these  boondoggles in southern California? It is crazy. Put it toward highways  that people can use or something else.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado with  almost the same name as me. I appreciate him leading this important  time for us here tonight, especially as we encroach upon Christmas,  which a lot of times can be made into something else besides the  celebration of our Savior.    The Bible serves as a compass, guiding us through life's journey,  illuminating the path of its teachings, parables, and wisdom. It is  indeed more than a collection of words. It is a living testament to the  grace, power, and unwavering love of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Its narratives reveal the depth of God's faithfulness, His miraculous  interventions, and His promise of salvation--if we would just ask for  it.   The Bible has played, of course, an integral role in shaping the  values, principles, and visions of the early pioneers who sought  freedom in this country, who did not want to be dictated by a monarch  as to what religion they would follow.   We have that freedom in this country. We don't have a state-sponsored  religion. We don't have a preferred one, even though many based the  founding of this country on Christian and Biblical values, the Judeo- Christian ideal. They don't force it on anyone in this country.   We hear a lot of fuss about the separation of church and state. That  is really a misnomer. It is not in the Constitution, and it is not what  everybody is about. No one has to prescribe to any particular type, but  we encourage it because there is salvation in it.   As we celebrate the week of the Bible here, it is the inerrant Word  of God, inspired. The teachings in it are positive values for anybody.  They stand the test of time. They stand above the whims of Congress, of  people, or of governing. If we embrace that, it is indeed better for  all of us and for all of our families.   The Pilgrims sought that religious freedom 300-plus years ago, and  many have been seeking it since. As we see more and more persecution of  people's religious beliefs, we have to put a stop to that and, indeed,  honor what is so formative in this country and its basic freedoms.   As we honor National Bible Week, we do recognize the impact extends  far beyond individual faith practices. It is indeed part of our  Nation's story. It serves as an anchor, offering solace, hope, and  guidance in the world--indeed, inspired by God, given to mankind.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this time and opportunity to put the  spotlight on this because it is a very selfless thing. We hope you will  take time to read it. It will inspire.
