 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, with all the challenges our Nation faces today, why are  we relitigating the ex-President's first impeachment from 2019?   After a similar resolution failed last week, why are extreme MAGA  Republicans hijacking this House yet again by devoting precious floor  time to attacking my friend and colleague Adam Schiff?   Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the leader of their  party is facing trial on 37 felony counts of conspiracy and mishandling  of classified documents. The disgraced ex-President even stored some of  the Nation's most sensitive secrets in the bathroom of his Florida  club.   These attempts to censure Adam have been orchestrated to distract,  but no one is fooled.   Extreme MAGA Republicans are targeting Adam because he is everything  they wish they could be. He is tough, principled, and effective.   I have stood shoulder to shoulder with Adam.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work we  did on January 6. It speaks for itself.
