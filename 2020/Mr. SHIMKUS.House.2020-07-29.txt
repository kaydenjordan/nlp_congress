 Mr. Speaker, I have heard it said that being a chief of  staff to a Member of Congress is one of the best jobs on the Hill.   It takes a special person to keep the staff performing at the high  level required of them. Burnout could easily occur because of long  hours, high stress, and low pay.   That is why I come to the floor to thank my chief of staff, Craig  Roberts, for his 24 years of service to me, the people of Illinois, and  the people of this country. Yes, you heard me right, Craig has been  with me for 24 straight years. It really has to be some kind of record.   Craig was born and raised in the Alton-Godfrey area of Madison  County. He was one of those kids who was drawn to politics as a young  kid, volunteering for campaigns in high school.   While attending Western Illinois University, he continued his studies  and political activities. He graduated with a degree in political  science and was an active member of the College Republicans.   Craig easily was hired by the Republican House staff in Illinois. I  may have met him then, but my first direct and consistent contact with  Craig was back in 1991 when he worked for the secretary of state. He  volunteered to take on the task of running my first congressional  campaign against an entrenched incumbent.   Running for Congress is difficult. Running against an incumbent is  even more difficult. Running against a powerful, well-entrenched  incumbent is crazy. Well, I was a little crazy, and I am glad Craig  was, too, as he started the task to win the race.   The district consisted of 19 counties. Neither of us had personal  money, but we put a little bit of our own in. I paid for gas and my  food. He ate the last month of his salary cost.   We lost in the Clinton landslide in Illinois, but Craig's involvement  helped provide immediate legitimacy to the campaign and made it  competitive.   In 1996, I ran again, and this time, Craig was involved as an unpaid  adviser. This race, I won narrowly. Once I won, I knew I had to ask  Craig to join me in D.C. and run my office.   I made many local Republicans mad by taking Craig away from  Springfield. In his time there, he had become highly respected. That  respect would be easily duplicated in D.C.   Craig's leadership style is uplifting and empowering. He softened my  big-hammer style and calmed the seas when storm Shimkus was billowing.   He is a mentor and a friend to all who come through his door. Team  Shimkus staff members can be found all over D.C., from the executive  branch to the Senate and the chief of staff of offices. They all stay  in touch and reach out to Craig for advice.   I left the D.C. hiring decisions to Craig. My theory is, if you hire  someone and it doesn't work out, you have to be the one to fire that  person.   My office staff is known for being open, accessible, friendly--most  of the time--hardworking, and knowledgeable. This is a tribute to  Craig. Our limited turnover is also a tribute to him.   Craig is a father figure to a bipartisan group of chiefs of staff.  Active in the Chief of Staff Association, he has helped Congress and  Members work together. In the heat of Member battles, chiefs talking to  chiefs can help work things out.   He is also a proud and active Republican. He is known for his  knowledge, organization, and planning. He volunteers and is an active  member of the Capitol Hill Club, which is a Republican club up here on  the Hill.    But a good chief of staff has to be a confidential adviser to the  Member. Members of Congress live in the governmental and the political  worlds simultaneously. So does the chief of staff.   The chief of staff has to ensure that the ethical boundaries are  known and obeyed. Action people take action and, many times, cross the  line. Chiefs, and particularly Craig, pulls a Member--and that would be  me--aside and keeps me away from the brink of doing something really  stupid.   Craig was and is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Maybe upon my  retirement, he can get some rest, but I doubt he will.   We both carry the political and governmental scars of 24 years of  service. Some can be seen while others cannot be seen. It is those  scars that will forever bind us together.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Craig for joining me in D.C., thank him for  staying with me, and thank him for being the best chief of staff on the  Hill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the  time.   We should at least comply with the law. I would think that a law- writing body, Congress, and the Appropriations Committee should at  least follow the law.   Well, again, this rule doesn't do that, and this bill doesn't do  that. Let me explain what I am talking about.   Spent nuclear fuel and defense waste is at 121 sites in 39 States  across this country. The DOE, Department of Energy, was supposed to  take title to this spent fuel and this defense waste in 1998.   Appropriators will like to hear this number. We spend unbudgeted out  of the Judgment Fund $2.2 million every day--$2.2 million unbudgeted-- unappropriated through legal action because we are not complying with  the law.                                time  1045    The Nuclear Waste Fund currently is booked as having $40 billion in  it, Mr. Speaker, and that $40 billion comes from ratepayers, not even  Federal money. It is people whose States have nuclear power. They pay  into this fund to find a safe disposal site.   Over the past 30 years, $15 billion has been spent. I brought  examples of that $15 billion. Mr. Speaker, this is one box of five of  the Department of Energy's scientific analysis of the safety of Yucca  Mountain, the long-term repository. They finished that, and then they  turned over all of their science.   Let me tell you who was part of this billions of dollars of research  by eight national labs, which comes through this appropriation bill.  Eight labs, the U.S. Geological Survey, and many universities helped do  this research. Then, they sent this research to our independent nuclear  safety agency called the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and they issued  a five-volume report.   This is the fifth volume of that, which says: Using Yucca Mountain as  a long-term geological repository would be safe for a million years,  not 10,000 years, not 100,000 years, not 500,000 years, a million  years.   Now, who did this research? Well, you had experts in geochemistry,  hydrology, climatology, structural geology, volcanology, seismology,  and health physics, as well as chemical, civilian, mechanical, nuclear,  mining materials, and geological engineering.   If we want to use science, want to talk about science, science from  the Department of Energy, science reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission says Yucca Mountain will be safe for a million years for  long-term storage of not just spent fuel but also of our defense waste.   So, what happens when we legally block the final portion of the law?  And the final portion would be: Let's get money to allow Nevada to  argue the science. That is what they always say: Let's argue the  science. Well, this bill, like other bills coming out of the  Appropriations Committee, has zero money to debate the science and do  the adjudication.   So if it had money, and this is part of the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, if the adjudication were to resume, one or more boards  would hear evidence and issue decisions on approximately 300 admitted  issues contesting DOE's application or the NRC's staff decision to  adopt the DOE environmental impact statement.   If we would finish the last portion of this debate and have the--it  is actually called the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel. They  would look at the science. They would hear Nevada's complaints, and  they would render judgment. That is why we go to courts and stuff to  resolve conflict.   If they don't like that decision, Nevada can appeal the Board's  decision to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If they don't like the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission's final decision, they can go to the U.S.  Court of Appeals.   Now, let's address a few things about the State of Nevada. I include  in the Record Nye County Resolution No. 2020-11, which passed this  year. I will read a few portions of it. The title is: ``A Resolution of  the Nye County Board of County Commissioners Supporting the Efforts to  Complete the Yucca Mountain Licensing Process and Resolve the Nuclear  Waste Issue.''   Here is one of the whereases. ``Whereas, almost 1,000 nuclear devices  were detonated on the Nevada test site.''  [[Page H3894]]    ``Whereas, Nye County and eight other Nevada counties have passed  resolutions supporting the completion of the Yucca Mountain licensing  process by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to determine if Yucca  Mountain is safe.''   So, that is nine Nevada counties that say we should move forward.   ``Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Nye County Board of  Commissioners does hereby continue to support the efforts to complete  the Yucca Mountain licensing process and resolve the nuclear waste  issue.''   So, that is Nye County, which has the site of Yucca Mountain.                     Nye County Resolution No. 2020-11   A RESOLUTION OF THE NYE COUNTY BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS SUPPORTING     THE EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE YUCCA MOUNTAIN LICENSING PROCESS AND                      RESOLVE THE NUCLEAR WASTE ISSUE         Whereas, Nye County Nevada is the third largest county in       the continental United States comprising over 11 million       acres; and        Whereas, almost 98 percent of this land is under either       management or control of various agencies of the federal       government; and        Whereas, Department of Defense and Department of Energy       have withdrawn approximately 4 million acres from public       access and restricted this land to defense, nuclear and other       related government uses; and        Whereas, almost 1000 nuclear devices were detonated on the       Nevada Test Site; and        Whereas, the 1987 Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendment       selected Yucca Mountain as the single site to be studied, and       in 2002 Congress approved the site for development of a       repository; and        Whereas, Nuclear energy is needed to integrate with       renewable energy to significantly reduce CO2 emissions; and        Whereas, the United States has over 80,000 tons of Spent       Nuclear Fuel and large quantities of High-Level Waste and       other radioactive waste that will require isolation in       geologic repositories; and        Whereas, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act directs the       Department of Energy to pursue a licensing proceeding to       determine if Yucca Mountain is a safe site to house a       repository for Spent Fuel and High-Level nuclear waste; and        Whereas, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is directed by       the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to adjudicate if Yucca Mountain       is safe to house a nuclear waste repository; and        Whereas, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act has never been       repealed and remains the law of the land; and        Whereas, this waste is currently located in temporary       storage facilities at over 100 sites in 39 states; and        Whereas, reprocessing of spent fuel and fast reactors have       the potential to reduce the amount of waste generated in the       future, there will always be large quantities of radioactive       waste for geologic disposal; and        Whereas, Nye County and 8 other Nevada counties have passed       resolutions supporting the completion of the Yucca Mountain       licensing process by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to       determine if Yucca Mountain is safe; and        Whereas, the Nye County Board of County Commissioners have       approved multiple resolutions and letters to the federal       government asking for negotiations with Nye County and the       State of Nevada to identify a package that includes       mitigation and benefits for Nevada residents; and        Whereas, the federal government has made no serious efforts       to negotiate with State and local leaders or offer benefits       to residents of Nevada; and now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Nye County Board of Commissioners does       hereby continue to support the efforts to complete the Yucca       Mountain licensing process and resolve the nuclear waste       issue; and be it further        Resolved, That as part of that effort, Nye County supports       the use of innovative technologies to minimize the amount of       nuclear waste. The research and investments for these       technologies should be done in Nevada creating jobs and       enhancing Nevada's Universities; and be it further         Resolved, That pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act,       Nye County encourages the Trump Administration and Congress       to develop a benefit package that offers jobs, educational       benefits and with potential revenue for services to residents       and visitors of Nye County and the State of Nevada.        Passed, Adopted, and Approved the 7th day of April, 2020.        Ayes: Koenig, Strickland, Wichman, Cox, Blundo.        Absent: None.        Nayes: None.        Nye County Board of County Commissioners: John Koenig,       Chairman.        Attest: Kelly Sidman; Sandra L. Merlino, Nye County Clerk,       and Ex-Officio Clerk of the Board.     Mr. Speaker, what if we don't do this? Here is a chart.  Here is Yucca Mountain, secure, in the desert, underneath a mountain,  90 miles from Las Vegas.   Right here in this Chamber, we are 44 miles from the nearest nuclear  power plant. It just happens to be Calvert Cliffs. It is on the  Chesapeake Bay, and so it is close.   The State of Nevada will argue it will hurt our tourism. Well, let me  tell you, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City have more tourists  than Las Vegas and are closer to spent nuclear fuel than any other  place.   Again, it is a travesty that we spend $2.2 million every day for not  complying with the law. This bill does not help us comply with the law.  In fact, I would say this bill breaks the law, which is another example  for the great American public to observe how dysfunctional we are in  this day and age in the people's House. It saddens me.   I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.
