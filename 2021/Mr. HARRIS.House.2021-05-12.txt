 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and sacrifice  of Corporal Keith Heacook, a police officer whose funeral I attended on  Monday. He was tragically killed in a violent assault while responding  to an early morning domestic disturbance call. As a member of the  Delmar Police Department, a police force that straddles the Maryland- Delaware border, Corporal Heacook honorably and selflessly served not  just my district, but also the constituents of southern Delaware.   Mr. Speaker, it was appropriate that a man who laid down his life in  service to his community was given such a fitting funeral with over  1,000 law enforcement officers paying their final respects.   Coincidentally, this week, we honor the courage and sacrifice of all  our men and women in blue nationwide--men and women who literally put  their lives on the line every day so that we can live safely in our  homes and in our communities. Corporal Heacook leaves behind a widow  and a young son.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to join me in praying for his family  during this challenging time and for all the families of all the brave  men and women who have laid down their lives to protect us.                            ____________________
