The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided among and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform or       their respective designees and the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure       or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to commit.        Sec. 7.  House Resolution 1118 is hereby adopted.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 1119, providing for consideration of three measures.   The first is H.R. 6531, the Targeting Resources to Communities in  Need Act, under a closed rule. The rule self-executes a manager's  amendment from Chairwoman Maloney and provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform, and provides one motion to recommit.   The second is H.R. 7309, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity  Act, under a structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's  amendment from Chairman Scott, provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Education and Labor, makes in order 39 amendments,  provides en bloc authority, and provides one motion to recommit.   The third is S. 2938, to designate the United States Courthouse and  Federal Building located at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee,  Florida, as the ``Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and  Federal Building'' under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and  controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the Committees  on Oversight and Reform and Transportation and Infrastructure and  provides one motion to commit.   Finally, the rule deems passage of H. Res. 1118.   Mr. Speaker, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, known  around here as WIOA, is our Nation's flagship workforce development  law. WIOA is the culmination of decades of policymaking by Congress to  create a federally supported, State-managed system of programming for  job training, adult education, and career services, as well as programs  to connect employers with jobseekers, and help with placement,  recruitment, and retention.   WIOA helps achieve our country's key goals of reducing poverty and  driving economic growth by helping working Americans get the skills,  knowledge, and experience they need to successfully participate in  today's job market. With a new skill, certification, or degree, workers  can apply for better-paying jobs, earning more for themselves and their  families.   WIOA and its predecessors have been a successful formula for  workforce development for over 60 years, and today's bill will ensure  that WIOA can continue serving workers and their families in our  changing and dynamic economy.   Today's bill is an overdue reauthorization for WIOA. While the bill  makes a variety of important technical adjustments to keep the law  relevant as our economy changes and evolves, the bill also upholds the  core programs and services that have a demonstrated record of success.   The bill's main achievement is raising WIOA's funding levels to meet  the needs of our workforce. Since the 1980s, the number of working  Americans has doubled, but the funding for our workforce development  programs has fallen by over 60 percent even as jobs and our economy  have been invented and changed at a dizzying pace. Most of the drop in  funding happened within the last 20 years as that pace accelerated.   The story of WIOA is the same as that of many of our Nation's key  programs to help working families. Twenty years of harmful budget cuts  and misguided austerity led by Republican Presidents and Republican  majorities in Congress have resulted in WIOA lacking the proper funding  to meet the needs of the American workforce and to allow members of  that workforce to reach their full potential.   The funding authorized by this bill will allow WIOA programs to train  over 1 million workers a year, creating real, tangible benefits for  workers and employers. Put simply, with this boosted funding, workers  will be able to get better jobs, and businesses will be able to hire  better employees. That is a rare win-win policy achievement that we  should all be able to get behind.   Today's WIOA reauthorization bill also has an added focus on youth  employment opportunities, adult education, and support for formerly  incarcerated individuals.   The WIOA reauthorization bill will reauthorize programs to help  disadvantaged and disconnected youth and provide them with summer  programming, employment and educational opportunities, as well as  youth-specific training programs.   The bill will provide community colleges with funding and technical  assistance to offer employment and training programs for in-demand  industries--a successful model that we have seen utilized in my  community--and the bill will create a Department of Labor program to  specifically help individuals released from prison transition back to  the workforce.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight three of my amendments to  WIOA. As chair of the Congressional Youth Mentoring Caucus, one of my  priorities is to make sure that youth are able to access job training  and meaningful employment opportunities. We know that mentors can have  a positive impact on youth in their career exploration and early  employment opportunities.   My amendments will ensure that WIOA's programming better targets  youth who are most in need of services and is specifically geared to  ensure positive outcomes for young people. The amendments will make  summer and year-round employment opportunities accessible to more young  people.    Finally, the amendments will make sure that employers, programs, and  staff that mentor youth will have the tools required to provide the  support and skill development needed to help young people succeed in  their chosen careers.   All in all, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will address  both recent and long-term challenges in the labor market. Right now,  our economy has a shortage of approximately 4 million skilled workers,  and that shortage is expected to continue to grow. Reauthorizing WIOA  is a key to this problem, so I encourage all my colleagues to help  American workers and pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, sadly, this rule also includes three suspension bills  that failed on the floor after our Republican colleagues obstructed the  business of the House of Representatives.   Included in today's rule is the Targeting Resources to Communities in  Need Act and two naming bills which were all blocked by House  Republicans with no other purpose than to obstruct the work of Congress  on behalf of the American people.   Passing bills on suspension is one way in which Congress tries to  streamline its work in order to devote more time to the most pressing  issues of the day. Suspension bills are bipartisan bills narrowly  tailored to the problems they address. To get on the suspension  calendar and to be considered with an expedited process, a bill must  have demonstrated strong bipartisan support.   By the time a suspension bill gets called up on the House floor,  majorities of both Republicans and Democrats have to be willing to back  the bill. However, some of our colleagues across the aisle have  compromised the suspension system solely to waste the time of the  American people and for political theater.   One of the bills we must reconsider now is the Targeting Resources to  Communities in Need Act which would use proven strategies to improve  the direction of Federal funds to areas of persistent poverty. This  bill will greatly improve the effectiveness of many of our safety net,  housing, hunger, and job training programs.                                time  1245    The bill is bipartisan, bicameral, and would benefit low-income  Americans in both rural and urban communities. Yet, House Republicans  tanked the bill.   The other two bills would rename a courthouse after Judge Joseph  Hatchett and a post office after Representative Lynn Woolsey.   Joseph Hatchett was a pioneering Black lawyer and judge from the  State of Florida. Born into the Jim Crow south, Judge Hatchett set many  important firsts as a Black judge, ultimately becoming the first Black  man to serve on the Florida Supreme Court.   Judge Hatchett was a committed public servant for the State of  Florida, a fact recognized by both of Florida's Republican Senators and  all 27 of the State's Representatives who cosponsored the resolution to  name a Florida courthouse after Judge Hatchett.   And yet, House Republicans tanked this bill, too, including 10  Florida Republicans who had previously supported the measure.   What purpose does this stunt serve? What constituent base wants you  to do this? It is nonsense and a waste of everyone's time.   If a Member doesn't like a bill, that is fine. That is how this place  works. But we need to work together, in good faith, for the American  people. It is a bad-faith move to torpedo bipartisan suspension bills  at the last minute. It is bad for Congress, and it is bad for the  country.   This Congress has seen a worrying increase in this kind of  parliamentary nonsense from a small but vocal sect of the Republican  Party. And while it is a small group of Members who initiate this  nonsense, the whole party has been happy to go along with it.   With these three suspension bills, the minority leader continues his  long and troubling streak of being unable or unwilling to control the  behavior of the members of his party.   It is not a good path for our country. We have been trending down  this road for a while, and January 6 was the painful result of this  type of behavior.   We should not be here to fight each other. We should be here to help  the American people. Some of our colleagues seem to have lost sight of  that mission, and the whole country is paying the price.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will redirect the focus to the underlying bill that we are  considering with this rule, and that is the Workforce Innovation and  Opportunity Act.   The purpose of that bill is to unleash the full power of our  investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and the care economy. It  is essential that we have a skilled workforce to power those industries  forward.   Now, we have seen what can happen when we make those kinds of  investments. We have seen them in my district as we have invested in  training our young people through our technical institutes, through our  community colleges, with our employers, and with our apprenticeship  programs. We are seeing the fruits of that labor, as it were, as we see  people prepared to get the good jobs that we are bringing to our  region.   The continued investment in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity  Act is really critical for my part of the country and critical for  every district across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration  Policy in which the administration urges the House to pass the WIOA Act  of 2022.                     Statement of Administration Policy      H.R. 7309--Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022--Rep.             Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott, D-VA, and 55 cosponsors         To unleash the full power of investments in infrastructure,       clean energy, and the care economy, it is essential that we       have the skilled workforce to power those industries forward.       It is equally important that the benefits of new job creation       are shared by all Americans, and in particular those who have       traditionally been left behind in the labor market. The       Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 7309,       the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022, and       looks forward to working with the Senate on this critical       bill.        The public workforce system should adapt to dynamic and       rising demand for worker skills training and related       services. The U.S. currently invests just one-fifth of the       average amount spent on workforce and labor market programs       by advanced economies. Workforce development is critical to       strengthening our economy and increasing our competitiveness.       Our investments must match employers' needs and workers'       goals of finding and keeping good quality jobs.        The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022       authorizes three critical Administration priority programs as       new national programs--the Sectoral Employment through Career       Training for Occupational Readiness, Strengthening Community       Colleges, and Reentry Employment Opportunities programs.       These programs will ensure greater access to quality training       opportunities and supportive services, particularly in       infrastructure and supply chain sectors that will create       pathways for people in underserved communities to middle-      class jobs. H.R. 7309 also increases employment programming       for underserved youth, establishing a new funding stream for       summer and year-round employment activities to deliver young       people the work experience they need to connect with future       employment and education pathways.        The Administration urges the House to pass the Workforce       Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We all know that Americans are feeling pain at the gas pump, but Big  Oil companies are raking in billions upon billions of dollars. They had  record-breaking quarters about which they bragged to their shareholders  during 2021, with the top 25 companies making more than $205 billion in  profits last year.   As the war in Ukraine rages on, this is a time when we can all make  choices, choices that reflect our moral fiber. Instead of choosing to  do the right thing, oil and gas companies are choosing to take  advantage of American consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a May 7, 2022, USA Today article  titled ``Oil giants reap record profits as war rages in Ukraine, energy  prices soar: Here's how much they made.''                       [From USA Today, May 7, 2022]   Oil Giants Reap Record Profits as War Rages in Ukraine, Energy Prices                      Soar: Here's How Much They Made                        (By Wyatte Grantham-Philips)         As households around the globe struggle with rising energy       bills, some of the world's leading oil giants reported record       profits for the first three months of this year.        Profits for Exxon Mobil, Shell and more also rose by       billions despite significant costs of exiting operations and/      or investments in Russia amid war in Ukraine.        After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the price of oil       climbed in 2022's first quarter--as countries that rely       heavily on Russia for energy scrambled for alternative fuel       sources amid uncertainty.        The benchmark for global oil prices, Brent crude, averaged       at $102.23 a barrel during the first quarter--67 percent       higher than during the same period last year, according to       the Associated Press. In the United States, for example,       drivers have consequently found increasingly expensive gas       prices at the pump.        Home heating bills and electricity prices also inflated       worldwide--as natural gas prices climbed from $3.50 per       million British thermal units to about $5.60.        High oil and gas prices have boosted the profits of major       energy companies, further contributing to global inflation       and the cost-of-living crisis.        The net profit margin of S&P 500 companies, which include       energy giants such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil, in the first       quarter has been running at 12.3 percent based on estimates       and earnings reported so far, according to FactSet. That's       down from a peak of 13.1 percent in the second quarter of       last year, but above the pre-COVID-19 level of about 11       percent.        ``Profit margins should be coming down,'' Lindsay Owens,       executive director of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive       economic policy research group, previously told USA TODAY.       Instead, she noted, ``they're actually growing.''        Here's a breakdown of the profits and earnings some of the       world's oil giants made in the first three months of 2022:                     Shell earnings rise to $9.1 billion         In the first quarter, Shell's adjusted earnings rose to       $9.1 billion from $3.2 billion in the same period last year.       Net income rose to $7.3 billion from $5.8 billion in last       year's first quarter. Shell said that it would also take a       $3.9 billion charge to cover the cost of exiting investments       in Russia, which the London-based energy giant pledged to do       after the invasion of Ukraine.                        BP records $6.2 billion profit         BP posted its highest quarterly profit in over a decade--      with the British energy company announcing on Tuesday that       its underlying replacement cost profit rose to $6.2 billion       in the first three months of this year, more than doubling       the $2.6 billion from the same period last year.        BP PLC also said its net loss in the first quarter totaled       $23 billion, after accounting for a write-off of its nearly       20 percent stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response       to the Ukraine war.        Both BP and Shell's recent profit reports have contributed       to calls in Britain for the government to impose a tax on       energy companies' windfall earnings, in hopes of helping       consumers struggling with rising energy prices. Prime       Minister Boris Johnson has rejected the idea, saying the tax       would reduce investment in Britain during efforts to       diversify the country's energy industry.        The British government's ``refusal to tax the super-profits       of energy companies is completely unforgivable when people       are too terrified to heat their homes,'' Ed Davey, leader of       the Liberal Democrats, told the Associated Press.            Exxon doubles profits from last year to $5.48 billion         At the end of April, Exxon Mobil reported $5.48 billion in       profits during the first quarter of 2022--also more than       doubling its profits compared with the same period last year.       Revenue for the Irving, Texas-based company was $90.5       billion, far exceeding the revenue of $59.15 billion during       the same quarter in 2021.        But, after abandoning Russian operations due to the war,       Exxon also took a significant hit, writing down $3.4 billion.                     Chevron reports $6.26 billion profit         Also at the end of April, Chevron reported a quarterly       profit of $6.26 billion, over four times its earnings of $1.4       billion in the first quarter of last year. Revenue for the       San Ramon, California-based energy producer surged 41       percent, to $54.37 billion.                   Sinopec totals $3.45 billion net profit         According to Reuters, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, or       Sinopec, reported 22.61 billion yuan ($3.45 billion) net       profit under Chinese accounting standards for the first       quarter of 2022, compared to 17.93 billion yuan ($2.69       billion) last year.        Sinopec also saw a 25 percent surge in net income.               Phillips 66's adjusted earnings of $595 million         For the first quarter of the year, Phillips 66 reported       first-quarter earnings of $582 million, with adjusted       earnings of $595 million.        In 2021, Phillips 66 reported a first-quarter loss of $654       million, with an adjusted loss of $509 million.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule should be an easy one for this Congress to  pass, particularly if there were two parties here interested in solving  problems rather than just pointing blame.   It is clear that we need to reauthorize the Workforce Innovation and  Opportunity Act. WIOA is an investment in ourselves. It is an  investment in the American worker and the American economy. WIOA  creates and propels economic opportunity, particularly for our youth.  Passing the reauthorization bill will help millions of Americans get  better jobs to support themselves and their families. It will make it  easier for workers to get the skills and training needed to compete in  the modern job market, and it will maintain our country's  competitiveness in the global economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the rule today  and to support the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1119         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security,       encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum       products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 9 Cause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6858.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
