 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I  rise today to anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order  hour. I thank the Congressional Black Caucus chairman, Cedric Richmond,  for his leadership in this effort.   For the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to  the American people about issues of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constituents whom we  represent. Tonight's Special Order hour topic is Women's History Month.   Mr. Speaker, during Women's History Month, we salute phenomenal women  who refused to sit on the sidelines of history. After the passage of  the 19th Amendment, millions of women have continued to march like the  women who came before them.   For generations, women, particularly Black women, have been on the  front lines fighting for key rights for America's women, including the  right to equal pay, the right to equal access to educational  opportunities, and the right to equal access to opportunities in the  workplace.   In that spirit, I rise today on behalf of the Congressional Black  Caucus in reclaiming 2018 as the Year of the Black Woman. 2018, the  Year of the Black Woman--I like the sound of that. Black women are a  force to reckon with, and we shall not be moved.   New York, my hometown, has a longstanding and illustrious legacy of  leading the way to advance women's rights, from Seneca Falls to the  United States Congress, and even on the road to the White House. It was  where Madam C.J. Walker and Billie Holiday laid down their roots. It  was the home of the late great Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the  first African-American woman to serve in this distinguished House and  whose congressional district I represent today.   ``I am not a candidate of Black America, although I am Black and  proud. I am not a candidate of the women's movement of this country,  although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of that. . . . I am the  candidate of the people of America.'' These are the words she spoke.   This year marks the 50th anniversary of Shirley Chisholm's election  to the House of Representatives as the reformer from Brooklyn and the  46th anniversary of her historic bid for the Presidency. In doing so,  Shirley Chisholm blazed a pathway for millions of girls and women to  dream unthinkable dreams.   Shirley Chisholm's labor and contribution to Brooklyn, Congress, and  the Nation continues to bear fruit today. She paved the way for many of  the women, myself included, to run for elected office at all levels.   Shirley Chisholm opposed war, racism, sexism, and inequality. She  stood up to Republicans and demanded more from her own party. She won;  she lost; she never backed down.   Forty-six years ago, the unbossed and unbought Shirley Chisholm  announced her candidacy for President of the United States, making her  the first woman in history to run for the highest office in the land. I  can because she did.   Congresswoman Chisholm used the authority of her experience to create  nutrition assistance programs, expand healthcare services for parents  and children, increase the minimum wage, support the veterans of our  Armed Forces, and provide opportunities for women in college, graduate  school, and collegiate and professional sports with the enactment of  title IX.   But that is not all. Shirley Chisholm pushed this country forward. I  can recall growing up in Brooklyn and just being so proud as a young  girl growing up knowing that there was a woman who looked like me who  came from my neighborhood, who came from my origins, sitting here in  the House of Representatives. She was somewhat of a rock star in  Brooklyn.   Her intellect, her ability, her savviness was something that she  exuded in every environment that she found herself. She was pretty  stylish as well. But it was, indeed, her strategic thinking and her  ability to be a voice for the voiceless that really propelled Shirley  Chisholm into the hearts and minds of all Americans.   Shirley Chisholm pushed this country forward, and for this and other  reasons, she deserves a permanent place among other figures of United  States history right here in the Capitol.    In January, I introduced H.R. 4856, what I have named the Shirley  Chisholm Statue Bill. The bill would do just that, honor Shirley  Chisholm's legacy with a permanent statue among those statues in our  hollowed Halls. H.R. 4856 directs the United States Joint Committee on  the Library, which is responsible for oversight of the operations of  the Library of Congress and the management of Statuary Hall Collection,  to obtain a statue of Chisholm  [[Page H1689]]  for permanent placement in the United States Capitol. I am very pleased  to say that over 70 Members of the United States House of  Representatives are cosponsors.   My sister, colleague, and friend, Senator Kamala Harris of  California, in late February, introduced the companion bill. Among  Senate cosponsors are the CBC members Senator Cory Booker of New  Jersey, in addition to Senators Warren and Sanders, and my Senators,  Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well.   Senator Harris and I agree, Shirley Chisholm created a path for Black  women Members of Congress who have served after her. ``Her legacy  encourages us to keep up the fight for our most voiceless and  vulnerable,'' Senator Harris stated.   Mr. Speaker, Rosa and Sojourner, giant figures in American history  and the only two African-American women cemented permanently here in  the Capitol, are lonely. Mr. Speaker, I hope that you will join us in  this effort. Let's pass the Shirley Chisholm Statue Bill right away.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence), one of the staunch supporters of women's rights here on  Capitol Hill and co-chair of the Bipartisan Women's Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her  extraordinary comments this evening, really highlighting the triumphs  and the challenges of both race and gender when we talk about Black  women.   This is Women's History Month. We want to bring a unique lens to the  conversation of Women's History Month because oftentimes, indeed, Black  women tend to be the hidden figures.                                time  2030    Having said that, it is now my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from  California, the honorable Barbara Lee, one of the outstanding mentors  and Black women here in Congress who has done extraordinary work,  whether it is in leading the conscience of this Congress around the  Iraq war or many other causes that we have seen her leadership as a  north star to really making this Nation the best that it can be. It is  my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  California for her eloquent presentation this evening.   It is now my honor and privilege to bring to the floor the gentleman  from the great State of Pennsylvania, the great city of Philadelphia,  the city of brotherly love and sisterly affection, the honorable Dwight  Evans of the Second Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for really bringing to the fore all of these extraordinary  Black women in Philadelphia. It is unfortunate that our history, when  it comes to gender parity, does not extol the virtues of everyone who  is really laboring in the vineyard, oftentimes trailblazers and making  things happen for communities, municipalities, and States across this  Nation. Again, we are illuminating hidden figures this evening, and I  want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for doing such a  tremendous job.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), who is just across the river  from the district that I represent in New York.   The gentleman has been an extraordinary advocate for communities of  color in the State of New Jersey. He has done a tremendous job in work  on the Committee on Homeland Security. I know he has been an advocate  for promoting and putting forth Black women in leadership positions. He  was responsible for electing the very first Black woman to be  Lieutenant Governor of the State of New Jersey. The Honorable  Donald  Payne, Jr., represents of the 10th District of New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank the  gentleman from New Jersey for highlighting all of the ways in which  Black women have excelled beyond expectation, despite all the  challenges and the obstacles that they have faced.   We continue to see Black women rise, and I want to thank the  gentleman for his observations, for his experience, and his  interactions as part of this Special Order hour. We know that, again,  these are hidden figures, but today I say hidden no more. They are in  the Congressional Record, and I thank the gentleman for adding such  richness to the Record this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  The Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee will be sharing with us her insights  [[Page H1692]]  during this Special Order hour as we highlight the accomplishments and  we speak to the concerns in the Year of the Black Woman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Texas for bringing to the floor so many of the issues that Black women  have been in the lead on or have been fighting for, such as social  justice and criminal justice reform, which is the hallmark of the  leadership of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. We are grateful to her  for expressing today all of these obstacles that we must overcome and  that we are focused on here in the House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Michigan for sharing those quotes with us this evening.   It is so important, in terms of inspiration and motivation, that we  are able to pull from the work that is being done by Black women and  those who have preceded us.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this moment, because I would be remiss if  I did not take this opportunity to honor another distinguished woman  from New York, the dearly departed Congresswoman Louise Slaughter from  New York's 25th District.   Words cannot adequately express the sense of sadness that I and many  in my delegation feel to have received word of the passing of  Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, the dean of the New York delegation.   Ms. Slaughter dedicated her life's work to the people of western New  York and, indeed, all Americans across our great Nation. She embodied a  spirit of strength, wisdom, grace, and beauty, inside and out.   She represented the very best of the American spirit, our values, and  our ideals. She was a trailblazer. She was the first woman to serve as  chair and ranking member of the powerful House Rules Committee. She  commanded the respect and admiration of her colleagues.   Having had the honor of serving with her has enriched my passion for  service and my commitment to fight for the most vulnerable amongst us.  She is, indeed, a woman on whose shoulders I stand. The United States  Congress has lost an esteemed leader, the New York delegation has lost  a beloved dean, and I have lost a cherished friend and mentor.   My thoughts and my prayers are with her three daughters, Megan, Amy,  and Emily; and her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In this time  of their bereavement, we extend our deepest condolences.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
