 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we begin the proceeding here on the Ways and Means portion of the  legislation, I want to begin by calling attention to the untimely and  tragic loss of our colleague, Jackie Walorski, and two members of her  staff.   Jackie was a force on the committee, as well as the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Worker and Family Support. She led with deep  commitment to children and families and was well regarded as a member  of the community, a real humanitarian.   You couldn't miss her bright smile or her booming laugh. She embodied  what it meant to serve.   When she called me ``Mr. Chairman,'' as she always did in the  hallway, loudly, with a booming voice, I know she meant it.   We were all lucky to have had her as a colleague and even luckier to  be able to call her a friend.   The families and loved ones of Congresswoman Walorski, Emma Thomson,  and Zachery Potts remain in our thoughts and prayers. May they rest in  peace, as valued Members of the Ways and Means family.   Madam Speaker, I rise in full support of the Inflation Reduction Act.  I look forward, as I have in the past, to this moment, reciting the  wisdom that is often referenced by me, because the words come from  another son of Massachusetts, Mr. Webster.   Over the Speaker's rostrum that adorns this marvelous institution,  which I love, the quote is simple: ``Let us develop the resources of  our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, and promote  all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and  generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.''   The Inflation Reduction Act is something worthy of being remembered.  This is substantive and transformative legislation, a reminder to all  that in the legislative life and its rhythms, we generally pursue  perfection but accept the possible. Part of that is what we are marking  at this moment.   This is a historic win for family pocketbooks, for Americans' health,  and for the future of climate security. We fund these gains by ensuring  that large, profitable companies pay their fair share, just like all  members of the American family are asked to do.                                time  1315    The Inflation Reduction Act will lower costs. For the first time,  Medicare will negotiate drug prices, and there will be a cap on what  comes out of seniors' pockets for their lifesaving prescriptions. No  more rationing or forgoing necessary medicines.   We are lowering healthcare costs for millions of low-income and  middle-income Americans by extending the Affordable Care Act's premium  tax credit enhancements through 2025.   Let me give you a statistic that is compelling. Madam Speaker, 100  percent of the children in Massachusetts have health insurance, and 97  percent of the adults in Massachusetts have health insurance. It polls  extraordinarily well in terms of its success ratios because we  decided--labor, business, Democrat, and Republican--to make it work,  and we did.   These enhanced premium credits, first enacted by the American Rescue  Plan, have made way for record-low uninsured rates that have put  hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of low- and middle-income  Americans.   This legislation will also make the largest investment in tackling  climate  [[Page H7660]]  change that our Nation has ever witnessed. The investments in clean  energy, energy efficiency, and clean manufacturing will generate 9  million good-paying jobs.   These historic wins are achieved with sensible and responsible  multiyear investments in the IRS.   I have been a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Madam Speaker,  for 30 years. Let me give our friends an interesting statistic about  the American family. We have the highest voluntary compliance rate in  the world. Eighty-six percent of the American people pay their taxes.  This idea that we are creating 87,000 armed representatives of the  Federal Government to go out and harass the American people is  nonsensical. Retirements alone are going to require a substantive  investment. The IRS has fewer than 20 percent of the employees that it  once did.   What is important to remember here is this: We want to make sure with  this investment in the IRS that we continue to have a high voluntary  compliance rate and also to invest in the necessary technology that  will allow the modeling to make sure compliance remains with us, as  well.   These are historical investments and achievements, and they also are  going to continue our quest on the Democratic side here for an element  of tax fairness that will hold people at the very top as responsible as  the other side likes to hold people who receive the EITC tax credit in  terms of their request for audits. We do this simply by asking the most  powerful among us to pay their fair share. This is what a full and fair  tax administration is about.   The American people have been through an unthinkable hardship over  the last 2\1/2\ years, but they entrusted Joe Biden and congressional  Democrats to keep them safe and to rebuild our economy.   Here is a fact: On March 11, 2020, Dr. Fauci gave his warning. He  warned us of what was coming. In April 2020, America had lost 22  million jobs. Here we are, 2 years later, in the Biden administration,  and every job has been returned. There are 10.6 million jobs that go  unanswered right now in the American economy.   We have bounced back faster than we imagined. Not only have all these  jobs been returned, but for 51 straight days, gasoline prices have  fallen.   That is an issue about supply and demand, by the way. It is about  international events, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and  supply chains across the world. Those chains that I have just  referenced have been shored up, and retailers are starting to  realistically address some speculation as it relates to price.   Democrats shouldn't be asked to do this alone, but we are being asked  to do it today alone.   We are going to hear a lot of Washington talk from folks on the other  side that want to address the politics of the situation rather than cap  the cost of insulin for their constituents. They want to protect the  pocketbooks of those who would raise prescription drug prices  unnecessarily and cut costs for workers and their families, which we  intend to do.   You are going to hear a lot of spin on this bill that has received a  lot of endorsements, even from bipartisan former Treasury Secretaries,  but that is because the opponents are out of options.   The Inflation Reduction Act sets our Nation on a healthier, fairer,  and more prosperous path. We have heard the calls of the American  people, and with the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to win this  moment for them in its totality.   Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the very  accomplished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who has had a profound influence on the  renewable energy part of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), who is retiring but has made many valued  contributions to our Nation and committee.    Madam Speaker, the bill we are considering in the House  today, the Inflation Reduction Act, started in the House of  Representatives as the Build Back Better Act.   Three years ago, all Democratic Members of the Ways and Means  Committee introduced the GREEN Act as the Committee's consensus  legislation for tax priorities relating to climate, clean energy, and  energy efficiency. The GREEN Act was reintroduced, again with all Ways  and Means Democrats, in the 117th Congress.   The GREEN Act formed the base of the climate and energy subtitle of  the Build Back Better Act, which the Ways and Means Committee marked up  in September 2021 and passed out of the House, following significant  input from the Senate, in November 2021. Many provisions of Subtitle D  of the Inflation Reduction Act remain substantially similar to those  that the House developed and passed.   As the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I wish to offer  additional detail on the legislative intent behind certain provisions  included in this legislation.   This legislation provides long-term extensions of tax credits for  renewable technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower  by extending section 45 and section 48 and enacting their successor  credits under sec. 45Y and section 48E. These provisions were drafted  with the goal of unleashing clean energy deployment, in line with  President Biden's pledge of a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels  in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. Additionally,  this legislation provides enhanced credit amounts for projects  additional goals, such as those meeting domestic content requirements  or located in energy communities.   Currently, these renewable energy tax credits often remain out of  reach for low-income communities, which disproportionately bear the  burden of pollution. The Committee believes that our renewable energy  deployment should align with President Biden's Justice40 initiative,  which aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of federal  investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities.  To achieve these goals, we must bring all resources to bear across all  agencies--the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Energy, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the White House Council on  Environmental Quality, and more. For example, the Council on  Environmental Quality has developed a tool to assist federal agencies  with best targeting resources towards disadvantaged communities.   This goal is closely aligned with a provision that I am proud to have  worked with Rep. Danny Davis to include in this legislation. H.R. 5183,  provides an enhanced investment tax credit for projects in connection  with low-income communities, and is included in new section 45(e) and  section 48E(h) in this legislation. It draws on the success in  California of a clean energy program that helps hundreds of thousands  of low-income residents in multifamily housing enjoy the cost savings  and environmental advantages of solar.   This program provides allocated bonus credits for projects benefiting  low-income residents, including multifamily housing, community solar,  and individual low-income residential homeowners. The Committee intends  that the program prioritize low-income individuals and communities  throughout the selection process. Low-income individuals can benefit  from this legislation in multiple ways, including in the form of lower  electricity bills, reduction in locally harmful air pollution,  inclusive economic opportunities through training and employment on  such projects, and benefits to the community proven through active  engagement and outreach to community members. Thus, in selecting  projects for allocation, the Committee intends for the Secretary to  take into account which projects demonstrate the greatest health and  economic benefits for disadvantaged individuals (including benefits  related to the ability to withstand extreme weather events); the  greatest employment and wages for such individuals; and the greatest  engagement with and outreach to such individuals, including through  partnerships with local governments, community-based organizations, and  Indian tribal governments.   Additionally, this legislation is designed to provide maximum  flexibility to the Secretary in designing an efficient application and  allocation process to meet the needs of low-income residents.  Specifically, the legislation is intended to allow residential rooftop  providers to identify potential customers in qualifying census tracts  and submit applications to serve these customers up-front, before these  businesses have contractually engaged these customers. My understanding  is that these businesses will need to know if they have received a  credit allocation before they can offer the benefits of the credit to  these customers so that businesses can provide customers accurate  pricing information and cost savings to low-income customers.   This legislation also makes several important additions to the  property eligible under the section 48 investment tax credit and its  successor credit, section 48E.   The first is the addition of energy storage technologies. This  provision originated as H.R. 1684, the Energy Storage Tax Incentive and  Deployment, as advanced by Representatives Mike Doyle and Earl  Blumenauer, and included in the GREEN Act and the Build Back Better  Act. It is the Committee's intent that the technologies included in  H.R. 1684, such as pumped hydropower, are considered energy storage  technologies for this legislation.   Pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities are sometimes called water  batteries. Electricity is used to pump water from a lower to an upper  reservoir. When needed, this water is then released and run through  turbines to convert the stored energy back into electricity.   The definition of energy storage technologies includes ``property . .  . which receives, stores, and delivers energy for conversion to  electricity'' under new section 48(c)(6)(A)(i). Thus, it is the  Committee's intent such property not only include the two reservoirs as  well as the pipe and pump to move the water uphill, but also the  turbines and step-up transformer to convert the stored energy back into  electricity.   Additionally, relating to the coordination of the credit for energy  storage technologies and the section 45 production tax credit, the  Committee intends that a credit is allowed for energy storage  technology under section 48 regardless of whether it is part of a  facility for which a credit under section 45 is or has been allowed.   The second is the addition of electrochromatic glass, also known as  dynamic glass, to section 48(a)(3)(A)(ii). It is the Committee's intent  that the basis for such property should include the cost of the glass  itself including the devices, the wiring and other components necessary  for the glass to change its light transmittance properties, as well as  the window frame and the capitalized costs for the installation of  these and any other related components.   Additionally, this legislation creates new section 45W, the credit  for qualified commercial clean vehicles, to incentivize clean vehicles  and mobile machinery. In including mobile  [[Page H7665]]  machinery, the Committee intends to incentivize cleaner farm equipment,  construction equipment, and other equipment. As the Secretary develops  regulations or other guidance to carry out the purposes of this  section, the Committee believes it is appropriate to consider industry  standards when applying rules in the section that reference vehicles.  For example, the Secretary may look established methods of determining  equipment weight for purposes of determining credit limits based upon  gross vehicle weights and may allow, as a substitute, other commonly  used identification or serial numbers when administering the vehicle  identification number requIrements.   This legislation is historic, and I look forward to seeing the impact  these, and the many other clean energy incentives contained in this  bill, have on our carbon reduction goals in the coming years.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who is always pleased to let us know what he  is thinking.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), one of the most talented members of the  committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this is misinformation about the IRS. They need the  funding to better serve the American people. The idea that, all of a  sudden, there is an army of IRS agents that is coming after the  American family doesn't stand up under the magnifying glass of critical  analysis.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Higgins), a really capable member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, a reminder that there are, I believe, almost  600,425 Medicare beneficiaries who have diabetes in Pennsylvania. It is  important that the bill that we have caps insulin costs.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama  (Ms. Sewell), a terrific member of the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is well known for her work in the  renewable energy field.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Chu), whose work in the arena of renewable energy  is well known.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip of the Democratic  Caucus, whose district I have visited.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), who has had a profound influence on this  legislation and knows it inside and out.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), who is a very valued member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the very capable  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    I will be the first to acknowledge that, Madam Speaker. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is a big day, and this is a big deal. We are putting people out  front and making good on the promises we have made, lowering drug  prices and investing in our climate.   A mountain-high pile of legislative achievements have we: the  American Rescue Plan, the CHIPS and Science Act, and now this  achievement for the American people.   Lyndon Johnson was right: ``Yesterday is not ours to recover, but  tomorrow is ours to win or lose.''   With the Inflation Reduction Act headed to the President's desk--and  give Joe Biden credit--we stand here assured that tomorrow is ours to  win.   We have had bold dreams in this Congress, and we have delivered big  on those dreams. None of this would have been possible without the  dedication and expertise of the staff of the Ways and Means Committee,  the best in the business. They have worked nonstop for 2 years for the  American people, and today, their hard work is on display for the world  to witness and await the President's signature.   The Inflation Reduction Act sets our Nation on a healthier, fairer,  and more prosperous path.   Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support this critical  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
