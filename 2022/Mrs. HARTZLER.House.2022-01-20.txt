 Mr. Speaker, as I stand at this podium, I will speak  for about 60 seconds, and within those 60 seconds, an unborn baby will  lose its life. In fact, in America, an unborn baby will have its life  ripped away every 50 seconds through the gruesome procedure of  abortion. This is about 630,000 unborn lives lost per year--a number  that equals about 80 percent of my congressional district.   This is tragic. God has a plan for these children. They are our  brothers, sisters, friends, and loved ones. They are future leaders,  nurses, doctors, farmers, and small business owners. But, most  importantly, they are human beings with a purpose from our Creator.  There is nothing more hideous than taking the life of the most  vulnerable in our society.   Forty-nine years ago, the decision made by the Supreme Court in Roe  v. Wade has resulted in the death of over 62\1/2\ million unborn  babies. Despite the three-quarters of Americans who want significant  restrictions on abortions, my colleagues across the aisle are still  prioritizing their abortion-on-demand agenda.   This is senseless. Together, as a nation, we must make this the last  year we speak on this horrible anniversary. We cannot wait another 50  seconds, another 50 months, or another 50 years. Everyone is entitled  to the right to life.                            ____________________
