 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  flagrantly unconstitutional gun control act. This bill is yet another  attack on our God-given rights to self-defense.   For instance, the bill would provide taxpayer dollars for State-level  gun confiscations without due process.   We constantly hear this constant theme from the left on how you can't  be pro-life and pro-gun, which I think is poignant to point out today.  For those who say you can't be pro-life and pro-gun, why did you send  billions of dollars of guns to Ukraine to help them save their lives  against the Russians?   You sent billions of dollars of guns over there so that our soldiers  wouldn't have to go over there and fight a war to save their lives.  Guns save lives, or you wouldn't have been sending the money over  there.   Our Founding Father, George Mason, who wrote the Virginia Declaration  of Rights on which our Constitution's Bill of Rights is based, once  said: To disarm the people is the most effectual way to enslave them.
