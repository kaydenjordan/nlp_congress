 Madam President, yesterday the Foreign Relations  Committee finished consideration of Mike Pompeo's nomination to serve  as our Nation's 70th Secretary of State. They reported his nomination  to the full Senate with a favorable recommendation. Later this week, we  will take their advice, and we will vote to confirm him.   We will be lucky to have this capable public servant on the job. We  know Mike Pompeo is up to the task. After all, we confirmed him with a  comfortable and bipartisan majority to lead the CIA. In one of the most  sensitive positions in our government, the quality of his leadership  was directly linked to the security of the American people.   West Point valedictorian, Harvard Law, U.S. Army officer, a  successful businessman, and three-term Congressman serving on the House  Intelligence Committee--this is the resume that Mike Pompeo brought to  the top job at the CIA with the support of a bipartisan supermajority  of the Senate, and, by all accounts, his tenure there has been a big  success. The caliber of Mike's leadership and the quality of his  counsel have won him the respect of our National Clandestine Service  and the confidence of the President.   Just recently, Director Pompeo undertook sensitive conversations with  representatives of North Korea to lay the groundwork for efforts aimed  at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.   As he steps into this new mission as Secretary of State, he clearly  enjoys the confidence of the President, and throughout his testimony  before the Foreign Relations Committee, he demonstrated expertise and  professionalism.   Fortunately, even as so many of President Trump's well-qualified  nominees are obstructed and delayed without reason, a bipartisan  majority of Senators have already signaled their intention to vote to  confirm Mike Pompeo. We have the nominee, we have the votes, and we  will confirm our next Secretary of State this week.   Then, I hope we can build on this bipartisan momentum and process  more of the President's qualified nominees                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, our Nation's  opioid epidemic continues to plague communities and families in my home  State of Kentucky and across the Nation. Here in Congress, we are doing  our best to support the healthcare and law enforcement professionals  who are battling it every single day.   Last week, I introduced the Protecting Moms and Infants Act, a  bipartisan effort to confront the heartbreaking cases of prenatal and  infant opioid addiction. It builds on my 2015 bill, the Protecting Our  Infants Act, and Congress's other recent progress on this issue.   In recent years, Congress has bolstered prevention, treatment, and  enforcement efforts through the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery  Act and the 21st Century Cures Act, and the recent government funding  bill dedicated a record level of resources to saving lives from heroin  and prescription drug abuse.   But much more work remains. So today I am proud to announce  legislation to address this crisis' devastating effects on the American  worker and the American workforce.   Stable employment is not just a path to financial security for  workers and families. Earning a paycheck from a job is also linked to  personal happiness and even physical health. We see firsthand in  Kentucky the need for the structure and support that come with a job to  help keep former addicts from falling back into the cycle of addiction.  According to the CEO of a treatment facility in Louisville, ``stable  housing and employment are vitally tied to an individual's recovery.''  But, unfortunately, in the very communities where employment could do  so much, the opioid crisis itself is making it harder to attain.   I frequently hear Kentucky employers cite substance abuse as a major  hurdle to finding and hiring suitable  [[Page S2360]]  applicants. One study traced roughly 25 percent of the decline in  workforce participation between 1999 and 2015 to the opioid crisis.  That amounts to about 1 million missing workers. It is no wonder that  the Trump administration reports that the epidemic cost our economy a  half trillion dollars in 2015 alone.   The economic cost pales in comparison to the human cost that  addiction and joblessness inflict. The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery  through Effective Employment and Reentry Act, or CAREER Act, would  bring targeted relief to the States most devastated by substance abuse.  This State-based pilot program would encourage local businesses and  treatment groups to form partnerships to help those in recovery find  and maintain employment.   The legislation expands housing block grants to encourage more  transitional housing options for recovering addicts until they secure  permanent arrangements. It gives States more flexibility to spend  Federal career services and training funds to support specific  initiatives dedicated to helping individuals transition from treatment  to the workforce. In short, this bill does exactly what the experts  tell us needs to be done on this front.   This morning, Chairman Alexander and the HELP Committee are reviewing  comprehensive opioid legislation. I commend the chairman for his  diligent efforts on this subject. It is my hope that the committee will  choose to include some of the proposals in the Protecting Moms and  Infants Act and the CAREER Act in the larger package that they are  developing.   This epidemic requires our continued attention. On behalf of those in  Kentucky and all over the country who are struggling, we are determined  to keep doing our part.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on one final matter, the passage  of Republicans' historic tax reform last December was just the latest  illustration of the diverging paths Republicans and Democrats envision  for our economy.   For the better part of the last decade, our Democratic colleagues'  ideas ran their course. We were promised that they would help us  recover from the financial crisis. But it wasn't a recovery for all  Americans. In fact, the path put forward by our Democratic colleagues  had two distinct lanes. The express lane was for major cities like New  York and San Francisco. Urban areas with more than 1 million residents  captured 90 percent of the Nation's population growth and nearly 75  percent of new jobs created between 2010 and 2016. Seventy-five percent  of new jobs created between 2010 and 2016 went to these large urban  areas.   Those select communities actually made up some ground, but working  families and job creators in America's smaller cities, towns, and rural  communities were stuck in the slow lane. There, job opportunities dried  up as investment dollars hit the road. There, Americans learned what it  feels like when Washington, DC, leaves you behind. But, fortunately,  these communities are among the first to feel the benefits of the new  Republican approach.   The historic tax relief we passed last year cut taxes for American  families and gave employers more flexibility to expand, hire, and give  their workers bonuses, raises, and new benefits.   As my colleague Senator Young reports, the results in Indiana are  adding up. He heard from a Hoosier in Cedar Lake who is expanding his  family milk-hauling business, and a Kokomo small business owner who is  now hiring more workers. I recently read that over in Ellettsville, one  family has found an additional $200 in their monthly paychecks--enough  to cover a week's worth of groceries.   I don't think my colleagues across the aisle intended to make life  more difficult for middle-class families across the country. It is just  that these leftwing policies make it harder, not easier, for American  workers and job creators to actually get ahead. But when my Democratic  friends had the chance to join us and deliver historic tax relief to  American families, they stood firm and tried to block tax relief on a  party-line basis. One of Indiana's own Senators tried to block all that  good Indiana news from happening.   I am proud that Republicans overcame that obstruction and got tax  reform accomplished for all Americans.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
