 Mr. Speaker, last month, I was privileged to stand  in the city of David, the site of ancient Jerusalem.   Just a few feet from the Western Wall, the city of David is the place  where Jerusalem began. It is a place I have regularly visited over the  past few years, joined by my fellow Members of Congress, Republicans  and Democrats alike.   I can think of no better place than the city of David to express that  the United States knows what the Jewish people have known for 3,000  years: Jerusalem is the historic capital of Israel.   This reality was reinforced when the United States correctly  relocated our Embassy to Jerusalem earlier this year. I call upon more  countries to do the same.   The historic bond is evidenced by the incredible discoveries that are  being unearthed in the archeological excavations throughout the city of  David. These excavations affirm the millennia-old connection of the  Jewish people to Jerusalem not as a matter of faith, but as a matter of  historical fact, despite UNESCO's ongoing, shameful efforts to declare  otherwise.   Among the most significant discoveries presently being unearthed in  the city of David is the ancient pilgrimage road. Built over 2,000  years ago, the pilgrimage road, running from the Pool of Siloam at the  southern tip of the city of David to the footsteps of the Western Wall  and Temple Mount, served as the main thoroughfare of the Second Temple  Jerusalem. Millions of people joined together to ascend to the temple  during the festivals of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.   Both the pilgrimage road and the Pool of Siloam have deep  significance to Jews and Christians alike. It holds profound meaning to  countless millions of Americans. Antiquities discovered along the  pilgrimage road tell the story of both the vibrant culture of the  Second Temple period Jerusalem and the devastating destruction of  Jerusalem at the hands of the Romans, which ended tragically in the  year 70 C.E.   In the future, visitors of all faiths and backgrounds will be able to  walk this route of their ancestors, upon the very flagstones as their  ancestors 2,000 years ago.   In the Givati parking lot excavation, another excavation in the city  of David, 10 layers of ancient Jerusalem civilization dating back some  2,700 years have been uncovered. The layers include Jewish, Greek,  Roman, Byzantine, Persian, Muslim, Crusader, and Ottoman. So each  visitor to the city of David can truly say: ``I also have a connection  to Jerusalem.''   In this very excavation, as you can see in this poster, in a  structure dating back 2,500 years to the Biblical First Temple period  in Jerusalem, a seal with ancient Hebrew writing was found. I have a  replica of that seal in my office, which was presented to me in a  meeting I had with Ze'ev Orenstein, a representative from the city of  David, together with my colleague, Congressman Eliot Engel. On the seal  was the name Eliana, daughter of Ga'el. I can't even begin to describe  my emotions when I learned that a seal with almost my very own name was  found in the city of David.   I, like countless Americans, feel a deep, personal connection to  Jerusalem, her history, her heritage, and her holiness.                                time  1100    In fact, it is only over the last 51 years of Israel's sovereignty in  Jerusalem that people of all faiths and all backgrounds have enjoyed  freedom of access and worship at their holy sites, whether they are  Christians, whether they are Jewish, whether they are Muslims. Such  freedoms cannot be taken for granted in the Middle East where, with the  very exception of Israel, the only democracy in the region, they are  not easy to find.   During the nearly 3 decades that I have had the honor of serving this  wonderful institution, support for Jerusalem as the capital of the  Jewish State of Israel has been bipartisan, and I call on my colleagues  from both sides of the aisle in the coming Congress to ensure that that  never changes, to ensure that the historic bond between the Jewish  people and Jerusalem remains undeniable.   Together with millions of Americans, I salute the work of the City of  David Foundation and especially my friend Ze'ev, who did not even want  me to mention him--tough--in uncovering our shared history in  Jerusalem, making it accessible to all of us who want to experience  these discoveries for themselves.   So congratulations to Ze'ev--I have said it again--for the  discoveries at the City of David. Many more to come.
