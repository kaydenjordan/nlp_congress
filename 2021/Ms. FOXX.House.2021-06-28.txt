 Madam Speaker, recently, two high school members of the  Shelby American Legion Post 82 were selected as participants for the  Boys Nation program in Washington. This is the first time that the  Shelby American Legion Post 82 has ever had two candidates selected to  participate in this prestigious educational program.   Robert Stockham of Pinnacle Classical Academy and Zachary Morrow of  Burns High School will spend 1 week in Washington learning about the  structure and function of the Federal Government. This opportunity,  through The American Legion, is important, and I am confident these two  young men will make the most of this experience.   Congratulations to both Zachary and Robert on this significant  accomplishment.                            ____________________
