 Mr. Speaker, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes put it:  ``Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.''   I rise today because, with the enactment of the Republican tax bill,  the American people have been getting the short end of that deal.   When the majority jammed through their tax bill, we all knew it was a  massive giveaway to the super-wealthy and the well-connected.   Now we see the evidence, tax day. The vast majority of tax cuts have  gone to stock buybacks, dividends, and corporate mergers, while only a  sliver of the benefits have found their way to American workers.   On top of that, it will be ordinary Americans and our children and  grandchildren who will shoulder the trillions of dollars of debt and  threats to cut the very Federal programs that help them and their  families make ends meet.   Americans deserve better than the Republican tax bill, massive debt,  and never-ending dysfunction. They deserve better jobs, better wages,  and a better future.                            ____________________
