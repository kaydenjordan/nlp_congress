 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act  of 2021. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this measure.   I'm so pleased to see bipartisan support for this bill. Providing  older workers with the legal tools they need to challenge unjust  discrimination in the workplace should not be a partisan issue.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, our workforce is working  longer than they have before. Those who are still working at or above  the retirement age may be forced to do so because they have no other  choice.   This vulnerable part of the American workforce deserves to have the  same promotions and prospects as any other age group in a truly fair  labor force. Unfortunately, age-based discrimination in the workplace  can make it difficult for older individuals.   And since a 2009 Supreme Court ruling, employees who felt that they  were wrongly discriminated against based on age have had to meet a much  more burdensome standard to get relief in court under federal law.   That ruling went against decades of legal precedent and weakened  protections for our working class, burdening victims and shielding  those employers who in engage in discriminatory actions from  accountability.   That is why it is so important that we pass H.R. 2062, and help older  workers who have suffered discrimination.   Those facing discrimination should not have to jump through more  hoops to ensure that their rights are protected. As noted by the  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, ``The ability to enjoy  employment opportunities, free from unlawful discrimination, is key to  promoting economic security for marginalized and multi-marginalized  communities.''   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill to protect our  American workers and hold companies accountable for discriminatory  practices.   I thank the Chairman for his leadership on this issue.
