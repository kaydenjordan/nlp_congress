 Madam Speaker, with the Second World War  raging, Eleanor Roosevelt noted that: ``When all is said and done, and  the statesmen discuss the future of the world, the fact remains that  people fight these wars.''   The war on the pandemic is being waged in our crowded hospitals, our  empty classrooms, and our closed businesses. Today's bill will bring  Americans desperately needed relief, and I am deeply grateful for the  victories that Democrats secured.   But the pandemic has exposed the deep income, racial, and health  disparities as it cuts a lethal path through our communities. And it  has exposed the callous and deadly indifference of the protectors of  the wealthy and the connected all too willing to sacrifice our  neighbors for the bottom line.   But in this House, the people's House, we know that our strength and  our recovery as a nation rests in the health and prosperity of all  Americans, and we will fight with everything we have for the people.
