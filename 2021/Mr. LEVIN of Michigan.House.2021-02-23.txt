 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the Macomb  and Oakland County students who participated in my inaugural Ninth  District MLK Jr. Day Youth Conference. These students brought their  whole brilliant, vulnerable, and idealistic selves to the table to zero  in on what Dr. King's life is really about: transforming society to be  more just.   COVID-19 has exposed deep inequalities in every facet of life,  especially for Black Americans, who are nearly two times as likely as  White Americans to die of COVID-19. Imagine what we could do to end  these disparities if we honor Dr. King by emulating his work.   Having watched these students sponge up lessons on the true premise  of MLK Day--achieving social justice--and make plans to fight for  change in their own lives and communities, I am energized and hopeful  that we can boldly champion justice and equality in Congress. I can  think of no better way of marking Black History Month than that.                            ____________________
