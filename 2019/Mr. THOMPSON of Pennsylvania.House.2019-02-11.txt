 Mr. Speaker, for the eighth consecutive  year, the Juniata Valley Council, Boy Scouts of America, achieved the  Gold Journey to Excellence Award.   It was an honor to celebrate this outstanding achievement yesterday  with the council as well as volunteers at the unit, district, and  council levels, as well as the Scouts and parents in Centre,  Huntingdon, Juniata, and Mifflin Counties in central Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, the Journey to Excellence Award measures a council's  performance in a range of areas; including fiscal management,  membership growth and retention, and program excellence; including  camping, advancement, and community service, among other areas.   These key performance areas are directly related to producing  successful, growing, and sustainable Scouting programs. I am incredibly  proud of the Juniata Valley Boy Scout Council, which I have been a  member of for four decades. The annual recognition dinner is a time to  celebrate achievements, and I was pleased to see Jonathan Long of my  hometown recognized as the Howard Cub Pack Leader of the Year.   Scouting makes a difference in the lives of so many youth. I  congratulate the Juniata Council on this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________
