 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the outstanding career of Susan Swanson, who has been the executive  director of the Allegheny Hardwood Utilization Group, or AHUG, since  1996.   She began her career 25 years ago as an administrative assistant with  the organization. Soon, she became the executive director. Since then,  Susan has championed numerous initiatives for the hardwood industry,  including Penn's Woods curriculum, the PA WoodMobile, the wood products  curriculum for high schools, and other forest-related educational  products.   Members of AHUG have joined forces successfully to present a united  front whose primary objective is expanding and diversifying the forest  products industry while maintaining a sustainable, high-yield forest  within a 14-county region in northwestern and north central  Pennsylvania.   Known for the quality and quantity of its hardwoods, the region of  the Commonwealth contains some of the finest forest resources in the  world. With a well-developed, primary-processing industry and  experienced workforce in place, the area has excellent opportunities  for investment. AHUG has been leading this cause since its inception in  1984.   Under Susan's leadership AHUG set out to create new economic growth,  promote the expansion of existing industry, and foster the creation of  jobs. At the same time, the group recognized the need to promote safe  logging and processing practices while maximizing prudent and sound  forest management.   AHUG is the lead organizer for the Kane Area Loggers Safety  Committee, which hosts the longest running safety meeting for loggers  in the United States. In conjunction with the safety meeting, Susan  initiated the Women in Timber ladies luncheon, which also is held  annually.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that Susan has left a lasting impression on  AHUG and the industry itself. She said: ``Pennsylvania hardwoods have  long been recognized around the globe for their premier quality. Here  in the Allegheny hardwood region, we produce 80 percent of all of the  cherry hardwood in the world. This does not happen by accident, but  because we take the time to manage our forest resources for optimum  production for today, sustainability for the future generations, and  unequaled environmental consciousness.''   I know Susan has left AHUG in an excellent place to accomplish its  goal for a thriving forestry industry in northwestern and north central  Pennsylvania. She has proudly led AHUG by partnering with other  organizations and entities in the delivery of services to the hardwood  industry, such as workforce initiatives, training, and professional  forestry development, all of which have been important to the  industry's survival.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Susan the best as she enters her well-deserved  retirement. She will get to spend more time with her husband, who is a  proud Pennsylvania logger; her three grown children; and her  grandchildren.   Her impacts on AHUG will last generations. We are grateful for her  leadership, dedication, and commitment to the Pennsylvania hardwood  industry.                Honoring Warren Lions Club on 95th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Warren Lions Club on 95 years of service to  northwestern Pennsylvania.   Founded in 1923, the Warren Lions Club is a fellowship of community- oriented and service-minded men and women dedicated to helping the  citizens of their city, nation, and the world realize their full  potential.   The Lions Club of Warren has provided assistance to people who are  challenged by sight or hearing impairment, as well as other health- and  economic-related issues.   The Warren Lions Club meets twice a month at the Conewango Club for  presentations, fellowship, lunch or dinner, and business and project  discussions. They host several projects and fundraisers throughout the  year, including  [[Page H8890]]  an annual turkey dinner, a car show, and events for sight- and hearing- impaired assistance.   Lions Clubs have inspired generations of people to become civic- minded individuals dedicated to using their talents and ambitions to  improve their communities without financial reward.   Mr. Speaker, Lions Clubs around the globe serve millions annually,  and I wholeheartedly congratulate the Warren Lions Club on its 95th  anniversary of being a powerful force for good in the world                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, September is Suicide  Prevention Month, and almost every 12 minutes, an American dies by  suicide.   It is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States of  America. The Centers for Disease Control recently reported a 30 percent  increase in suicide rates in the last 30 years, with nearly 45,000  Americans taking their own lives in 2016.   Mr. Speaker, suicide is preventable. Increasing access to crisis  resources saves lives. Mental and behavioral health research saves  lives. Ending the stigma surrounding suicide and reaching out for help  saves lives.   On average, one person dies by suicide every 4 hours in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, according to  [[Page H9083]]  research from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.   There is no single cause of suicide, and suicide risk increases when  several health factors and life stressors converge to create an  experience of hopelessness and despair.   But, together, we can reverse this course. By making mental  healthcare, substance abuse treatment, and suicide prevention a  national priority, we can reverse the tide on these deaths of despair.   We will save lives, and we will do it together.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his leadership. I congratulate him on some great legislation that was  passed out of the Natural Resources Committee earlier today, which I  know will be extremely important to the citizens who are lucky to have  him as their Representative.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here this evening. As vice chair of the  Agriculture Committee and as a former chair of the House Forestry  Subcommittee and a proud member of the Western Caucus--I always say I  am on the eastern frontier of the Western Caucus, being from  Pennsylvania, but we have the same issues. We really do.   I have a national forest, one of the more profitable national forests  in the country, but facing a lot of the issues: rural communities,  school districts that are dependent on secure rural schools, and just  so many issues--energy production, development--and so I am proud to be  here this evening on an issue that is incredibly important, an issue  that impacts the lives of so many and heavily impacts our Western  States.   I am honored to represent Pennsylvania, obviously, and as some have  described our forest, Mr. Speaker, as asbestos forest in Pennsylvania,  probably because of the 90-some-thousand miles of streams that we have.  We have plenty of moisture. I wish we could put a bunch of that water  in a pipeline and sell it to you. We would send it your direction.   But as it is, while the devastating impact on our forests is invasive  species--that is a subject for another evening--I can tell you, when  the wildfires occur in States such as Utah, Montana, Colorado, and  throughout the West, California, these devastating wildfires, there is  a large sucking sound, as I like to describe it, out of my national  forest, and it comes in the form of resources, money that is taken away  because of the necessity that I support of having to fight those fires.  [[Page H9085]]                                     time  2015    We also have personnel that are deployed out of my national forest.  So that means that our timber, the money for our timber marketing, and  harvesting, and the multi-use comes almost to a screeching halt.   So I am pleased with the leadership that we have done, in both the  Natural Resources Committee and the Agriculture Committee, to address  this issue. As vice chair of the Agriculture Committee, I am proud of  the Forestry Title of the House farm bill. It contains a number of  reforms intended to provide the Forest Service and our private  foresters with more authorities and flexibilities to help better  manage; that is both in increasing timber production, but it is also in  managing a forest that is healthy and, therefore, managing the  understory, the fuel load that has built up over decades of  mismanagement.   By providing new authorities and encouraging new timber markets, we  do that in a number of ways, Mr. Speaker. The bill encourages active  forest management. We reauthorize the Landscape Scale Restoration  Program, and that allows for more partnerships to tackle critical  challenges such as forest health, and wildfires, as well as drinking  water protection.   The bill supports, in many ways, these types of initiatives but,  specifically, on the wildfires, Mr. Speaker. Over the past 2 decades,  wildfires have been an increasing challenge for the Forest Service as  costs have skyrocketed to fight them.   Since 1995, the Forest Service's annual wildfire budget has increased  from 13 percent of the budget to nearly 60 percent of the budget, Mr.  Speaker. Last year was the costliest fire year on record, with the  Forest Service spending $2.4 billion in 2017 alone.   Year after year, the agency runs out of fire funding, forcing it to  draw additional funds from non-fire accounts and other forests,  national forests, including to cover basic operational and forest  management funds that pay for timbering, and research activities, and  even proactive fire prevention.   Unfortunately, this occurs because the Forest Service has been unable  to access additional funding when the fire funds runs out due to a  budget cap.   Now, finally, the 2018 omnibus included a ``fire borrowing fix'' by  creating a wildfire cap adjustment, which will treat wildfires like any  other natural disasters; just like we saw down in the Carolinas with  Hurricane Florence.   Now this change will free up the Forest Service to fight wildfires  and do so without transferring funds from non-fire accounts. These are  accounts that help to prevent fires with restorative cuts, and managing  the understory, dealing with the fuel load, the standing dead timber  because of, perhaps, disease.   For forests around the Nation, especially in the East, this will mean  more funding for other essential activities such as management,  timbering, and even recreation and research activities.   Now, along with fixing the budget cap, the omnibus currently provides  the Forest Service with new management authorities, and these reforms  are specifically intended to help the Forest Service better manage and  proactively prevent forest fires from breaking out.   Specifically, these new authorities will streamline the environmental  analysis, reduce litigation, and provide timber harvest contract  certainty. Some of these reforms include, within our proposed farm  bill--which we are in conference in right now, and we need the Senate  to realize these improvements were based on the successes we had in the  last farm bill, which has really helped our forest products industry,  our timber industry, helped make our forests more healthy; and when  they are healthy, they are more resilient to wildfires.   So it includes: Categorical Exclusions for Wildfire Resilience  Projects; Healthy Forest Restoration Act inclusion of Fire and Fuel  Breaks; 20-year Stewardship Contracts; Cottonwood Reform; Fire Hazard  Mapping Initiative; Fuels Management for Protection of Electric  Transmission Lines; and Good Neighbor Authority Road Amendment.   Forest fires do not recognize or respect boundaries. If they start in  a national forest, they are going to wind up in State forests, they are  going to wind up on private property land.   So we are doing all the right things. I am very pleased, and we need  to do this.   When I look at the communities, such as the ones that the gentleman  from Montana represent, as a result of wildfires, we see a loss of  life; we see a loss of homes; a loss of the economy; a loss of the  taxpayer-owned assets, whether it is national forests or State forests;  and certainly a loss of assets for those private property owners that  have forests.   So I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this topic and issue,  and I really appreciate his managing this Special Order this evening on  a very important topic of wildfires.    Nationwide impact.    It really is.   Mr. Speaker, our watersheds, most of our water sources start--many of  them start in national forests. They are certainly in forests, but a  lot of national forests. And with wildfires, you create a situation  where there is no stability in the soils. And so where these wonderful  trout streams, streams that support life, support communities, support  families with clean water, these wildfires, they basically caramelize  that soil so that, essentially, the flash flooding, the runoffs, it  puts all these solids within those streams, it creates turbidity, the  solids, the nutrients that go in there.    So the impact of wildfires, as the gentleman said, it is the land, it  is the air and, quite frankly, it is the water, and that is why we have  to do a better job of preventing these wildfires to start with.
