 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I wish to speak this afternoon to honor  the memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone. Today marks 15 years since we  lost Paul and Sheila, their daughter Marcia, and staff members Tom  Lapic, Mary McEvoy, and Will McLaughlin. Because Paul was such a  memorable and incredible person, it is hard to believe that it has been  15 years since we lost all of them.   For me, as for so many Minnesotans, it is impossible to forget the  moment that we first heard about their plane going down. It is  impossible to forget the wait to get the final news that there were no  survivors. That is how much Paul and Sheila meant to the people of our  State.   I get my own special reminders every day. First, I get a reminder  from the employees at the Capitol who were around when Paul graced  these hallways. They remember him because he treated everyone with  dignity. Whether it was the tram operator, the elevator operator, or  the police at the front door, he treated them as though they were  Senators. I also have the flags in my office from his Senate office.  Every day, they are a reminder for me of Paul and all that he did for  the people of our State.   Paul and Sheila were always on the move. They were full of joy. They  were persistent in their fight against injustices, small and large.  During his lifetime as an educator, as an activist, and as a U.S.  Senator, Paul Wellstone touched the lives of people throughout  Minnesota and across the country. That is because his philosophy was  simple. A lot of people, he said, would have people paid to represent  them in Washington, but he was going to represent the other people. As  he said in one of his famous campaign ads, he wasn't there to represent  the Rockefellers; he was there to represent the ``little fellers.''   If you go to any local mental health group, they remember Paul. If  you go to any Somali event in our State, they remember Paul. If you go  to any community on the Iron Range in Minnesota, they remember Paul-- both the man and then what he did.   Paul was my friend and mentor. He told me that I should run for  office, and, as he did with so many others, he taught me that politics  should have a purpose.   He also taught me how to campaign on city buses. This is how he would  do it. At Nicollet Mall--being from a nearby State, the Presiding  Officer is aware of Nicollet Mall in the city of Minneapolis. We would  get on a city bus at one end of the mall, and we would work it as  though we had just got on the bus: Meet everyone on the bus, go to the  end, get off, and then get on another bus going the other way and meet  a whole group of people. I have no idea what the busdrivers thought  after an hour of this, but that is what we did.   Paul Wellstone worked it bus by bus, block by block, precinct by  precinct, and he made a lasting impression on people in a way that made  them believe and know that getting involved in politics could make a  real difference in their lives. He had an unending sense of optimism-- optimism that maybe people he didn't agree with in this Chamber would  eventually change their views.   He made a lot of friends here, on both the Democratic and Republican  sides of the aisle. That was the message Paul took to new citizens, new  voters, and everyone looking to get involved. He told them that working  in public service can make a difference, and he showed them through his  actions.   He had many passions. He fought for everything from campaign finance  reform to improving our rural economies. He fought against veteran  homelessness, to protect the environment, and, of course, he fought for  the rights of workers.   He truly believed, as he famously said, that ``we all do better when  we all do better'' and that politics is simply about improving people's  lives.  [[Page S6800]]    Anyone who ever met or talked with Paul found out that he had a  special passion for helping those struggling with mental illness. That  was shaped by his own family. As a young child, Paul watched his  brother Steven's traumatic descent into mental illness. In college, his  brother suffered a severe mental breakdown and spent the next 2 years  in hospitals. Eventually, he recovered and graduated from college with  honors, but it took his immigrant parents years to pay off the hospital  bills.   Paul would always talk about how, when he grew up, his house was dark  because no one wanted to talk about mental illness back then because it  had so much stigma. He wanted to get it out in the sunlight. He knew  that there were far too many families going through the same  experience, too many devastated by the physical and financial  consequences of mental illness. He knew that we could and we should do  better. For years as a Senator, he fought for funding for better care,  better services, and better representation for the mentally ill, and he  fought for mental health parity in health insurance coverage.    Even years after his death, Paul's voice was heard loud and clear.  Congressman Ramstad from Minnesota, a Republican Congressman at the  time, took up the cause in the House. I helped. Ted Kennedy led the way  and, of course, Pete Domenici, who had paired up with Paul on this  important bill.   Finally, in 2008, we passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici  Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. The bill requires  insurance companies to treat mental health on an equal basis with  physical illness. For Paul, this fight was always a matter of civil  rights, of justice, and of basic human decency, and that landmark  legislation is one fitting way we honor him.   Sheila, of course, also dedicated herself to helping others,  especially survivors of violence. I had the opportunity to work closely  with Sheila when I served for 8 years as Hennepin County Attorney. She  focused on domestic violence and was instrumental in creating and  getting the funding for the Hennepin County Domestic Abuse Center. That  center is an international model for serving victims of domestic  violence by bringing together a full range of services and resources in  one central location. Victims of domestic violence don't have to go  through the redtape that would be difficult even for a lawyer to figure  out.   Of course, one of Paul's greatest legislative achievements was the  work he did, along with Vice President Biden and others, to pass the  original Violence Against Women Act. It was a team effort, and Sheila  was right there on the frontlines with Paul.   Together, they accomplished so much. Their commitment to others never  wavered, and neither did they.   It was just a few weeks before that tragic crash that I last saw  Sheila and Paul. Sheila and I had been asked to speak to a group of new  citizens, immigrants from Russia. It was a very small group, and we  were there to talk about our own immigrant experiences, our own  relatives. I remember she talked about her relatives in Appalachia, and  I talked about my relatives on the Iron Range coming over from  Slovenia. The event was winding down. It was a small, small event in a  synagogue with these new immigrants, and, all of a sudden, a big  surprise--in walked Paul. He wasn't supposed to be there. It was just a  few weeks, a month away, from one of the biggest elections he had ever  faced in the U.S. Senate. But he had gotten on an early flight and had  come home from Washington. There he was--he and a group of immigrants  and us--with no press, no TVs, not even a big crowd, all just a few  weeks before his election.   He came for two reasons. He loved Sheila, and he wanted to be there  to support her. But he was also there because he loved the immigrant  experience. He embraced it. His family, like so many Minnesota  families, was an example of how you can come to America, succeed in  America, and then, in turn, help America succeed.   That is my last memory of Paul as he stood before those immigrants,  telling about his own story, embracing them. I will remember him in  that way, but I will also remember the joy he felt for politics, how he  would run around that green bus of his, with people running alongside  him on the parade routes.   In the last year of his life, he told the public he had MS, and he  couldn't run like that anymore. So he would stand in the back of the  bus with Sheila and wave. What was so amazing about it was that he had  energized so many people in those green Wellstone shirts to run around  that bus that you didn't even notice he wasn't running. He had given  them the energy and the hope to carry on his work, and they were doing  it for him.   Now, 15 years after we lost Paul and Sheila, it is our job to carry  on and run around that bus. That is organizing, that is politics, and  that is the gift of joy in improving people's lives that Paul, Sheila,  Marcia, and those other beloved staff members left for us.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the vote in the  Senate last night to overturn the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's rule regarding forced arbitration that would protect consumers  and make sure they get their day in court when financial institutions  violate the law. The floor schedule did not allow me to give these  remarks before the vote, so I am giving them today. This rule would  have restored the ability of servicemembers, veterans, and other  consumers to join together and seek relief through class action  lawsuits. I opposed this rule repeal.   In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection  Act included a provision instructing the CFPB to study mandatory  arbitration and write a rule based on what they found. After several  years of careful study, the CFPB released a 728-page report in 2015.  This year, the CFPB finalized its arbitration rule mandating that  consumer financial product contracts no longer include language barring  class actions.   This rule was an important step forward in protecting consumers from  the fine print arbitration clauses included in all sorts of contracts,  including contracts for credit cards, debit cards, prepaid bank cards,  payday loans, and even cell phones. The 2015 CFPB report found that 93  percent of consumers whose credit cards included forced arbitration  clauses did not know that they could not sue their credit card  companies.   The CFPB rule enhanced protections for consumers in the military.  That is why the American Legion, the Nation's largest wartime veterans  service organization, which represents 2 million veterans, and the  Military Coalition, which represents 5.5 million current and former  servicemembers and their families, supported the protections provided  under this rule.   I have cosponsored the Military Consumer Protection Act led by  Senator Reed, which would put the enforcement of the Servicemember  Civil Relief Act under the CFPB so that the agency responsible for  protecting servicemembers and their families is also able to enforce  those protections.   Our servicemembers and veterans face challenges that are different  from civilian consumers, especially during deployment. We need to make  sure that they have all the protections they earn through their  service. That is why I voted against H.J. Res. 111, the resolution of  disapproval with respect to the CFPB arbitration rule, and I will  continue to fight for our servicemembers, veterans, and consumers to  get the protections they deserve.                            ____________________
