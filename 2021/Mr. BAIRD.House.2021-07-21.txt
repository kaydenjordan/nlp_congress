 Madam Speaker, today I rise to express my support for the  Cuban people.   After decades of enduring an oppressive Communist regime, the people  of Cuba deserve freedom.   Last week, we watched as Cubans proudly waved the American flag  through the streets and peacefully advocated for the freedom our flag  represents.   Unfortunately, as Cubans marched, many of my colleagues across the  aisle have remained silent or, worse, they have wrongfully blamed the  United States or even suggested these protests were in response to  COVID-19.   Let me be clear: The embargo isn't responsible for young children who  have been forced into joining the police force. The embargo isn't  responsible for cutting off internet access. It is the failed Communist  system, a system so full of corruption and greed that medicine, food,  and gas shortages are sadly the norm.   Crowds chanting ``Freedom'' and ``Down with the dictatorship'' are  clear cries for relief from six decades of suffering.   History has shown us that communism has always failed, leaving those  who must live under its restrictive rule to suffer.   I have witnessed these atrocities and failure of communism firsthand,  and I have dedicated my life to fighting against it.   I am proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Cuba as they  fight to end the Communist rule that has ruined their nation. I hope my  colleagues will consider doing the same.
