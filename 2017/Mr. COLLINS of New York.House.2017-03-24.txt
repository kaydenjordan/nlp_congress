 Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day, make  no mistake about it. The American Health Care Act changes the  trajectory of health policy in this country. Here are just a few of the  highlights:   This bill eliminates the individual mandate penalty; eliminates the  employer mandate penalty; eliminates the ObamaCare subsidies in 2020;  eliminates ObamaCare tax increases; eliminates insurance mandates so we  can lower premiums; provides refundable tax credits for individuals and  families who do not get their health insurance through their employer  or the government, and allows them to choose the health care that works  for them; almost doubles the contribution limits  [[Page H2420]]  for health savings accounts; provides $115 billion for the Patient and  State Stability Fund to lower patient cost and stabilize the insurance  market; and enacts the most significant reforms to Medicaid in history,  ensuring that Medicaid is sustainable and available for the most  vulnerable among us for generations to come.   The American Health Care Act is a monumental step toward freedom,  choice, and individual responsibility in health care.   Mr. Speaker, I will proudly vote for this bill today, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.
