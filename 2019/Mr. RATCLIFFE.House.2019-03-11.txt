 Mr. Speaker, at age 19, Ralph Hall jumped at the  chance to join the Navy, to fly Hellcat fighters during World War II in  defense of this Nation. Seventy years later, at the age of 89, he  jumped again out of an airplane to honor America's veterans on Memorial  Day.   At age 11, Ralph Hall was working at the Rockwall, Texas, drugstore  when he served two Coca-Colas, two packs of Old Gold cigarettes, and a  stack of newspapers to two customers known simply to the rest of the  world as Bonnie and Clyde. Eighty years later, at the age of 91, Ralph  was still working and serving the folks in Rockwall, in north Texas, as  the oldest Member ever to cast a vote in the history of the House of  Representatives.   From beginning to end, Ralph Hall lived one of the most extraordinary  and remarkable lives of anyone ever to serve in Congress.   In his 34 years in this Chamber, Ralph spent some of his time sitting  over here as a Blue Dog Democrat. For some of his time he spent it  sitting over there as a conservative Republican. Ralph liked to joke  that was because ``the Republicans never much wanted me, and the  Democrats never much liked me.'' Neither of those was true, but it was  that self-deprecating humor that made Ralph Hall beloved to everyone  who knew him.    In the Science, Space, and Technology Committee room, Ralph Hall's  picture hangs alongside other past chairmen. But Ralph was the only  chairman to have Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Gene Cernan, and every  then-living Apollo-era astronaut come to his home to celebrate one of  his birthdays. When asked why, Neil Armstrong, the first man on the  Moon, who famously took a giant leap for mankind, said it was because  Ralph Hall was a giant to our space program. Ralph Hall, he said, was a  giant among men.   Mr. Speaker, to those on the floor who knew Ralph Hall, thank you for  allowing me to remember him for the Representative that he truly was.  And for those of you who did not have the privilege of serving with  Ralph Hall, thank you for letting me remember the man who was the kind  of Representative that we should all hope to be.   When Ralph Hall passed away last Thursday at the age of 95, he left  this Earth, went right past the Moon--and our loss became Heaven's  gain.   Godspeed, Ralph Hall.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask all Members to rise and observe a  moment of silence to honor the extraordinary life of Congressman Ralph  Hall.                            ____________________
