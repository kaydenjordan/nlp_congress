 Mr. Speaker, on June 11, 2021, western Pennsylvania lost  Officer Jerrod Withrow of the Mount Lebanon police, who passed away  after a heroic battle with cancer.   Officer Withrow had a long and distinguished career in law  enforcement, but one moment stood out. In October 2018, he responded to  the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where a mass murderer attacked  a peaceful religious gathering with an assault rifle and killed 11  members of our community.   It is hard for most of us to understand the bravery and the raw  physical courage that it takes to run toward gunfire rather than away  from it, but that was the kind of person that Officer Withrow was. It  was who he trained himself to be, and we thank him and honor him for  his courage.   On behalf of the people of western Pennsylvania and on behalf of our  national government, I wish to extend our condolences to Officer  Withrow's wife, Lisa; his sons: James, Brayden, and Ben; and all of his  family.   I am proud to remember Jerrod Withrow today in our Nation's Capitol  and hopeful that our service here will be worthy of all those Americans  like him who every day put their community and their country first.                            ____________________
