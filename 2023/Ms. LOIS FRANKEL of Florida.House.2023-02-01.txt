 Mr. Speaker, let me, just for a start,  say that hatred and discrimination against any marginalized community  are wrong, whether it be an ethnic minority, LGBT, a person with a  disability, and women and girls.   Today, I want to focus on something that is personal to me.   My family was blessed. My grandfather came over to this country from  Poland just before the rise of Hitler, and he saved his brothers and  sisters by bringing them over. Too many people were not so blessed.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today and start my comments by saying, ``never  again,'' as I address the growing concern of anti-Semitism in my home  State of Florida and across the country.                                time  1045    This rise in anti-Semitism is deeply concerning, particularly given  the lessons of the Holocaust, where we lost 6 million Jews and millions  of others who were murdered by the Nazis in one of the worst human  atrocities in the history of the world. These were precious lives who  were tortured, gassed, shot, and treated as less than human.   It is terrifying that we find ourselves today having to defend the  fact that it even happened. So we say ``never again'' to remind the  world that we just didn't wake up one moment to gas chambers and  genocide; it was a slow and deliberate effort, dehumanizing Jews and  others, fomenting fear and normalizing extremism and prejudice.   Today, Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism is on the rise. Incidents  of anti-Semitism reported--and this is just reported--to the Anti- Defamation League have risen by 34 percent in their last report. There  were over 2,700 incidents that were reported in a year: Harassment,  assaults, Molotov cocktails thrown at synagogues, defacing Jewish  cemeteries, I could go on and on. The point is, it is clear that anti- Semitism is real.   In my own community in Palm Beach County, which is home to tens of  thousands of Jews, this past January there were Nazi symbols projected  on buildings and hundreds and hundreds of anti-Semitic flyers thrown  into the yards of people.   Mr. Speaker, I say what should we do? What must we do?   Combating anti-Semitism is everyone's responsibility. There is  something for all of us to do to promote a more inclusive and  respectful society.   Let me just give a to-do list. It is not necessarily inclusive, but  some things that we should all take to heart.   Believe it or not, a significant number of our young people don't  have any understanding of the Holocaust; and so, of course, education  and awareness about the Holocaust and the history of anti-Semitism and  the harm it causes, education is something that is very important.   All of us must speak out and condemn anti-Semitism wherever and  whenever it occurs, whether it is using your voice, your Facebook page,  your Twitter, writing letters to the editor. If you see something, you  must say something.   We should be working with our great partners across different sectors  and levels of government to combat anti-Semitism and protect our Jewish  communities, partners like the ADL, the American Jewish Committee, and  many others.   We have to keep our houses of worship safe, not just synagogues, but  churches and mosques. People must be free in this country to go to a  house of worship and feel safe.   We must support the laws and policies that protect people and  communities from discrimination, extremism, hate crimes, and improve  hate crime reporting and prosecuting hate crimes.   Mr. Speaker, let me just refer to a magnificent hero in my community,  Ben Ferencz, the last living Nuremberg prosecutor, who tells us that  creating a world of tolerance and compassion would be a long and  arduous task, a task we must all take up in words and actions.   Mr. Speaker, we must build bridges between different communities  through dialogues and collaborations that can help to reduce prejudice  and foster mutual respect, and it means standing against hatred aimed  at other often marginalized groups.   And we must protect the safety and security of Israel, the homeland  of 46 percent of the world's Jews.   As I conclude my remarks, I want to highlight the story of Ben  Ferencz, a magnificent hero from my community.   Ben, who at 103 years old, is the last living Nuremberg prosecutor  and was recently bestowed the Congress' highest honor, a Congressional  Gold Medal.   As World War II engulfed Europe, after graduating from law school,  Ben enlisted in the U.S. Army.   He was transferred to a unit responsible for gathering evidence of  Nazi war crimes.   He later took that evidence to the chief Nuremberg prosecutor, and at  27 years old, Ben was appointed the lead prosecutor of the biggest  murder trial in the history of the world where he convicted 22 Nazi  leaders for their roles in the deaths of over 1 million people.   Ben went on to spend his life pursuing peace and justice.                            ____________________
