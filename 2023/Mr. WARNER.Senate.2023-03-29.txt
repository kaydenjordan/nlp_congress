 Mr. President, I have come to speak on a different topic,  but I want to commend my friend the Senator from Illinois for his  comments. I agree with him.   Just yesterday, my colleague and dear friend Senator Kaine and I met  with four of the families who were part of one of that litany of  shootings, in Virginia Beach, where a mentally deranged individual came  in and brutally murdered 12--mostly city employees and a few folks who  were there to try to get city services. The anguish, pain, and hurt of  these four families 4 years after the fact reflect the kind of anguish  and hurt that the families in Nashville are feeling and so many  countless others.   I commend the Senator again and agree that it is incumbent upon us to  do our job. Thoughts and prayers are not enough.   I thank him for his comments.                                    S. 316    Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning where, after 2 weeks  of consideration and debate--and I have not been part of all that  debate. I would like to say I had been because then I could use an  excuse of why my voice sounds so crummy this morning. But after 2 weeks  of debate and literally the way the Senate used to function, with votes  on a whole host of amendments, the Senate shortly is poised to take a  truly notable action: voting to repeal not one but two authorizations  for use of military force, finally taking these outdated  authorizations--dating all the way back to 2002 and the previous one,  back to 1991--off the books.   This is an important step for Congress in reclaiming its  constitutional duties with regard to authorizing the use of U.S. forces  in combat. I want to give credit to the Biden administration for  supporting this repeal and to the bipartisan majority in Congress who  have brought this measure to the brink of passage here in the Senate.   As we come to the floor, getting ready to take this vote, we would  not have gotten here, I can assure you, without the steadfast  leadership of Senator Kaine and Senator Young. These two have been  partners on this effort since 2019.   For Senator Young, given his service as a marine in the decade right  in the middle of these two authorizations, I know that this fight is  personal for him, and I appreciate his tireless work on this. And  starting off on that fight, it was a little more challenging, perhaps,  on his side of the aisle, but he has been relentless. He has, through  the  [[Page S1011]]  power of his passion and conviction, convinced a number of his  colleagues to join this event.   This will go down, I believe, as one of Senator Young's most  significant accomplishments, accomplishments that I have worked with  him on as well--for example, the CHIPS bill last year, the science  bill--where he also provided enormous leadership, and I thank him for  that.   But I would be remiss here today if I didn't spend the balance of my  2 or 3 minutes on the efforts of my great, great friend of 43-plus  years Tim Kaine, who I think we would all agree that without his  efforts, we wouldn't be here today.   For the decade--or a little more than a decade that Senator Kaine has  served in this Chamber, he has been the leading voice--and a lot of  times the only voice, much to the chagrin sometimes of folks in my  party, much to the chagrin sometimes of the Obama administration--in  working to push this Senate to live up to its constitutional duty--that  duty, which is one of the most solemn ones we have, which is the  exercise, the power to declare war and, ultimately, to commit our young  men and women--fellow Americans--into combat.   Now, this is also very personal to Tim. We both have the honor of  representing the State that has probably the highest concentration of  military and veterans of any State in the country. Tim also brings the  experience of being a father of a marine. I remember watching Matt grow  up--our families have been friends--and when he chose to go into the  marines, I don't think we were surprised, but the way he distinguished  himself in that duty, serving abroad in deployments to Africa and  elsewhere and then serving back here in this country, you could always  tell how proud Tim and Anne felt about Matt's service. But you could  also feel the extra burden of responsibility he felt to make sure what  he owed not only to Matt but what he owed to, literally, every young  American who served in our military.   So this has been something that--this push has really been one of the  guiding principles that has directed Tim throughout his whole career in  the Senate. I think back to initially him raising these issues in the  Foreign Relations Committee back in 2013, saying it was time for  Congress not to simply take a passive role or be a Monday morning  quarterback--or, more likely, a Sunday morning quarterback--on the news  shows about our constitutional responsibility in weighing in on  conflicts that were taking place around the world that went well beyond  the original authorizations of these AUMFs. He constantly would try to  bring up this issue--again, many times being the only voice--and I know  how much he respected President Obama--many times going against the  position of the Obama administration. Now, other folks might have, at  some point, whether it was Democratic leadership at the White House or  his fellow Members, said, you know: Can't you get off this? This makes  us all feel a little uncomfortable.   And my friend Tim Kaine, it is hard to work with him. We are a great  partner. I am the glass ``three-quarters empty guy''; he is the glass  ``overfilling with confidence and hope guy.'' But even that constant  hope and belief, there had to be times during this decade of fighting  on this when he had to have lost a little bit of faith--could this  actually get done?   But that relentless optimism, that belief based in his faith, that if  you keep on something, that people will ultimately do the right thing.  And at the end of the day, that dogged determination, all that has come  about in these last 2 weeks, is a testament to that kind of hard work.   I have watched it at times when he kept, year after year, kind of  banging his head against the wall--and, again, there are a lot of us,  sometimes even I felt this way--well, you know, maybe we should do it  next year; maybe this is not the right time; maybe there is some other  reason where, you know, this can wait a little while; it is not on the  front of mind. But, for Tim Kaine, it was always front of mind. Working  now with our friend Todd Young--but his prior partners, great Senators  who I had the opportunity to work with, Bob Corker and Jeff Flake--he  has been just relentless.   And this profile and courage--profile in doing the right thing--is a  great testament to the people of Virginia and, frankly, to the people  in our Nation that this Senator keeps his eye on the ball.   Now, when I told Senator Kaine I might want to make these comments,  he said: But, Mark, we are not at the finish line; we still have to get  it through the House.   Well, I think you are going to have a remarkable vote in a few  minutes due to the work of Senator Young and Senator Kaine. And that  overwhelming majority that is going to be posted here today, I think,  will propel this action in the House. And I am very glad to see that  the Speaker of the House has indicated that he will bring this  legislation up.   There are more debates to be had and more votes to wrestle down and  more amendments when it gets to the House; but, at the end of the day,  this bill is going to become the law of the land. Congress is going to  take back its Constitutional responsibility over the power to declare  war and to put our troops in harm's way.   It wouldn't have happened without the great work of Senator Todd  Young. This debate wouldn't even have still been alive, still vibrant,  still forcing us to do our job without the relentless, tireless work of  a great public servant, a great Virginian, a great American--my friend  Tim Kaine.   With that, I yield the floor.
