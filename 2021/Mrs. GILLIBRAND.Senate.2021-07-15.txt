 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise again today to call for every  Senator to have the opportunity to cast their vote on the Military  Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.   It is time for us to look at this issue to move serious crimes like  sexual assault and murder out of the chain of command and put them in  the hands of well-trained military prosecutors who are independent,  impartial, and highly trained uniformed prosecutors.   This is an issue that deserves urgency. I began calling for this full  floor vote on May 24. Since then, it is an estimate that 2,912  servicemembers will have been raped or sexually assaulted during that  time; more will have been victims of other serious crimes. Many will  not even report these crimes because they have no faith in the current  system, where decisions about whether to prosecute are made by  commanders and not trained lawyers. And yet this vote continues to be  delayed and denied, week after week.   While I am glad to see that more of our colleagues have acknowledged  that we must move sexual assault out of the chain of command, it is not  enough. It doesn't address the fundamental flaw in the military justice  system, which is that it asks commanders to act as judge and jury in  highly complex crimes that they are not trained to do.   In fact, the training commanders get includes just a few hours, at  the most, on legal topics like military justice and unlawful command  influence. No one could be expected to learn in a few hours what it  takes lawyers years of study and decades of experience to master.   That is why this bill would move serious crimes to the purview of  those lawyers who have had the time to properly prepare for the job.   Today, I would like to outline exactly which crimes this bill would  move out of the chain of command. Opponents have tried to misrepresent  these crimes the bill addresses. It does not, for example, deal with  larceny under $1,000 or destruction of government property. Those  crimes would stay with the commander.   The bill includes a finite list of crimes. I will read them all now:  recruit maltreatment, nonconsensual distribution of visual images,  murder, manslaughter, murder of a pregnant mother, child endangerment,  sexual assault, obscene mailing, sexual assault of a child, voyeurism,  major financial crimes, major fraud, robbery, bribery, graft,  kidnapping, arson, extortion, aggravated sexual assault, maiming,  domestic violence, stalking, perjury, obstruction of justice, and  retaliation.   That is it. That is the list. Those are crimes that have punishment  of more than 1 year associated with them.   I ask those who oppose this reform to tell me why they would expect a  commander with as little as a few hours of training to be prepared to  try cases on obscene mailing or to be well versed on the elements of  extortion. Tell me about the commander who understands the intricacies  of using false documents to claim benefits or has the time to  investigate complex financial frauds. Tell me about what leaves our  commanders prepared to act as judge and jury in a murder trial or a  kidnapping case.   Our bill simply recognizes that these are serious crimes that require  legal expertise to properly review and prosecute. By moving these  crimes to independent military lawyers, this reform allows commanders  to focus on what they are trained to do: preparing our troops to fight  and win our Nation's wars.   Additionally, the chairman has said that this bill would remove from  the chain of command ``crimes that have been handled by the military  chain of command effectively for years and years and years.''   But, actually, that is not the case. They haven't been handled  effectively.   Just this week the Military Times reported on the case of Private  Jonathan Lauture, who is alleged to have shot and killed Jason Lindsay  in June 2019, when Lindsay entered Lauture's home in an attempt to  intervene in a situation of domestic violence.   His chain of command at Fort Bliss was aware of the killing, but they  did not inform the Army's criminal investigation division. Instead,  they quickly reassigned him to Fort Stewart, where he continued to  assault his wife.   The Military Times reports:         Army investigators had no idea that the shooting had even       occurred, much less the domestic violence. . . . Lauture's       Fort Bliss chain of command did not inform the CID of the       shooting. Nobody did, until a domestic violence investigation       in December 2019 by Fort Stewart CID incidentally learned       that Lauture had [allegedly] killed a man who was attempting       to rescue his wife.    That is how the current system handles alleged murder and domestic  violence. It is not only ineffective, it is actively concealing  information and hampering justice. That is why the current system is  unacceptable.   We have to reform the system. The Military Justice Improvement and  Increasing Prevention Act is supported by experts, by servicemembers,  and by a bipartisan filibuster-proof majority of Senators if we bring  it to the floor.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation  with the Republican leader, the Senate Armed Services Committee be  discharged from further consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate proceed  to its consideration; that there be 2 hours for debate, equally divided  in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the  Senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.   They have the approval of the Majority and Minority leaders.
