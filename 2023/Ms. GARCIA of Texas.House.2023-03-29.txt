 Mr. Chair, this week my Republican colleagues  are fast-tracking a bill that puts polluters over people, H.R. 1.   Let's be clear: This bill won't do anything, not one thing to help  American consumers and families to lower their energy costs. Yes, we do  want that light on, but this bill is not going to help us get there.    Instead, it would simply repeal household energy rebates passed by  House Democrats, like those from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.   We shouldn't have to choose between dirty air and polluted water just  to meet the energy needs of the future. We simply don't have to. We  could work together in a bipartisan way to address energy costs, but  extreme MAGA Republicans refuse to do that.   We could work together on issues like the electrical grid liability  and security, an issue that is all too important to us in my home State  of Texas.   Instead, Republican-backed H.R. 1 picks winners and losers. The  wealthy and well-connected win and workers lose. I stand with workers.  Workers in my district know that new energy jobs and clean energy jobs  are the jobs of the future. We depend on them.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this bill because this bill does not protect  those workers. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Oppose this bill.
