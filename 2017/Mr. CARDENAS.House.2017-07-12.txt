 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act.   I also would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee for working so hard to get this important  bill on the floor here today.   This reauthorization bill provides the FDA with the resources to  complete an important and difficult job: ensuring timely and efficient  drug review processes while maintaining rigorous scientific and safety  standards to maintain the safety, efficacy, and security of drugs,  biological products, medical devices, and therapies that Americans have  access to today and tomorrow.   I am lucky to have been born and raised in this great country where  we have access to the latest innovation in the life sciences sector. I  wish my parents had been raised right here in this great, wonderful  country so they may still be here today, so that they could enjoy time  with their grandchildren if I have been so blessed to do so myself.   The FDA is seen as the gold standard around the world, and this bill  keeps us right there, right at the top.   I am encouraged to see my colleagues working together to ensure that  the FDA is able to continue to fulfill this responsibility, and I look  forward to continue working to have this reauthorization passed out of  Congress.
