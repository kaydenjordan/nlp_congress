 Madam President, I have heard from people across  Washington State about the need to respond to the opioid crisis and its  tragic impact on so many families and communities. I have visited with  people from communities in Seattle and Everett and Longview, and I have  heard from families across my State. I know my colleagues across the  aisle and across the Nation have heard from constituents about the  urgency of this crisis. So I am really glad today that the Senate is  able to come together and pass the Opioid Crisis Response Act--the  bipartisan legislation I have been working on with Senator Alexander  and so many others.   This bill is a bipartisan compromise. It is not what I would have  written on my own, and I know it is not what my colleagues on the other  side would--have written on their own, but it is the result of more  than 70 proposals from Members on both sides of the aisle, and that is  important. The bill we will vote on today does not reflect the full  agreement struck between Democrats and Republicans.   I am glad that Chairman Alexander and Republican leaders have worked  with us as the bill has hit the final stretch here in the Senate and  that they committed to a number of specific changes beyond the text of  this bill to make sure we could have this vote tonight and keep working  to get it signed into law.   The text of our agreement has been released, and I am hoping that  Republican leaders live up to their agreement to take this agreement  into the conference and work by our side in conference to get this done  in the bipartisan manner it began.   This agreement goes to show that when we work together, when we focus  on the problems families are actually facing and when we look for  common ground and commonsense solutions, we can actually craft and pass  legislation.   This agreement is a much needed and long overdue step toward helping  those families on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic to address its  root causes and ripple effects, including some of the issues, by the  way, that I have heard firsthand in my State.   I heard from hospital staff about how many of the babies they deliver  are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, battling symptoms of opioid  withdrawal, which is why I fought to make sure this agreement includes  support for State efforts to include plans of safe care for children  born to mothers battling addiction and also ensures the health  department is implementing strategies already identified to protect  moms and babies from the effects of opioid substance abuse.   I heard from an elementary school principal about how some of his  students are having trouble focusing in class because they deal with  the trauma of a family member's addiction at home, which is why I  worked to make sure this agreement includes provisions to develop a  task force and grants to help support trauma-informed care programs and  increase access to mental health care for children in their  communities, including their schools.   I heard from many more experts and everyday people, as the HELP  Committee held a series of bipartisan hearings focused on this crisis.  We heard about the many different faces of this epidemic and the broad  challenges we have to consider to make sure we address its root causes  and ripple effects, which is why I worked with my colleagues to make  sure this agreement includes provisions to address the economic and  workforce impacts of the opioid crisis, support for training to help  the nearly 1 million people out of work due to opioid addiction to gain  and retain employment. Washington State has already received a grant  for this important work to get workers back on their feet after they  battle addiction. So I am glad we could expand this valuable grant  program.   This bipartisan package of proposals is an important step forward to  help our families and communities who are on the frontlines of the  opioid crisis, and I look forward to continuing to work with my  colleagues to see it signed into law.   While this bill is an important step, it is by no means final. We  have a lot more to do to end the tragedy and address the ongoing issue.  So even as we work to get this agreement across the finish line, I am  going to keep fighting for more support, resources, and solutions for  the families in my home State of Washington and across the country who  are facing the heartbreak of this epidemic.   I yield the floor.                                   S. 2554     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fellow on  my HELP Committee staff, Nikki Meadows, be granted floor privileges  until October 1, 2018.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the  opioid legislation. I will get to that; however, I do wish to briefly  comment on another critical issue.   Once again, I want to thank Professor Ford for her bravery. This is  not easy for anyone. Nobody asks for this to happen to them, and I can  only imagine the trauma and heartache involved in sharing and reliving  a sexual assault like this. But she should know that I and millions of  people are standing by her side and stand ready to help however we can.   I want to make three points.   First, this nomination needs to be delayed. The idea that this  nomination could be jammed through given what we know now is almost  unthinkable and would be shameful and wrong. Whatever one may think  about the timing of this new information and the process that has taken  us to this point, the fact is that Senators now have new information  about a potential crime committed by a nominee for the highest Court in  the land and an individual who has come forward with details of the  alleged criminal act, and we can't simply ignore it.   There is no urgency to fill this seat before October. Republicans  held a Supreme Court seat open for more than a year in order to prevent  President Obama from fulfilling his constitutional role, so surely we  can take the time we need now in order to fulfill our constitutional  role. To be very clear, we should have nine Justices on the Supreme  Court, but it is more important right now to slow down, make sure we  have all of the facts, all the information, and that Senators have a  chance to weigh that before casting a vote to a position of such  importance.   Secondly, we need a full, fair, and robust investigation into these  allegations, and we need this to happen before anyone is brought in to  testify or ``re-testify'' to make sure Senators have the information  they need to ask the right questions and to do their jobs.   We saw what happened in 1991 when an accuser was brought in for  questioning before the Senators had access to all of the corroborating  information, and we cannot allow that to happen again. We saw the way  Senators completely mishandled the questioning of Anita Hill when they  didn't have access to the facts, hadn't yet heard from all of the  witnesses, and didn't have a grasp of the information and her  experience. I am very worried this would happen exactly that way again  if we don't take the time to do this right. There is no way a thorough  investigation can be completed in time for a hearing on Monday.   That brings me to my third and most important point. We cannot allow  this to turn into another attack on a woman who has come forward to  talk about her experience. We just can't.  [[Page S6195]]  The Senate needs to be better than that. And I am going to do  everything I can with anyone who is willing to join me to make sure we  are.   I joined millions of women in 1991 in watching as Anita Hill was  attacked, interrogated, and maligned on national television simply for  sharing her experience. A generation of women watched what happened to  her and were then less likely to share their own stories and more  likely to let their attackers and harassers off the hook because they  saw what happened to Anita Hill at the hands of the U.S. Senate, and  they didn't want anything like that to happen to them. That cannot  happen again. An all-male Judiciary Committee dropped the ball in 1991.  We cannot allow an all-male Republican side of the Judiciary Committee  to do the same in 2018.   Over the past year, we have made some tremendous strides with the  ``me too.'' movement and the understanding more and more that sexual  harassment and assault is not OK and cannot be tolerated no matter how  powerful the perpetrator. We have made tremendous strides with the  understanding more and more that women who have come forward should be  listened to, should be heard and believed, and that investigations and  all appropriate actions should be taken once they have come forward to  share their experience. We have made tremendous strides with the  understanding more and more that women who come forward do so at great  cost. None of them want to have to do so. All of them wish they had  never been through what they went through. And the idea that they are  making it up for some personal gain or agenda is as wrong as it is  offensive.   We have made progress, but all that progress is at stake if this is  now allowed to become a replay of what happened to Anita Hill, and I am  already seeing some troubling signs of some people going down that  path. Right away, some Republicans have shifted into an attack mode,  attacking the process and starting to attack the accuser. I can only  imagine Republicans are getting ready to attack and interrogate  Professor Ford in a misguided attempt to protect Judge Kavanaugh and  put politics ahead of their job as U.S. Senators and their duty to  their constituents. We cannot allow attacks like that to happen. I urge  all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to put a stop to it  whenever they see it.   Let's look at the facts. Let's investigate the allegations. Let's  consider what that means for our view on this nominee, but let's make  sure that it doesn't become another 1991, and let's make sure this  doesn't become another attack on a woman resulting in another chill on  women everywhere.    Mr. President, I want to turn to another issue, and I  ask unanimous consent that my remarks appear in the Record before the  vote took place.
