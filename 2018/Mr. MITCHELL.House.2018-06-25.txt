 Mr. Speaker, ``Unless someone like you cares a whole  awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.''   For those who are not familiar with the insights of Dr. Seuss, that  quote concludes ``The Lorax.'' You see, when I got home on Friday  night, my 8-year-old wanted to watch a move with dad. We watched ``The  Lorax'' with him belly laughing at some of the scenes and me just  enjoying him curled up beside me, happy to be together at home.  [[Page H5584]]    Playing through my mind also--as it has for some time--was our  collective struggle with legal immigration and our Nation's struggle  with addressing this problem.   For anyone wondering if I did not see or feel the real painful events  of separating children from their parents at the border last week, as I  curled up with my little guy, know that I did. I felt it to my soul.  You see, my 8-year-old son is also an immigrant. My wife and I adopted  him from Russia just before Vladimir Putin slammed the door shut for  other children who could desperately use a loving home in America.   We had to come home after adoption was granted and wait out an appeal  period. We had to leave our son behind and then go back and get him  weeks later. So I understand the problem well and what is at stake.   America has struggled with this issue since our creation. We are a  Nation of immigrants. My ancestors arrived in America during the Irish  potato famine. We can't ignore immigration, both illegal and legal, any  longer. The issue surrounds us every day, especially if you live in  border communities, areas of large immigrant populations--legal and  illegal--or resort communities or agriculture communities who depend  upon guest workers to even function.   In 1986, Congress passed the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which was signed  into law by President Reagan, the last major immigration legislation.  This granted legal status to about 4 million illegal immigrants with a  commitment to fund what was necessary to secure our borders.   However, clearly, we did not secure our borders, and that failure is  why we struggle right now with this problem. Our Nation's border agents  stop about 2,000 people deemed to be high risk, attempting to enter the  United States from Africa and the Middle East at our southern border  every year.   Does anybody care to estimate the number of people we do not  apprehend and the risks they pose to our security?   A group of young people, often called the DACA population, are  estimated at 1.6 to 1.8 million people and they are here, young people  brought here by their parents--yes, illegally, I grant that--but the  question remains: What do we do? Leave them in limbo? Leave them in  fear on the edge of society?   America has an immigration system that is old-fashioned at best.  Rather than doing what is necessary, like other nations have, a merit- based immigration system, we have visa lottery, family chain migration,  and a refugee and asylum system that does not work--all backed up by  illegal immigration that we can't address solely through deportations  and hearings.   We must secure our borders now. Not some day. Not maybe.   We must end the political circus of the DACA program and fix the  limbo status for the DACA population now. We must move to merit-based  immigration, end the visa lottery, and end family chain migration.   There is no answer to these issues that is perfect, in the view of  myself and many, because we are in a representative democracy. I don't  believe perfect exists in the world.   I spent 35 years in a private business. I don't think I ever saw  perfect. My spouse and children will tell you I am far from their  definition of perfect. I came here to address our Nation's challenges  and take those tough votes gladly because I want to make a difference.   I chatted with a more senior member at the airport Friday who  commented that only 100 or 150 Members of this body are prepared to  truly work on solving this problem, to compromise, and take a tough  vote on immigration.   Some believe their idea is the only approach. Some have election  fears. Some want to message on this issue at elections.   Less than 12,000 individuals have ever served in the House of  Representatives. To all with the honor and responsibility of being in  this Chamber, I say, now is the time to step up, work on this issue,  compromise, tackle the dilemma, and then take a vote to move it forward  to a better place.   Because, again: ``Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,  nothing is going to get better. It's not.''                            ____________________
