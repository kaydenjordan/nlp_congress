 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Langevin) for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4627.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Donovan, for this important  legislation, which contains a critical provision to ensure that our  antiterrorism funds go to their intended purpose.   Three months ago, we heard rumors of plans to use precious homeland  security funding to distribute guns to teachers. I introduced language  to block this idea, and I am glad to say that this language has,  indeed, been included in H.R. 4627.   As a former law enforcement commander, I was assigned to Orlando  International Airport during the 9/11 attacks. I have seen firsthand  the vital  [[Page H5271]]  need for our antiterrorism funding to be used wisely, carefully, and  precisely to prevent terrorist attacks before they occur.   It is essential that our students go to school safely. Arming  teachers would be both impractical and immoral. Requiring teachers to  stop mass shooters not only shifts our responsibilities as lawmakers to  them, but it also shifts the hurt, the pain, the guilt, and,  potentially, the liability when they find themselves outskilled and  outgunned by a shooter with a weapon of war.   We already, as you all know, ask our overworked and underpaid  teachers to do too much. We must find ways to continue to allow them to  teach. Let's support them in helping all of our children reach their  full potential and continue to work with our law enforcement  departments to reduce gun violence.   Our limited homeland security funding should be used to prevent  terrorist attacks in our local communities. Therefore, I join my  colleagues here on the floor, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support H.R. 4627.
