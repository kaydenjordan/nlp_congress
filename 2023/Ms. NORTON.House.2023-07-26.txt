 Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs to provide support to law school  clinical programs and provide pro bono legal and support services to  veterans, including assistance with disability claims and appeals and  foreclosures. The House passed this amendment last year.   There are already at least 22 law schools that have clinics devoted  to veterans' legal needs, including William and Mary Law School  Veterans Benefits Clinic, which serves as a national model for this  idea and was the first recipient of the ``best practice'' award for the  VA.  [[Page H3996]]    There are many other law schools, such as the University of the  District of Columbia's David A. Clarke School of Law that are  interested in starting their own VA certified clinics. More needs to be  done to sustain and increase the number of these programs.   I was a tenured professor of law and continued to teach a seminar  after being elected to Congress. I saw the expert attention that  clinical programs provide their clients.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, a concrete  measure that would assist our veterans who put their lives on the line  for this country.
