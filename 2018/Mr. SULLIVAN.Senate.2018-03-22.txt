 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wish to add my words to what we saw on  the Senate floor here a couple of minutes ago. I had the honor of  presiding over much of the ceremony recognizing Senator Thad Cochran's  incredible service to Mississippi and to America. You heard a lot. It  was really remarkable--45 years in the Congress and four decades as a  U.S. Senator. I think Senator Leahy, from Vermont, said it best when he  talked about Thad Cochran's integrity--a man who will always keep his  word.   As Alaska's Senator, I also want to mention what a great friend he  was to our State and to our Senators. Senator Cochran was very close to  Senator Ted Stevens--the late Senator Ted Stevens--and to Frank  Murkowski. He really supported our State--my State--and I want to thank  him for that.   He has this great nickname that I think was given to him in 2006,  when Time Magazine said he was one of the best U.S. Senators and called  him the ``quiet persuader.'' You heard that term a lot just a few  minutes ago. In that article, they said that he had gained the trust of  the administration and on Capitol Hill for his quiet, courtly manner,  using his experience and mastery of the issues to persuade his  colleagues privately rather than making demands of them in public.   It is a great example we can all learn from. I was proud to have been  able to serve and learn from Thad Cochran for the last 3 years.                           Tribute to Carlos Gomez    Mr. President, one of the things I enjoy doing in my duties in the  Senate is to come down each week to recognize somebody special in my  State--somebody who has made a difference for their community, somebody  who might not get the attention that people get in the press or in  other areas but someone who has really made an impact. I like to call  that person our Alaskan of the Week.   Right now what has been happening in Alaska is a very special time.  Our State, in many ways, is shrouded with myth and mystique. We  certainly have, I believe, the most beautiful State in the country.  There is a lot of excitement that happens, a lot of special things.  Just last week, we had 60 mushers who were being pulled by dog teams,  dozens of dogs--these great athletes, as we call them--nearly 1,000  miles through some of the harshest landscapes and some of the harshest  climates. We just finished the Iditarod, the last great race. We want  to encourage people watching on TV and people in the Galleries to come  on up to Alaska. You will love it. It will be the trip of a lifetime.  Come see the Iditarod next year, the last great race. We just finished  that.   It is a great time to be in Alaska. It is still winter, of course. It  is time to ski and for snow machines. It is still cold, and there is  lots of snow, but the sun is now coming out high in the sky. Of course,  in Alaska, there is hockey. We love hockey. We all know it is a tough  and competitive sport, but it certainly fits into the ethos of my  State. All across the State, kids and adults play hockey--boys, girls,  men, and women, in indoor and outdoor rinks, ponds, and lakes--and  skate up and take to the ice.  [[Page S1900]]    However, as many parents who are involved in hockey know, gear can be  very expensive. Actually, hockey can be very expensive. Many kids and  adults can miss out on this great, great sport--a great sport in my  State--because of the cost.   I would like to introduce you to Anchorage resident Carlos Gomez, who  is our Alaskan of the Week. He has dedicated an extraordinary amount of  his time and his life to try to make sure that all kids in my State-- boys and girls from all walks of life--get to play hockey, like so many  others do in Alaska, no matter if they can afford it or not.   Let me tell you about Mr. Carlos Gomez, because he is not one to brag  about himself. Like most Alaskans of the Week, he is an unsung hero,  doing so much for the community. His impact on hockey--particularly,  for the youth of Alaska--is remarkable. In many ways, his story is  truly a classic story of the American dream.   Carlos was born in California. When he was 10, he and his brother  went to live with an aunt in San Diego. His wife Dalia was born in  Colombia and then moved to Alaska, also with an aunt, when she was just  7 years old. Carlos received a scholarship from the University of  California San Diego but had to drop out and cut his studies short  because the strain of both going to school and providing for his family  and contributing enough for his family was very difficult.   He ended up in Alaska in 1972 to work as an ironworker, where he  helped to build our State. He built the Alaska pipeline during that  time. It was a huge and exciting time in the State. He met his wife  Dalia, as I mentioned, and they settled down in a modest home in  Airport Heights, AK, and began to raise a family.   They had three wonderful kids. His daughters are Monica and Natalie,  and his son is Scott. All of them are great, bright kids. One of them,  Scott, who we in Alaska simply call Scotty--and I will get to that--had  amazing athletic talents. When Scotty was just 4 years old, Carlos took  him to his first hockey game. Scotty wanted to try it himself. Soon the  young boy was hooked and wanted to play hockey as often as he could,  and he was good. The problem was that although they weren't poor as a  family, they didn't have the extra money for all the equipment and the  expense that hockey requires. The Anchorage Boys & Girls Club had a  program that loaned out hockey equipment and hockey gear. They helped  to utilize that. As Scotty grew, he needed more equipment, and he  stayed focused on hockey. Soon Carlos, our Alaskan of the Week, became  so involved in youth hockey and had such a heart for the youth who  wanted to play hockey in Alaska but had difficulty affording it that he  became this master fundraiser throughout Alaska for the sport, not only  for his son but for all the kids in the community who wanted to play  hockey across the city.   Fast forward to 1998, and Scotty, his son, a 4-year-old playing  hockey on ponds in Anchorage, is selected by the New Jersey Devils as  their first-round draft choice--the first Latino ever drafted to be in  the first round of the NHL draft. Scotty went on to become an all-star,  Stanley Cup winner and a recipient of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the  league's rookie of the year--all in his first NHL season. That is not  bad for a little kid from Anchorage--all before he turned 21. He went  on to win another Stanley Cup and later played for the New York  Rangers, the Montreal Canadiens, the San Jose Sharks, the Florida  Panthers, and the St. Louis Blues. He even chose to return home to  Anchorage during the NHL lockout to play briefly for our very own  Alaska Aces.   As you can imagine, Scotty is quite popular and well-known in  Anchorage. He is admired by so many, and his father is as well. He  could have stopped championing, as he has done for so many years, the  sport of hockey at any point along the way, but what he did was that he  kept doing this. He kept working. He kept encouraging young kids in  Alaska to get on the ice to achieve their goals, just like his son  did. So Carlos, Scotty, and the rest of the family set up the Scotty  Gomez Foundation, which is devoted to that cause, and Carlos Gomez is  still running it today. There are more kids like Scotty out there,  Carlos said, and ``we're going to give that kid an opportunity,'' like  my son had.    The foundation has done so much for youth hockey in Alaska. Thousands  of kids across the State have access to gear and the ability to play  this great sport that they otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. Around  Anchorage's rinks, you will find the dark blue and gold gear--just like  our Alaska flag--with a ram. It is the Gomez ram, and it helps kids, no  matter their backgrounds or experience, get on the ice and play this  great sport.   The foundation has put money into rehabbing rinks, like the one in  East Anchorage, which is the neighborhood outdoor rink where Scotty  learned to play hockey. When the Anchorage School District dropped the  girls' high school hockey in the spring of 2013, the Scotty Gomez  Foundation, under Carlos's leadership, stepped up, picked up the sport  for 3 years, and redeveloped it into cooperatives across Anchorage's  eight public high schools. Girls' hockey in Anchorage is alive today  because of Carlos Gomez and his family. Also, in his never forgetting  the generosity given to Scotty in his start in hockey, the foundation  sponsors youth hockey events and grants for the Boys & Girls Club of  Anchorage. That is really giving back to the community.   One of the Scotty Gomez Foundation's biggest events every year is the  Last Frontier Pond Hockey Classic, which is organized by Carlos and his  partner, Mike Davenport, in Big Lake. The event took place just two  weekends ago, and it was quite an event. More than 600 hockey players  showed up--kids, lawyers, doctors, slope workers, former pro and  college players--men and women. Counting everybody, more than 1,000  people, from all walks of life, went to the event to raise money for  youth hockey in Alaska.   It is amazing what one family can do to touch so many, led by Mr.  Carlos Gomez. As Scotty said, ``It was my father's dream to give back.  This is all him. He always just wants to help others.''   If you are a kid in Alaska who wants to play hockey, Carlos Gomez  will egg you on and make sure nothing, especially the cost of  equipment, will stop you.   Scotty said:         When I was growing up, he was like a father to all of the       neighborhood kids who needed one. My dad's a true hero.    I thank Mr. Carlos Gomez for all he has done for Alaska's youth and  youth hockey throughout our great State. We are honored to call him our  Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
