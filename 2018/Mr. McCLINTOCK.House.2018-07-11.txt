 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2075) to adjust the eastern boundary of the Deschutes  Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Area in the State of Oregon to  facilitate fire prevention and response activities in order to protect  adjacent private property, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2075         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Crooked River Ranch Fire       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Crooked River Ranch is an unincorporated community       with a population of 5,000 residents.        (2) The current lands located adjacent to Crooked River       Ranch are managed by the Bureau of Land Management and are       classified as a Wilderness Study Area.        (3) There is currently only one entrance/exit to the       Crooked River Ranch.        (4) Jefferson County and Crooked River Ranch have       determined that the Wilderness Study Area lands are in the       highest risk category for exposure to devastating wildfire       due to overstocked juniper stands under the federally       mandated and locally promulgated Jefferson County Community       Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP).        (5) The current Wilderness Study Area classification       prevents mechanical fire prevention activities within the       overstocked juniper stands.        (6) Advancing this proposed legislation will greatly       enhance the life and safety of people and property by       reducing the extreme fire threat to these lands.  [[Page H6068]]            SEC. 3. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT, DESCHUTES CANYON-STEELHEAD FALLS                     AND DESCHUTES CANYON WILDERNESS STUDY AREAS,                     OREGON.         (a) Boundary Adjustment Required.--The Secretary of the       Interior shall adjust the eastern boundary of the Deschutes       Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Area and the       Deschutes Canyon Wilderness Study Area in the State of Oregon       to exclude approximately 832 acres, as depicted on the map       entitled ``Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study       Area'' and dated April 6, 2017, in order to facilitate fire       prevention and response activities on the excluded public       lands and adjacent private property.        (b) Effect of Exclusion.--Effective on the date of the       enactment of this Act, the public lands to be excluded from       the Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Area       and the Deschutes Canyon Wilderness Study Area pursuant to       subsection (a) are no longer subject to section 603(c) of the       Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C.       1782(c)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, Crooked River Ranch is a residential community that is  home to approximately 5,500 people. It is located between the Deschutes  and Crooked Rivers in Jefferson County, Oregon. Because of this  geography, there is only one all-weather road in and out of Crooked  River Ranch.   Now, right next to this community, along the Deschutes River, is a  roughly 3,200-acre Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study  Area, which is managed--or, more accurately, is mismanaged--by the  Bureau of Land Management. This BLM property is thick with vegetation,  which poses a very real risk for catastrophic wildfires, in large part  because the wilderness study area regulations greatly restrict  essential measures for both fire mitigation and firefighting.   For example, in a wilderness or wilderness study area, you can't use  mechanized or motorized equipment or transport. This includes chainsaws  as well as electrical generators, trucks, and larger equipment  essential to fuels management. You can't even use this equipment to cut  fire breaks. You can't build fire roads. You can't do mechanical  thinning of vegetation. Even the hand thinning that is allowed in such  areas is very limited.   Absent a waiver from the Secretary of the Interior, firefighters  can't drop fire retardant or use bulldozers to cut fire breaks in the  wilderness study area during a fire. Tragically, the benign neglect  mandated by these requirements has made all wilderness areas firetraps  just waiting for a lighting flash or a careless match.   H.R. 2075, authored by Congressman  Greg Walden, with the support of  the local community, would slightly modify the eastern boundary of the  Deschutes Canyon-Steelhead Falls Wilderness Study Area, making it  possible to manage the land properly to reduce fuel loads that threaten  the neighborhoods in Crooked River Ranch.   The boundary change will reduce the WSA by about 830 acres, but this  small change will promote public safety, allow for more efficient fuels  treatments on the lands immediately adjacent to Crooked River Ranch,  and give critically important flexibility to local firefighters should  fire break out in that area.   This is an issue of public safety, and this bill will clearly help  protect the lives and property of the thousands of Crooked River Ranch  residents from wildfire.   I commend Congressman Walden for his work to provide a commonsense  solution to a very real public safety concern. I urge adoption of the  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the author of this legislation  and the elected representative of this threatened community.    Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the more than 5,000  residents of the Crooked River Ranch and in the name of common sense, I  ask for passage of this vital public safety measure, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
