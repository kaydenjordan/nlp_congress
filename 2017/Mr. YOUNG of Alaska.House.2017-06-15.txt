 Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege last Sunday to  be an observer in Puerto Rico for the plebiscite and watch the people  of Puerto Rico make the decision that they would like to be the 51st  State.   I think it is time for this Congress to make the 3,400,000 American  citizens part of the United States--in full grandeur, as every one of  us have--and have a chance of making sure we can vote for everyone to  be part of this.   I think it is time that America should stop colonizing. If I am not  mistaken, this is the last Nation that has a colony. The great America  of the United States has a colony, and I think it is time that we  change that. Vote in Congress to make sure that we have the 51st State.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from  Maryland, Steny Hoyer, for the support. It is going to take a lot of  effort. There is a lot of naysayers out there. But, again, I believe so  strongly that we treat every American equally.   This is a civil rights issue, and they have voted 97 percent in favor  of statehood. As you know, I led this battle with your help in 1997. We  had a vote, and, with your side, I won by one vote. Puerto Rico and  Alaska didn't go anywhere, but I ask every American to think about it.   Let's make this the last colony. Let's make this the 51st State.                            ____________________
