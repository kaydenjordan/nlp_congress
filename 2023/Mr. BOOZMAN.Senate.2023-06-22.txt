 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Joe Fox  for his years of service and dedication to the State of Arkansas. For  the past 11 years, Mr. Fox has served as the Arkansas State Forester,  directing the good work of the forestry division within the Arkansas  Department of Agriculture to promote and steward the State's forestry  community.   His leadership, dedication, and passion for forestry is worthy of  celebration as his service as State forester comes to a well-deserved  retirement. Joe boasts a long and rich history advocating for our  natural resources. Prior to this role, he worked as the director of  conservation forestry for the Arkansas branch of the Nature  Conservancy. He is also the former president of the Arkansas Forestry  Association and served on the Arkansas Forestry Commission from 1987 to  1997, serving as chairman in 1995 and 1996.   A native Arkansan, Joe is a third-generation lumber industry  professional and the first in his family to receive a forestry degree  from a university. His vast experience in conservation forestry has  been instrumental in promoting forest health, stewardship, and  conservation. Joe has been the guiding voice for the division of  forestry and I, as well as the State of Arkansas, have been blessed to  benefit from his advice and knowledge throughout his tenure. His  testimony and expertise have been essential in informing forestry- related policy through our work on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition,  and Forestry Committee. I am pleased to consider Joe a friend and am  grateful for his service to our State.   I commend Joe for a job well done and wish him the best in this next  chapter of his life.                            ____________________
