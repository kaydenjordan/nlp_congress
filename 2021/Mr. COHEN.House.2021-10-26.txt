 Madam Speaker, a heartbreaking statistic of the COVID-  [[Page H5905]]  19 pandemic has been the increase of domestic and family violence that  continues to affect Americans across the country. It has alarmingly  gone up. We must do all we can to keep children and families safe  throughout this pandemic and at all times.   My amendment is part of the en bloc package, and it simply clarifies  grant eligibility to include legal aid organizations that provide  violence prevention services.   There is a direct relationship between legal intervention and a  decline in domestic violence. One study found that obtaining a  permanent protection order resulted in an 80 percent reduction in  physical violence in the 12 months after initial client contact.   Another study found that women represented by legal counsel obtained  a protection order 83 percent of the time, while those without legal  counsel only received a protection order 32 percent of the time.   In the United States, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men have experienced  domestic violence, resulting in tens of millions of Americans  experiencing domestic violence in their lifetimes.   Legal aid is a critical prevention tool to help limit the damage  domestic violence causes.   I want to thank Chairman Scott, Legal Services Corporation, the  National Domestic Violence Hotline, and all of the domestic violence  prevention organizations for their support of the inclusion of this  amendment and the vital work that they do.   I want to thank Reisha Buster on my staff, Kevin on my staff, and all  of the other members of my staff.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  overall bill.
