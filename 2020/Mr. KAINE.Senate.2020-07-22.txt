 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 316, S. 906.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  amendment be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, be considered  read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill, as amended.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about a provision  of the National Defense Authorization Act that would direct the  renaming of military bases and facilities that are currently named for  those who voluntarily fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War.   I thank Senator Warren for offering the amendment, and I particularly  thank her for making adjustments to the amendment to accommodate  concerns of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I was proud to  cosponsor the revised amendment in committee and speak in favor of it  today.   It is important to state clearly what this amendment will do. If it  passes and survives a threatened Presidential veto, it will require the  Department of Defense to initiate a 3-year process to change the name  of any military base, barracks, or other facility named after a  Confederate military leader. Why 3 years? The timing is designed to  allow a full public process in each location so that the desires of the  community leaders can be taken into account in choosing new names.   I state with clarity the substance of the amendment because one of my  colleagues took the floor earlier this month to oppose the amendment,  and he obscured its purpose in describing it, only saying that it  required that ``some of the names of our Nation's military bases must  be removed.'' He neglected to mention that the amendment specifically  sought change only to facilities named for Confederates. In fact, he  did not mention the Confederacy or the Civil War at all.   If you are unwilling to be plain about what is at stake, it portrays  a weakness in your position. So let me be plain. I speak today because  I am a Senator from the State with the most at stake in this  discussion. Three of the ten bases whose names must be changed under  this amendment are in Virginia. Virginia was the State whose people  were most affected by the Civil War, and I served as its 70th Governor.  My hometown of Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy, and I  served as its 76th mayor. I have dealt with issues of Civil War names,  statues, memorials, battlefields, and buildings throughout my 26 years  in public life. Based on decades of grappling with this question, I  want to describe a principle, explain an epiphany, and finally pose a  question.   First, a principle: If you declare war on the United States, take up  arms against it, and kill U.S. troops, you should not have a U.S.  military base named after you.   If you declare war on the United States, take up arms against it, and  kill U.S. troops, you should not have a U.S. military base named after  you.   This principle is nowhere stated in law because it need not be. It is  a basic commonsense principle. The principle explains why we have no  Fort Cornwallis, Fort Benedict Arnold, Fort Santa Ana, Fort Von  Hindenburg, Fort Tojo, Fort Ho Chi Minh   If you declare war on the United States, take up arms against it, and  kill U.S. troops, you should not have a U.S. military base named after  you, but we make an exception. Ten bases and many other military  facilities are named after Confederate leaders who declared war on the  United States, took up arms against it, and killed U.S. troops. Even  further, they took these actions to destroy the United States, to tear  our country in half so that the seceding Southern States could continue  to own those of African descent as slaves--a species of property-- rather than treating them as equal human beings. Is this worthy of  honor? Does it justify an exception to the sound principle that I  describe?   Why were these 10 bases so named when they were constructed in the  years before and during the First and Second World Wars? The names were  not chosen due to the military skill of the Confederate leaders. Some  are revered for their prowess, but some are reviled. The names were not  chosen to honor the character of the 10 leaders. Some are respected-- excepting the blight on character that support for slavery confers--but  others were not  [[Page S4400]]  distinguished in their behavior or their integrity. The record makes  clear that the 10 bases were named for Confederate leaders upon their  construction during the First and Second World Wars because of a  lingering belief in their cause--dividing the Nation to uphold slavery  and White supremacy.   In the days of mandated segregation, a vibrant Ku Klux Klan, popular  culture painting a false picture of the war and its aftermath with  films like ``The Birth of a Nation'' and ``Gone with the Wind,'' there  was a powerful desire to hold up the Confederate cause, to sanitize the  Confederate cause and deny the reality of African-American suffering.  That desire even affected this very body during those years, as the  Senate repeatedly used the filibuster to block Federal anti-lynching  legislation.   It is clear now, as it has been clear for a very long time, that the  cause of the Confederacy was not just but monstrous. Destroying the  Nation to preserve slavery would have been a catastrophe.   History can't be rewritten, and it is important to tell it, but  choosing who to honor is another matter entirely. I repeat a principle  that I believe brooks no exception: If you declare war on the United  States, take up arms against it, and kill U.S. troops, you should not  have a U.S. military base named after you.   This wisdom was understood immediately in the aftermath of the Civil  War by Robert E. Lee. He was asked about memorials to the Confederacy  and stated: ``I think it wiser not to keep open the sores of war but to  follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the  marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.''  This amendment is consistent with Lee's wise observation.   Second, let me explain an epiphany that I have had just in the last  few months. When I moved to Virginia to get married in 1984, I saw the  Confederate statues in Richmond, and I was puzzled. As a Kansas-raised  civil rights lawyer and then later as a local elected official in a  city that was majority African American, I was struck by their  continued prominence. But together with the leadership of my diverse  city, we viewed these statues and other symbols of the Confederacy as  painful symbols of an incomplete past--painful because of the reality  of slavery and discrimination, which have warped our Commonwealth and  country since 1619, and incomplete as well. Where were the statues to  Richmond heroes from the revolution or the civil rights movement? Why  did our city highlight 4 years out of a 250-year history and downplay  everything else?   My generation of Richmond leaders endeavored to solve this problem by  painting a more complete picture--statues of Arthur Ashe, Abraham  Lincoln, Maggie Walker, a civil rights memorial on our capitol grounds,  new municipal buildings, courts, schools, many named after prominent  African Americans, women leaders. Aging bridges that had been named for  Confederate generals were eventually replaced and named for civil  rights heroes.   In short, we viewed this problem as one that could be solved with a  path of addition--not replacing the painful symbols of the past but  instead adding to our built environment the recognition of people and  eras that had not previously been honored. This was necessary and  important work. I was proud to play my part in it during my 16 years in  local and State service.    But in recent months, as I spent our extended April quarantine in  Richmond and I talked to people about whether Confederate statues on  our Monument Avenue should be removed, I learned something. When I  refer to these statues as symbols of a painful past, again and again, I  was told: Tim, you might see these statues as signifying a painful  past, but we see them as signs of a painful present and even predictors  of a difficult future.   This sort of stopped me in my tracks. I asked my friends to explain.  Here is a composite of what they told me: If honoring these  Confederates were just about the past, that would be one thing. But  these statues are honored in the present by a city and State that  maintain them, spotlight them, emphasize their beauty, and market their  appeal to tourists. In the present, these statues become a rallying  point for neo-Confederates and others who would take us back, just as  occurred in Charlottesville in 2017.   The present is pretty frightening. African Americans are dying of  COVID at disproportionate rates. The job losses in this economic  collapse are falling so hard on African-American communities. We see  scenes of police violence against African Americans playing endlessly  on our televisions, and we don't see an immediate end to these  disparities.   Do you really expect us to believe that a society that continues to  honor those who tried to destroy our country to save slavery will be  serious about ending the racial disparities that exist today? You  either support the equality of all or you don't. If you honor those who  opposed our equality--indeed, opposed the very notion of our humanity-- what hope can we have about overcoming the real-time injustices that  are manifest all around us?   I thank God I can still learn some new things at age 62. In my view,  the statues and base names and the other Confederate honorifics that  dot the American landscape have been about the past. But I now see  that, for so many, they raise deep and troubling questions about the  present and the future. Are we committed to the equality of all--the  moral North Star announced by Jefferson in the Declaration of  Independence and reconfirmed by Lincoln at Gettysburg? If we continue  to honor men who fought to deprive those of African descent of their  equality, we signal that we are not committed to our most fundamental  American value.   Finally, there are questions for those, including the President, who  attack those who want to remove Confederate names from military bases  or take down Confederate statues.   When you saw young Germans in 1989 spray graffiti on the Berlin Wall  and knock it down, how did you feel? I know how you felt. You felt good  to see people standing up to leaders and saying: You will no longer  divide us.   When you saw people throughout the Soviet bloc pulling down statues  of Stalin and Lenin after the collapse of the Soviet Union or Iraqis  pulling down statues of Saddam Hussein, how did you feel? I know how  you felt. You felt good to see people standing and saying with their  actions: We will no longer glorify tyrants who oppressed us.   When you see hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers in the streets  protesting against the Chinese Government, how do you feel? I know how  you feel because I heard you, even in this Chamber. You feel good  seeing everyday people standing up against a government that would  deprive them of their basic freedom.   Well, if you feel that way--and I believe virtually all Americans  do--how can we feel otherwise about patriotic Americans who believe in  a nation committed to the equality of all when they stand up and say:  We will not be divided. We will not glorify those who oppressed us. We  will not honor those who stood against our freedom. That is what our  people, especially our young people, are saying to us now. Supporting  this amendment will show them that we are listening.   In conclusion, we Americans have grown as a nation and as a people  since the Civil War. And we have grown as a nation and as a people  since the first half of the 20th century when, in very different  circumstances, it was still seen as a good idea to honor the  Confederacy.   One of the key areas of our growth--admittedly a progress of fits and  starts--has been a greater acceptance of others, regardless of race or  religion or sexual orientation or gender or nationality or physical  ability. Thank God for that growth. Of course, the evidence all around  shows that we still have a long way to go to reach full equality. It  might be like the North Star. We can steer by it, but it is not in the  capacity of mortal mankind to reach it.   But when we do steer by it and step in its direction, we become  better. That is what this amendment will accomplish, and it is why I so  strongly support it   I yield the floor.    Mr. President. There are significant racial and ethnic  inequities in maternal and infant mortality rates in the U.S. According  to the CDC, the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women in  2018 is more than 2.5 times higher than the maternal mortality rate of  non-Hispanic white women, and the infant mortality rate of non-Hispanic  Black women is more than 2.3 times higher than the infant mortality  rate of non-Hispanic white women. Any pregnant woman choosing to have a  child should be able to do so safely without regard to income, race,  ethnicity, employment status, or any other socio-economic factor.'   This is why Senator Murkowoski and I are introducing the Mothers and  Newborns Success Act, which aims to reduce maternal and infant  mortality, ensure that all infants can grow up healthy and safe, and  protect women's health before, during, and after pregnancy. Our  legislation supports innovation in maternal health delivery and  improves data collection on maternal mortality and maternal deaths. The  bill will help ensure that women are matched with birthing facilities  that are risk-appropriate for their particular needs to improve  maternal and neonatal care and outcomes. The legislation strengthens  support for women during the critical postpartum period, the year after  birth, and will help ensure pregnant women get the vaccinations they  need and are aware of maternal health warning signs. The bill promotes  maternal health research and the use of telehealth to help high-risk  expectant mothers in geographically-isolated areas. The Mothers and  Newborns Success Act is a significant step toward reducing racial,  ethnic, and geographic inequities in maternal and infant health. I am  glad that my colleague Rep. Terri Sewell will be introducing companion  legislation in the House of Representatives.   Given COV1D-19's disproportionate impact on communities of color and  recent research from the CDC which finds that pregnant women with  COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized and admitted to the ICU,  this legislation is especially timely.   No woman should fear for her or her child's health because of her  race. We need to ensure more women of color and their children,  particularly Black women and children, receive equitable care. COVID-19  and its impact on pregnant women has only underscored the need for  urgent action. By advancing evidence-based policies to improve maternal  and infant health outcomes, this bill will work to reduce and eliminate  preventable maternal and infant mortality in the United States. I'm  calling on my Senate colleagues to support this bill and include it in  the next coronavirus relief package so we can enact positive systemic  changes to make sure more women and newborns thrive and have the  maximum chance for success.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Enzi):   S. 4275. A bill to require recipients of Pandemic Unemployment  Assistance to provide employment documentation, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Finance.
