 Mr. President, yesterday, every single Republican  rejected the Democratic leader's attempt to separate border security  from national security. As we have said for weeks, that was a futile  effort that was doomed to fail from the very beginning. Hopefully, the  Senate can now seize a new opportunity to make real progress on  legislation that addresses urgent national security priorities both at  home and abroad.   So let's establish a few things going forward: It is profoundly  unserious to pretend that national security priorities don't include  securing our Nation's borders, to warn about borders in jeopardy and  not start with the one that is being overrun here at home, to invoke  threats facing sovereign nations without a clear plan to uphold  America's own sovereignty.   Mr. President, I am not in need of any lectures about the gravity of  the challenges facing national security. I don't need any admonishments  about what is at stake for America and our allies in Ukraine's fight  against Russian aggression. I am well aware that the world's largest  state sponsor of terrorism remains undeterred from trying to kill  Americans in the Middle East. And I certainly have not forgotten that  China, our top strategic adversary, is watching what we do very  closely.  [[Page S5833]]    Instead, unfortunately, it has been the Biden administration-- including our Commander in Chief--who has all too often needed  reminders about the responsibilities of a global superpower. From  Europe to the Middle East, the administration has reached new heights  of self-deterrence.   With Putin's forces massing on the borders of Ukraine, the  administration slow-walked lethal assistance. As the Russian offensive  unfolded, they held back the most decisive capabilities Ukraine needed  out of an unfounded fear of escalation.   And even with further security assistance hanging in the balance, the  Biden administration has been slow--very slow--to sell this urgent  measure and its massive domestic benefits to our people here at home.   From the outset, the Biden administration resumed the Obama-era  efforts to reset relations with Tehran and removed the Iran-backed  Houthis from the terrorism list. Also, it is no surprise that Iran has  snubbed its nose at these displays of weakness. It is no surprise that  U.S. personnel are facing a spike in terrorist attacks from Iraq and  Syria to the Red Sea. But the administration continues to pull its  punches.   And meanwhile, Republicans have spent years urging the administration  to start performing even the bare minimum of its fundamental  responsibility to secure our southern border and enforce our Nation's  laws.   Right now, the crisis created by the Biden administration's neglect  is bringing illegal aliens to the United States at the rate of 300,000  a month. That is roughly the population of Lexington, KY, arriving  every month. And thanks to an asylum and parole system that desperately  needs fixing, many of them are just brought straight in.   I know many of our Democratic colleagues recognize the urgency of  this crisis. I know many of them are ready to help restore sanity at  our southern border.   Well, Senator Lankford, Senator Graham, and other Republican  colleagues are still working hard to do exactly that. There is no time  like the present to join them in those efforts.                                    Syria    Mr. President, now, on a different matter, this morning the Senate  will vote on a resolution calling for the withdrawal of American  military forces from Syria. Passage of such a resolution would be a  gift to Iran and its terrorist network. Driving American troops from  the Middle East is exactly what they would like to see.   Adopting this short-sighted measure would wreck America's credibility  in the region. It would encourage Iran's proxies to open a northern  front in the territorial war against Israel. It would invite America's  adversaries to challenge our military presence throughout the world.   Back in 2019, as our colleagues may recall, the Senate went on record  about the wisdom of withdrawing prematurely from Syria and Afghanistan.  At that time, the vast majority of us rejected such a retreat. And  those who didn't have since watched President Biden's disastrous  withdrawal from Afghanistan, Putin's escalation against Ukraine,  China's growing challenge to international peace and stability, and  Iran's glaring threat to America and to Israel.   Today is the 82nd anniversary of Pearl Harbor. It is a day to  remember the cost of being caught on our heels. A vote in favor of this  resolution is a vote for retreat in the face of terror.                                  Bidenomics    Mr. President, now, on one final matter, working Americans can't seem  to catch a break from Bidenomics. Washington Democrats' spending sprees  on President Biden's watch have driven inflation up 17.6 percent. And  the effects are becoming inescapable.   In my home State, many small business owners have been forced to  raise their prices to keep up with the rising costs. One shop owner in  Lexington, put it:         I make food and chocolates and all the ingredients have       gone up.        I've been battling with increasing my prices which I don't       want to do.    Just like in cities and towns across the country, small businesses in  Lexington are facing declining foot traffic, which might have something  to do with the consumers' shrinking paychecks. Inflation is eating away  at people's savings.   By one estimate, the average American family would need an extra  $11,400 a year just to maintain the standard of living they had when  President Biden took office. And, needless to say, folks on fixed  incomes are among the hardest hit.   One 68-year-old retiree in western Massachusetts summed up his  struggle to make ends meet in the Biden economy. Here is what he said:         You get your check and then you have to sit down there . .       . like `What am I going to pay [out]? Am I going to get food       or lose my electricity?' . . . I can't spend nothing anymore.       I have to pay rent, utilities, food, medicine.    This is what the American people are up against. This is everyday  life under Bidenomics. Bizarrely, the Biden administration still seems  to hold its favorite phrase in high esteem. The White House Press  Secretary called Bidenomics ``the word of the year.''   Well, working Americans feel quite differently. And the President's  hometown is no exception. As one resident from Scranton, PA, reported  recently:         [E]verything is going up, except for paychecks.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
