 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Tara  Roe Smith. Tara attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October  1. She lived in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada, where she was a wonderful  mother to her two kids, Lennon and Louis, and was a loving wife to her  husband Zach.   Tara was a hard worker who modeled with Sophia Models International,  worked as an educational assistant with children with autism, and was  about to be promoted to be a manager at a restaurant where she was a  waitress.   Tara was very active and loved dancing, swimming, and being at her  favorite summer spot, Clear Lake. Going to the Route 91 festival was an  annual tradition for Tara and her husband. They would be there every  year to celebrate their anniversary.   Tara was dedicated to her community, and if she had survived, her  husband has no doubt that she would have done everything she could to  help those who were victims of the Las Vegas shooting.   She was a very caring spirit who greeted everyone with a friendly  face. I would like to extend my condolences to Tara Roe Smith's family  and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of  Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
