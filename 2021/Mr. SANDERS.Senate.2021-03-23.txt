 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate, and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1868, an act to prevent  across-the-board direct spending cuts, which was received from the  House and is at the desk.   I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    I object.
