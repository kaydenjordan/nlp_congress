 Madam Speaker, 2 miles down the road from this very  Chamber, in 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr. stood on the steps of the  Lincoln Memorial and proclaimed his vision for the future:   ``I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a  Nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by  the content of their character.''   Nearly 60 years later, radical far-left Democrats are doing  everything possible to eliminate this dream through the implementation  of critical race theory.   Instead of equality, critical race theory frames race, not character,  as the focal point of the human construct, implying that one's racial  identity defines who they are and who they will ever be.   To these CRT believers, your fate has already been decided by your  skin color.   To the average American living outside the swamp bubble, this idea is  ludicrous.   Everyday Americans have seen individuals of all races and backgrounds  succeed. They know hard work and character are the biggest determinants  of success, and the American Dream is alive and well for everyone.   But critical race theory wants to poison our classrooms by pushing an  agenda which revolves around race, not character. They want to teach  young minds that racism persists even if no individual or institution  acts in a racist way or holds any racist beliefs.   This toxic teaching squashes hope, stifles growth, and fuels anger  and despair.  [[Page H3760]]    What began as a theory for civil rights lawyers to debate has  transformed into harmful messages that ultimately seek to further  divide our Nation.   CRT and The 1619 Project have no place in our schools, our  workplaces, or our military.   Our Nation's founding principles of equality and freedom are worth  fighting for and protecting. While our Nation isn't perfect, we always  strive for that more perfect Union. We have made progress in the last  100 years and are still the greatest Nation in the world. This progress  would be lost should we allow the divisive, racist rhetoric of critical  race theory into our classrooms.   As a mother and a former teacher, I believe our education system is  at its best when we inspire our young people to be all they can be and  share with them the principles showcased in America's traditional  motto, ``e pluribus unum,'' which means, out of many, one. That is the  unique greatness of our country, the idea of being a melting pot of  people from different countries, races, and backgrounds, but we become  one as Americans.    Our schools should never stifle the growth of our children, belittle  them based on the color of their skin, or teach them that they  themselves or their families are racist regardless of their individual  beliefs.   The American Dream is alive and well and should be fanned into  flames, not crushed by critical race theory's restrictive and damaging  rhetoric. That is the last thing our children need.   Since critical race theory has entered the national discussion,  Missourians and parents across the country have expressed strong  disdain for teaching our students that this country is inherently  racist and that minority groups are unable to succeed within our  country's current systems and institutions.   Today, I stand by those parents. I cannot condone an education system  that teaches students to be ashamed of our country and to judge each  other based on the color of our skin. And I believe neither would  Martin Luther King, Jr. Our kids deserve better.                            ____________________
