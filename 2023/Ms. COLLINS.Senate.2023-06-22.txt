 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 175th  anniversary of Unum, a great company with deep Maine roots, the  country's largest provider of private disability insurance and a leader  in advancing the health and financial security of America's workers.   When the company was incorporated in Maine in 1848 as Union Mutual,  the very first policy issued covered founder and president Elisha B.  Pratt for $5,000. Today, Unum helps protect 45 million people and their  families across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland. The  company pays $8 billion in benefits each year and helps many people in  their journey back to work after a long illness or injury. More than  180,000 businesses, including many of America's largest companies,  partner with Unum to provide for their employee's well-being.   Unum has a long history in Maine and is today one our State's major  employers with a proud tradition of providing access to insurance  coverage for workers and their families. The company was a pioneer in  the nascent insurance market in the United States and, over the years,  has provided businesses and individuals with new ways to help protect  their financial futures.   A century ago, Unum was the first to offer life insurance through  group coverage, enabling employees to purchase policies at reduced  premiums. Nearly 85 years ago, the company introduced the first  disability insurance to provide workers with the ability to protect  their paychecks in the event of illness or injury.   An article titled ``The Popular Home Company'' in the ``Maine Board  of Trade Journal'' from 1905 offered two examples of business practices  that illustrate the principles that guide the company: It writes  policies in simple, understandable language devoid of technicalities,  and it pioneered extending insurance coverage to beneficiaries who had  fallen behind in premium payments due to the difficulties that often  precede a death in the family. As a result, the article stated, it  would be impossible to fully describe ``the hardships it has alleviated  in thousands of families throughout the land.''   With around 11,000 employees across the U.S. and in Europe, Unum  provides a dynamic and welcoming workplace where people can experience  rewarding careers and are encouraged to bring their best ideas to work.  I am proud to note the company's recognition by many third parties as a  best employer for excellence in health and wellbeing, disability  employment, diversity, opportunity for women and new graduates, and  technology. For the last 3 years, the company has received the  prestigious designation as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by  the Ethisphere.   Unum has a tradition of giving back to the community. The company has  been recognized for 5 consecutive years on the Civic 50 list of  America's most community-minded companies by the Points of Light  Foundation founded by President George H. W. Bush. Unum provided $12  million of charitable giving last year, while its employees donated  more than 45,000 hours of volunteer work, for causes as diverse as  developing education leaders in Maine, helping enable rehabilitative  services for patients in Tennessee, and supporting humanitarian efforts  in Poland.   Throughout its 175-year history, Unum has had a tremendous impact in  the State of Maine and beyond. I congratulate the company and its  employees on reaching this impressive milestone and wish them a long  and successful future.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Clean  Cooking Support Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my  friend and colleague Senator Durbin. Our bill aims to address a serious  global public health and environmental issue where leadership by the  United States can make a real difference.   Today, more than 2 billion people, or 30 percent of the global  population, rely on ``dirty cooking,'' such as open fires or  inefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves that use agricultural  waste, coal, dung, or other solid fuels, to cook their meals. The  majority of people using these types of cookstoves and fuels are in  developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.   Exposure to smoke from these traditional cooking methods and open  fires, referred to as household air pollution, can cause chronic and  acute diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.  Alarmingly, the household air pollution caused by traditional  cookstoves and open fires leads to 3.2 million premature deaths  annually, including 450,000 children younger than 5  [[Page S2233]]  years of age, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Women  and girls are disproportionately affected, as they spend hours cooking,  inhaling toxic smoke, and collecting fuels.   These cookstoves also create serious environmental problems.  Household air pollution does not remain in the home; it contributes to  global ambient air pollution. Specifically, more than half of manmade  black carbon emissions come from household fuel combustion. Black  carbon is a powerful short-lived climate pollutant with warming impact  on the climate that is 460 to 1,500 times stronger than carbon dioxide.   These cookstoves should be replaced with modern alternatives to  reverse these alarming health and environmental trends. Since 2010, the  Clean Cooking Alliance, an innovative public-private partnership hosted  by the United Nations Foundation, has supported the adoption of clean  cooking worldwide. Recognizing the serious health and environmental  issues posed by traditional cookstoves, the alliance aims to save  lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and combat pollution by  creating a thriving global market for clean and efficient household  cooking solutions.   Our legislation reinforces our country's policy on promoting clean  cookstoves and seeks to take a whole-of-government approach to address  household air pollution. Specifically, the Clean Cooking Support Act  would create an interagency working group, with representatives from at  least six different Federal Agencies, committed to increasing access to  clean cooking fuels and technologies worldwide. Our legislation  explicitly spells out the role of each Federal Agency in the  advancement of clean cooking as well. The Department of Energy, for  instance, is tasked with research and development to spur the  production of low-cost, low-emission, and high-efficiency cookstoves,  while the Department of State is directed to engage in diplomatic  activities across the globe to support the clean cooking and fuels  sector. Finally, our would authorize funding for the U.S. Government to  continue such activities through 2028 to ensure that these important  efforts to prevent unnecessary illness and reduce pollution around the  globe continue.   Our legislation would directly benefit some of the world's poorest  people, including the women and girls who are disproportionately  affected, and reduce harmful pollution that affects us all. I urge my  colleagues to join me and Senator Durbin in supporting the Clean  Cooking Support Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Budd,          Mr. Markey, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Merkley, Mrs.          Murray, and Mr. Brown):   S. 2196.
