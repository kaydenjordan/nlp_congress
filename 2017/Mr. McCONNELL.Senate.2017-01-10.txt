 Mr. President, Senate committees have been working for  many weeks to process President-Elect Trump's Cabinet nominations. I  commend the committees and their staffs for their very hard work. Now  we begin the next phase of this process with committee hearings. In  fact, it just began this morning in the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I would like to say a word about our colleague from Alabama. Each of  us knows Senator Sessions. We have worked with him. We know he cares  about his country and the Department he will be tasked to lead. We know  he is a forthright colleague, an experienced lawyer, and someone who  believes strongly in the rule of law. We know that he will reach across  the aisle as well.   He supported President Obama's first Attorney General nominee, Eric  Holder. He worked with our late colleague Ted Kennedy on prison reform.  He worked with our current colleague Senator Durbin on sentencing  reform.   Senator Durbin, in fact, noted that Senator Sessions is ``a man of  his word.'' Senator Leahy called him ``wonderful to work with.''  Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, said he is ``straightforward  and fair.''   Let me quote from a former Democratic Senate colleague who knows  Senator Sessions after having served with him for 16 years:         I always found Jeff to be an honorable and trustworthy       person, a smart and good lawyer, and a thoughtful and open-      minded listener.    He then continued with this:         I believe that he will be a principled, fair, and capable       Attorney General. If I was in the Senate today, I would vote       ``aye'' on his nomination.    That is the former Democratic candidate for Vice President of the  United States, Senator Joe Lieberman.   But it is not just our Democratic colleagues who have praise for  Senator Sessions. Let me read another letter from one of Senator  Sessions' constituents in Alabama, Albert F. Turner, Jr. Here is what  he had to say:         My family and I have literally been on the front line of       the fight for civil rights my whole life. I believe that       [Senator Sessions] is someone with whom I, and others in the       civil rights community, can work with if given the       opportunity. I believe that he will listen, as he has in the       past, to the concerns of my community. More than most I am       very familiar with him. I believe he will be fair in his       application of the law and the Constitution; as such I       support his nomination to be the next Attorney General of the       United States.    Now, a lot of unfair things have been said about our colleague from  Alabama in recent weeks. I am glad he is finally getting the chance to  show Americans and the committee the Senator Sessions we all know and  serve with. I look forward to the Senate's fair treatment of our  colleague's forthcoming nomination, just as it fairly processed an  incoming President Obama's pick for Attorney General--a nominee, whom,  as I noted, Senator Sessions supported.   So let me turn to a larger point. The nominations process for an  incoming President is important. As President Obama recently said when  he met with President-Elect Trump, the Presidency ``is bigger than any  one person, and that's why ensuring a smooth transition is so  important.''  [[Page S182]]    I certainly agree. When President Obama was elected, Republicans  worked across the aisle to confirm seven--seven--of his nominees on  inauguration day and five more by the end of his first week. These  nominees were hardly centrists. We had reservations about many of them.  But Democrats had won the Presidency and the Senate, and we hadn't. I  ask our friends across the aisle to now demonstrate the same courtesy  and seriousness for President-Elect Trump's nominees, especially his  national security team.   The Senate has a longstanding tradition of confirming the Cabinet  nominees of a newly elected administration in a timely fashion, and the  Senate and its committees are now following the same standard for  President-Elect Trump and his nominees as we have for past Presidents.   I know some are urging Democrats to play partisan games and needless  delay. I hope they will not. The American people will see through it,  anyway.   Here is a perfect example. The Democratic leader has been quoting a  letter I sent to then-Senator Harry Reid in 2009. He apparently missed  the fact that the letter he has been quoting was not only sent after  every one of President Obama's eligible nominees had hearings but after  all but one had been confirmed. So it is actually an important reminder  of how Republicans fairly treated incoming President Obama's Cabinet  nominees and how Democrats should now do the same.   This is time for serious consideration and cooperation. Americans  aren't looking for partisan games. We are a nation at war. We are a  nation grappling with a slow economy. Americans want the incoming  President to have his national and economic security teams in place to  get to work. They want us to work together across the aisle to get this  done.   That is what Republicans did in 2009, it is what we are doing now,  and it is what we invite our Democratic friends to join us in getting  accomplished.                            ____________________     Mr. President, families across the country have been  hurt by ObamaCare's rising costs and limited choices, and we continue  to hear the stories from constituents back home.   My own home State of Kentucky was once championed as a success story  by ObamaCare supporters. That is hardly the case today. Too many  Kentuckians are watching their insurance premiums grow higher and  higher. They are struggling to meet deductibles so high that their  insurance is almost useless. They are watching their friends and  neighbors lose their plans or access to family doctors. They sit around  the kitchen table and try to budget for their family's future. They  know one thing for sure: The promises of ObamaCare have failed them.   ObamaCare promised lower costs, but premiums have skyrocketed. It  promised families could keep their plans or doctors, but many have seen  their options, in fact, limited. Kentuckians want to see lower costs,  more choices, and better care. But after 7 long years of rising costs  and diminishing options, ObamaCare has not delivered, and the people of  Kentucky are demanding change. They have been loud and clear in their  distaste for ObamaCare.   Like other Members here, I have received letters, emails, and phone  calls. I have met with constituents directly who are feeling the pain  of higher costs and fewer choices.   Consider this mom in Kentucky. She is facing a higher cost of health  insurance, and she literally doesn't know what to do. Here is what she  said:         My family is being pushed out of the middle class by the       ObamaCare law. How can we pay almost $1,200 a month on health       insurance?    Listen to this veteran and father from Louisville. After his plan was  discontinued, he tried to buy insurance through ObamaCare, only to find  that his children's pediatrician wouldn't accept it. This dad worries  that unless something is done, he will be ``one of thousands of  Kentuckians that will find that they do not have insurance options.''   I have heard from many constituents expressing similar frustration,  disappointment, and anger about the outcomes of ObamaCare. They  expected the law to deliver on its promises, but, instead, they paid  more and received less.   This year the cost of insurance premiums in Kentucky spiked up to 47  percent. These price increases are a direct result of instability  injected into the market by ObamaCare. Families across Kentucky are  scrambling to find ways to fit the extra expenses into their budgets.   To make matters worse, the choices that families once had for health  insurance continue to disappear. Nearly half of the counties in  Kentucky only have one option for a health insurance provider on the  exchange, and, when there is only one choice, there is really no choice  at all.   For the people of Kentucky and for people across the country, repeal  means relief. The time to act is now.   However, our friends on the other side of the aisle are doing  everything they can to stop us from fulfilling our promise to help the  American people. Instead of continuing to push their political agenda,  I urge them to help us. I ask them to listen to the American people,  who are demanding change. A recent Gallup poll showed that 8 out of 10  Americans wanted to see ObamaCare significantly changed--significantly  changed--or completely replaced.   It is time to admit it. ObamaCare has failed. This partisan  experiment is hurting more than it is helping. It is time to finally  move past it and replace it with something that works. The repeal  resolution is the first step to bring relief to hardworking Americans  and to prevent health insurance markets from imploding. Next, we need  to work together to replace ObamaCare with health care policies that  actually work for families. Once we repeal ObamaCare, we can use the  stable transition period to deliver on another promise.   I would encourage colleagues on both sides to offer their input as we  work to lower costs, increase choices, and promote better care. But one  thing is certain. Republicans will continue to follow through on our  promises and act on behalf of our constituents to bring relief from  ObamaCare.                            ____________________
