 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 918, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3249) to authorize the Project Safe Neighborhoods  Grant Program, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment  thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3249.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, gangs are a poison in America. They bring violence,  drugs, and death. They paralyze our communities with flagrant acts of  violence and flood our neighborhoods with drugs. Gangs tear apart  families by prematurely taking the lives of sons, daughters, and  parents.   Unfortunately, today, some areas of our country have been overrun by  gang violence. Homicide rates skyrocketed in St. Louis, Baltimore, and  Chicago in 2016. Compared to the previous 5 years, 2016 represented a  15.8 percent increase in homicides in St. Louis, a 12.7 percent  increase in Baltimore, and an 11.4 percent increase in Chicago.   We must stand up to violent gangs and provide an antidote to their  poison.   H.R. 3249 is a vital part of the antidote. This legislation reforms  and reauthorizes the Project Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant Program.  This program operates under four key principles: partnerships,  strategic planning, training, and outreach.   First and foremost, the program brings all the important actors  together. This legislation will foster and improve existing  partnerships between Federal, State, and local agencies, community  groups, and researchers.   Strategic planning is the foundation of the Project Safe  Neighborhoods program.   Moreover, H.R. 3249 promotes the robust enforcement of existing  criminal laws and the development of intervention and prevention  programs, such as juvenile justice projects and activities, including  street-level outreach, conflict mediation, and social services.  Intervention and prevention programs provide extensive training and  community outreach.   Furthermore, in relying on localized and contemporaneous data, this  bill strategically prioritizes a focus on individuals or organizations  that are responsible for increasing violence in a particular geographic  area.   This legislation will ensure that 30 percent of Project Safe  Neighborhoods funding is allocated to gang task forces in regions  experiencing a significant or increased presence of violent crime,  firearm offenses, human trafficking, and drug trafficking.   As a result, critical resources, such as the deployment of law  enforcement and funding, are put to their best use.   Altogether, this legislation takes a balanced approach by combining  enforcement with prevention to combat gang violence in our communities  across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, the comprehensive, coordinated, and community-focused  nature of the Project Safe Neighborhoods program will serve as a key  part of the antidote to the poisonous effects gangs have on our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia, Congresswoman  Barbara Comstock, for taking the lead on this important bill, and I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), the chief sponsor of  this legislation.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.   This legislation is intended to help our communities fight criminal  gangs and the violence and mayhem they wreak, and the bill is not  intended to target anyone because of their race or national origin.                                time  1430     If the gentlewoman will continue to yield, yes, I do.  And I certainly support, at every level of government, making sure that  we are doing what we can to intervene and get people headed in the  right direction and avoiding some of those problems in the first place.  And, certainly, some of that is contained within the programs that are  funded by this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that I appreciate the bipartisan  effort that has gone into passing this very important legislation which  will now go to the President's desk for his signature, and will do a  lot of good in fighting gang violence and helping young people steer  toward a better future and a better life.   Both of those things are the purpose of this legislation. I want to  especially thank, again, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock)  for her long-dedicated work to fighting gang violence and helping our  young people have better opportunities for the future, not only in  Virginia, but all across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4798]]     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
