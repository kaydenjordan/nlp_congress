 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to celebrate  the 70th anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 728.   This troop's longstanding commitment to instilling positive social  values and building self-esteem and self-reliance in young men has  provided a great benefit to our community.   Opened in 1947, Troop 728 has produced a tradition of excellence. It  has been led by many dedicated Scoutmasters over its 70-year history,  each of whom has contributed to the legacy of the troop. These  passionate, active leaders allow the memories of past leaders to  continue to flourish in the troop's culture today.   Traditions of Troop 728 include Scout breakfasts, hiking, camping  trips, and summer camp. Additionally, Scoutmasters focus instilling  leadership skills in troop members and developing leaders for the 21st  century.   Troop 728 has produced over 30 Eagle Scouts, the most prestigious  award that any young man can earn in Scouting. This demonstrates their  continued commitment to their long legacy of service throughout the  community.   On this special anniversary, I would like to congratulate the leaders  and members of Troop 728 for all of their successes.                            ____________________
