 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women  who deliver the mail in rural America. The work is not easy. As the  National Rural Letter Carriers' Association notes, these carriers are  essentially post offices on wheels, providing many of the same services  to rural residents that urban dwellers take for granted.   One such rural carrier was Larry Earl Robertson from Jessieville,  Arkansas. Larry was my mailman for more than 25 years and, as many  rural letter carriers throughout our country can attest, he was a part  of our family. He knew my wife and children, just as we knew his  family. He was an integral part of our community and played an  important role in the lives of rural Garland County residents. Simply  put, Larry was a friend to everyone. Just as Larry was a friend to all,  he was also a faithful Christian and family man.   Through his service--at just 54--he had made an important and lasting  impact on his community, as many rural letter carriers do. That is why  it was especially sad when we received word of his untimely passing  last week. In the pain and grief of death, we take comfort in the words  of Christ who said: ``I am the resurrection and the life. He who  believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.''   May we all strive to do our jobs with diligence and a smile and  positively impact our communities as Larry Robertson impacted his.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney) for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule for H.R. 3905 as  well as the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year I had the opportunity to travel to  Minnesota with Minnesota Congressmen Emmer and Nolan and others to  visit the Superior National Forest in northeast Minnesota.   While northeast Minnesota is a long way from the Fourth District of  Arkansas, the people, areas, and the economics are somewhat similar.  This is a rural area where local economies and constituencies depend on  the ability to sustainably and responsibly harvest and mine the natural  resources found there.   Unfortunately, the previous administration placed the wants of  special interest environmental groups before the needs of Minnesotans  and others who depend on natural resources management. In my opinion,  they trampled our Article I constitutional authority of the legislative  branch when doing so.   On January 19, 2017, one day before President Trump was sworn in, the  Obama administration published a 235,000-acre Federal mineral  withdrawal application in the Federal Register to impose a 20-year  moratorium on lands within the Superior National Forest in northeast  Minnesota.   Mr. Speaker, this was in direct conflict with the will of Congress  and the law going back to when the Boundary Waters Canoe Area  Wilderness was established.   At the same time, the Obama administration wrongly rejected Twin  Metals Minnesota's application to renew two hard rock mineral leases  that were renewed in 1989 and 2004. The land in question is not in the  Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and it doesn't even border  Boundary Waters. In fact, the land in question is outside a buffer area  around Boundary Waters created by Congress to protect the Boundary  Waters.   This politically motivated decision has the ability to destroy the  local economy, kill job creation, significantly harm education in  Minnesota, and sets a bad precedent.   I want to talk just a moment about the impact this decision will have  on Minnesota education. If this withdrawal is allowed to take place,  Minnesota is projected to lose up to $3 billion in royalty revenues for  the State's permanent school trust fund, supporting nearly 900,000  students.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who represents schools, communities, and  counties that depend on programs like Secure Rural Schools and PILTs, I  know the harm that will be brought on school districts, specifically  rural school districts, should the withdrawal and application rejection  go forward.   How much longer will we allow rural communities and education to  suffer because a special interest group doesn't agree with forest  management or mining, even though any projects will be carried out in  compliance with all environmental regulations in a responsible manner?   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3905 is a vital piece of legislation to not only  Minnesota, but to other States and communities that depend on natural  resource utilization.   It is also important for the legislative branch to remind the  executive branch it is not their job to make law or to change laws made  by Congress. For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this  rule and the underlying legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar), my friend and colleague, for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3905, the Minnesota's  Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, or the MINER Act.  This act does not remove or reduce the permitting requirements should a  future project ultimately be developed in the Superior National Forest.   But nearly a year after President Obama's departure from the White  House, I stand before this body to speak in favor of a bill that would  rectify an injustice placed upon Minnesotans by the previous  administration.   As we have heard throughout this debate, on President Obama's last  day in office, the previous administration pulled such a politically  motivated stunt that appears more as a thumb-in-the-eye of hardworking  Minnesotans than sound policy.   Without a second thought, and one stroke of his pen, President Obama  proposed withdrawing over 200,000 acres from future mineral exploration  while, simultaneously, rejecting a renewal application for a hard rock  mining operation that had been renewed in 1989 and 2004, without  controversy.   This decision endangered thousands of jobs. These are good-paying  jobs that are significantly higher than the median average wage in  Minnesota and the United States. Additionally, that decision could  devastate the State's permanent school trust fund that will support  nearly 900,000 K-12 students statewide if the withdrawal application  and canceled leases are not rejected. At a time when it is vital that  our teachers and students are given the resources they require, it  would be foolish to allow this to take place.   Some may ask why a Member from Arkansas would care about this  decision. It is close to 1,000 miles away from my district to the  Superior National Forest. The answer though is twofold, and it is  simple.   The first, it restores Federal land management oversight back to  where it belongs, the United States Congress. H.R. 3905 will prevent  executive order overreach by requiring congressional approval of all  mineral or monument withdrawals within National Forest System lands in  Minnesota and reverses the unwarranted action taken under the Obama  administration to unilaterally block responsible mineral development in  the Superior National Forest.   Secondly, as someone who represents communities, counties, and  schools that depend on the safe, responsible harvest and mining of our  natural resources, I understand the real devastation that will take  place, not only in Minnesota, but possibly in my district and other  areas across the country if H.R. 3905 is not passed.   Mr. Speaker, for the protection of our constitutional system of  checks and balances, and preservation of rural economies, I believe  that it is vital that we pass this piece of legislation. I encourage my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3905.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 53 bipartisan  Minnesota State legislators, a letter from Jobs for Minnesotans, and a  letter from the Minnesota Pipe Trades Association.                                                 November 27, 2017.      Congressman Tom Emmer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Emmer: As elected leaders of the Minnesota       Legislature, we are writing in strong support of H.R. 3905.       This legislation supports jobs, economic development and       industry in Northeast Minnesota, and will reverse an onerous,       overreaching and politically-motivated decision by the Obama       Administration that withdrew nearly 240,000 acres of federal       lands and minerals from potential development. H.R. 3905 will       halt these last-minute land withdrawals, reinstate leases       affected by that decision including the Twin Metals' lease,       and require congressional approval for any future withdrawal       actions.        The decision by the Obama Administration last January put       jobs and nearly $2.5 billion of our state's economy at risk.       Furthermore, it risked the depression of the precious metals,       technology, infrastructure and manufacturing industries in       our state, and the economic well-being of Northeast       Minnesota--a region where mining has been an economic anchor       since the late nineteenth century. And that's not to mention       the estimated four billion ton deposit of copper, nickel, and       other strategic minerals located within the Duluth Complex       which could generate as much as $3 billion in royalty       revenues for the state's Permanent School Trust Fund--      resources that would support education for nearly 900,000 K-      12 students across the state.        H.R. 3905 also reaffirms our shared commitment to the       protection of our environment and support of a thorough and       proper environmental review process for the mineral leases,       as well as upholds our state's commitment to restricting       mineral development in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness and Mine Protection Area.        The expansion of the precious metals mining industry offers       generations of Minnesotans thousands of good-paying jobs,       billions of dollars in investment in industry, and billions       of dollars in revenue for Minnesota schools. Moreover, it       provides an incredible opportunity to further establish our       nation's economic and energy independence from foreign       nations. The decision to remove vast amounts of federal land       from potential development and blocking the Twin Metals'       federal mineral lease renewal was short-sighted and damaging.       H.R. 3905 has our bipartisan support, and it is our sincere       hope that it will become law for the well-being of our state       and its citizens.            Sincerely,        Rep.

Re In Support of MINER Act.       Hon. Erik Paulsen,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Paulsen: I'm writing on behalf of       legislation described below but wanted to let you know I had       submitted a request to meet in person, as I plan to be in       Washington the week after Thanksgiving. I hope you have time       to meet with me. Thank you for considering.        On behalf of the coalition Jobs for Minnesotans, which       represents business, labor and communities across the state,       I am writing in strong support of H.R. 3905, the Minnesota's       Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, known as       the MINER Act. This bipartisan legislation sponsored by       Congressman Tom Emmer (MN-6th) and co-sponsored by       Congressmen Collin Peterson (MN-7th), Jason Lewis (MN-2nd)       and Paul Gosar (AZ-4th) seeks to ensure the proper       consideration of future job growth and economic opportunity       in northeastern Minnesota by requiring congressional approval  [[Page H9507]]       of any mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving       the National Forest System lands in the state. It also       provides for the renewal of certain mineral leases and       ensuring that future leases in northeastern Minnesota remain       valid and renewed as outlined by current law. H.R. 3905 is       currently before the House Rules Committee and is expected to       reach the House floor in coming weeks.        H.R. 3905 leaves intact existing environmental review       processes and standards and restates Congress' prohibition of       any mining activity in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness (BWCAW) and surrounding protective buffer. As       such, it reaffirms long-standing Congressional intent in       management and development of critical minerals in Minnesota       and cuts bureaucratic delays in assessing responsible mine       project proposals.        Unfortunately, federal agency actions in December 2016       jeopardized the economic future of the region by canceling       valid, long-standing federal mineral leases and withdrawing       235,000 acres of federal land in the region from future       mining development. This was contrary to the previous       directives by Congress in 1950 and again in 1978. In 1950       Congress made land available for mineral exploration and       development within the Superior National Forest (SNF) within       the Iron Range region. In 1978, while Congress prohibited       mining within the BWCAW and an adjacent protective buffer       zone, it also reaffirmed that mining should be allowed and       promoted in the remaining area of the SNF.        The agency actions in 2016 would block the potential       creation of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in       economic growth, and billions more in revenues for       Minnesota's public schools through mineral development on       state school trust lands.        H.R. 3905 aims to correct these injustices, which is why we       strongly urge you to cast your vote in support of it. Thank       you very much.            Sincerely,                                                     Nancy Norr,                                                        Board Chair,      Jobs for Minnesotans.                                   ____                                                      Minnesota Pipe                                              Trades Association,                                                  November 28, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 9500 men and       women working in various piping related industries throughout       the state of Minnesota, I am writing to express our support       of H.R. 3905, Minnesota's Economic Rights (MINER) in the       Superior National Forest Act.        On January 5, 2017, the previous administration proposed a       234, 328-acre federal mineral withdrawal of National Forest       System lands, for a 20-year term, within the Rainy River       Watershed in the Superior National Forest. The action       immediately placed this area off limits to development for up       to two years while the withdrawal is considered. The total       withdrawal application boundary spans 425,000 acres,       including 95,000 acres of state school trust fund lands.        With this policy in place, Minnesotans lost their mineral       rights. Unable to utilize these natural resources, 17,000       jobs are at risk and roughly $2.5 billion of economic       activity is jeopardized. Many members of the Minnesota Pipe       Trades Association are depending on these jobs.        The Minnesota Pipe Trades Association (MPTA) fully supports       the thorough regulatory process in place in the State of       Minnesota. It is our belief this process is adequate in       determining whether a project should move forward. or not.        As a result, MPTA is in support of H.R. 3905, Minnesota's       Economic Rights (MINER) in the Superior National Forest Act,       and urge the immediate passage of this bi-partisan       legislation.            Sincerely,                                             David M. Ybarra II,                                                          President,                                 Minnesota Pipe Trades Association.
