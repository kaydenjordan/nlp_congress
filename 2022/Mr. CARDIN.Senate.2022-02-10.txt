 Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Black  History Month.   Black History Month provides an opportunity for our Nation  collectively to reflect on and celebrate the contributions and legacies  of Black Americans. And while we have chosen this month, February, to  engage in collective celebration, we must also remember that we benefit  from the contributions and legacies of these great Americans every  single day.   Today, I would like to focus my remarks on our Nation's black  entrepreneurs. From Madame C.J. Walker to Baltimore's own Reginald F.  Lewis and beyond, Black entrepreneurs have long been vital to the  success of the American economy.   Unfortunately, throughout history, those who seek to hold back the  progress of the Black community view the successes of Black  entrepreneurs as a threat.   One need only look to the 1921 Tulsa Massacre--a dark incident in our  Nation's history that has belatedly entered our collective  consciousness.   White residents of Tulsa, OK, bombed, burned, and destroyed the  Greenwood District. In addition to an untold number of lives lost-- estimates range from dozens to hundreds--the riot destroyed homes,  churches, schools, and businesses in the district. At the time,  Greenwood was known as ``Black Wall Street'' due to its thriving Black  middle class and successful businesses, and its destruction was one of  the worst instances of racial violence in our Nation's history.   It is with instances like Greenwood and the dozens like it in mind  that I stand here today because while Black entrepreneurs no longer  work under the threat of such violence, they still face many  longstanding systemic barriers.   My late friend and mentor, former Congressman Parren J. Mitchell,  believed very strongly that the Federal Government had an important  role to play in our efforts to right these historical injustices and  support Black entrepreneurs.   In 1977, Congressman Mitchell fought to pass an amendment to a $4  billion Federal public works program requiring city and State  recipients to set aside 10 percent of the funds for minority-owned  businesses. He would go on to call the amendment his proudest  congressional accomplishment.   I was incredibly proud last year to build on his legacy by working  across the aisle and finally codifying the Minority Business  Development Agency, MBDA, and giving the agency the resources and  leadership necessary to help support entrepreneurs in the Black and  other minority communities.   This accomplishment is particularly important in Maryland, as the  Presiding Officer knows, since we are the home to the highest  concentration of minority-owned businesses in the country.   While we have made progress, we must also continue working together  to address these systemic inequities.   At the height of the pandemic, we came together to create the  Paycheck Protection Program, the PPP program, and we worked in a  bipartisan manner to improve the program once it became clear that it  was leaving far too many of our most vulnerable small businesses  behind.   We invested in non-bank financial institutions like the community  depository financial institutions and microlenders. We strengthened  relationships between the Small Business Administration and our  Nation's historically Black colleges and universities and minority- serving institutions. We created grant programs that reduced structural  barriers instead of reinforcing them.   Recent studies have shown that these policies directly address the  inequities present during the phase 1 PPP, which favored larger  businesses. Through thoughtful policy, we made the program more  equitable with the share of loans made to minority-owned businesses  during phases 2 and 3 of the program in proportion with their overall  share of small businesses.   As I speak here today, the Senate is still trying to find a path  forward on President Biden's Build Back Better budget, which implements  many of the lessons we have learned over the past 2 years. The bill  contains many key provisions that will provide the SBA and the MBDA  with resources to empower Black entrepreneurs even more.   For instance, the Build Back Better Act would create a direct loan  program at the SBA. It would create a new Uplift Accelerator program to  deepen the relationships between SBA and HBCUs, and it would make the  SBA existing loan products more accessible and affordable.   The pandemic has demonstrated that when we come together to address  the problems in our society free from partisanship and in good faith,  we are able to make great strides. It also confirms that the Federal  Government has a key role to play in addressing the historic injustices  that have harmed--and continue to harm--Black entrepreneurs and the  Black community at large.   This Black History Month, let us commit to pairing our words with  actions, just as we did during the pandemic. We need to enact these  proven policies as quickly as possible. We cannot let this opportunity  pass us by.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, as we celebrate Black History Month, I  rise today to honor two American heroes from our Greatest Generation:  Brigadier General Charles E. McGee and Staff Sergeant Waverly B.  Woodson, Jr.   McGee was a Tuskegee Airman who passed away peacefully in his home in  Bethesda, MD, on January 16, 2021. He was 102. Woodson, an Army medic  assigned to the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, landed on Omaha Beach  on D-day and saved the lives of as many as 200 soldiers over the next  30 hours of continuous duty.   Both of these Marylanders fought with valor and distinction on behalf  of a Nation that discriminated against them.   Brigadier General McGee's incandescent spirit, courage, and resolve  led us to victory through some of our darkest times. He has left  lasting impact on our country as a pilot, patriot, and civil rights  advocate. He was born on December 7, 1919, in Cleveland, OH. His mother  died soon after. His father, who was a minister, teacher, and social  worker, moved the family frequently during McGee's childhood in search  of work opportunities that were not easy to come by. Despite this  adversity, McGee graduated from high school in Chicago in 1938 and  joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC.   McGee used the money he made in the CCC to help pay for college,  attending the University of Illinois as an ROTC student.   When we look at the extraordinary life of Charles McGee, one thing is  explicitly clear: No matter how dangerous or difficult the call, if his  country needed him, he always answered. This inspiring pattern of  behavior started during his sophomore year in college when, on McGee's  22nd birthday, Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor. McGee began  searching for a way to serve in the war. After he heard that President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt had authorized a unit of Black soldiers to  train as pilots in the Army Air Corps, he applied and to start flight  training at the Tuskegee Army Field in Alabama and was accepted.   Charles McGee battled racial discrimination but completed flight  school as 1 of only 1,000 pilots, earning his spot as a Tuskegee Airman  in the first-of-its-kind, all-Black 332nd Fighter group. In 1944, just  a year after graduating, he deployed to Italy as a fighter pilot in  World War II. He moved up the ranks quickly, from lieutenant to  captain. McGee's squadron was responsible for escorting heavy bombers  of the 15th Air Force across Europe and for target-of-opportunity  missions. McGee flew 136 missions across Europe. Our victory in World  War II, however, was not the end of McGee's service. He remained in the  Army Corps and the Air Force for another 30 years, flying in both the  Korean and the Vietnam wars. He tallied a record of 409 aerial fighter  combat missions over the course of three wars. In 2020, McGee received  an honorary promotion to brigadier general.   While there are few individuals living or dead who have had careers  as successful or significant as Charles McGee's, what made him so  remarkable was his undying positive attitude and kind nature, even in  the most trying situations. As a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, he was  constantly subject to racial discrimination, both in the military and  back home where Jim Crow Laws prevailed. In an essay McGee penned for  the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, he wrote, ``The  prevailing opinion was that blacks did not possess the intelligence or  courage to be military pilots. One general even said, `The Negro type  has not the proper reflexes to make a first-rate fighter pilot.' The  Tuskegee Airmen certainly proved men like him wrong.''   Until the day he passed away, Charles McGee educated others about the  Black experience during this time and spoke of the ``equality of  opportunity'' that he and the Tuskegee Airmen valiantly fought to  achieve.   I am humbled and proud to call Charles McGee a fellow Marylander. His  daughters Charlene McGee Smith and Yvonne McGee, 10 grandchildren, 14  great-grandchildren, and a great-great-grandchild survive him. His  legacy is intertwined with our Nation's legacy. He is a true American  hero.   Waverly Bernard Woodson, Jr., is another true American hero. He was  born on August 3, 1922, in Philadelphia and attended Lincoln University  in Oxford, Pa, where he was a pre-med student.   McGee enlisted in the Army 8 days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  He joined the anti-aircraft artillery Officer Candidate School after  scoring highly on a test, where he was one of only two Black Americans.  He learned, however, that he could not become an officer because of his  race. He trained as a combat medic at Camp Tyson in Paris, TN, where he  experienced segregation and discrimination. He was assigned to the  320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, reaching the rank of corporal by the  time Operation Overlord commenced.   On D-day, the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion was the only African- American battalion to participate. While Corporal Woodson was coming  ashore at Omaha Beach, his landing craft tank--LCT--hit a naval mine  and then was hit by an ``eighty-eight'' shell. Woodson suffered  shrapnel injuries to his groin, inner thigh, and back. Once he reached  shore and received treatment for his wounds, he set up a first-aid  station and began treating other wounded soldiers. He worked  continuously from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. on the following day, setting  fractured limbs, removing bullets, amputating a foot, dispensing  plasma, and reviving three men who nearly drowned while exiting their  LCT; Woodson provided artificial respiration to the three men, reviving  them.   Woodson's commanding officer recommended him for a Distinguished  Service Cross for his actions, but the office of General John C. H. Lee  determined that Woodson's actions warranted the greater honor of a  Medal of Honor. U.S. Department of War special assistant to the  director Philleo Nash proposed that President Franklin D. Roosevelt  should give Woodson the award personally. Woodson ultimately received a  Bronze Star Medal and a Purple Heart. The Philadelphia Tribune wrote,  ``The feeling is prevalent among Negroes that had Woodson been of  another race the highest honor would have been granted him.''   After World War II ended, Woodson hoped to study medicine, but was  unable to find a medical school that would admit him as a Black  American.   He returned to Lincoln University and graduated with a degree in  biology in 1950. Woodson served in the Korean war, initially training  combat medics before running an Army morgue. He served in the United  Kingdom, France, and the Asia-Pacific. Within the United States, he  also served at Fort George G. Meade, Valley Forge General Hospital, the  Communicable Disease Center, and Walter Reed Army Medical Center.   Woodson left the Army in 1952 with a final rank of staff sergeant.  After leaving the Army, Woodson went on to work in the bacteriology  department of the National Naval Medical Center. In 1959, he began  working in the clinical pathology department of the National Institutes  of Health until he retired in 1980.  [[Page S644]]    Staff Sergeant Woodson married Joann Katharyne Snowden in 1952; the  couple had two daughters and a son. He died in 2005 and was buried with  military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.   Last month, I joined Senator Van Hollen and Representative Trone in  writing to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth to request that an award  decision authority formally review and consider awarding the Medal of  Honor to Waverly B. Woodson, Jr., posthumously. In June 2021,  Commanding General of the First United States Army Thomas S. James,  Jr., wrote in favor of Woodson receiving the Medal of Honor.   Woodson's widow Joann announced that if he were to receive the Medal  of Honor posthumously, she would donate it to the Smithsonian's  National Museum of African American History and Culture.   These stories are just two examples of Black-American soldiers who  fought to defeat fascism during World War II while simultaneously  enduring virulent racial discrimination as servicemen and back home in  America as civilians.   After the Civil War and Reconstruction, powerful White officials in  southern States sought to nullify the political outcome of the Civil  War. They passed laws and instituted policies that enforced  segregation.   We all know those laws: the Jim Crow laws, the Black Codes, the  institutionalized segregation. The intent was to disenfranchise  minority voters with poll taxes and literacy tests and voter  intimidation.   Thanks to courageous leaders, we were able to reverse those laws.  President Harry Truman integrated our military in 1948. Then, there was  the landmark decision in 1954 of Brown v. Board of Education. We  Marylanders are proud of Thurgood Marshall, a native son, with respect  to the role that he played in arguing that case before the Supreme  Court. In 1964, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act and followed that  historic legislation with the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and the Fair  Housing Act in 1968.   Black Americans and other people of color have fought and died to  preserve our freedom. As we celebrate Black History Month, if we want  to honor Brigadier General Charles E. McGee and Staff Sergeant Waverly  B. Woodson, Jr., and countless others like them, we need to continue to  expand equal opportunity in America, and we can start by passing voting  rights legislation, the need for which I have frequently spoken about  on the Senate floor.                            ____________________
