 Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Biden's Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act that I and many of us voted for, we are now  putting those resources on the ground across America.   The first billions of dollars to go to California and every State in  the Union are now being put in place to fix bridges. Next, we are going  to fix our roads and build our infrastructure to electrify our system  throughout the country.   These are the kinds of things that our voters sent us to Washington  to do, to bring those resources back to every single community, every  single one of our communities, and that is what we are doing here in  Congress with a President who actually believes in the fundamentals of  infrastructure and making sure that we put our American workers back to  work to build our Nation as it should be and what we are so proud of.   We are the number one infrastructure place in the world, and we will  continue to be so with these investments.                            ____________________
