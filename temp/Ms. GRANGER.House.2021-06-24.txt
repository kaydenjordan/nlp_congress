 Mr. Speaker, the Hyde amendment is an essential  protection for the conscience rights of Americans and has saved over 2  million innocent lives.   The prohibition on the use of taxpayer funds for abortion has been  enacted annually on a bipartisan basis despite our country's divisions  on the question of abortion itself. Yet, despite President Biden's  decades of support for the Hyde amendment, his budget request bows to  the radical left and fails to include these longstanding protections.   As ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, I am committed to  protecting all existing pro-life protections and advancing the pro-life  cause whenever possible.   I will strongly oppose the elimination of the Hyde amendment from  annual appropriations bills. But to strengthen the Hyde amendment, we  must make it permanent law. That is why I support H.R. 18, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
