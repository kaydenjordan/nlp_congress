 Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 140, I voted yea.  It was my intention to vote nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent  that I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the  outcome of the vote.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.                            The President's Budget     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act, a common sense  fix to improve affordability of health insurance on the individual  market. I am pleased that Senators Hassan, Warren, Harris, Baldwin, and  Leahy have joined this bill as original cosponsors, and I appreciate  their support.   Since its implementation, the Affordable Care Act has helped to  expand health care and control out-of-pocket costs for millions of  Americans. Over 20 million people who were previously uninsured now  have coverage, there are no yearly or lifetime limits on coverage, and  no one can be denied coverage or charged more based on their gender or  because of a pre-existing health condition. The Affordable Care Act  also expanded the individual marketplace, through which 18 million  people currently get their coverage. Individuals who make between 100  and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, and who do not have  affordable employer coverage available to them, can receive a tax  credit subsidy to help pay for insurance on the individual market. This  credit limits the cost of insurance at 9.69 percent of an individual's  income.   However, someone who makes just one dollar above the income threshold  immediately loses all federal assistance. This `cliff' unfairly impacts  middle-income Americans who are by no means wealthy, but who make just  barely too much to qualify for the tax credit. I am particularly  concerned about my constituents between the ages of 50 to 64, who are  facing higher premiums as they age and who need access to health  services but are not yet eligible for Medicare.   To address this issue, the Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle  Class Act would eliminate the current cliff, and instead gradually  phase out federal assistance based on income. Nobody would pay more  than 9.69 percent of their income for insurance, and once someone's  premium fell below this threshold, they would no longer receive federal  assistance.   For example, in my hometown of San Francisco, a 60-year-old making  $50,000 currently pays $946 per month for the second-lowest cost Silver  plan and does not receive federal assistance. Under this bill, their  premium would be capped at $404, or 9.69 percent of their income, and  the tax credit subsidy would cover the rest. This bill would create a  fairer and more predictable system, ensuring that consumers on the  individual market know just how much their insurance will cost and will  have affordable options available. The Affordable Care Act has reduced  costs and expanded benefits for many Americans, and it is critical that  we build on this progress to further improve the law--not destroy it.   The bill is supported by a number of organizations, including the  American Association of Neurological Surgeons, AANS, Child Welfare  League of America, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, CNS, Families  USA, Lung Cancer Alliance, and National Farmers Union.   This legislation is a simple fix that provides relief for middle- income  [[Page S3331]]  Americans and strengthens affordability protections for coverage  through the individual market. I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor  the Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act. Thank you Mr.  President and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Peters):   S. 1308. A bill to increase authorized funding for the Soo Locks; to  the Committee on Environment and Public Works.    Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley  in introducing the Trafficking Victims' Protection Act of 2017.   Last week, I met with a remarkable group of anti-trafficking  stakeholders in Fresno, California, who reinforced what I have long  held to be true: stamping out the horrific crime of human trafficking  must be among our top priorities as lawmakers. At our meeting, Central  Valley law enforcement, service providers and, most importantly,  survivors of human trafficking educated me about the nature and  prevalence of sex and labor trafficking in the Central Valley. I  learned that counties like Fresno and Tulare serve as key stops along  major California trafficking circuits, with victims as young as 10- years-old being shipped to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and beyond. I also  learned that in 2016 alone, Fresno Police arrested more than 140 sex  buyers and traffickers. This tells me that the demand for trafficking  is far too high. Central Valley law enforcement and service providers  are working together to reduce this demand, crack down on traffickers,  and better serve victims, through a unique, highly-coordinated and  victim-centered approach that I believe ought to be emulated  nationwide.   Over the past seven years they have teamed up to identify and  critically to provide comprehensive services to nearly 500 trafficking  victims. When Central Valley law enforcement took down a trafficking  ring last year, the ring leader and two of his associates were arrested  and prosecuted, and approximately 50 victims were rescued, including 23  children. These victims were all provided with wraparound services, and  the ring leader was sentenced to 40 years in prison. This is the kind  of coordinated, victim centered work we need to support and replicate  nationwide. The Trafficking Victims' Protection Act of 2017 aims to do  that.   I have now met with law enforcement, service providers and survivors  representing Southern, Central and Northern California. All have made  one thing abundantly clear: lawmakers at all levels of government must  commit whatever time and resources are needed to thwart this horrendous  crime.   Over the past two decades, Congress has taken action to combat human  trafficking. We passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000  and, 8 years later, passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act. And two years ago, Congress passed the  Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act--a landmark piece of  legislation. The law focuses on reducing demand, rescuing victims,  educating law enforcement and judges, and making sure that trafficking  enterprises are put out of business. But it is clear that our work is  far from done. The human trafficking industry continues to be one of  the biggest criminal enterprises in the world and it is constantly  evolving. The use of the internet to sell children for sex has  escalated dramatically over the past several years.   In my home State, District Attorney Nancy O'Malley and her pioneering  anti-trafficking team identified 47,719 internet users looking to  purchase sex in Alameda County alone during a single month. Many of the  victims posted on these sites are underage. In one survivor study, a  staggering 75% of minor sex trafficking victims reported being bought  or sold online. And last year, the Washington Post reported devastating  accounts about human trafficking is also committed by Islamic State  fighters, who sell young girls over platforms such as Facebook.   The bill that Senator Grassley and I have introduced includes a  provision that would give to law enforcement an additional tool to  prevent human traffickers from accessing the internet and other tech  platforms to sell minors for commercial sex. Under current current law,  it is a criminal offense to advertise commercial sex acts with a minor.  This legislation would add civil injunction authority to the criminal  provision, providing the Department of Justice with a more readily  accessible tool to deny human traffickers access to tech platforms to  commit trafficking crimes. The bill also supports and strengthens  efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to human trafficking crimes.   It allows school resource officers at schools to train school  personnel to recognize and respond to signs of child sex trafficking.  This is important because kids are often recruited at schools. In one  heartbreaking case in Oakland, California, a 12-year-old student with  top grades suddenly changed her normal behavior. She stopped completing  her assignments, became withdrawn, and began wearing provocative  clothing. Eventually, she stopped going to school altogether. Her  parents contacted the school looking for her, but no one was able to  locate her. She was discovered 24 hours later on an online sex  advertisement based out of Los Angeles. This 12-year-old girl had been  groomed by a trafficker--but no one was able to recognize the signs of  exploitation. Teachers and school personnel interact with these kids  every day. They are critical in recognizing which kids are at risk or  are about to become exploited. We need to be sure that they are  familiar with the patterns and practices of human traffickers, and know  how to identify and respond to suspected victims.   In addition to working with Chairman Grassley on the reauthorization  [[Page S3337]]  bill, I am also pleased to cosponsor Senator Cornyn and Senator  Klobuchar's Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017. One of the most  important provisions of this bill is the mandatory designation of at  least one Human Trafficking Justice Coordinator in each United States  Attorney's Office. This is critical to ensure that our judicial system  treats human trafficking offenses with the seriousness they deserve.  Among other responsibilities, this Coordinator will be responsible for  assisting in the prosecution of human trafficking cases. This includes  the prosecution of those who solicit minors for commercial sex, a  change in the law that was enacted in the Justice for Victims of  Trafficking Act.   In 2015, former United States Attorney Eileen Decker conducted one of  the first federal prosecutions of a buyer under this new statute. The  buyer, a 59-year-old man from Torrance, admitted to lying to federal  prosecutors about his conduct with a 16-year-old girl he met online and  hired for commercial sex acts. He was sentenced to 57 months in prison.  Former United States Attorney Decker remarked that this case should  serve as a warning to adults who engage in this type of criminal  conduct.   It is critical that such prosecutions continue. Stemming the abuse  and exploitation of trafficking requires confronting not only the  predatory suppliers, but also those who solicit young girls for  commercial sex. The designation of a Human Trafficking Justice  Coordinator would ensure that those who violate human trafficking  offenses, both buyers and sellers, are prosecuted to the fullest extent  of the law. The Human Justice Trafficking Coordinator would also be  responsible for ensuring the collection of restitution for victims.   Restitution for trafficking victims is mandatory under federal law.  Moreover, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act requires the  Justice Department to train prosecutors to seek restitution for  trafficking victims, regardless of whether the victim requests  restitution. Yet, we continue to see our judicial system failing to do  right by victims. In a 2015 law review article, the Human Trafficking  Pro Bono Legal Center reported on the appallingly low rates of  restitution orders in human trafficking prosecutions. In a study of  federal human trafficking cases brought over a four period, federal  courts failed to order restitution in nearly two-thirds of cases  involving sex trafficking offenses. And shockingly, they found that the  victims least likely to obtain restitution orders were children  trafficked in the sex industry. Less than one in three defendants who  commit sex trafficking offenses against children were ordered to pay  restitution to their victims. This is unacceptable.   Furthermore, even if restitution is ordered against a trafficker,  restitution itself is not being effectively collected. In response the  requests from the Judiciary Committee, the Attorney General included  restitution order and collection data in the Department of Justice's  report on trafficking for fiscal year 2015. Of the $4,268,358 ordered  in restitution in 2015, only $987 was collected.   While we may not expect to see full restitution collected in the year  it is ordered, it is shocking that the total restitution collected is  less than 1% of what was ordered.   That is why we have tried to include additional restitution  provisions in the bill to better support victims. For example, there is  an additional provision in the bill to update the Combat Human  Trafficking Act of 2015, a bill that I authored with Senator Portman.  That bill mandated extensive training on restitution for prosecutors  and judges. It is our hope that with these updates--and with the recent  enactment of the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 to make  sure that prosecutors are held accountable in seeking restitution-- victims will be better supported going forward. I am hopeful that we  will be able to pass these bipartisan bills this Congress. I urge my  colleagues in this body to support the passage of this important,  comprehensive legislation to protect trafficking victims.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CASSIDY (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mrs. Capito):   S. 1313. A bill to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs.
