 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this en  bloc amendment and H.R. 1, the so-called For the People Act.   It is hard to know exactly where to begin when considering how  misguided this bill truly is. If this bill becomes law, we will have  nationwide universal mail-in balloting, ballot harvesting, and  taxpayer-funded elections where for every $1 of contribution from an  individual, the Federal Government will kick in $6. Additionally, this  bill eliminates the voter ID laws in all 50 States and effectively  eliminates signature matching.   The sad truth is that there are things that we could be doing on a  bipartisan basis to improve our election process. In the last Congress,  many of my Democratic colleagues supported auditing of election  results. I agree and believe we could find genuine compromise on that  important point.   It is for all these reasons and many, many more that I urge my  colleagues to oppose H.R. 1. It is a bad bill.   Madam Speaker, I would like to remind my friend from Illinois that if  it weren't for my participation, I don't know that we would have won  that game.
