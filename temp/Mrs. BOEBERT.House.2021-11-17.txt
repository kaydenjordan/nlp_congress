 Madam Speaker, Democrat policies are so pathetic and  have done so poorly that the left has nothing else to do but troll the  internet, looking for ways to get offended, and then try to target  Members and strip them of their committees. This is a dumb waste of the  House's time. But since the Speaker has designated the floor to discuss  Members' inappropriate actions, shall we?   The jihad squad member from Minnesota has paid her husband--and not  her brother husband, the other one--over a million dollars in campaign  funds. This Member is allowed on the Foreign Affairs Committee while  praising terrorists.   A Democrat chairwoman incited further violence in the streets outside  of a courthouse.   Then the cherry on top, my colleague and 3-month Presidential  candidate from California, who is on the Intelligence Committee, slept  with Fang Fang, a Chinese spy. Let me say that again. A Member of  Congress who received classified briefings was sleeping with the enemy.
