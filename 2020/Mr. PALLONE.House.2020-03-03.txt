 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 1822) to require the Federal  Communications Commission to issue rules relating to the collection of  data with respect to the availability of broadband services, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
