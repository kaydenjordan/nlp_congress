 Mr. Speaker, I think the key term that Ranking Member Bost  used was ``common sense.'' That can sometimes be in short supply around  here.   When we found out that the VA has roughly the same number of EEOC  counselors today--38--that it had in 1997, you ask yourself the simple  question: Well, what else has happened at the VA since that time?   Their workforce has nearly doubled. Since 1997, the VA has become one  of the largest Federal agencies, with a workforce of over 400,000  people, which means those same 38 EEOC counselors are handling roughly  double the amount of complaints of unfair and illegal discrimination  today that they were in 1997.   See, the law placed an artificial cap on the number of counselors,  but it did not place a cap on the amount of unjust discrimination in  our society. That has continued. If anything, the last year has shown  us how deep and intransigent racial discrimination, sex discrimination,  and other illegal forms of discrimination remain in our society and how  we have to take active steps to dismantle them wherever we find them.   Unfair and illegal discrimination exists at the VA. It doesn't make  me proud to say it as a veteran, as a lawmaker, as a public servant,  but it exists there just like it exists everywhere else. These folks  know how to deal with it. They know how to listen. They know how to  make the employees feel like they have a safe place to go and tell  their side of the story. They know how to stick up for these employees  who are giving their careers to helping our veterans.   All we need to do is lift the cap, and the VA will hire EEOC  counselors who can do their job effectively and take care of those who  are taking care of our veterans every day.
