 Mr. Chairman, I would like to remind my colleagues of the  simple truth that process matters. If the process fails, the outcome  fails. That is exactly what has happened with this farm bill.   Instead of following regular order, as we have done in the past--and  I was there personally to be a part of it and witness it--by taking  this kind of legislation up through the subcommittees with open rules,  giving all the members an opportunity to offer their amendments and  their ideas and consider them and have the opportunity to write this  bill through the subcommittees, instead, it has come from behind closed  doors for the simple purpose of partisan positioning.   In fact, members of the committee weren't even allowed to see this  bill for weeks leading up to the consideration, nor were stakeholders  and affected parties given the opportunity to review and express their  thoughts. The result is a missed opportunity and an abandonment of a  bipartisan, collaborative tradition that has worked so well for the  farmers and the consumers in this country. It is a mean-spirited, bad  bill--the result of a failed process--and it should be defeated.
