 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Girl  Scouts of the USA on their 106th birthday and to commend the  organization for helping girls become leaders in their communities and  in our Nation. It is fitting that the Girl Scouts' birthday falls  during Women's History Month.  [[Page H1647]]    In 1912, Juliette Gordon Low founded the first Girl Scout troop, with  18 girls, in Savannah, Georgia. 106 years later, more than 50 million  women are Girl Scout alums, and the program reaches nearly 2 million  girls. Today, Girl Scout alums launch rockets into space, serve as CEOs  of international companies, sit on academic boards, and more.   As we celebrate the Girl Scouts' 106th birthday this week and Women's  History Month, I applaud the Girl Scout councils that serve girls in my  State for building girls of courage, confidence, and character, who  make the world a better place.   I am proud that this program was founded in the First Congressional  District of Georgia and in my hometown of Savannah, Georgia.                            ____________________
