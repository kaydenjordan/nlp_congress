 Madam Speaker, yesterday, the President's budget  proposal was announced. It contains some of the largest tax hikes in  American history. If enacted, it would set the corporate tax rate at 28  percent, a higher level than even Communist China.   Combined State and Federal taxes would amount to 32 percent.   This tax burden will primarily fall where?   On American workers and consumers.   It is broadly accepted by economists on the left and right that  corporate taxes hurt wage growth, with labor bearing as much as 25  percent of the cost of corporate taxes.   Some estimates even place that burden as high as 70 percent. Raising  the corporate tax will hurt American workers, depress their wages, and  lower their purchasing power.   This is not a progrowth or proworker budget proposal. It is not even  serious.   The President must meet with House Republicans and negotiate in good  faith for spending reductions and work toward an actual balanced budget  like everyday Americans do in their homes and their businesses.                            ____________________
