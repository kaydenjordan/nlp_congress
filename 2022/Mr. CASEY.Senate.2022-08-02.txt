 Madam President, I am pleased that Democrats have come  together to address the costs of prescription drugs and to lower  Affordable Care Act health care premiums for Americans. I strongly  support a negotiation process for prescription drugs that will enable  the voices of affected stakeholders, especially older adults, patients  and people with disabilities, communities of color, and other  marginalized groups, to play an integral role and inform the  development and oversight of Medicare drug negotiations.   The Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to  ensure affected stakeholders provide input about the potential for  drugs to achieve outcomes that improve their quality of life. I view  the Inflation Reduction Act as an opportunity to put older adults,  people with disabilities and patients in front of the process so those  affected, especially those historically excluded from the data used to  make decisions, are at the table as the Department of Health and Human  Services negotiates prices and advances the health equity goals we all  share.                            ____________________
