 Madam President, the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Jones,  and I have legislation that we propose to introduce tonight.   I am prepared to let him speak before I do because I understand he  has another event, but I don't see him.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, the Senator from Alabama will be here  shortly. I will go ahead and make my remarks, and then he can add his.   I ask unanimous consent that I may be able to use a piece of  demonstrative evidence as a part of my remarks.    Mr. President, about 20 million Americans know what  this is. This is the FAFSA. This is the form that about 20 million  Americans fill out every year in order to qualify for the Pell grant  and the student loan they might use to go to college--20 million  Americans.   About 400,000 Tennesseans fill this out every year, and what Senator  Jones and I propose to do is to reduce the 108 questions that are  filled out online to between 17 and 30 as a way of making it simpler  and easier for 20 million American families and their children to go to  college.   Last month, I received a letter from Janet who volunteers with low- income students in Nashville and has seen the challenges students and  their families face to apply for college and financial aid.   She describes the FAFSA as ``being a huge impediment . . . to  students raised in poverty to even attend college.''   Janet continued, saying: ``But a few years ago, a different hurdle  became evident.'' She was referring to something called verification.   She told the story of an excellent student who began classes at  Middle Tennessee State University, but 6 weeks into her fall semester,  her FAFSA was flagged for verification--a complicated process that  stops Pell grant payments while a student and their families scramble  to submit their Federal tax information or prove they didn't have to  file taxes.   ``Our student had to drop out of school as she lost funding,'' Janet  said. ``There has to be a better way.''   Well, today Senator Jones and I are suggesting a better way. We call  it the FAFSA Simplification Act, to give students a better, simpler way  to apply for financial aid.   Every year, nearly 20 million families, as I said, fill out the FAFSA  to apply for Federal student aid, including 400,000 families in  Tennessee.   A volunteer mentor with Tennessee Promise, which is our State's  program that provides 2 years of free community college, told me that  the FAFSA has a ``chilling effect'' on students and on parents.   Former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam told me that Tennessee has the  highest rate for filling out the FAFSA--more students fill it out than  in any other State by percentage--but it is still the single biggest  impediment to more students enrolling in Tennessee Promise, which gives  them a free community college tuition.   The FAFSA Simplification Act will make it easier for families to  apply for Federal student aid by doing three things.   First, it reduces the number of questions on the FAFSA from 108 to 17  to 30 questions.   Second, it will greatly reduce the need for the burdensome  verification I discussed, the process that caused Janet's student to  drop out of school.   East Tennessee State University said that one-third of its  applicants, approximately 10,000 students, are selected each year for  verification.   Third, this legislation will allow students to find out as early as  eighth grade how much Pell grant funding they may be eligible for so  students can start to plan for college sooner.   This result has been 5 years in the making.   In 2014, at a hearing before our Senate Education Committee,  witnesses testified that the vast majority of questions on the FAFSA  are unnecessary.   I asked if the four witnesses, who came from many different  directions, would each write a letter to the committee recommending how  they would simplify the FAFSA. The witnesses stopped for a moment, they  looked at one another, and said: We don't have to write you four  letters because we all agree on how to fix the FAFSA. We can write you  one letter, and they did.   So Senator Michael Bennet, a Democratic member who was on the  committee at the time, said: Well, if that is true and if there is that  much agreement, then why don't we do what you recommend?   I mean, how many times do we go home to Tennessee or Arizona and  Alabama and explain something and people say: Well, then why don't you  do it?   This is a case of, well, then why don't we do it, and Senator Jones  and I are here to ask that question and recommend that we do.   So we started talking with other Senators, students, college  administrators, other experts about how to simplify the FAFSA.   In 2015, Senator Bennet and I--now, listen to this list--along with  Senator Booker, Senator Burr, Senator King, Senators Enzi, Warner, and  Isakson, introduced bipartisan legislation that would reduce the number  of FAFSA questions to two questions.   After discussions with college administrators and States, we realized  we needed to keep some questions or States and schools would have to  create their own additional forms that students would need to fill out.   Over the last 4 years, we have improved that legislation. We now  believe that what Senator Jones and I are proposing will permit us to  move forward with bipartisan legislation that would reduce the FAFSA to  between 18 and 30 questions. That is the legislation we have introduced  today. This is one more step to make it easier for families to fill out  the FAFSA.   In President Obama's administration, with the encouragement of our  committee, families were allowed to use the tax information from the  previous year so they could apply to colleges in the fall rather than  have to wait until the spring.   Second, the Trump administration has put the FAFSA application on a  phone app. I was at Sevier County High School last November, and I saw  students zipping through the FAFSA on their iPhones.   Third, last year's Senate passed bipartisan legislation that Senator  Murray of Washington and I introduced that allows students to answer up  to 22 questions on the current FAFSA with just 1 click, and that will  stop requiring students to give the same information to the Federal  Government twice.   I can't tell you the number of parents and grandparents who said to  me: Why do I have to give the same information to the Federal  Government twice in order to apply for a student loan or a Pell grant?   The answer is, you shouldn't have to. This would dramatically  decrease the number of students selected for verification.  [[Page S5971]]    In conclusion, that third step, along with the bill Senator Jones and  I have introduced today, is part of the package I introduced last month  to permanently fund historically Black colleges and universities and  other minority-serving institutions, provide Pell grants for prisoners,  and allow Pell grants to be used for short-term programs.   This legislation, which includes our bill to simplify the FAFSA, can  and should pass the Senate and the House this year so it can be signed  into law by the President.   By reducing the number of questions on the FAFSA, reducing the need  for verification, and allowing students to learn earlier how much aid  they may qualify for, the FAFSA Simplification Act will make it simpler  and easier for students and families to apply for financial aid.   I have some statements of support which I would like to read into the  Record, but I will pause at this moment and give Senator Jones a chance  to speak, and then I will come back after he has finished and ask for  the floor and discuss these statements of support.    Mr. President, Senator Jones made a very important  point, not only about Alabama, but really about every State.   The Pell grant that we are talking about is money you don't have to  pay back. This is not a student loan that you lay awake at night  worrying about.   Forty percent of our college students in this country go to community  colleges, 2-year colleges. The average tuition at community colleges in  America is $3,600. The average Pell grant is $3,600. Just those few  facts show that basically 40 percent of those who go to college in  America can go tuition-free or close to tuition-free because of the  availability of the Pell grant. Now, it is higher in some States and  lower in other States, but that is a fact. These are not loans that you  have to pay back. These are grants that basically say that, if you want  2 years of college past high school, you can have it.   In States like Tennessee and an increasing number of other States,  the State government is stepping up to say: Well, if the Pell grant  doesn't quite cover your tuition, we will cover the rest of it, so it  is tuition-free.   It is important for us to say to the American people--to parents,  grandparents, and students--that: If you want to go to college, you  can; and tuition is probably free or about free, but first, you have to  fill out this 108 question FAFSA. That is the problem.   A president of a community college in Memphis that has almost all  African-American students told me he  [[Page S5972]]  thinks he loses 1,500 students a semester because of the complexity of  the FAFSA. At the other end of the State, the President of East  Tennessee State University says that 10,000 of his students get their  classes interrupted by the so-called verification process. We would fix  almost all those problems with this bill.   I am glad that Senator Jones has stepped up and so many other  Senators are agreeable to this. I hope we can answer the question that  people ask me when I go home: Okay. Why don't you do it?   We should do it. We have been working on it for 5 years--whether it  is Senator Bennet who introduced the first bill with me and a number of  others or whether it is Senator Murray who introduced with me the bill  that passed the Senate last year that said that, in one click, you can  answer the tax questions and you don't have to give that information to  the government twice. We can do that this year, and 20 million American  families will be grateful.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements of support be  printed in the Record following my remarks.   I will just summarize some of them quickly.   Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student  Financial Aid Administrators, said: ``In short, this bill makes the  process of applying for student aid much easier for all students, but  the biggest positive impact will be for our nation's neediest  students.'' I would like to thank Justin and his association of  financial aid experts for working with us because the first bill we  introduced didn't take into consideration a number of points that it  should have. The administrators pointed them out to us, and so we  believe we have come up with a set of solutions that meets those needs  and has their support.   The National College Access Network Executive Director Kim Cook said:  ``[Our organization] has long advocated for a streamlined FAFSA to  lessen one of the barriers faced by many first-generation students  going to college. By combining this simpler FAFSA with a Pell Grant  look-up table, we can show students, early in their decision-making  process, that there is money to help them complete college.''   Stacey Lightfoot testified before our committee. She is vice  president of college and career success at the Public Education  Foundation of Chattanooga: ``The FAFSA is even more complex for  families, especially those from underserved backgrounds, who get lost  answering over 100 questions on the form. [This] proposal to simplify  the FAFSA is long overdue and has been thoughtfully created to ensure  better access to college by eliminating unnecessary and irrelevant  questions. The new bill takes the most intimidating aspect of the  college process away from students.''   Why would we cause 20 million families to answer unnecessary and  intimidating questions, and discourage their students from going to  college? Why would we do that? We shouldn't.   Executive director of Alabama Possible, Kristina Scott, said: ``With  the FAFSA Simplification Act implementation of simple, clear Pell Grant  look up tables, we will be able to talk with students beginning in  middle school about what aid for which they should be eligible and how  to access it by completing a shorter, simplified FAFSA. These two  changes can shift the conversation about postsecondary education from  `if' to `when' for low-income and first-generation college-going  students and their families.''   How many times do we hear it said that--particularly in low-income  families--parents, grandparents, and others discourage the students  from going to college because they are afraid it will mean a lot of  debt that they will never be able to pay back. They can't imagine how  they can handle this. This bill and all that goes with it will allow  conversations to begin with middle school students, including low- income students, and say: You may be in the eighth grade or the seventh  grade or a freshman in high school, but you can begin thinking now  about at least 2 more years of college after high school that are  essentially tuition free, and it is simple to do because of the simpler  FAFSA.   Mike Krause, director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission,  said: ``For Tennessee, the complexity of the FAFSA presents a barrier  for students attempting to enroll in Tennessee Promise, Tennessee  Reconnect, and other financial aid programs like the HOPE Access Grant.  . . . Simplifying the FAFSA would improve college access for students  in Tennessee by allowing the federal government and our state to better  target financial aid to the neediest students.''   Now, what he is saying is that this complicated form is a barrier to  free college for students of all ages in Tennessee. They have to fill  this out first. If they are discouraged from doing it, they don't go to  college.   Barbara Duffield, executive director of School House Connection,  which helps homeless and foster care children, had this to say: ``The  FAFSA Simplification Act removes barriers to financial aid for some of  our Nation's most vulnerable youth--those who experience homelessness  or foster care.''   This has been a good exercise in the United States Senate. We have  had testimony before our committee. Our witnesses told us what to do.  Senator Bennet and I, and a group of others who were on the committee  at that time, said: Okay. Let's do it.   We got advice from the financial aid officers who said: Wait a  minute. You didn't think about this and that. For example, if you cut  it down to two questions, then Arizona and Tennessee are going to have  to ask more questions in order to do the State grant programs that they  have. So we recognized that, and we adjusted our position. Then Senator  Jones, who is a new member of our committee, stepped up and said he  wanted to be a part of it, so now, we are ready to go.   Chairman  Bobby Scott, chairman of the House Education Committee,  introduced a bill that would simplify the FAFSA just last week. It is  not the same as our bill, but it heads in the same direction.   I think every single Member of this body wants to help students,  especially low-income students, have an opportunity to attend college  if they want to. We have everything in place for them to do it, yet we  have created this single barrier--this 108-question form--with  unnecessary, needless questions and a verification process in the  middle of the semester that would yank your money and cause you to drop  out of school. We can change that this year. If we will do it, we have  bipartisan support in the Senate, and the President will sign it. I  hope it is law by the beginning of next year.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           State of Tennessee, Higher Education Commission, Student             Assistance Corporation,                                   Nashville, TN, October 21, 2019.      Hon. Lamar Alexander,      Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions           Committee.      Hon. Doug Jones,      Member, Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee.        Dear Chairman Alexander and Senator Jones: The Tennessee       Higher Education Commission and Tennessee Student Assistance       Corporation write to express appreciation and strong support       for the FAFSA Simplification Act of 2019.        The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the       way nearly 20 million Americans access federal, state, and       institution based financial aid to attend college each year.       However, the complexity of the form and chilling effect of       the verification process is one of the biggest barriers for       our most vulnerable students to enter a postsecondary       institution.        For Tennessee, the complexity of the FAFSA presents a       barrier for students attempting to enroll in Tennessee       Promise, Tennessee Reconnect, and other financial aid       programs like the HOPE Access Grant. In the 2018-19 school       year, over 400,000 Tennesseans submitted a FAFSA, and that       information was the cornerstone to access both state and       federal aid. Simplifying the FAFSA would improve college       access for students in Tennessee by allowing the federal       government and our state to better target financial aid to       the neediest students. In particular, Tennessee sees great       value for our State in the FAFSA Simplification Act based on       four key aspects:         1. Statewide efforts to promote FAFSA completion and       college enrollment thrive on simple messages. The new simple       Pell Grant formula will allow statewide college access       messaging campaigns to inform students and families about how       much Pell Grant they will likely be eligible to receive based       on a table or simple calculator.         2. Tennessee and its public institutions depend on the       Needs Analysis formula to annually award over $400 million in       State appropriated student financial aid. By continuing the       availability of this calculation and most  [[Page S5973]]       of the variables behind it, our State will have the to       continue awarding state and institutional aid without       disruption.         3. FAFSA filing can quickly become challenging for       applicants when sorting through difficult financial       questions. By relying on tax information the federal       government already has on file, students and families do not       have to find additional information and are unlikely to be       selected for burdensome verification processes.         4. The flexibility provided to financial aid       administrators regarding professional judgement and       applicants to file provisionally independent will be       transformative for our State's most vulnerable students.        Thank you both for your strong commitment to this issue. It       is important to enact this reform which will help us reach       our State's goals.            Sincerely,      Mike Krause.                                   ____                              Support Statements         Justin Dragger, president of the National Association of       Student Financial Aid Administrators said: ``In short, this       bill makes the process of applying for student aid much       easier for all students, but the biggest positive impact will       be for our nation's neediest students.''

Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Doug Jones (D-Ala.)       today introduced the FAFSA Simplification Act of 2019, a bill       that would create a streamlined financial aid application       process, while still giving schools, states, and scholarship       providers enough information to offer financial aid to       today's diverse college-going population. Under this       proposal, all students would be able to determine their Pell       Grant eligibility through Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and       household size.        For far too long, thousands of students who have every       intention of attending college never enroll, or end up       leaving millions of financial aid dollars on the table--      including $2.3 billion in Pell Grant dollars annually--in       large part due to the overly complex nature of applying for       and receiving federal financial aid. While we have made       significant progress toward simplifying the process in recent       years--through the addition of skip logic to the Free       Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and allowing some       income data to be imported via the Internal Revenue Service's       Data Retrieval Tool, for example--we can do better.        The FAFSA Simplification Act would significantly reduce the       number of questions on the FAFSA--including irrelevant and       unnecessary questions, such as the Selective Service and drug       offense-related questions--and require students to only       answer questions based on their family income.        ``Taking into account feedback from financial aid       professionals nationwide, this bill takes a commonsense       approach to shorten the FAFSA application to an extent that       would not deprive institutions of crucial information needed       to appropriately disburse billions of dollars of financial       aid to eligible students,'' said NASFAA President Justin       Draeger. ``In short, this bill makes the process of applying       for student aid much easier for all students, but the biggest       positive impact will be for our nation's neediest students.''        ``NCAN has long advocated for a streamlined FAFSA to lessen       one of the barriers faced by many first-generation students       going to college.

A few NASFAA and NCAN members also weighed in on the bill       and what it would mean for students:        ``Legislation that makes the process for accessing       financial aid simpler for our students and families is a       win,'' said Brenda Hicks, director of financial aid at       Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas. ``Condensing       eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant to a look-up table       places pivotal information directly in students' hands in a       concise and accessible way. This kind of knowledge could make       the difference between a student who feels a college       education is out of reach financially and a student who       suddenly has hope for their future.''        ``One of the biggest reasons students and families don't       complete the FAFSA is that they don't think they will be       eligible for any financial aid. This is true even for Pell-      eligible families,'' said Kristina Scott, executive director       of Alabama Possible. ``With the FAFSA Simplification Act       implementation of simple, clear Pell Grant look up tables, we       will be able to talk with students beginning in middle school       about what aid for which they should be eligible and how to       access it by completing a shorter, simplified FAFSA. These       two changes can shift the conversation about postsecondary       education from `if' to `when' for low-income and first-      generation college-going students and their families.''        ``FAFSA simplification is an important step in the right       direction to make the financial aid process more transparent       for students and their families,'' said Lori Vedder, director       of the office of financial aid at the University of Michigan-      Flint. ``Allowing our neediest students to avoid answering       unnecessary questions when applying for financial aid would       remove barriers that often keep many students from       matriculating. Having an earlier and upfront indication of       their eligibility to receive crucial need-based aid, such as       the federal Pell Grant, will help these students realize they       have the ability to attend and afford college.''        ``Completing the FAFSA, for as long as I can remember, is a       daunting process--one that my mother needed help with over 20       years ago for my sister and me,'' shared Stacy Lightfoot,       vice president of college and career success at the Public       Education Foundation of Chattanooga-Hamilton County. ``Now,       the FAFSA is even more complex for families, especially those       from underserved backgrounds, who get lost answering over 100       questions on the form. Senator Alexander's proposal to       simplify the FAFSA is long overdue and has been thoughtfully       created to ensure better access to college by eliminating       unnecessary and irrelevant questions. The new bill takes the       most intimidating aspect of the college process away for       students.''

I ask unanimous consent that I may be able to use a piece of  demonstrative evidence as a part of my remarks.    Mr. President, about 20 million Americans know what  this is. This is the FAFSA. This is the form that about 20 million  Americans fill out every year in order to qualify for the Pell grant  and the student loan they might use to go to college--20 million  Americans.   About 400,000 Tennesseans fill this out every year, and what Senator  Jones and I propose to do is to reduce the 108 questions that are  filled out online to between 17 and 30 as a way of making it simpler  and easier for 20 million American families and their children to go to  college.   Last month, I received a letter from Janet who volunteers with low- income students in Nashville and has seen the challenges students and  their families face to apply for college and financial aid.   She describes the FAFSA as ``being a huge impediment . . . to  students raised in poverty to even attend college.''   Janet continued, saying: ``But a few years ago, a different hurdle  became evident.'' She was referring to something called verification.   She told the story of an excellent student who began classes at  Middle Tennessee State University, but 6 weeks into her fall semester,  her FAFSA was flagged for verification--a complicated process that  stops Pell grant payments while a student and their families scramble  to submit their Federal tax information or prove they didn't have to  file taxes.   ``Our student had to drop out of school as she lost funding,'' Janet  said. ``There has to be a better way.''   Well, today Senator Jones and I are suggesting a better way. We call  it the FAFSA Simplification Act, to give students a better, simpler way  to apply for financial aid.   Every year, nearly 20 million families, as I said, fill out the FAFSA  to apply for Federal student aid, including 400,000 families in  Tennessee.   A volunteer mentor with Tennessee Promise, which is our State's  program that provides 2 years of free community college, told me that  the FAFSA has a ``chilling effect'' on students and on parents.   Former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam told me that Tennessee has the  highest rate for filling out the FAFSA--more students fill it out than  in any other State by percentage--but it is still the single biggest  impediment to more students enrolling in Tennessee Promise, which gives  them a free community college tuition.   The FAFSA Simplification Act will make it easier for families to  apply for Federal student aid by doing three things.   First, it reduces the number of questions on the FAFSA from 108 to 17  to 30 questions.   Second, it will greatly reduce the need for the burdensome  verification I discussed, the process that caused Janet's student to  drop out of school.   East Tennessee State University said that one-third of its  applicants, approximately 10,000 students, are selected each year for  verification.   Third, this legislation will allow students to find out as early as  eighth grade how much Pell grant funding they may be eligible for so  students can start to plan for college sooner.   This result has been 5 years in the making.   In 2014, at a hearing before our Senate Education Committee,  witnesses testified that the vast majority of questions on the FAFSA  are unnecessary.   I asked if the four witnesses, who came from many different  directions, would each write a letter to the committee recommending how  they would simplify the FAFSA. The witnesses stopped for a moment, they  looked at one another, and said: We don't have to write you four  letters because we all agree on how to fix the FAFSA. We can write you  one letter, and they did.   So Senator Michael Bennet, a Democratic member who was on the  committee at the time, said: Well, if that is true and if there is that  much agreement, then why don't we do what you recommend?   I mean, how many times do we go home to Tennessee or Arizona and  Alabama and explain something and people say: Well, then why don't you  do it?   This is a case of, well, then why don't we do it, and Senator Jones  and I are here to ask that question and recommend that we do.   So we started talking with other Senators, students, college  administrators, other experts about how to simplify the FAFSA.   In 2015, Senator Bennet and I--now, listen to this list--along with  Senator Booker, Senator Burr, Senator King, Senators Enzi, Warner, and  Isakson, introduced bipartisan legislation that would reduce the number  of FAFSA questions to two questions.   After discussions with college administrators and States, we realized  we needed to keep some questions or States and schools would have to  create their own additional forms that students would need to fill out.   Over the last 4 years, we have improved that legislation. We now  believe that what Senator Jones and I are proposing will permit us to  move forward with bipartisan legislation that would reduce the FAFSA to  between 18 and 30 questions. That is the legislation we have introduced  today. This is one more step to make it easier for families to fill out  the FAFSA.   In President Obama's administration, with the encouragement of our  committee, families were allowed to use the tax information from the  previous year so they could apply to colleges in the fall rather than  have to wait until the spring.   Second, the Trump administration has put the FAFSA application on a  phone app. I was at Sevier County High School last November, and I saw  students zipping through the FAFSA on their iPhones.   Third, last year's Senate passed bipartisan legislation that Senator  Murray of Washington and I introduced that allows students to answer up  to 22 questions on the current FAFSA with just 1 click, and that will  stop requiring students to give the same information to the Federal  Government twice.   I can't tell you the number of parents and grandparents who said to  me: Why do I have to give the same information to the Federal  Government twice in order to apply for a student loan or a Pell grant?   The answer is, you shouldn't have to. This would dramatically  decrease the number of students selected for verification.  [[Page S5971]]    In conclusion, that third step, along with the bill Senator Jones and  I have introduced today, is part of the package I introduced last month  to permanently fund historically Black colleges and universities and  other minority-serving institutions, provide Pell grants for prisoners,  and allow Pell grants to be used for short-term programs.   This legislation, which includes our bill to simplify the FAFSA, can  and should pass the Senate and the House this year so it can be signed  into law by the President.   By reducing the number of questions on the FAFSA, reducing the need  for verification, and allowing students to learn earlier how much aid  they may qualify for, the FAFSA Simplification Act will make it simpler  and easier for students and families to apply for financial aid.   I have some statements of support which I would like to read into the  Record, but I will pause at this moment and give Senator Jones a chance  to speak, and then I will come back after he has finished and ask for  the floor and discuss these statements of support.    Mr. President, Senator Jones made a very important  point, not only about Alabama, but really about every State.   The Pell grant that we are talking about is money you don't have to  pay back. This is not a student loan that you lay awake at night  worrying about.   Forty percent of our college students in this country go to community  colleges, 2-year colleges. The average tuition at community colleges in  America is $3,600. The average Pell grant is $3,600. Just those few  facts show that basically 40 percent of those who go to college in  America can go tuition-free or close to tuition-free because of the  availability of the Pell grant. Now, it is higher in some States and  lower in other States, but that is a fact. These are not loans that you  have to pay back. These are grants that basically say that, if you want  2 years of college past high school, you can have it.   In States like Tennessee and an increasing number of other States,  the State government is stepping up to say: Well, if the Pell grant  doesn't quite cover your tuition, we will cover the rest of it, so it  is tuition-free.   It is important for us to say to the American people--to parents,  grandparents, and students--that: If you want to go to college, you  can; and tuition is probably free or about free, but first, you have to  fill out this 108 question FAFSA. That is the problem.   A president of a community college in Memphis that has almost all  African-American students told me he  [[Page S5972]]  thinks he loses 1,500 students a semester because of the complexity of  the FAFSA. At the other end of the State, the President of East  Tennessee State University says that 10,000 of his students get their  classes interrupted by the so-called verification process. We would fix  almost all those problems with this bill.   I am glad that Senator Jones has stepped up and so many other  Senators are agreeable to this. I hope we can answer the question that  people ask me when I go home: Okay. Why don't you do it?   We should do it. We have been working on it for 5 years--whether it  is Senator Bennet who introduced the first bill with me and a number of  others or whether it is Senator Murray who introduced with me the bill  that passed the Senate last year that said that, in one click, you can  answer the tax questions and you don't have to give that information to  the government twice. We can do that this year, and 20 million American  families will be grateful.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements of support be  printed in the Record following my remarks.   I will just summarize some of them quickly.   Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student  Financial Aid Administrators, said: ``In short, this bill makes the  process of applying for student aid much easier for all students, but  the biggest positive impact will be for our nation's neediest  students.'' I would like to thank Justin and his association of  financial aid experts for working with us because the first bill we  introduced didn't take into consideration a number of points that it  should have. The administrators pointed them out to us, and so we  believe we have come up with a set of solutions that meets those needs  and has their support.   The National College Access Network Executive Director Kim Cook said:  ``[Our organization] has long advocated for a streamlined FAFSA to  lessen one of the barriers faced by many first-generation students  going to college. By combining this simpler FAFSA with a Pell Grant  look-up table, we can show students, early in their decision-making  process, that there is money to help them complete college.''   Stacey Lightfoot testified before our committee. She is vice  president of college and career success at the Public Education  Foundation of Chattanooga: ``The FAFSA is even more complex for  families, especially those from underserved backgrounds, who get lost  answering over 100 questions on the form. [This] proposal to simplify  the FAFSA is long overdue and has been thoughtfully created to ensure  better access to college by eliminating unnecessary and irrelevant  questions. The new bill takes the most intimidating aspect of the  college process away from students.''   Why would we cause 20 million families to answer unnecessary and  intimidating questions, and discourage their students from going to  college? Why would we do that? We shouldn't.   Executive director of Alabama Possible, Kristina Scott, said: ``With  the FAFSA Simplification Act implementation of simple, clear Pell Grant  look up tables, we will be able to talk with students beginning in  middle school about what aid for which they should be eligible and how  to access it by completing a shorter, simplified FAFSA. These two  changes can shift the conversation about postsecondary education from  `if' to `when' for low-income and first-generation college-going  students and their families.''   How many times do we hear it said that--particularly in low-income  families--parents, grandparents, and others discourage the students  from going to college because they are afraid it will mean a lot of  debt that they will never be able to pay back. They can't imagine how  they can handle this. This bill and all that goes with it will allow  conversations to begin with middle school students, including low- income students, and say: You may be in the eighth grade or the seventh  grade or a freshman in high school, but you can begin thinking now  about at least 2 more years of college after high school that are  essentially tuition free, and it is simple to do because of the simpler  FAFSA.   Mike Krause, director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission,  said: ``For Tennessee, the complexity of the FAFSA presents a barrier  for students attempting to enroll in Tennessee Promise, Tennessee  Reconnect, and other financial aid programs like the HOPE Access Grant.  . . . Simplifying the FAFSA would improve college access for students  in Tennessee by allowing the federal government and our state to better  target financial aid to the neediest students.''   Now, what he is saying is that this complicated form is a barrier to  free college for students of all ages in Tennessee. They have to fill  this out first. If they are discouraged from doing it, they don't go to  college.   Barbara Duffield, executive director of School House Connection,  which helps homeless and foster care children, had this to say: ``The  FAFSA Simplification Act removes barriers to financial aid for some of  our Nation's most vulnerable youth--those who experience homelessness  or foster care.''   This has been a good exercise in the United States Senate. We have  had testimony before our committee. Our witnesses told us what to do.  Senator Bennet and I, and a group of others who were on the committee  at that time, said: Okay. Let's do it.   We got advice from the financial aid officers who said: Wait a  minute. You didn't think about this and that. For example, if you cut  it down to two questions, then Arizona and Tennessee are going to have  to ask more questions in order to do the State grant programs that they  have. So we recognized that, and we adjusted our position. Then Senator  Jones, who is a new member of our committee, stepped up and said he  wanted to be a part of it, so now, we are ready to go.   Chairman  Bobby Scott, chairman of the House Education Committee,  introduced a bill that would simplify the FAFSA just last week. It is  not the same as our bill, but it heads in the same direction.   I think every single Member of this body wants to help students,  especially low-income students, have an opportunity to attend college  if they want to. We have everything in place for them to do it, yet we  have created this single barrier--this 108-question form--with  unnecessary, needless questions and a verification process in the  middle of the semester that would yank your money and cause you to drop  out of school. We can change that this year. If we will do it, we have  bipartisan support in the Senate, and the President will sign it. I  hope it is law by the beginning of next year.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           State of Tennessee, Higher Education Commission, Student             Assistance Corporation,                                   Nashville, TN, October 21, 2019.      Hon. Lamar Alexander,      Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions           Committee.      Hon. Doug Jones,      Member, Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee.        Dear Chairman Alexander and Senator Jones: The Tennessee       Higher Education Commission and Tennessee Student Assistance       Corporation write to express appreciation and strong support       for the FAFSA Simplification Act of 2019.        The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the       way nearly 20 million Americans access federal, state, and       institution based financial aid to attend college each year.       However, the complexity of the form and chilling effect of       the verification process is one of the biggest barriers for       our most vulnerable students to enter a postsecondary       institution.        For Tennessee, the complexity of the FAFSA presents a       barrier for students attempting to enroll in Tennessee       Promise, Tennessee Reconnect, and other financial aid       programs like the HOPE Access Grant. In the 2018-19 school       year, over 400,000 Tennesseans submitted a FAFSA, and that       information was the cornerstone to access both state and       federal aid. Simplifying the FAFSA would improve college       access for students in Tennessee by allowing the federal       government and our state to better target financial aid to       the neediest students. In particular, Tennessee sees great       value for our State in the FAFSA Simplification Act based on       four key aspects:         1. Statewide efforts to promote FAFSA completion and       college enrollment thrive on simple messages. The new simple       Pell Grant formula will allow statewide college access       messaging campaigns to inform students and families about how       much Pell Grant they will likely be eligible to receive based       on a table or simple calculator.         2. Tennessee and its public institutions depend on the       Needs Analysis formula to annually award over $400 million in       State appropriated student financial aid. By continuing the       availability of this calculation and most  [[Page S5973]]       of the variables behind it, our State will have the to       continue awarding state and institutional aid without       disruption.         3. FAFSA filing can quickly become challenging for       applicants when sorting through difficult financial       questions. By relying on tax information the federal       government already has on file, students and families do not       have to find additional information and are unlikely to be       selected for burdensome verification processes.         4. The flexibility provided to financial aid       administrators regarding professional judgement and       applicants to file provisionally independent will be       transformative for our State's most vulnerable students.        Thank you both for your strong commitment to this issue. It       is important to enact this reform which will help us reach       our State's goals.            Sincerely,      Mike Krause.                                   ____                              Support Statements         Justin Dragger, president of the National Association of       Student Financial Aid Administrators said: ``In short, this       bill makes the process of applying for student aid much       easier for all students, but the biggest positive impact will       be for our nation's neediest students.''

Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Doug Jones (D-Ala.)       today introduced the FAFSA Simplification Act of 2019, a bill       that would create a streamlined financial aid application       process, while still giving schools, states, and scholarship       providers enough information to offer financial aid to       today's diverse college-going population. Under this       proposal, all students would be able to determine their Pell       Grant eligibility through Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and       household size.        For far too long, thousands of students who have every       intention of attending college never enroll, or end up       leaving millions of financial aid dollars on the table--      including $2.3 billion in Pell Grant dollars annually--in       large part due to the overly complex nature of applying for       and receiving federal financial aid. While we have made       significant progress toward simplifying the process in recent       years--through the addition of skip logic to the Free       Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and allowing some       income data to be imported via the Internal Revenue Service's       Data Retrieval Tool, for example--we can do better.        The FAFSA Simplification Act would significantly reduce the       number of questions on the FAFSA--including irrelevant and       unnecessary questions, such as the Selective Service and drug       offense-related questions--and require students to only       answer questions based on their family income.        ``Taking into account feedback from financial aid       professionals nationwide, this bill takes a commonsense       approach to shorten the FAFSA application to an extent that       would not deprive institutions of crucial information needed       to appropriately disburse billions of dollars of financial       aid to eligible students,'' said NASFAA President Justin       Draeger. ``In short, this bill makes the process of applying       for student aid much easier for all students, but the biggest       positive impact will be for our nation's neediest students.''        ``NCAN has long advocated for a streamlined FAFSA to lessen       one of the barriers faced by many first-generation students       going to college.

A few NASFAA and NCAN members also weighed in on the bill       and what it would mean for students:        ``Legislation that makes the process for accessing       financial aid simpler for our students and families is a       win,'' said Brenda Hicks, director of financial aid at       Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas. ``Condensing       eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant to a look-up table       places pivotal information directly in students' hands in a       concise and accessible way. This kind of knowledge could make       the difference between a student who feels a college       education is out of reach financially and a student who       suddenly has hope for their future.''        ``One of the biggest reasons students and families don't       complete the FAFSA is that they don't think they will be       eligible for any financial aid. This is true even for Pell-      eligible families,'' said Kristina Scott, executive director       of Alabama Possible. ``With the FAFSA Simplification Act       implementation of simple, clear Pell Grant look up tables, we       will be able to talk with students beginning in middle school       about what aid for which they should be eligible and how to       access it by completing a shorter, simplified FAFSA. These       two changes can shift the conversation about postsecondary       education from `if' to `when' for low-income and first-      generation college-going students and their families.''        ``FAFSA simplification is an important step in the right       direction to make the financial aid process more transparent       for students and their families,'' said Lori Vedder, director       of the office of financial aid at the University of Michigan-      Flint. ``Allowing our neediest students to avoid answering       unnecessary questions when applying for financial aid would       remove barriers that often keep many students from       matriculating. Having an earlier and upfront indication of       their eligibility to receive crucial need-based aid, such as       the federal Pell Grant, will help these students realize they       have the ability to attend and afford college.''        ``Completing the FAFSA, for as long as I can remember, is a       daunting process--one that my mother needed help with over 20       years ago for my sister and me,'' shared Stacy Lightfoot,       vice president of college and career success at the Public       Education Foundation of Chattanooga-Hamilton County. ``Now,       the FAFSA is even more complex for families, especially those       from underserved backgrounds, who get lost answering over 100       questions on the form. Senator Alexander's proposal to       simplify the FAFSA is long overdue and has been thoughtfully       created to ensure better access to college by eliminating       unnecessary and irrelevant questions. The new bill takes the       most intimidating aspect of the college process away for       students.''
