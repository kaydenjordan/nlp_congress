 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a good friend of  mine and an even better lawyer that recently passed away in Knoxville,  Bernie Bernstein.   My friend Jerry Becker delivered the bad news last week. Bernie and  my father were good friends, and they served on a draft board together.   Bernie served in the United States Air Force and was a respected  lawyer and leader not only in the Jewish community but in every  community he was in, especially in Knoxville.   My dad had two compliments he would give people. He would say: ``You  would make a good marine,'' or he would say: ``He is solid.''   He always told me that if negotiations were ever going south, just  let Bernie speak because he was solid. Mr. Speaker, he was that.   There is a Holocaust memorial that we built in the West Hills Park  when I was in the State legislature with the help of some folks, and  Bernie was one of those.   He gave the words that are on the stone that stands there today. I  remember we were supposed to have the dedication at the memorial, but  dadgummit, it was raining cats and dogs, so we ended up having it at  West Hills Baptist Church.   Oddly enough, Bernie was dear friends with Pastor Prince who has  since passed away. His son is now the pastor there, and he is my good  friend.   I walked up thinking no one would be there. The doors opened, and it  was completely jam-packed. It was packed because he was not only a  leader in the Jewish community, he was a good friend to everyone he  met.   My dad was right. Bernie was solid, and when he spoke, people  listened. Thank you for being such a dear friend. You will truly be  missed, Bernie   He leaves his wife and two children. I wish him shalom.                            ____________________
