 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking  member from Missouri for his leadership on continuing the biennial  consideration for the Water Resources Development Act.   Today, I rise in strong support of S. 1811, the Water Resources  Development Act of 2020. WRDA 2020 will strengthen our Nation's ability  to withstand severe weather and flood events, authorize the  construction of key water infrastructure projects throughout the  Nation, create jobs here at home, and directly contribute to our  economic growth and competitiveness.   All 60 project authorizations contained in WRDA 2020 were proposed by  non-Federal sponsors and underwent a rigorous planning process before  congressional review.   This WRDA bill focuses on building more resilient infrastructure,  increasing rural flood protection, addressing the maintenance backlog  at our Nation's ports and harbors, and prioritizing our Nation's inland  waterways.   The House passed WRDA by voice vote nearly 5 months ago, continuing  the strong bipartisan tradition that WRDA enjoys.   After negotiations with the Senate, I am glad to support this  compromise bill, which contains nearly all of our Chamber's priorities.   S. 1811 is fiscally responsible, with new project authorizations  fully offset by deauthorizations of projects that are outdated or no  longer viable.   Again, I want to stress that this legislation represents the  continuing commitment to regular order for consideration of water  resources projects. Regularly overseeing the improvement of our  Nation's infrastructure is one of the most important responsibilities  of Congress.   This is a good, commonsense, and bipartisan bill. I want to recognize  the great work of our subcommittee staff, Ian, John, and Victor. I also  want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Chairman Napolitano for their  partnership in its creation.   I urge all Members to support S. 1811.
