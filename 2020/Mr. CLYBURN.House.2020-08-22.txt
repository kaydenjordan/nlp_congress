 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8015, the Delivering  for America Act. This legislation is vital to protecting the United  States Postal Service.   I maintain that the post office is the thread that holds the fabric  of our great country together. The Postal Service existed before our  Nation's Constitution as the lifeline that connected far-flung  communities. The Founders believed so strongly in the importance of the  post office that they enshrined it in our Constitution.    The post office provides a critical public service that we cannot  allow to become a potential political pawn of a dysfunctional,  destructive, and, I dare say, disastrous administration. This  administration has demonstrated time and again why government should  not be run like a business. Businesses exist to make profits. The post  office and the whole of our government exist to provide services. That  is why it is called a Postal Service, not the postal corporation.   Today, we are acting to reinforce our Postal Service system, which  provides vital services like delivering medications, Social Security  benefits, income and tax payments, veterans benefits, Census forms, and  absentee ballots to all American communities, however remote they may  be.   Americans' dependence on the Postal Service has dramatically  increased during this pandemic as we have watched the on-time delivery  of mail decrease significantly. This legislation provides the $25  billion in emergency COVID funding to the Postal Service that was  unanimously requested by the bipartisan Board of Governors.   It also prohibits and even rolls back changes made by the post office  since January 1 of this year. That prohibition lasts through January  2021 or until the end of the pandemic, whichever is later.   That means no post office can be closed, consolidated, or reduce  hours; no prohibition or restriction of overtime pay; no changes that  will delay mail delivery or increase the volume of undelivered mail;  and no removal of post office infrastructure, like sorting machines or  mailboxes.   This legislation protects the integrity of our democracy by requiring  that all election mail be treated as first class, which means ballots  must be postmarked, processed, and cleared on the same day that they  are received.                                time  1545
