 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Western High  School championship-winning football coach Dan Davidson on being named  Orange County's Football Coach of the Year. Coach Davidson led the  Western High School Pioneers to the first-ever CIF championship.   Coach Davidson built a winning team of hardworking young men--inner  city kids, average athletes--and made them believe in themselves and  hard work.   Do you know what? They won CIF this year in Orange County.   I want to congratulate Coach Davidson because not only did he create  and build a football team of winners, but he also changed the lives of  many students in central Orange County.   Coach Davidson, congratulations. All of us in Orange County are proud  of you. Keep up the good work.                            ____________________
