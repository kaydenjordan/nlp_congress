 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the centennial of  James Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' arguably one of the great literary  accomplishments in history. The time-honored epic was published in its  entirety on Joyce's 40th birthday, February 2, 1922.   Born in Dublin and educated at University College Dublin, his words  transcend countries across the world. The  [[Page H5615]]  story is read and studied worldwide, and Joyce himself has become an  intrinsic part of world culture.   Through a stream of consciousness writing style, and with humor and  parody, Joyce has kept literary thinkers and historians engaged with  interpreting his words, even 100 years later.   In 265,222 words, Joyce chronicles the simple and even mundane  encounters of protagonist Leopold Bloom on one ordinary day in Dublin:  Thursday, June 16, 1904. Yet, Joyce does it with such wit, linguistic  exuberance, and high regard for the ordinary and often overlooked  details that readers remain captivated.   I am one of those readers.   June 16, today, is considered by Joyce fans as Bloomsday, and  festivals are taking place in Dublin, here in the States, and around  the world.   As such, let me wish all of you a happy Bloomsday.                            ____________________
