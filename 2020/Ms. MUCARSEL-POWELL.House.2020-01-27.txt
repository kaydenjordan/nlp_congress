 Mr. Speaker, from maternal mortality rates to  inaccurate drug prescriptions to cardiovascular procedures, it is clear  that minority groups experience worse health outcomes in our healthcare  system.   Although structural bias is a factor, the unconscious biases of even  the most well-intentioned healthcare professionals play a role as well.  And we can't let this continue.   In a district as diverse as Florida's 26th District, we must do more  to ensure that every person, regardless of their background, can get  the quality care that they need. That is why I introduced the Medical  Education for a Diverse America Act, along with Representative Porter,  which would provide cultural competency and language training to  medical students and prepare them to better serve minority populations.   This legislation would help not only patients in south Florida, but  all over the country in diverse communities.                            ____________________
