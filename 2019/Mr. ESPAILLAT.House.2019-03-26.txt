 Madam Speaker, President Trump continues to push for  his useless, medieval wall along the southern border in defiance of  Congress, despite a bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives and  the Senate to reject this fraudulently invoked emergency declaration  which would rob taxpayers' funds from other programs. Congress has  asserted its authority, but the President is using every tool he has in  his toolbox for his pet project.   Let me remind the American people: There is no emergency at the  southern border or anywhere else that warrants this wall.   The head of the U.S. Northern Command, who is responsible for troops  on the border, testified that border crossings do not pose a military  threat. The refugees arriving on our border are families: mothers and  fathers with their children. They are willingly turning themselves in  to request asylum from the violence and harassment from gangs they face  in their home countries. No wall no matter how high it is built would  change that reality.   Madam Speaker, this is nothing more than a naked power grab, and if  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly stand for limited  executive power, I expect them all to vote to override the President's  veto today.   Madam Speaker, there is no emergency on the southern border.
