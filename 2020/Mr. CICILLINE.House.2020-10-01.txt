 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am mindful today that the Major League Baseball  playoffs are starting. While House Democrats are ready, once again, to  step up to the plate and pass urgently needed relief for our  constituents, Senate Republicans and the White House refuse to play  ball. But sadly, unlike a ball game, their refusal will have deadly  consequences.    This updated, much-needed bill addresses the seriousness of both the  public health crisis and the economic crisis American families are  dealing with. It provides strong support for small businesses, non- profits, and gives a lifeline to the struggling restaurant industry and  independent live-venue operators.   It gives additional assistance for airline industry workers,  extending the Payroll Support Program, and adds more funds to bolster  education and childcare.   Living up to its name, Heroes 2.0 honors our heroes on the front line  by providing assistance to State and local governments who desperately  need funding to pay vital workers, like first responders and healthcare  workers who are keeping us safe. It provides funds for coronavirus  testing, tracing, and ensures every American can access free  coronavirus treatment.   These are not radical ideas. This is the basic responsibility to keep  the American people healthy and safe.   It provides additional direct payments with a more robust second  round of economic stimulus checks of $1,200 per taxpayer and $500 per  dependent.   It ensures worker safety by requiring OSHA to issue a strong,  enforceable standard for all workplaces to develop and implement  infection control plans.   And it protects Americans from losing their employer-provided health  insurance by making unemployed Americans automatically eligible to  receive the maximum ACA subsidy on the exchanges.                                time  1730    It restores the $600 weekly unemployment benefits through next  January.   It helps struggling families afford a safe place to live, assisting  renters and homeowners make monthly rent, mortgage, and utility  payments, preventing homelessness in the middle of a global health  pandemic.   It addresses rising hunger with an increase in maximum SNAP benefits.   Finally, it safeguards our democracy with new resources to ensure  safe elections, an accurate Census, and preserving the Postal Service.   I have heard my Republican friends say these are radical, far-left  ideas. These are core American responsibilities that we should address  in a bipartisan way.   We have met you halfway. That is the compromise. Your constituents  are suffering. They need your help. Vote ``yes.''
