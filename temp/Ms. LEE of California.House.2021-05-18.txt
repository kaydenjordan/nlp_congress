 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. I applaud  the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act's passage in the Senate, and I thank  Representatives Meng, Chu, Beyer, and Senators Hirono and Duckworth for  leading the call to address the rise in hate crimes against the AAPI  community.                                time  1500    The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act will help ensure that we are measuring  the severity of hate crimes in this Nation so we can implement systemic  change.   It is time that we address the rise in hate crimes against Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders. We cannot ignore the fear and the  heartbreak that plagues our AAPI communities. We cannot ignore the hate  and the violence perpetrated upon the AAPI community. We cannot ignore  the fact that there have been at least 2,800 incidents of anti-Asian  hate in the United States since the pandemic began and 1,226 incidents  taking place in California and 728 crimes in the Bay Area alone.  Unfortunately, this is only a fraction of anti-Asian hate crimes and  incidents that we know because so many go unreported.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the COVID-19 Hate  Crimes Act so that we can continue to fight against hate and violence  and support justice, equality, and safety for the AAPI community.
