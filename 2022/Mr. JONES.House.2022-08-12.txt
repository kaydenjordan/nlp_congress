 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to be standing here today in  this Chamber as we make history for the American people.   Democrats fought so hard for so long to get to this moment. Even when  faced with what many described as insurmountable odds, we kept at it.  We never gave up. We never relented in our advocacy. We said we wanted  to get back to the negotiating table and that we wanted to start with  climate.   Now, we will make the biggest climate investment this Nation has ever  seen, while creating millions of good-paying jobs. The stakes of the  climate crisis could not be higher, especially for low-income  communities and communities of color around the country, who are always  the hardest hit.   This legislation is also for my grandmother, Alice Jones, who worked  well past the age of retirement just to pay for the high cost of  prescription drugs and medical procedures not fully covered by  Medicare, as we know. Today, we will also lower prescription drug  prices for our seniors.   This is why I ran for Congress. This is government working for the  people. This is Democrats delivering on our promises.
