 Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to this  appropriations bill.   This amendment would strengthen the International Commission against  Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG, and the Mission to Support the Fight  against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras. Specifically, it would  exempt both institutions from the conditions that Congress has placed  on U.S. assistance to Central America.   I am strongly supportive of conditions on aid to Central America, but  the conditions must not interfere with the work of CICIG and MACCIH,  which have been valuable allies in the fight against corruption and  have helped the people of Honduras and Guatemala work toward a more  secure and prosperous future.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
