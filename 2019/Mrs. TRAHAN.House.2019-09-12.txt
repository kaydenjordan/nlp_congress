 Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of a tragic  anniversary that the residents of the Merrimack Valley will never  forget.   Tomorrow marks 1 year since a cascade of explosions in Lawrence,  Andover, and North Andover, Massachusetts, damaged over 130 homes and  businesses, burning several to the ground.   At least 20 people were sent to the hospital. A Lawrence police  officer, Ivan Soto, lost his home while aiding his community. Shakira  Figueroa was seriously injured, and a young man, Leonel Rondon, lost  his life.   An NTSB investigation revealed a series of failures by the gas  company as it replaced pipelines in the area. Oversights allowed the  full flow of high-pressure gas to enter a low-pressure distribution  system.   In April, I introduced the Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act to  prevent this type of disaster from ever happening again. We owe it to  the Sotos, the Figueroas, the Rondons, and the many other families who  suffered on September 13 to pass strong pipeline safety legislation  this year.                            ____________________
