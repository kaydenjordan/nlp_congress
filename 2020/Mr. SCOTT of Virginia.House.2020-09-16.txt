 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 2574, the Equity  and Inclusion Enforcement Act of 2019.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1107, I call up the bill (H.R. 2574) to amend title VI of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 to restore the right to individual civil actions in  cases involving disparate impact, and for other purposes, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Equity and Inclusion  Enforcement Act. This legislation will restore the right of students  and parents to address racial inequities in public schools.   This legislation comes over 66 years after the Supreme Court ruled in  1954, in the Brown v. Board of Education case, that in the field of  education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate  educational facilities are inherently unequal.   This comes just 4 years after the General Accountability Office found  that racial segregation in public schools is now as bad it was in the  1960s and getting worse.   For almost 40 years, the courts interpreted the Civil Rights Act of  1964, title VI, as granting students and parents the right to bring  discrimination claims against public schools and any other entities  receiving Federal funds for discriminatory policies and practices.   Victims of federally funded discrimination could use title VI to  challenge both discriminatory policies and practices that were created  with the intent to discriminate and policies and practices that, while  neutral on their face, had the effect of discrimination on the basis of  race, color, or national origin.   To be clear, the mere presence of the policy's disproportionate  impact does not alone constitute a violation of title VI, but allowing  communities to use disparate impact analysis equipped them with an  important tool to combat systemic inequities for decades.   Unfortunately, in its 2001 decision in the case of Alexander v.  Sandoval, the Supreme Court stripped private citizens, including  students and parents, of their right to bring disparate impact claims  against schools and other federally funded programs. While this ruling  did not invalidate the use of disparate impact analysis to prove  discrimination, it reserved that power to pursue such claims to the  Federal Government through administrative enforcement of  [[Page H4440]]  title VI. In other words, this longstanding protection against  discrimination in federally funded programs, including education, can  now only be enforced if the administration in power so chooses.   The effect of this ruling on antidiscrimination enforcement has been  particularly acute in education. Since 2001, we have seen an increase  in racial isolation in public schools and a decrease in resource  equity. As a result, African-American and Hispanic children  disproportionately attend schools that are both majority minority and  underresourced.   Whether this trend has been intentional or not is immaterial, but we  do know that discrimination in 2020 is not the same as it was in 1964.  Discrimination increasingly comes in the form of coded terminology,  structural inequality, and implicit bias rather than explicit bigotry.  So students and parents must be empowered to hold schools accountable  for policies and practices that deny students access to quality  education based on their race, color, or national origin whether or not  they can prove the discriminatory policies were intentionally imposed.   Understandably, parents and students have been expressing confusion  and frustration because they can no longer use the Civil Rights Act to  challenge discriminatory policies and practices in their schools.                                time  1030    By ceding this right to the Federal Government, the Supreme Court  majority in Sandoval opened the door to civil rights enforcement  becoming a political issue instead of a right. While the Office of  Civil Rights, the OCR, at the Department of Education is staffed with  career attorneys, it is led by a political appointee. This department  has repeatedly shown its reluctance to enforce and defend the civil  rights of all students.   Our core civil rights protections should not be up for a vote every 4  years. To that end, the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act would  restore the private right of action of students and parents to bring a  title VI discrimination claim based on disparate impact and hold  schools accountable for providing equal access to quality education for  all students.   The legislation also requires school districts and institutions of  higher learning to appoint a title VI monitor to ensure that at least  one employee is responsible for ensuring compliance with the law. This  includes, at a minimum, investigating complaints of discrimination  based on race, color, or national origin. This provision in the bill is  modeled after title IX officers in school settings. The legislation's  aim is for title VI monitors to foster a culture of compliance, similar  to what we now have under title IX.   Finally, the bill creates an assistant secretary in the Department of  Education to coordinate and promote title VI compliance. History has  shown that we cannot support historically disadvantaged students or  close persistent achievement gaps without robust civil rights  enforcement. This is particularly true as public schools become more  segregated, more segregated than they were in the 1960s and as the  COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates inequitable access to quality education  for underserved students.   Today, we have the opportunity to restore and strengthen critical  civil rights protections by passing the Equity and Inclusion  Enforcement Act.   Nearly seven decades after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in  Brown v. Board of Education which struck down school segregation, this  bill would bring us one step closer to delivering on its promise of  equity in education.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The gentlewoman is exactly right. This will have ramifications that  school districts will have to defend longstanding policies where they  have a clear, provable disparate impact against minority children but  the parents can't prove that it was imposed with discriminatory intent,  and this administration won't do anything about it until they are just  stuck.   Yes, if this bill passes, the parents will be able to come forth and  say that the Black children are stuck in woefully inadequate schools  while the White children are not. Yes, they should have to defend  themselves if  [[Page H4441]]  you can prove it. They ought to have their day in court. They can prove  that the policy is having a disparate impact on their children, and  according to the Sandoval decision they have to wait for this  Department of Education to do something about it.   On school choice, the recent studies have shown that when you don't  very carefully regulate it, you can actually have more school  segregation in school choice than you have now.   The question on achievement is mixed. There are some studies a few  years ago that said on average school choice produced results that were  average. More recent studies have shown that on average school choice  produces achievement numbers that are worse than average. So that is  not a road we should be going down. We should make sure that people, if  they prove discrimination, have their day in court.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the question of segregation of school choice is not  what the Democrats are saying; it is what the studies have shown, that  there is more likely to be segregation when you give people the choice.  That is why freedom of choice was thrown out by the Supreme Court as an  answer to Brown v. Board of Education many years ago.   You have Whites choosing the White schools, Blacks choosing the White  schools, social isolation taking place, and nature taking its course.  That is why you need the right to integrate the schools, and you can't  do it with school choice.   Madam Speaker, I think the question is clear. We have a lot of  schools where the distribution of resources is done clearly along  racial lines, and because you can't prove that it is with  discriminatory intent, you can't do anything about it. So that is why  you need the bill, and I would hope that we would pass the bill to let  those who can prove that they are being discriminated against have  their day in court.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I  have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to say a few words about what the U.S.  Commission on Civil Rights found, since the ranking member mentioned  the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, by name.   It found that the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has rescinded  critical guidance to protect students' civil rights, narrow the scope,  and reduced the number of investigations conducted, and decreased the  budget and staffing capacity of the Office of Civil Rights at the  department.   The Commission's report indicated that OCR issued 38 guidance  documents to improve program understanding of and compliance with civil  rights statutes under the Obama administration. By comparison, the OCR  under the Trump administration has issued few guidance documents and  has instead rescinded critical guidance documents.   Specifically, in 2018 Secretary DeVos rescinded guidance documents in  support of the constitutionally protected use of race in admission or  assignments to improve diversity and higher education and K-12.   Also, in 2018, Secretary DeVos rescinded 2014 school discipline  guidance packages, which provided local educational agencies with  technical assistance through reform, discipline policies, and practices  that, although racially neutral, disproportionately impacted students  of color in violation of title IV. And it goes on and on to talk about  what has been going on in this administration.   Madam Speaker, the ranking member talked about school segregation  yesterday. We had the opportunity to do something to help those  localities that wanted to voluntarily desegregate their schools. And it  was a bipartisan result--21 Republicans joined Democrats in providing  resources to localities that wanted technical assistance in how to  voluntarily desegregate their schools.   That can be complicated, because in the Supreme Court case involving  two localities, Louisville, Kentucky, and Seattle, Washington,  voluntary school desegregation initiatives were found unconstitutional.  The Court said you can do it, but in this case, you didn't do it right.  So technical assistance, legal advice, is necessary to make sure that  you can have an effective policy that can withstand constitutional  challenge.   Regrettably, 160 Republicans voted ``no'' to give those resources to  those localities that want to voluntarily desegregate their schools.   I mentioned the research on school choice. This is a very simple  bill. It just gives the right of those who can prove discriminatory  impact on their school systems--they can prove it, it just gives them  the right to come to court to prove that they have been discriminated  against to vindicate their rights.   It is a very simple bill, and I hope that the House will pass it so  their civil rights will be protected.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  motion.    Madam Speaker, anti-Semitism is religious  discrimination. As the motion reflects, religion is not covered by  title VI. It covers discrimination based on race, color, or national  origin. It doesn't cover religion.   While we are picking just one religious kind of discrimination, anti- Semitism, what about the other religions? Wouldn't they deserve  attention, too?   This is just a political attempt to insert religion into title VI.  That is controversial. Might get support for that, but that is not part  of this bill.   This motion just diverts attention from the core provision of the  bill, and that is to open the courts so that those who can prove  discrimination can have their day in court if their proof is based on  disparate impact.   Now, let's not divert attention away from that core idea that people  who have been discriminated against ought to be able to get into court.  Let's let them have their day in court. Defeat this motion and pass the  bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the instructions of  the House in the motion to recommit, I report the bill, H.R. 2574, back  to the House with an amendment.
