 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4279,  to name the post office in Laceyville, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania,  after Melinda Gene Piccotti.   A native of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, Mindy was an  Air Force veteran who knew the struggles of combat veterans and wounded  soldiers. She knew the struggles they faced when returning home from  duty.   Starting in 2009, at the age of 60, Mindy highlighted her commitment  to our Nation's Armed Forces by founding Hunts for Healing, based out  of Laceyville.  [[Page H833]]    Mindy founded Hunts for Healing to help wounded soldiers returning  from military missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other combat missions  transition back into civilian life, allowing them to experience the  joys of hunting, including social interaction and camaraderie.   With the assistance of volunteer guides and funded entirely by  private donations, Hunts for Healing helps veterans in need of  physical, spiritual, and emotional support. In Laceyville, to the  veterans she has helped and their families and loved ones, Mindy is  nothing short of a hero.   For the impact of her life and for her continued legacy to the  veterans' community, I urge members to support H.R. 4279 to name the  post office in Laceyville, Pennsylvania, for Melinda Gene Piccotti.                                time  1700
