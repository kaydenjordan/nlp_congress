 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  business leaders in support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. These  businesses range from Patagonia to Chobani to Mastercard to Johnson &  Johnson.                                                September 15, 2020.        Dear Members of Congress: Women's labor force participation       is critical to the strength of our companies, the growth of       our economy and the financial security of most modern       families. The private sector and our nation's elected leaders       must work together to ensure that working women and families       have the protections and opportunities they need to       participate fully and equally in the workplace. Twenty       leading companies from across states and industries have come       together in support of pregnant workers and their families by       calling on Congress to pass H.R. 2694, the bipartisan       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, without delay.        More than 40 years ago, Congress passed the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act of 1978, which made it illegal to       discriminate against most working people on the basis of       pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions. Since       that time, 30 states and the District of Columbia now require       certain employers to provide accommodations to pregnant       employees at work. It's now time to clarify and strengthen       existing federal protections for pregnant workers by passing       the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This bill would ensure       that pregnant workers who need reasonable accommodations can       receive them and continue to do their jobs.        As a business community, we strive to create more equitable       workplaces and better  [[Page H4517]]       support pregnant workers and their families every day. We       urge the passage of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act as an       important advancement toward ensuring the health, safety and       productivity of our modern workforce--and the workforce of       tomorrow.

Madam Speaker, as a former lawyer who worked long hours  during two pregnancies, it is outrageous to me that, in 2020, 100 years  after women finally secured the power to vote, current law does not  explicitly guarantee every pregnant worker the right to a reasonable  accommodation at work.   I had the luxury of a desk and chair and an office door that closed-- not all workers do.   Currently, in order to get an accommodation, a pregnant worker must  show that other nonpregnant employees are similarly accommodated. It is  beyond absurd. Because the challenges of pregnancy are so unique, it is  often difficult to find comparable nonpregnant workers who received  similar accommodations.   Fatigue, vomiting, back pain, and frequent urination are more than  just nuisances; these are symptoms that can make it impossible to work  without accommodation. And that is without mentioning the more serious  conditions related to pregnancy.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act secures for women basic rights to  earn a living without jeopardizing their health or the baby's.    Madam Speaker, it protects workers with known limitations  related to childbirth, because it is time that we recognize that mental  health conditions like postpartum depression are real and tangible  medical conditions.   Madam Speaker, I thank leadership, the ACLU, and the Chamber of  Commerce for endorsing this bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to this political poison pill of an MTR.   Corporations are a legal creation. They don't have religious beliefs.  Their officers might, but they do not.   Let's be clear about who inspired the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   It is women who have asked for accommodations in lifting requirements  because their doctors told them they were at high risk of miscarriage  or preterm birth.   It is women like the worker in Pennsylvania who was denied a schedule  change and fired due to cramping in her uterus that landed her in the  ER.   This MTR invites discrimination. It emboldens those who would use  religion as a basis to discriminate against people who are pregnant and  not married, workers in same-sex couples, women who used IVF to get  pregnant, even people with partners of a different race.   Something the proponents of this amendment aren't saying out loud is  that other religious exemptions would already apply to the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.   This MTR frustrates the purpose of a good bill, a bill that is  supported by the Chamber of Commerce and by 89 percent of voters.   Every year, an estimated quarter of a million women are denied  requests for an accommodation because current law forces pregnant  workers to find other nonpregnant employees who received similar  accommodations to make a case.   When pregnant women are denied accommodations, they face health  risks, miscarriage, premature births.   Symptoms and conditions of pregnancy cannot be fully appreciated  unless you have been pregnant yourself. So when you consider this vote  on the MTR, remember that 80 percent of directors of ACWI Index  companies are men. Men who have never experienced the struggles of  pregnancy will be deciding whether to invoke an exemption to deny an  accommodation to a pregnant worker. That is not right.   This bill is not some new burden on employers. They must already  engage in a good faith interactive process over reasonable  accommodations under the ADA.   This bill, as written, takes employer concerns into account.  Employers with fewer than 15 employees or those who would suffer undue  hardship need not provide accommodations.   Madam Speaker, I urge a resounding ``no'' vote on this MTR because it  dilutes the very protections for pregnant workers that the bill seeks  to establish. Those protections are long overdue.
