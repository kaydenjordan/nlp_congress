 Mr. President, it is Thursday afternoon, and it is one  of my favorite times in the Senate because it is the time I have the  opportunity to come down on the Senate floor to talk about an Alaskan  who is making a difference in their community or the State or maybe the  country, you know, sometimes maybe the world. And I think we have one  today. This is an individual we call our Alaskan of the Week.   I really enjoy doing this. It is just really a good opportunity to  recognize people who often don't get a lot of recognition.   You know, Alaska is known throughout the world for many things: our  physical beauty, the size of our State, giant mountains, great fishing,  great place to take a vacation. By the way, if you are watching at  home, come on up to Alaska. We would love to have you--summer, winter,  it doesn't matter.   All of these things, of course, about the State are true, but there  are so many other great things about our State. The No. 1 thing is our  people: strong, resilient, kind, tough American citizens--great people.   Nowhere is this spirit of the people of Alaska and their patriotism  more apparent than in our veterans across the State.   In Alaska, we have the highest number of veterans per capita of any  State in America, veterans and their families everywhere. Everyday  heroes, I like to call them.   It is amazing. In every city, village, community--it doesn't matter  how big, how small--you will find proud American veterans, many of them  working tirelessly together to make sure they help other veterans get  the support that they have earned, the care that they have earned, and  to support their families.   Today, as our Veterans Day approaches, I want to highlight one of  these heroes, one of these Alaska veterans whose service is so  inspiring that for those who are watching, I think you are going to  have a hard time actually believing it is true. This person, our  Alaskan of the Week, is 94-year-old Jim Schmidt--husband, grandfather,  great-grandfather, combat veteran, Alaskan, American hero.   Let me tell you about this incredible, remarkable story, for which  somebody should buy the movie rights right now.   While you are watching, you better go buy the movie rights of Mr.  Schmidt.   Jim was 14 years old in 1942. Of course, the United States had  already entered and was fighting in World War II. It wasn't going well  in 1942, by the way. He was living with his parents in the San  Francisco Bay area. Jim slipped out one day to see a movie. It was  called the ``Parachute Battalion.'' That was the name of the movie,  starring the beautiful Nancy Kelly. It was then, watching this movie,  right then and there, he said: I am going to enlist. I am going to  enlist in the Airborne.   Now, he was a big guy, a big young man--actually, he was a young  kid--200 pounds, 6 feet tall. A big kid, as I mentioned, but just  think, he was 14 years old. He went to the recruiter and said he was  18. He looked it.   The Army didn't ask for IDs back then, so off he went, assigned to  the 504th Infantry Regiment of the world-famous 82nd Airborne at the  tender age of 14.   His father was also in the Army, stationed at Fort Campbell, KY. And  when there was a little confusion about where Jim was, when he didn't  come home for days and weeks, his mother assumed he had gone to stay  with his dad. His dad assumed he was still with his mother. Wires got  crossed, and later his mom got a letter from Corporal Schmidt, CPL Jim  Schmidt, who was now 15. He wrote:         From somewhere in North Africa.    Actually, it was near Tunis, which had just fallen to the British and  General Patton, the American general, in  [[Page S7451]]  the battle against the Germans in North Africa.   He wrote his mom:         How are you [mom] and the girls?    He was referring to his sisters. He talked about the hot weather. He  sent her $30.   Fast forward a few months later. It is now July 9, 1943. Jim is  jumping out of an airplane onto the island of Sicily, a combat jump. In  Sicily, it was the largest airborne offensive in U.S. history--a  military airborne operation providing support for what was called  Operation Husky, more than 170,000 Allied troops that would descend  onto the island, drive the Axis powers--mostly the Germans--from the  island and open up the Mediterranean front of the European theater.  Combat operations, airborne operations, and Jim is 15.   Now, mistakes were made in this very big operation. Communications  were sporadic. Friendly fire happened, no doubt killing American  servicemembers--ferocious combat.   Some of these brave paratroopers--many were killed, many missed the  landing spot--were scattered all over the island.   When Corporal Schmidt, 15 years old, landed, he came under attack by  the Germans. He lost one of his best friends and mentors, fighting  together in a foxhole, hand-to-hand fighting. He engaged in combat,  killing the enemy. He remembers one young German, a messenger about his  age. He actually found the boy's wallet because he wanted to get in  touch with his family after the war to tell them how brave the young  German soldier was--tough stuff.    During the battle, he was wounded, but he continued to fight. But  because he was wounded, a telegraph was sent home by the Army to his  mom. And at that point, he and his battalion, which was part of the  504th Infantry Regiment, Airborne Regiment in Salerno, Italy, were  fighting to hold off a major German counterattack.   You can imagine Jim's mother was beside herself. Her 15-year-old son  was wounded in combat in Italy. So guess what she did. You can tell  what kind of stock Jim comes from. His mom wrote the President of the  United States directly, President Roosevelt.   She said to the President she was glad to have her husband serve in  the Army, but it was a bit much that her 15-year-old son was fighting  in Europe and ``lying wounded and unattended in a Sicily field.''   That is Jim's mom to President Roosevelt.   Remarkably, she received a response. The letter has since been lost,  but those who saw it said that President Roosevelt himself wrote Jim's  mom and said: I am sorry the military didn't know that Jim was only  15--14 when he joined--and that he would make sure he was located as  soon as possible and sent back to the United States. Sounds a little  bit like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the movie.   So that happened. Shortly before he turned 16, Corporal Schmidt was  put on a ship, pretty much at the direction of the President of the  United States, and sent back to the United States.   Jim later recalled that when his mom saw him, of course, she was  happy, but she ``chewed me out. What would any other mother say to  their son'' for enlisting at the age of 14 and not telling the mom?   A local newspaper heard about Jim and wrote a story. Here is what it  said:         Fifteen year old [then] Pfc James O. Schmidt . . . left his       desk in the Eighth Grade at Ross Grammar School . . . to       enter the Army, [he] has retired from active duty [at the age       of 15] after seeing action with the [Airborne unit and]       Paratroopers in [North] Africa and being wounded in the       Battle of Sicily.    He was 15.   The newspaper wrote about how Jim had received an invitation to his  own grammar school graduation when he was in Sicily.   He wrote back to his grammar school and said:         It will be impossible [for me to attend eighth grade       graduation] as I am rather busy with the job of hunting       Germans and Italians.    This alone makes a great story. Grade school graduation was missed  because he was fighting in Europe and North Africa and Italy. But there  is more to this story.   Shortly after being home, you guessed it, Jim walked into a Navy  recruiting office. Again, nobody in the Navy asked how old he was.   The recruiter said:         Congratulations. You're now in the U.S. Navy.    So off to boot camp he went at the age of 16, already a veteran, a  serious combat veteran--16 years old, unstoppable, American patriot,  wanting to fight for his country in World War II.   Six months later, Jim is on a Navy destroyer deployed. But his age  finally caught up with him. The Navy found out, figured out he was 16,  and sent him back home. Here is an Airborne combat veteran of World War  II, he is 16, and he has already been kicked out of the Army and the  Navy because he is too young.   Obviously, this young man was hell-bent on serving his country so he  found another organization where age didn't matter. He joined the  Merchant Marines, where he remained for the remainder of World War II,  serving on an ammo resupply ship in the Atlantic, participating in the  war until the war was won and wound down.   So the war is over. He is a little older. What do you think he does?  Eight months after he turned 18, he reenlisted in the U.S. Army.   Now, the Army was gracious and recognized: Hey, we got a combat vet.  Yeah, he was only 14. So they brought him in as a sergeant, a D5. And  guess what. By luck, he was assigned to occupation duty in Germany with  the 508th Infantry Airborne Regiment that he had fought with in North  Africa and Sicily.   So he did that duty; then he went to Japan for occupation duty. And  then what happened in 1950? The Korean war breaks out. So he is sent to  Korea.   As if his service in World War II wasn't enough, this remarkable  story of James Schmidt continues.   He went alongside the U.S. Marines to fight in one of the most  brutal, ferocious battles of the 20th century--the Battle of the Chosin  Reservoir. It was 30 below zero, 120 communists, People's Liberation  Chinese soldiers, surrounding 20,000 marines and the Army, soldiers and  marines.   It was incredible, horrible odds. And yet the Marines and the Army  persevered, despite brutal combat situations, relentless Chinese  communist troops attacking, attacking, attacking.   He was wounded, broke his shoulder again, led his men in many  counterattacks, and got the rest of his men out of the Chosin  Reservoir.   So, Mr. President, you are seeing that this is remarkable, but we are  not done.   He survived Chosin Reservoir. He survived the rest of the Korean war.  He survived World War II.   Fast-forward another decade, another American conflict in Southeast  Asia, and now Jim Schmidt is a master sergeant, Special Forces, in  Laos, charged with raising local forces to fight the communist Lao  guerillas.   Now he has been in combat in three wars, presented his third award, a  Combat Infantry Badge, for his actions in Laos. And, then, it was on to  Vietnam, where Jim was the sergeant major in charge of the 7th Special  Forces A-Teams and then the 5th Special Forces Group, one of the most  famous units of all of the Vietnam war--5th Special Forces, an airborne  unit--until he returned to Fort Bragg in 1965.   So here is what he has done so far for his country: two Silver Stars  for heroism, three Bronze Stars for heroism, two Purple Hearts.   He wanted back in the action, but the Army said: Nope. You are going  to go into recruiting.   According to one of his daughters, he was never much of a handshaker  and did not like the idea of riding a desk. So, despite the heroism,  despite the service, he opted to retire from the military, and then he  joined Air America, which was doing covert operations in Vietnam, until  1967, when he finally decided to settle down with his wife Peggy and  focus on another critically important task for our country: raising  three strong, wonderful, beautiful daughters.   Mr. President, that is something I can certainly relate to.   Now, I want to say that this is an amazing story. Unfortunately, Jim  was not always treated like the hero he was. During his Vietnam  service, his father died--the World War II veteran I mentioned  earlier--and so he rushed home through the San Francisco airport to  attend his father's funeral. And, unfortunately, he was in uniform  [[Page S7452]]  and, unfortunately, was jeered and booed by many in the airport.   Can you imagine that, America? Think about that. What a shameful  period for our Nation that so many failed to honor obvious American  heroes like Jim. But, fortunately, that didn't last long for our  country. But we should never forget that.   But I am digressing because he wasn't just an American hero in  uniform but, according to his daughters, a great father. He was engaged  in their activities--his three daughters--taught them to be determined,  independent, hard-working young women where the sky was the limit. He  didn't let them sleep in. That was the military dad, I am sure.   He and his wife Peggy, a registered nurse, came to Alaska in 1993 to  be close to one of their daughters, who is now a renowned chef-- actually, one of the best chefs in all of Alaska, and a lodge owner in  Alaska, Kirsten Dixon. His other daughter Katherine is now a successful  real estate broker, and his other daughter Jami lives in the DC area,  who is also working in the intelligence field, kind of like her old man  did. What a great legacy for Jim and Peggy and the whole family.   So Jim loves Alaska, the freedom in Alaska, the frontier spirit, the  fact that he is in a State with more veterans per capita than any  State. And he is certainly one of the great ones that we have in our  State.   At 94 years old, he is surrounded by his children, his grandchildren,  his great-grandchildren. According to his family, like most heroes in  our country, he doesn't talk much about the war--still really doesn't-- and his full story was only fully revealed when one of his  grandchildren, Henry, began to get interested and did a podcast about  his grandfather and shared it on social media--his amazing grandfather.  Since then, the letters have flooded in, people wanting to know about  this incredible American hero who missed his grade school graduation  because he was doing airborne operations in Sicily.   Just the other night he was on a Zoom with a 15-year-old because he  always has time for veterans, and he gives advice to young people who  are interested in serving in the military and hearing his story and  getting advice. Jim says that he doesn't believe the military is for  everybody, but if you have the calling, then you should follow the  calling, even if you are young--but, I would caution, not 14. But Jim  should know.   Mr. President, this is a remarkable American story, one for the  history books, and it is one of the reasons, many reasons, that so many  people in my State have served and sacrificed for their country-- everyday heroes we call them--in Alaska. There are heroes all around  us, and certainly Jim is one of the most important, one of the most  prominent, one of the most humble. We are proud to have him in our  State.   We thank him and his wife Peggy and his wonderful three daughters and  their whole family for sharing Jim with us, and we want to thank Jim  for his incredible tenacity, patriotism, remarkable service, and  example.   And, Jim, we want to thank you once again for being our Alaskan of  the Week. Happy Veterans Day to you and all the veterans back home in  Alaska.   I yield the floor.
