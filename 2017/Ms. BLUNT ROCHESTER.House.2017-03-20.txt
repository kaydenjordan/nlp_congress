 Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my  distinguished colleague from the State of New York (Ms. Meng), the  sponsor of this legislation.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 382, the 100 Years of Women in Congress  Act.   This bipartisan legislation will recognize the work that Jeannette  Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress in 1916, accomplished  fighting for women's rights. It will rename the USDA's Women and  Minorities in STEM Fields Program to the Jeannette Rankin Women and  Minorities in STEM Fields Grant Program. In our time, it is critical  that we encourage more women to enter STEM fields across this country.  In receiving a bachelor's degree in biology before women even had the  right to vote, she set an example for those who followed her to follow  their passions for science and to achieve impactful leadership roles.   As I travel through Delaware, one of the consistent messages that I  hear from businesses and universities is the need for more engineers.  We have a wealth of knowledge in our young girls who are demanding  rigorous programs that put them in place for rewarding careers. These  types of programs match the boundless enthusiasm with concrete steps  towards achieving meaningful career goals that benefit our entire  country.   My sister, Thea, demonstrates the impact of successful STEM education  from organizations like the Forum to Advance Minority Engineers--FAME-- for schoolchildren in Delaware, to her attending an HBCU as an  engineering major, and in her career spent serving our country as an  engineer with the Army.   My late husband Charles received undergraduate and graduate degrees  in mechanical and aerospace engineering. Those degrees gave him the  opportunity to travel the world as an engineer and give back to the  energy sector.   However, my family and I know that the answer doesn't simply end with  STEM. It is also about incorporating the arts into one's education in  the form of STEAM, where we can see the balance that a quality  education provides.   In my experiences, as the first woman elected to Congress from  Delaware, I understand the challenges that come with trying to break  through barriers. That is why this legislation and the impact of  getting more young women to pursue STEM and STEAM careers is so deeply  personal to me.  [[Page H2210]]    As Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin said before taking her oath of  office in 1917--nearly 4 years before women had even gained the right  to vote through the 19th Amendment--as you heard before, she said: ``I  may be the first woman to be a Member of Congress, but I won't be the  last.''   I am honored to serve as one of the more than 300 women to follow her  lead. When we look to history to guide us in challenging moments, we  will look to people like Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin, and I am  confident she would be honored to have her name associated with this  legislation and its aims.   I thank the sponsors, and I thank my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle for this bipartisan work.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge all Members as well to  support passage of H.R. 382, and I yield back the balance of my time.
