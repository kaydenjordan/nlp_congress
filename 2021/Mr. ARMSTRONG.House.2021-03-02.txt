 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle recognizing the unique nature of the State of North  Dakota.   In 1993, the Voter Registration Act passed and there were six States  that did not have voter registration. And so, rightfully so, under  thoughtful and considered language, they exempted the States who didn't  have voter registration from the Voter Registration Act.  [[Page H999]]    Well, now we are in 2021, and the only State in the country that  doesn't have voter registration is the State of North Dakota. So as  this process has been going on and the different fights that exists,  which I agree with my colleagues on this side of the aisle on a lot of  those issues, we find ourselves in a fairly unique position in that the  intent of what people are trying to do with this bill would have  actually made it more difficult in a lot of cases in North Dakota for  how we do things.   We are proud of our quirky board of elections system. I will just  tell you, when I served in the State legislature, I was the chair of  the State Senate Judiciary Committee, which was in charge of election  law. And North Dakotans are very proud of it. I also served as the  State party chair for 3 years, so I was very frustrated by the fact  that we didn't have voter registration. So even in my own background, I  had conflicting views on this.   Madam Speaker, I just appreciate the ability of everybody working  together because this is really important to my State, and it would  fundamentally alter things, and not in a good way.
