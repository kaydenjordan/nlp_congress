 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment to increase  funding for the Building Communities of Recovery program.   We all know that the opioid epidemic is a major health crisis that  has impacted every community and every congressional district. My home  State of Kentucky suffers from the fifth highest overdose mortality  rate in the country, and we learned from the CDC that last year 72,000  of our fellow citizens died of an opioid overdose. This is a national  crisis.   Last fall, Congress passed a historic package of legislation to  address the opioid epidemic to research treatment and prevention. The  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act builds upon past resources  authorized and  [[Page H4568]]  funded by Congress, including the 21st Century Cures Act and the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.   Additionally, Congress has appropriated $4 billion, the largest  Federal investment to date, to address the opioid epidemic, but there  is more work to be done. We cannot continue to focus our Federal  efforts on prevention and treatment without looking toward long-term  recovery through housing, job placement, financial literacy, and life  skills.   Not all recovery is the same. Everyone has a different recovery  journey, and we must not prioritize one pathway to recovery over  another. If there is one thing I have learned talking to folks who are  struggling through an addiction recovery is that what works for one  individual may not work for another.   I have heard from my constituents of the need for funding to be made  available for programs that provide alternatives to medication-assisted  treatment for opioid use disorder. Obviously, medication-assisted  treatment is considered evidence-based and the gold standard in many  cases for helping people to recovery, but there are alternatives, and  some individuals need a different course.   Currently, the Building Communities of Recovery program is one of the  only sources of funding for nonmedication for opioid-use disorder.                                time  2045    According to SAMHSA, non-MAT programs are ineligible for the State  Opioid Response Grants which constitute the majority of opioid funding.   My office has been told time and time again that the reason they  cannot receive funding is because they do not offer medication-assisted  treatment.   I would like to emphasize that I am not critical of medication- assisted treatment programs, but I do believe that non-narcotic  alternatives to recovery complement medication-assisted treatment for  certain individuals.   As we continue to combat this crisis, we must make critical,  nonmedication resources for recovery available to those who need them.  Treatment programs that choose to offer non-MAT recovery options are  doing incredible work despite their inability to access most Federal  grant programs that we enacted last year.   I would like to highlight the story of Zachary Thomas, my  constituent, and a prime example of someone who successfully worked  through addiction to recovery. At the age of 18, Zach dropped out of  Mercer County Senior High School just 4 months before graduation. He  was hooked on methamphetamines, heroin, and alcohol and was homeless.   At age 19, Zach was in the Boyle County Detention Center on drug  charges. Upon recommendation of the county attorney, Zach was sent to  the Shepherd's House, a recovery residence in Lexington, Kentucky, that  provides transitional residential treatment for men 18 years and older.   Shepherd's House has been providing treatment for clients who suffer  from drug and alcohol issues for the past 30 years. It offers  structured programs that promote personal responsibility and  accountability for those seeking sustained abstinence from mood and  mind-altering substances.   Zach now works at DV8 Kitchen, a Lexington restaurant owned by Rob  and Diane Perez that has a practice of hiring employees in recovery  from drug and alcohol addictions.   Zach's success is just one example of the great work of the people at  the Shepherd's House and the great work that these nonmedication- assisted treatment recovery programs are doing to combat this crisis.   The Shepherd's House's desire is to live in the solution of recovery,  to make a positive economic impact on the communities we serve, and to  one day put a small dent in the national crisis that we know as  addiction.   Another example I would like to highlight is my good friend, Jenell  Brewer, in Powell County, Kentucky, the SPARK program. It is an  advocacy center that helps families navigate addiction, educates them  on addiction, and connects them with recovery resources in the State.  At a time when many families don't know what to do, SPARK offers a  personal approach and an outlet for those coping with this crisis.   But these great organizations, SPARK and the Shepherd's House, are  not eligible for many of the Federal grant programs that we have  funded. And so this amendment would simply provide increased funding  for that program, the Building Communities of Recovery program that  would provide funding for these alternatives that are desperately  needed.   I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Arkansas, for his leadership on this very important issue, providing  employers with flexibility.   Yes, we want to support Department of Labor-registered  apprenticeships, but we need employers to be able to fill these job  openings with skilled workers using apprenticeships that are actually  tailored for the jobs that are available.   When I visit the employers in central and eastern Kentucky, they all  tell me the same story: Because of tax cuts and deregulation, the  economy is booming, they are creating jobs, but they can't find  workers.   There is a labor supply shortage in this country, and we need more  skills. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that labor force  participation among prime-age men has dropped from 86 percent in 1950  to a rate currently of 71.5 percent.   We have got to get that labor participation rate up, and, because of  that, we need skills. That is why I am proud, as chairman of the  Republican Study Committee's American Worker Task Force, to support the  Hill amendment, which would allow Federal grant funds to be used for  apprenticeship programs that are not just DOL-registered.    Madam Chair, not just DOL-registered programs, but also  apprenticeship programs tailored by the employers for those particular  jobs.   So, while the economy does need to utilize these DOL-registered  apprenticeship programs, a one-size-fits-all solution is not the  answer. Many employers need specific, tailored apprenticeship programs,  and I urge support for the gentleman's amendment.
