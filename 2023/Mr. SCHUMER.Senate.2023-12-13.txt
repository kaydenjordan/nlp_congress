 Mr. President, negotiations continue today between  Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration on an emergency  national security supplemental package. The stakes are high, and time  is of the essence.   Democrats are still trying--still trying--to meet our Republican  colleagues in the middle and reach an agreement. Negotiators met  yesterday afternoon. It was a productive meeting. Real progress was  made. But, of course, there is still a lot of work to do. We will keep  working today to get closer to an agreement.   The two words I have used to describe each party here in the Senate  continue to be relevant. Democrats are still trying to reach an  agreement. Republicans need to show they are still serious about  getting something done--Democrats trying, Republicans need to be  serious.   Unfortunately, too many Republicans now seem more interested about  flying home for the holidays than sticking around to finish the job.  For months, Republicans insisted that action on the border is a crisis  that can't wait. But with the holidays around the corner, they are  suddenly saying: Never mind, this can wait until next year. If  Republicans say the border is an emergency, then they should be  prepared to stay.   Crying fire about the border one minute and then saying we should go  home the next is the definition of  [[Page S5928]]  ``unserious.'' An emergency is an emergency. If you argue there is an  emergency at the border, an emergency in Ukraine, you can't pretend to  be serious about solving them if you think we should go home.   Now, months ago, the Biden administration put forward a comprehensive  plan to tackle border security. For weeks, we implored our Republican  colleagues to get serious and offer a credible bipartisan proposal--not  Donald Trump's extreme border policies, as contained in H.R. 2. Weeks  were wasted. And now here we are: Progress is being made, but progress  must be allowed to be continued. Yes, this is difficult--very  difficult. But we are sent here to do difficult things.   If Republicans are serious about getting something done on the  border, why are so many in a hurry to leave? Do they not want to reach  an agreement on border security? Republicans should not be so eager to  go home.   I hope we can reach an agreement very soon to pass a supplemental  through the Senate because the only people happy right now about the  gridlock in Congress are Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Putin is  delighting in the fact that Donald Trump's border policies are  sabotaging military aid to Ukraine.   Republicans should not be so content to throw their hands in the air  and kick the can down the road. Our friends in Ukraine, after all, are  not on our timeline. They don't get a Christmas break on the  battlefield. Their fight against Vladimir Putin is a matter of life and  death. And if Putin prevails, it will come back to haunt the United  States and the whole Western World in the very near future.   So if my Republican friends care at all about taking a stand against  Russian autocrats, they should get serious about reaching an agreement.   If Republicans care about defending democracy, about protecting  freedom, and preserving America's values around the world, they should  get serious about reaching an agreement.   If Republicans truly think the border is an emergency and if they  truly support the cause of the Ukrainian people as they claim, then  they should get serious about reaching an agreement very soon.   We are writing a chapter in history this week. Will Republican  obstruction hand a Democratic country over to the forces of autocracy?  Will autocrats see America's inaction as a green light to keep going?  Will places like Taiwan come next? Or will we do what America has done  again and again and again throughout America's glorious history and  stand with our Democratic friends in need? Will we do what is necessary  to keep the democratic order the United States helped create after the  Second World War? These are the stakes.   Senate Democrats have made clear which side of history we want to be  on. We want to stand with President Zelenskyy and the brave people of  Ukraine. We want to stand for democratic order. We hope--we hope--our  Republican colleagues are ready to do the same.                      National Defense Authorization Act    Mr. President, NDAA, as soon as later today, the Senate will approve  our annual National Defense Authorization Act, one of the most  important bills we pass each year to protect the American people and  ensure our long-term security.   Last night, Senators overwhelmingly voted to end debate on the NDAA  by 85 to 15. That is a strong sign of support, and it shows you the  momentum for finishing the NDAA quickly. We will work today to reach a  time agreement with Republicans to finish the job on the NDAA as soon  as today.    At a time of huge trouble for global security, doing the Defense  authorization bill is more important than ever. Passing the NDAA  enables us to hold the line against Russia, stand firm against the  Chinese Communist Party, and ensure that America's defenses remain  state of the art at all times.   Now, the NDAA process here in the Senate is precisely the kind of  bipartisan cooperation the American people want from Congress.   When this bill came before the Senate in July, we had a robust debate  and amendment process. We voted on dozens of amendments on the floor  and even included more in our manager's package. Both sides had input.  Both sides had a chance to shape the bill. And in the end, the Senate's  version of the NDAA passed in an overwhelming 86-to-11 vote, with  majorities--significant majorities--from both parties.   And after a lot of hard work reconciling the Senate's NDAA with the  House's version through the conference process, I am pleased the final  version of the NDAA has many of the strongest provisions of the  Senate's original bill.   We will give our servicemembers the pay raise they deserve; we will  strengthen our resources in the Indo-Pacific to deter aggression by the  Chinese government and give critical resources for training, advising,  and capacity-building for the military and Taiwan; and we will approve  President Biden's trilateral U.S., UK, and Australia nuclear submarine  agreement. This historic agreement will create a new fleet of nuclear- powered submarines to counter the Chinese Communist Party's influence  in the Pacific.   I applaud my colleague Senator Reed of the Armed Services Committee  as well as Ranking Member Wicker for their excellent leadership pushing  this bill over the finish line. I commend all conferees for their good  work over the past few weeks.   And thank you to my colleagues on both sides for uniting to get the  NDAA done. When we finish our work in the Senate, I urge Speaker  Johnson and the House to move this bill quickly.   As I have said repeatedly, we began the month of December with three  major goals here in the Senate before the end of the year: First, we  had to end the unprecedented and monthslong destructive blockade of  hundreds of military nominees. We have done that. Second, we needed to  pass the NDAA, as we have for decades on a bipartisan basis. We are  going forward on that today. And, finally--and hardest of all--we must  reach an agreement on a national security supplement.   Democrats are still trying to reach an agreement on the supplemental.  We urge Republicans to show that they are still serious about getting  something done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I see my friend Senator Rounds is on the  floor and ask him to engage in a colloquy on an important set of  provisions in the NDAA that deals with transparency, trust, and  government oversight--the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure  Act that he and I co-sponsored, and portions of which we will pass in  the NDAA.   I say to my friend that unidentified anomalous phenomena are of  immense interest and curiosity to the American people, but with that  curiosity comes the risk of confusion, disinformation, and mistrust,  especially if the government isn't prepared to be transparent.   The U.S. Government has gathered a great deal of information about  UAPs over many decades but has refused to share it with the American  people. That is wrong, and, additionally, it breeds mistrust.   We have also been notified by multiple credible sources that  information on UAPs has also been withheld from Congress, which, if  true, is a violation of the laws requiring full notification to the  legislative branch, especially as it relates to the four congressional  leaders, Defense Committees, and the Intelligence Committee.   So the bill I worked on with Senator Rounds offers a commonsense  solution. Let's increase transparency on UAPs by using a model that  works, by following what the Federal Government did 30 years ago with  the J.F.K. Assassination Records Collection Act. They established a  Presidentially appointed board to review and release these records, and  it was a huge success. We should do the same here with UAPs.   I will yield to the Senator from South Dakota.    Now, I say to my colleague from South Dakota, who has  worked with his great team on this issue--and on many other issues, I  might add--that it is beyond disappointing that the House refused to  work with us on all of the important elements of the UAP Disclosure Act  during the NDAA conference.   But, nevertheless, we did make important progress. For the first  time, the National Archives will gather records from across the Federal  Government on UAPs and have a legal mandate to release those records to  the public, if appropriate. This is a major, major win for government  transparency on UAPs, and it gives us a strong foundation for more  action in the future.    Well, I would like to echo what my friend Senator Rounds  has said today and on many occasions. It is essential that we keep  working on the proposal to create an independent, Presidentially  appointed review board that can oversee UAP classified records and  create a system for releasing them, where appropriate, to the public.  Again, as the Senator has said, it is the same method used for the  J.F.K. records, and it continues to work to this very day.   It is really an outrage that the House didn't work with us on  adopting our  [[Page S5931]]  proposal for a review board, which, by definition, needs bipartisan  consent. Now it means that declassification of UAP records will be  largely up to the same entities that blocked and obfuscated their  disclosure for decades.   We will keep working. I want to assure the American people that  Senator Rounds and I will keep working to change the status quo.   Before I yield finally to him, I would just like to acknowledge my  dear friend, the late Harry Reid, a mentor, who cared about this issue  a great deal. So he is looking down and smiling on us, but he is also  importuning us to get the rest of this done, which we will do  everything we can to make it happen.     Again, I thank my colleague and pledge to work with him  and other bipartisan colleagues in the future to build upon what we  have achieved in the conference report. We encourage our colleagues to  join us in the further investigation of this issue and in advancing  legislation that will complete what we have accomplished in this NDAA.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m.,  Senator Paul or his designee be recognized to make a rule XXVIII scope  point of order; that, if raised, Senator Reed be recognized to make a  motion to waive; and that if the waiver is successful, all postcloture  time be considered expired and the Senate vote on the adoption of the  conference report; finally, that there be 2 minutes equally divided  before each vote.    Mr. President, for the 62nd year in a row, the Senate is  passing our annual Defense Authorization Act--one of the most important  bills we work on each year to protect the American people and ensure  our long-term security.   At a time of huge trouble for global security, passing the Defense  authorization bill is more important than ever. It will ensure America  can hold the line against Russia, stand firm against the Chinese  Communist Party, and ensures that America's military remains state of  the art at all times all around the world.   I thank my colleagues on both sides for their great work on the NDAA.  I applaud the leadership of Chairman Reed--steady, steadfast, always  getting it done--chairman of the committee, as well as the great  cooperation he had from Ranking Member Wicker and all the members of  the committee. I commend them for their good work.   Thanks to the good work on both sides, the final version of the NDAA  contains many of the most important bipartisan provisions we had in the  Senate's original bill.   We will give our servicemembers the pay raise they deserve. We will  strengthen our resources in the Indo-Pacific to deter aggression by the  Chinese Government and give resources for the military in Taiwan. We  will give DOD more resources to deploy and develop AI, protect against  foreign cyber threats, and increase transparency on unidentified aerial  phenomena, which I was proud to work on with Senator Rounds.   Critically, we will approve President Biden's trilateral United  States, UK, and Australia nuclear submarine agreement. The AUKUS  agreement is a game changer. It will create a new fleet of nuclear- powered submarines to counter the Chinese Communist Party's threat and  influence in the Pacific.   I want to commend all the staff who made this possible: Liz King,  Jody Bennett, Kirk McConnell, Damian Murphy, Andrew Keller, David  Weinberg, Chris Mulkins, and so on. I also want to thank the floor  staff and the legislative staff that worked so long and hard to get it  done. And, of course, everyone knows I love my staff: Yazeed Abdelhaq,  Gunnar Haberl, Raymond O'Mara, Mike Kuiken, Meghan Taira, and so many  others. The staff has put in long hours, and all 100 Senators thank  them.   As I have repeatedly said, we began the month of December with three  major goals here in the Senate before the end of the year. First, we  had to end the blockade of the hundreds of military nominees. We have  done that. Second, we needed to pass the NDAA. We are doing that now.  And, finally, hardest of all, we must reach an agreement on a national  security supplemental. We are trying.   Democrats are still trying to reach that agreement. We had very  productive talks with our Republican colleagues today; but, of course,  we have a lot of work to do left. We are going to keep working.   I yield the floor.

There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills  en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendments, where applicable, be agreed to; that the bills,  as amended, if amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table, all en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, S. Res. 499, S. Res. 500, S. Res. 501, S. Res. 502.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Madam President, these resolutions concern requests for  evidence in two criminal actions pending in Federal district courts,  one in the District of Columbia and the other in the Southern District  of Texas. Trials in both matters are expected to commence on January 8,  2024.   In the first case, pending in Federal district court in the District  of Columbia, the defendant is charged with multiple counts arising out  of the events of January 6, 2021. In this case, brought against Anthony  Antonio, the prosecution has requested testimony from Daniel Schwager,  formerly counsel to the Secretary of the Senate, concerning his  knowledge and observations of the process and constitutional and legal  bases for Congress' counting of the Electoral College votes. Senate  Secretary Berry would like to cooperate with this request by providing  relevant testimony in this trial from Mr. Schwager.   In the second case, pending in Federal district court in the Southern  District of Texas, the defendant is charged with threatening to injure  and murder Senator Ted Cruz in a voicemail he left with the Senator's  Houston, TX office. In this case, brought against Isaac Ambe  Nformangum, the prosecution has requested testimony from Amy English,  the Senator's staff assistant, and Grant Murray, the Senator's special  operations adviser, who witnessed the relevant events. The prosecution  has further requested trial testimony from Anthony Rodregous, Senator  Cruz's counsel, who has knowledge of the Senator's official duties and  position on the 1965 Civil Rights Act, which formed the basis of the  defendant's threat. Senator Cruz would like to cooperate with these  requests by providing relevant employee testimony from his office.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, the enclosed  resolutions would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Mr. Schwager, Ms. English, and Messrs. Murray and Rodregous, with  representation by the Senate legal counsel.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Thursday, December 14; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Edwards nomination; further, that if any  nominations are confirmed during Thursday's session, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:44 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, December 14, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
