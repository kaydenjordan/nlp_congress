 Mr. Speaker, a tree is known by its fruits.  Every policy that Biden and the Democrats have created is demonstrably  an America last policy.   They call it Build Back Better, but the truth is, their agenda is  Americans last, build back broke policies.   Americans are facing an extreme economic crisis as a result of  Democrat policies that President Biden and Speaker Pelosi have put into  place.   Skyrocketing prices at the store and the pump are causing Americans  pain in their pocketbook. Biden's outrageous budget is fuel on the  inflation fire.   President Biden and the Democrats in the House are deliberately  bankrupting Americans and taking away their economic opportunities.  What are we leaving behind for our children and grandchildren?   Americans cannot afford the America last policies the Democrats have  created that have made crisis upon crisis.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mann for  hosting this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, at the conclusion of National Agriculture Month, I would  like to share how strongly I believe in the family farm as part of the  American way of life. It has truly been a blessing to have our sons-- who are the 4th generation--and their children--the 5th generation-- working our land.   I am proud to be an Illinois farmer and to represent the farmers'  needs in  [[Page H4066]]  Congress and on the Ag Committee. If Americans are hungry, really, what  else matters?   The agriculture industry keeps Americans and the world fed, fueled,  and clothed. I am so thankful for the work that the ag industry does  and for their contributions to the GDP and Illinois and across our  Nation.   America is on a dangerous path, losing our self-sufficiency in  farming, which is why I introduced a bill in Congress to prevent China  from buying up our farmland. Biden and the Democrats continue to push  policies that promote Chinese-made batteries and solar panels instead  of American biofuels.   National Agriculture Month is a great time to thank our farmers,  ranchers, and agriculture professionals for their tireless work.
