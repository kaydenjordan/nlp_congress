 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 2513 and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2513, the Corporate  Transparency Act of 2019, a bill introduced by Representative Carolyn  B. Maloney of New York.   H.R. 2513 closes significant loopholes in the law that are commonly  abused by bad actors and will make it harder for terrorists,  traffickers, corrupt officials, and other criminals to hide, launder,  move, and use their money.   Today, anyone can create a company without providing any information  about the company's actual owners. This ability to remain anonymous  gives criminals and terrorists unimpeded, hidden access to our banking  and commercial systems.   It also makes it more difficult for law enforcement and even our  banks, which have a duty to know their customers and evaluate risk, to  detect illicit activity.   For example, unbeknownst to authorities for years, the skyscraper at  650 Fifth Avenue in New York City was owned by Iranian-controlled  entities through shell companies. The Corporate Transparency Act closes  these loopholes by requiring firms which do not already report  ownership, for example through public SEC filings, to share this  information with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN.   This beneficial ownership database created by the bill will be  accessible only by FinCEN-approved law enforcement agencies and by  financial institutions, with customer consent, to fulfill requirements  to identify their beneficial owners. Unapproved sharing of this  information would be subject to criminal penalties, as would lying on  or intentional omission of beneficial ownership information. For most  firms, which have only one or two owners, this process would require  only a few lines of data. But for law enforcement agencies, the  additional information will have great benefit, as their investigations  will no longer be stymied by anonymous shell companies.   The bill has also been broadened to include the entirety of H.R.  2514, the Coordinating Oversight, Upgrading and Innovating Technology,  and Examiner Reform Act of 2019, the COUNTER Act, a bill introduced by  Representative Emanuel Cleaver. The COUNTER Act closes loopholes in the  Bank Secrecy Act, the key law aimed at countering money laundering,  terrorist financing, and other criminal uses of the banking system.                                time  1400    For example, the bill requires the identification of owners behind  high-risk commercial real estate transactions and transactions  involving arts and antiquities, which are often used by criminals to  launder money.   The COUNTER Act examines Chinese and Russian money laundering, an  issue that is seen in opioid and methamphetamine production, as well as  human and wildlife trafficking.   The bill also creates a national strategy to fight trade-based money  laundering, which is considered the most pernicious but hard-to-detect  form of money laundering.   Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Cleaver's bill also works to lower the  compliance burden on financial institutions, most of which are  community banks, by establishing several tools to allow for more  targeted sharing of BSA-AML-related information.   The bill makes modest increases to the currency transaction reporting  limit and studies ways to reduce the costs associated with researching  and writing suspicious activity reports.   The bill also creates a new privacy and civil liberties officer, as  well as an innovation officer in each of the Federal financial  regulators.   Importantly, the bill imposes new penalties on financial institutions  and personnel that violate the law and creates a whistleblower program  to encourage and protect those who identify such bad acts.   H.R. 2513, as amended, has the strong support of financial  institutions. It is also supported by NGOs like the AFL-CIO, Global  Witness, Oxfam America, Friends of the Earth U.S., Jubilee USA Network,  and the Small Business Majority, all of which are members of the  transparency-focused FACT Coalition. It is widely supported by law  enforcement organizations such as the Fraternal Order of Police, the  National District Attorneys Association, and the Federal Law  Enforcement Officers Association. In addition, this legislation is  supported by the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation.   I commend Congresswoman Maloney and Congressman Cleaver for their  very hard work on the legislation, as well as their collaboration to  put together a comprehensive bill to reform how this country fights  against illicit finance.   I urge passage of H.R. 2513, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the sponsor of the bill and chair of  the Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital  Markets.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster), who is the chair on the Task Force on Artificial  Intelligence.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Cleaver), who is the sponsor of the COUNTER Act which is  part of this bill. He is also the chair of the Subcommittee on National  Security, International Development and Monetary Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Lawson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, the United States is vulnerable. According to a 2017  report by the Government Accountability Office, ``GAO was unable to  identify ownership information for about one-third of GSA's 1,406 high- security leases as of March 2016 because ownership information was not  readily available for all buildings.''   This finding was a leading factor in Congress voting to adopt a  provision in the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act  for the Department of Defense to collect beneficial ownership  information for all high-security office space it leases.   As a matter of fact, there is more information required to obtain a  library card. According to a 2019 Global Financial Integrity analysis,  ``The Library Card Project: The Ease of Forming Anonymous Companies in  the United States,'' in all 50 States and the District of Columbia,  ``more personal information is needed to obtain a library card than to  establish a legal entity that can be used to facilitate tax evasion,  money laundering, fraud, and corruption.''   The British model: The United Kingdom has a beneficial ownership  directory, and an analysis found that the average number of owners per  business in the U.K. is 1.13. Eighty-eight percent had two or fewer  owners. The most common number of owners is one. More than 99 percent  of businesses listed less than six owners.   According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, approximately 78  percent of all businesses in the U.S. are nonemployer firms, meaning  there is only one person in the enterprise. This suggests that the  experience in the U.S. would be similar to that in the U.K.   Mr. Chair, I would like to share with you that this legislation has  tremendous support, for example, from Main Street Alliance, a network  of over 30,000 small businesses; American Bankers Association; Bank  Policy Institute; Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America; National Foreign  Trade Council; Consumer Bankers Association; Financial Services Forum;  Bankers Association for Finance and Trade; American Land Title  Association; National Association of Realtors; One; FACT Coalition, a  collection of 100-plus NGOs, including AFL-CIO, Global Witness, Oxfam  America, Friends of the Earth U.S., Jubilee USA Network, Public  Citizen, and Small Business Majority.   We could go on and on and on, but I think it is important to know  that members of the Financial Services Committee, Representatives  Maloney, Luetkemeyer, and Cleaver, have worked in good faith, along  with the Department of the Treasury, nonprofit groups, and the  financial services sector, to find consensus to close a massive  loophole in our anti-money laundering framework.   The resulting pieces of legislation to modernize the anti-money  laundering processes and to create a secure financial ownership  registry of legal entities held at the Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network at the Department of the Treasury represent the best path  forward to provide law enforcement with needed information to pursue  money criminals looking to exploit our financial system.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) sponsor of the legislation, H.R. 2513.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire as to how much time  I have left.    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Representatives Maloney  and Cleaver for their work on these reforms.   I would like to just add that H.R. 2513 is an important, commonsense  measure that stops criminals from being able to hide behind anonymous  shell companies. It closes loopholes in the Bank Secrecy Act, increases  penalties for those who break the law, and helps provide financial  institutions with new tools to more easily and accurately fulfill their  obligations under the law.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the Burgess amendment would require an  annual report to Congress that examines the aggregated submissions to  the beneficial ownership database, thus providing a snapshot of the  size, type, and location of reporting entities.   I agree that an examination of this data will be helpful to FinCEN as  it contemplates rulemakings and to Congress should we consider future  refinements of the law. So I would encourage Members to support the  amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the sponsor of  this important legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not oppose.    Mr. Chairman, the Hill amendment requires FinCEN to  develop protocols governing how law enforcement and others can access  the beneficial ownership database.   Today, in order for law enforcement to access FinCEN's Bank Secrecy  Act database, they must comply with a stringent process requiring  assessment, training, and review.   H.R. 2513 also includes protocols governing access to the new  beneficial ownership database, including creating an audit trail of the  law enforcement agencies that access the data.   Mr. Hill's amendment would provide an added measure of protection,  reinforcing the importance of clear procedures to ensure that such  information is not inappropriately accessed or misused by law  enforcement agencies. I will vote in support of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the sponsor of  this important legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I firmly oppose the Davidson amendment because  it would gut the bill.   After years of working to ensure that criminals, terrorists, and  enemies of the United States can no longer use loopholes to cloak their  dangerous acts from law enforcement, this amendment heedlessly tries to  jettison this significant layer of defense.   If the amendment is adopted, there would be no requirement to share  the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations and LLCs that  currently do not make such disclosures.   If adopted, there would be no ability for law enforcement to get  information that it needs to unmask the wrongdoers who abuse State laws  to hide their global criminal activities.   To make things worse, the amendment would repeal the FinCEN customer  due diligence, or CDD, rule, which currently requires banks to identify  and verify the beneficial ownership of corporate customers. It prevents  criminals, kleptocrats, and others looking to hide ill-gotten proceeds  from accessing the financial system anonymously.   The Director of FinCEN said that the CDD rule is ``but one critical  step toward closing this national security gap. The second critical  step . . . is collecting beneficial ownership information at the  corporate formation stage.''   An outright and immediate repeal of this rule endangers the financial  system by leaving a dangerous new gap in information about bank  customers while the implementation of H.R. 2513 gears up.   The safer approach, and one supported by the financial institutions,  is to require the Treasury to remove identified redundancies after the  database becomes operational. This is precisely what H.R. 2513 already  does.   Mr. Chairman, the AFL-CIO, Oxfam, the FACT Coalition, FBI, Treasury,  DOJ, FinCEN, as well as the Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law  Enforcement Officers Association, and most State attorneys general have  urged Congress to pass H.R. 2513 to develop a Federal beneficial  ownership database.   The Davidson amendment would undermine this effort before it can  begin.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the sponsor of  this important legislation.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Pappas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cuellar, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2513) to  ensure that persons who form corporations or limited liability  companies in the United States disclose the beneficial owners of those  corporations or limited liability companies, in order to prevent  wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations and limited  liability companies for criminal gain, to assist law enforcement in  detecting, preventing, and punishing terrorism, money laundering, and  other misconduct involving United States corporations and limited  liability companies, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________
