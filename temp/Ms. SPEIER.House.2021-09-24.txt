 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I thank Judy Chu  for their leadership.   Madam Speaker, 10 years ago on this floor, I spoke about a second- term abortion that I had. It was painful. It was hard. But I did  because so many on the other side of the aisle that day knew nothing  about what women endure. We are not vessels for a man to inject their  sperm into and then walk away with no consequences.   This is my body, not yours. Many on the other side of the aisle whine  about the freedom that they have lost by having to wear masks, yet you  want to take my freedom to control my body away from me.   You have not carried a fetus in your body. You have not had a fetus  die in your body. You have not had to mourn the loss. You stand there  preaching birth but not life.   This is my body. This is my life. This is my freedom.
