 Madam Speaker, I want to take one second to  congratulate Jake Ellzey on his election to Congress.   It brought two people back together.  Mike Garcia and Jake actually  served our Nation earlier, before he served in this body. He flew F-18s  off an aircraft carrier into Iraq. They were brothers, and now they are  back together again, serving their Nation and putting it forth.   It might be a little ironic that they both came in in a special  election. They both were turning points on those elections and, I would  say, underdogs in those elections. But it shows they both graduated  from the Naval Academy, served their Nation, and continue to serve  again. This is a good day in this House.   Madam Speaker, 1 week ago, President Biden said inflation was  temporary. He went on to say that spending trillions more would  ``reduce inflation, reduce inflation, reduce inflation.'' I think he is  the only one who believes that.   I say to the President, with all due respect, we need to wake up.  Inflation has risen every single month since he took office, and last  month was the largest increase in 13 years.   Now, let's be very clear. Inflation is a tax on every single  American. Everyone who is buying groceries knows it. Everyone who is  filling up their car knows it. Everyone who is booking a summer flight  knows it.   Yet, President Biden told a townhall in Ohio last week: ``I don't  know anybody . . . who is worried about inflation.''   Madam Speaker, the only people I could imagine who are not worried  about inflation make $5 million in a couple of months trading stock  options or sell paintings for half a million dollars.   Why doesn't the President of the United States know what is going on?  This is what Americans hate about Washington. They turn on their TV and  hear the President telling them their concerns aren't real.   Enough is enough. People are fed up with the ignorance and arrogance  and hypocrisy.   Madam Speaker, President Biden needs to get a clue about inflation  before it is too late. And it is not just Republicans who have been  warning the Democrats if they pass the bill it would bring inflation,  and here it is. It was Democrats who served in the Obama administration  and Clinton administration, who warned them if they spend more  trillions, inflation will come. And it has come every single month. And  what is their answer for the future? More trillions. They will probably  even try to call us back in August to make sure inflation grows a  little more.   And, if that is not enough, just yesterday, we missed every  indication and every prediction for growth in America. Americans can't  take this much longer. November can't come sooner.   Inflation is a tax on every single American. But for those who don't  know it, spend a little time with the real America and you will realize  it.                            ____________________
