 Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not only about being  against a Soviet-style regime and the quotas and a variety of other  things that come with it, but this amendment is, hopefully, about  common sense.   The one thing we don't want to subsidize are the things that cause us  problems. We are now spending more than a quarter of a trillion dollars  in healthcare costs as type 2 diabetes has ballooned. To give you the  exact number, $327 billion a year is spent on type 2 diabetes.   So the idea of saying let's subsidize our sugar so that we can then  spend more on healthcare is something that needs to be looked at.
