 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the impeachment  of President Donald Trump. The gravity of the moment demands it, and  the fate of our Republic depends on it.   He committed an impeachable offense by inciting a violent and deadly  insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. For this, Congress must hold him  accountable to preserve our democracy, our Constitution, and the rule  of law.   He should serve not 1 minute more and be barred forever from public  office. He is toxic to our Republic and toxic to our democracy.
