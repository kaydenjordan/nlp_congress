 First, I have a message for the information of the  Senate.   I understand there is an important meeting at the White House this  morning that several Members are attending. So in order to accommodate  them, the first vote will start at 10:45 a.m., not at 11 a.m., and we  are going to have to move quickly on that vote so people can get their  votes done and get to the White House.   So, Members, please take notice.                            ____________________     Madam President, before we reach the conclusion of the  June work period, the Senate will confirm yet another one of President  Biden's highly qualified nominees to the Federal Bench: Candace  Jackson-Akiwumi to serve on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.   A graduate of Princeton and Yale Law School, Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi left  a career at a big law firm to work for 10 years as a Federal defender  in Illinois. She was a voice in the courtroom for Americans who often  had no one else to speak for them: the mentally ill, folks who could  not afford an attorney.   We have plenty of former prosecutors and corporate lawyers on the  bench. Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi would bring a sorely needed perspective. The  more our courts reflect our country as a whole, the more faith  Americans will have in the equal application of the law.   Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi will make an outstanding addition to the Seventh  Circuit, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for her later today.   Now, I want to reflect for a moment on the pace of judicial  nominations in the Democratic-led Senate so far this year. Typically,  the first several months of a new administration don't feature a ton of  judicial nominations. New Presidents often have ambitious legislative  agendas, and it takes a lot of time for a new President to make  appointments and to get them to go through all of the background checks  and for the Judiciary Committee to advance nominees to the floor. So in  administrations past, the first 6 months are a fallow period for  judges.   For all the focus that the Republican leader put on judges during the  previous administration, the Senate only confirmed one--one district or  circuit judge--before July 4 in the first year of Donald Trump's  Presidency. By the end of today, the Senate will have confirmed more  judges this week than in all 6 months of Donald Trump's first year in  office.   In fact, with the confirmations this week, the Senate will have  confirmed more district and circuit court judges to the Federal bench  in the first 6 months of President Biden's first year than any other  administration in 50 years.   Let me say that again so people hear, because I know there is a lot  of worry--justified--that President Trump shifted the bench so far to  the right that we need to rebalance it, and we need to make that a very  high priority. Well, we have. After the confirmation of Ms. Jackson- Akiwumi, the Senate will have confirmed more district and circuit court  judges in the first year of a  [[Page S4736]]  Presidency in over 50 years, including the first 6 months of Donald  Trump's Presidency. So we are making good, good progress, and we have  done it with judges who break the Federal mold--Federal defenders,  civil rights lawyers, voting rights lawyers, the first Native American  judge, the first Muslim American judge. Those make me proud that we are  constantly expanding who in America can get to the bench. All of these  folks have one thing in common: They are individuals of impeccable  character and impressive credentials.   The Democratic Senate is restoring balance to the judiciary with  highly qualified, mainstream jurists who reflect the diversity of this  country, and we are going to keep at it when we come back in July and  beyond                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, infrastructure, our  Nation's economic potential depends on the quality of its  infrastructure. Our businesses, workers, farmers, manufacturers--you  name it--they all depend on the infrastructure networks that connect  our country. And here in the 21st century, electrical grids and  broadband internet access are just as important as roads, bridges, and  highways.   But it has been decades--decades--since Congress passed a  significant, stand-alone bill to increase Federal investment in  infrastructure. Our roads and bridges are crumbling. Children learn in  dilapidated schools. Large swaths of rural America lack access to  broadband internet.   We need to refashion much of our infrastructure to address the  existential threat of climate change. That is so important and  essential to the overwhelming majority of my caucus. So the Senate,  this summer, is going to move forward on multiple legislative proposals  to make historic investments in our Nation's infrastructure. And when  we say that, we mean both types of infrastructure: the concrete and  steel and that kind of infrastructure--the physical infrastructure--but  also the human infrastructure, so that we can maximize the potential of  our people which, after all, is our greatest resource--our greatest  resource.   So we are pursuing on multiple--we are making two tracks. The first  legislative track is bipartisan. The second track will incorporate  elements of the American jobs and families plan and will be done  through the budget process, which must pass even if it is not  bipartisan.   There has been significant progress this week on both tracks.   Yesterday, a bipartisan group of Senators announced that they had  reached an agreement in concept for a bipartisan infrastructure  proposal, and I have encouraged them to move forward. But I made it  explicit to every one of them, together and separately, that we have to  pass both tracks together.   Speaker Pelosi and I were made aware of the concepts of the  agreement--the bipartisan agreement--last night. And while we have yet  to see the details, I am encouraged by the progress the bipartisan  group of Senators has made. I have supported these bipartisan  discussions from the beginning, and I want to thank my colleagues for  their hard work.   Senate Democrats have also made significant progress on preparing a  budget resolution.   These two efforts are tied together. Let me make that clear. The  bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget resolution are tied  together. If the Senate is going to move forward with a bipartisan  infrastructure bill, we must also move forward on a budget resolution,  as well. I have discussed this with President Biden directly on several  occasions, and he agrees that we cannot do one without the other, and  he has let the participants know that. Speaker Pelosi agrees that we  cannot do one without the other. All parties understand that we won't  get enough votes to pass either unless we have enough votes to pass  both.   When the Senate returns in July, it will be time to take the next  step and hold the first votes on the bipartisan infrastructure bill on  the floor of the Senate. Senators should also be prepared to consider a  budget resolution that will clear the way for the budget reconciliation  bill as soon as possible.   The bottom line is, both tracks need to make progress concurrently.   This is about building a foundation for the United States to remain  the world economic leader in the 21st century. We are the largest  economy in the world, but our infrastructure ranks 13th, behind South  Korea, Germany, Japan, and even the United Arab Emirates.   There isn't a community in this country without some glaring  infrastructure challenge--certainly, in my home State of New York. If  America is going to prosper in the 21st century, we can't have  infrastructure that is stuck in the last century.   We need to pass major investment in infrastructure, both physical and  human, this year, and I look forward to holding the first votes when we  return for the July work period.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 67.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.  [[Page S4749]]     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 63.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, June 24, be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
