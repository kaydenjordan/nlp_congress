 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and to pay tribute to  a community leader, a veteran, and a vocal advocate, Mr. Frank Fryburg,  who passed away last week at the age of 94.   Those of us who had the pleasure to know Frank know that he lived a  life of service to others. Frank joined the Navy in 1944 as an  electronic technician, and went on to serve 20 years in the Navy  Reserves. Frank was a graduate of Penn State University, earning his  bachelor's degree in physics on the GI Bill. He later earned his MBA  from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.   Frank served his community for a decade as a commissioner in Manheim  Township in Lancaster County. He was an active member of his church, a  national leader of his chosen fraternity, and worked to support  countless community organizations over the years.   With Frank, you always knew where you stood. He always shared his  opinions with you, and they were very well-thought out. He was recently  recognized as one of the most prolific letter writers to the editor in  the local newspaper.   Frank Fryburg was a man of exceptional character, of boundless energy  and determination, a true servant leader, and a community advocate.   Frank is survived by his 6 children, 13 grandchildren, and 20 great- grandchildren.   We will miss him. We wish those who are grieving, comfort. We give  thanks for the opportunity to know Frank, who positively impacted so  many people during his 94 years.                             Thanking Alex Munro     Mr. Speaker, I rise to give thanks to someone who has  positively impacted the lives of a generation of students and untold  generations  [[Page H2428]]  to come in Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District.   Alex Munro has retired after 30 years as executive director of the  Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology Foundation and Alumni  Association. Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology is known across the  State and across the Nation as a preeminent 2-year degree-granting  institution, which prepares students for today's in-demand technical  jobs.   Prior to serving the college, Alex graduated from the school then  known as the Thaddeus Stevens Trade School, and he talked many times  about how it changed his life. He studied masonry at the school. After  25 years in the private sector, successfully applying those skills and  the lessons that he learned at Thaddeus Stevens, Alex joined the alumni  foundation board before becoming the foundation's executive director in  1990.   Alex has been integral to the advancement of the school, building  relationships with elected officials and industry leaders to support  expansion of the school's mission and programs.   Alex is known for saying: ``Changing lives is not by chance; it is a  tradition at Stevens.''   That is a tradition that he has dedicated himself to for the past 30  years.   I personally have worked with Alex for a number of years, and I have  always appreciated his efforts and candor. I want to thank Alex for all  he has done to improve the lives of so many students, and I  congratulate him on his retirement.                            ____________________
