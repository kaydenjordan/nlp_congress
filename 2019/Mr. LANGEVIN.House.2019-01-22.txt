 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding me time. I hope I won't use all 5 minutes. I first want to say  I support the bill under debate right now and certainly support  criminal justice reform. One of the best ways, of course, we can  prevent people from hopefully going down the path of crimes is to make  sure they have a good education, so hence I am here to speak on H.R.  439.   Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Career and  Technical Education Caucus, I am pleased to rise with my good friend  and fellow co-chair, Representative G.T. Thompson, in support of H.R.  439, the National FFA Organization's Federal Charter Amendments Act. I  would like to thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his partnership on  this bill which modernizes the FFA congressional charter to better  serve the organization's 669,000 student members across the country.   Since 1928 the FFA, formerly known as Future Farmers of America, has  been an integral part of our Nation's agricultural education system.  Its mission is to prepare the next generation of farmers who form the  backbone of our Nation's food supply system. Congress recognized the  FFA's importance in 1950 when it granted the organization a Federal  charter. But today, nearly 70 years later, that charter is overdue for  an update.   Of the 100 nonprofit organizations that have charters with the  Federal Government, from the Girl Scouts of America to the National  Academy of Sciences, only six require government agencies to appoint  members to the NGO's board of directors. Of those six, the FFA is the  only federally chartered organization that requires a majority of its  board members to be chosen by its partner agency, the Department of  Education.   The bill that had been considered this afternoon and that passed  brings the role of the Department of Education in line with other  congressionally chartered organizations while maintaining the long  relationship between the department and the FFA. In doing so, it gives  the FFA more autonomy to deliver its integrated system of agricultural  career and technical education, or CTE, to the 8,000 chapters located  across all 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.   H.R. 439 allows the FFA to be more independent, but it retains its  ability to collaborate with the Department of Education in agriculture.  It also allows the FFA to move its headquarters from Washington, D.C.  and provide online publications for its chapters around the country.  The FFA needs to adapt to the 21st century economy, and modernizing  this charter is a necessary step in that process.   Today the FFA helps train more than future farmers. It prepares the  next generation of scientists, veterinarians, and business owners  through classroom and work-based learning. As a strong advocate for  CTE, I am thrilled to support the skills-based education model on  behalf of the FFA and its many teachers and students. Our bill aligns  the FFA's charter with this focus on CTE, specifically the Agriculture,  Food, and Natural Resources Career Cluster which gives students the  opportunity to explore exciting careers and be prepared for future  challenges.                                time  1630    Our country faces daunting tasks in agricultural policy, from  addressing food shortages to containing animal-borne diseases and  stopping the pollution of our waterways.   Mr. Speaker, we can count on our Nation's FFA students to not only  grow our economy but to become the next community of world leaders,  ready to tackle these 21st century challenges.   In my home State of Rhode Island, I am continually impressed by the  hardworking, motivated, bright FFA students and the dedicated teachers  who instruct them. Through the FFA, these students are developing the  academic and technical skills to succeed in agricultural fields and the  leadership skills to make a real difference.   This bill, the National FFA Organization's Federal Charter Amendments  Act, will allow the FFA to continue its mission with more autonomy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, my colleague G.T. Thompson from the  great State of Pennsylvania, along with Chairman Nadler and Ranking  Member Collins, for their support, as well as my esteemed colleague  Senator Todd Young of Indiana for leading this bipartisan effort in the  Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill, and I  thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding.
