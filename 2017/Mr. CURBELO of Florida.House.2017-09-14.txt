 Mr. Speaker, I left Washington last week to  be with my family and community as Hurricane Irma headed straight  toward south Florida.   Some in the lower and middle Keys lost everything to the storm's 130- mile-per-hour winds and 10-foot storm surge. Some lost their lives. But  with the Keys' tourism-based economy currently at a standstill, perhaps  the greatest devastation will be the financial strain on individuals,  families, and small entrepreneurs.   But there is hope. Conchs are resilient and generous people. It will  be a long road, but coordinated local, State, and Federal resources  have ensured the Keys recovery is already underway.   I have returned to Washington briefly to urge my colleagues to  support two critical needs here in Congress: long-term, robust funding  of FEMA, and a tax relief package for those trying to rebuild and  recover after disasters like Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.   Mr. Speaker, this can happen to any district or community. Whether it  is a hurricane, wildfire, or earthquake, we have a responsibility to  come together when large groups of Americans are in desperate need. I  look forward to working with my colleagues to do just that.                            ____________________
