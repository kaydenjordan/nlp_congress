 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration's open border  policies are wreaking havoc across our Nation, causing crime to spike,  even in my home district in northern California.   Hidden under the cover of our magnificent, forested wildlands,  Mexican  [[Page H6629]]  cartels are using our porous borders as easy access to Federal lands to  grow illegal marijuana crops.   Even though cannabis products are legal under California law, truly  they are still illegal under Federal law. These illegal grows are  dangerous and cause irreversible harm to the landscape and animals.   These grows are guarded by dangerous cartel members with illegal  weapons that they smuggle across the border. This puts local residents,  foresters, and outdoor recreationists at grave risk if they  accidentally come across or near a grow.   Butte County in northern California, my home county, is designated  now as a Federal high-intensity drug trafficking area. Thanks a lot.   These illegal farmers use toxic pesticides that are outlawed by the  U.S. and unavailable to American growers anymore. These chemicals run  off into nearby water sources, poisoning the animals and killing off  plant life. They cut off water from other farmers and rivers and cause  much damage to the environment.   This drug trafficking must be stopped.                            ____________________
