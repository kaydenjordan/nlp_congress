 Madam Speaker, last month, I had the opportunity to  visit the Port of Galilee in Narragansett, Rhode Island, one of the  most productive commercial fishing ports in the entire Northeast.  Galilee is home to more than 270 commercial fishing boats, supporting  3,500 jobs and landing more than 16 million pounds of seafood per year.   As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, I am committed to  fighting for resources for America's ports and to supporting the  commercial fishing industry, which is vital to how we feed our Nation  and support our economy.   I am also introducing a bill to secure a voice for the Rhode Island  fishing industry in the Mid-Atlantic Fishery  [[Page H1161]]  Management Council. I am proud to support and fight in Congress for  Rhode Island's fishermen, and I encourage everyone to try the best  seafood in America, which is Rhode Island seafood.                            ____________________
