 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Congressional  App Challenge winner from Arkansas' Second Congressional District, Anne  Li.   Currently a sophomore at Central High School in Little Rock, Anne  aspires to major in computer engineering and has the goal of pursuing a  career in programming.   STEM education is education for the future, and having serious skills  in computer programming and coding open up tremendous opportunities for  our youth. It gives them the skills to compete in a 21st century job  market as well as the skills to act on their imagination and engage in  their entrepreneurial exploration.   I wish Anne the very best as she continues her studies at Central  High School and beyond in this critical field.   As a member of the Congressional STEM Education Caucus and the dad of  a STEM student at the university, I want to continue to support the  growth of STEM education throughout Arkansas and America.                            ____________________
