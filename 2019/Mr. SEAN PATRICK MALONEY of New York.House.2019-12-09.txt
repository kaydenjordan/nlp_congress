 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor my friend, David Mixner, the legendary civil rights activist,  best-selling author, and humanitarian known throughout the world for  championing LGBT equality, healthcare, non-violence, and human rights  for nearly 60 years.   I had the privilege of working and learning from David, an experience  I will never forget, when I worked as White House staff secretary to  President Bill Clinton. In the mode of our own   John Lewis, David  inspired a generation of us with his pioneering work for equality and  documented those struggles in his seminal autobiography, ``Stranger  Among Friends.''   David's leadership and wisdom shaped--indeed, made possible--my  career and the careers of so many of us. He taught us to never tire of  the fight and to always wage it with love.   From his early work with Harvey Milk defeating discriminatory laws  against LGBT teachers, to demanding real action in funding to combat  the AIDS epidemic when our government was failing our community, David  changed our Nation for the better. I know I speak for an entire LGBT  community and our many allies in thanking David for his decades of  activism.   At this very moment, he is giving what may be his final public  performance in New York City before beginning his retirement. While I  so wish I could be there tonight, my presence here, in this Chamber, in  many ways is itself a tribute to David's lifetime of work.   And while the public phase of David's career may be drawing to a  close, I know David's words and deeds will live on for many generations  to come. He represents the best of America. He is a true patriot and a  stranger no more.                            ____________________
