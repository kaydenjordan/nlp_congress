 Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of the Carl D.  Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.   I would be remiss if I didn't compliment my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle and all of their respective staffs who have worked so hard  to bring this really good, strong bipartisan measure here before the  Congress for the benefit of the American people.   I have got to tell you: everywhere I go back in Minnesota and around  the country, I hear two things when I am talking to businesspeople. And  they say, you know, the people who are trained under this career and  technical education program are the best employees that we have. The  other thing I hear is that we need more of them.   So, again, thanks to my colleagues for bringing this bill forward.  There are some good, new provisions in it that gives States an  opportunity to focus better on what the needs are in their particular  region. There are some other tools to help communities, the program  itself, and the businesses to form partnerships to expand the program.   At the end of the day, it is all about creating good, strong jobs  with living wages and strong futures. It is about creating  opportunities for the working men and women in this country and for the  businesses that are at the heart of our economy. And is it about  creating a dynamic economy where people can grow and prosper in the  21st century.   It is a good bill for workers. It is a good bill for business. It is  a good bill for our economy. And it is a good bill for our national  security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption in the strongest language possible.
