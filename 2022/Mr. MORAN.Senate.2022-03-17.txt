 Madam President, I rise this afternoon here among my  colleagues and those back home in Kansas to pay tribute to a Kansan,  Sonny Rundell.   Sonny passed away this past Friday at the age of 89, and I want to  take a moment to recognize his life and his service. A moment is  insufficient, certainly, to pay the tribute that this gentleman and his  family deserve.   Sonny was born in Pierceville, KS, a little town in Southwest Kansas.  In places as rural as Pierceville, people are sparse, and so you  quickly learn what is important. And Sonny learned that in his life,  family, church, community were the important things.   Sonny embodied qualities that fostered his community: hard work and  generosity. And like so many young men of his generation, he was called  to service to his country. In 1953, he answered that call and left to  serve in Korea.   When he returned home to Kansas in 1956, he finished his degree at  Kansas State University, earning a degree in agriculture. He went on to  farm land in Hamilton, Stanton, and Finney Counties for more than 30  years.   Sonny was involved in so many ways. He was a churchgoer, and he cared  about education advocacy throughout our State. He was a member of the  State board of education and was an advocate for education for all kids  in our State.   He had preceded that by being a member of the Syracuse, KS, Board of  Education, the High Plains Special Education Cooperative. He was a  founding member of Garden City Community College Board of Trustees, a  founding member of the Education Equity Advisory Council, the Education  Commission of the States, the Kansas Commission on Teaching and  America's Future, and the National Association of State Boards of  Education, and that is only to name a few.   Sonny recognized, as I hope we all do, that education is the great  equalizing opportunity for Americans, for Kansans. It allows us to  pursue what we call the American dream.   He received lots of recognitions during his life. He received those  for his advocacy, and in 2003 Sonny was awarded the Governor's Award  for Distinguished Service to Secondary Education in Kansas.   From 2000 to 2003, our country recognized 50 years since the Korean  war. And during this time, the Republic of Korea issued a service medal  and awarded those to veterans who had served, coordinating with  congressional offices like mine. I was pleased to be able to recognize  Sonny's service to our Nation.   Particularly in these troubled times, these days in which we see the  surge for support for freedom, Sonny committed to doing so and served  his Nation and the world in that cause of freedom.   In 2002, while I was still a Member of the House of Representatives  here in the Nation's Capitol, I was pleased to be able to honor Sonny  for his recognition during the Korean war.   Then and now, I thank him for his dedication to our State, and I  thank him for his service to our Nation.   My prayers are with his wife Verna and to his entire family and loved  ones.   Robba joins me in expressing our sincere condolences and wish those  who remain to look at the life of Sonny Rundell and recommit ourselves  to service to our community, to our family, and to our church.                           Remembering Dick Hedges    Madam President, this afternoon I rise to pay tribute to a Kansan, a  champion of the Fort Scott community, Dick Hedges.   In Kansas, we talk often of community and how important it is to the  fabric of small towns that dot the State.   There are small towns in Southwest Kansas, and there are small towns  in Southeast Kansas because in Kansas, those communities matter so  much. We grew up knowing our neighbors and making the effort to get  involved with those around us that ensure our smalltown survival.   Dick Hedges was a man who took that need for a strong community to  heart and helped build the fabric of Fort Scott in so, so many ways.   Last night, I was reading the Fort Scott Tribune, and I read an  article in tribute to Dick. Its headline read: ``Man who shared so much  is remembered.'' It is a pretty good headline to have upon your death,  ``shared so much.''   Dick was a coach, a teacher, a vice principal, a principal, a college  president; he was a member of the community civic clubs and a  churchgoer; he  [[Page S1244]]  served on local boards; he wrote for local papers; and he championed  the arts in and around Fort Scott.   In 2018, he even opened a local book store because the community  needed one. He was a man who shared so much of himself: his time, his  love, his experience, his loyalty, and his commitment to others.   He was an advocate for athletics and sportsmanship and the way it  could influence young students in a positive way. For 40 years, he  shared his life with purpose and continually found new ways to do so.   But to Dick, I expect that was his definition of ``community,''  sharing oneself for the betterment of others with the expectation that  they, too--the people whom you help--may pay it forward.   Dick has impacted the lives of so many, so many throughout his life,  and his life gives me hope for others like him in towns across Kansas  and around the country.   My prayers are with his wife Jan, the Fort Scott community, and his  entire family and loved ones.   I yield the floor.
