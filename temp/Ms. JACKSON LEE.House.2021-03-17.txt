 Madam Speaker, we have just been engaged in  presenting to the public the Violence Against Women Act. But all of it  stands on the shoulders of the equal rights amendment, which has been  long overdue.   What an amazing journey that this legislation has taken, and how sad  it is to acknowledge that we are one of only a few nations that does  not have an equal rights amendment in its constitution.   I remember going to Afghanistan and working with the women of  Afghanistan to include the rights of women in their Constitution. I  want to say that again: To include the rights of women in their  Constitution.   So let me speak clearly to vital points of this resolution. This is  not an abortion bill. However, we realize that the right to choose is  embedded in the Constitution in the Ninth Amendment. But this is not  that.   It is a bill that says that women have a right, as Alice Paul said so  many years ago, to be able to have rights of equality under this flag,  under this Constitution. Are we suggesting that that should not be?   In addition, let it be very clear that any court decision that was  issued, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, that is,  the Commonwealth of Virginia v. Ferriero, we can explain that case,  because the Court said the only authority to extend the deadline was  Congress, and here we are. Congress is now intending to extend that  deadline.  [[Page H1426]]    Nothing in the Constitution prohibits that. It is not embedded in the  amendment. And by Article V, we are able to deal with deadlines.  Deadlines are a simple process of statutory authority, and that is what  we are doing today.   I don't think my friends on the other side of the aisle want to leave  without recognizing the fact that women make 80 cents for every $1 a  man earns, and that they are treated unfairly in the workplace.   If you want equal dignity, if you want the rights of women to be  promoted, vote for the ERA.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.J. Res. 17. H.J. Res. 17,  introduced by Representative Jackie Speier with 209 co-sponsors, would  take a critical step towards ensuring that the Equal Rights Amendment,  or ``ERA'', becomes part of the Constitution.   The resolution provides that notwithstanding the ratification  deadline of 1979 that Congress set for the ERA and later extended to  1982, the ERA ``shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of  the Constitution whenever ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths  of the several States.''   The purpose of the ERA is simple and fundamental: It ensures that  everyone is treated equally under the law, regardless of sex or gender.  Almost one hundred years ago, Alice Paul, who helped lead the campaign  to secure women's right to vote, proposed the first version of the ERA.   She and her fellow suffragists knew that if women were to achieve  true equality, our Nation's founding document needed to be amended to  reflect that core principle. Nearly a century later, it is long past  time to make that dream a reality.   In 1971 and 1972, the House and Senate, respectively, passed the ERA  by well more than the constitutionally-mandated two-thirds majority in  each chamber.   It contained these simple words: ``Equality of rights under the law  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on  account of sex.'' In the years that quickly followed, dozens of States  ratified the ERA through their legislatures.   By the end of the 1970s, the ERA was just a few States short of full  ratification. But then progress slowed, and the deadline Congress had  set for ratification passed. A well-organized counter-movement scared  the American people into thinking that a guarantee of equality would  somehow harm women who stay at home to raise their children or would  erode American families. What had started as a matter of broad  consensus became another divisive wedge in the culture wars.   Today we know better. We know that in the year 2021, it is  unacceptable that women still make only 80 cents for every dollar men  earn. We know that when women are treated with equal dignity and  respect in the workplace, in the home, by our institutions of  government, and in our society at large, all of the American people  stand to benefit. And we know that a simple but fundamental guarantee  of equality should be welcomed rather than feared.   Thankfully, the momentum for ERA ratification has picked back up.  Nevada ratified the ERA in 2017, and Illinois followed suit the next  year. Then, in January 2020, Virginia made history and became the 38th  State to pass a resolution ratifying the ERA. So long as these last  three ratifications are valid, the ERA will become law.   Unfortunately, a federal district court ruled two weeks ago that  these states were too late because the ratification deadline that  Congress set had expired already in 1982.   Importantly, that court affirmed that Congress has the power to set  ratifications deadlines, as Article V of the Constitution, which  governs the constitutional amendment process, does not itself provide  for ratification deadlines of any kind. Of course, the power to set  deadlines necessarily includes the power to remove those deadlines.   By removing the ratification deadline that Congress set previously,  H.J. Res. 17 ensures that the recent ratifications by Nevada, Illinois,  and Virginia are counted and that the ERA becomes part of our  Constitution.   We are on the verge of a breakthrough for equality in this country,  despite all the obstacles in our current political and social climate.  This resolution will ensure that no deadline stands in the way.  Therefore, I strongly support H.J. Res. 17 and urge its passage by the  House.    Madam Speaker, I include the following letters of  endorsement for H.R. 1620, the Violence Against Women's Act (VAWA) into  the Record.   Letters are from: The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence,  National Resource Center on Domestic Violence, The National Center on  Violence Against Women in the Black Community, YWCA, End Sexual  Violence, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, National  Congress of American Indians, LegalMomentum: The Women's Legal Defense  and Education Fund, JWI, and Casa de Esperanza.                                                      March 8, 2021.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Representative Fitzpatrick,       and Chairman Nadler: The National Coalition Against Domestic       Violence, (NCADV) applauds you for introducing the Violence       Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021. The Violence       Against Women Act (VAWA) is one of the three pillars of the       Federal response to domestic violence. First passed in 1994       under the leadership of then-Senator Biden, VAWA has been       reauthorized three times since then, most recently in 2013.       VAWA's authorization lapsed in 2018.        Every reauthorization included critical updates to enhance       America's response to domestic violence and other forms of       gender-based violence. These enhancements reflect the       evolution of our understanding of the dynamics of violence       and the needs of impacted communities. The Violence Against       Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 is the successor bill to       these previous reauthorizations and is a slightly updated       version of the H.R. 1585/S. 2843, the Violence Against Women       Reauthorization Act of 2019, which passed the House of       Representatives with strong bipartisan support before dying       in the Senate.        Like its predecessor, the updated 2021 bill invests in       prevention; keeps guns out of the hands of adjudicated dating       abusers and stalkers; promotes survivors' economic stability;       ends impunity for non Natives who commit gender-based       violence on Tribal lands by expanding special tribal criminal       jurisdiction beyond domestic violence; and increases       survivors' access to safe housing. The Violence Against Women       Reauthorization Act of 2021 also recognizes the disparate       impact of gender-based violence on communities of color due       to systemic racism and increases funding for culturally       specific organizations serving these communities. The       Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 expands       VAWA's life-saving provisions to increase access to safety       and justice for all survivors.        It is particularly critical to reauthorize and improve VAWA       as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. In a recent       survey of domestic violence programs, 84% reported that       intimate partner violence has increased in their community       during the pandemic. Fifty percent reported the use of       firearms. against intimate partners has increased, and one-      third reported intimate partner homicides have increased in       their communities. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization       Act of 2021 responds to the needs of survivors and supports       the programs that serve them.        We thank you, again, for your leadership, and we urge the       House to pass the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act       of 2021 as a matter of upmost urgency.            Sincerely,        The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

Hon. Jerry Nadler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Nadler, Jackson Lee and Fitzpatrick:       On behalf of the National Resource Center on Domestic       Violence, which has worked since 1993 to strengthen and       transform efforts to end domestic violence, I am writing to       express our support for the Reauthorization of the Violence       Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2021 and our gratitude for your       leadership in ensuring that survivors are able to access       lifesaving programs and services.        With each reauthorization of VAWA, Congress has made       important steps forward to better address the needs of       survivors and communities. Based on extensive conversations       with and feedback from local programs and advocates about       current strengths and disparities in VAWA, we--along with our       partners in the domestic and sexual violence movements--      recommended several key enhancements to the current statute.       We are very pleased that your legislation includes the       targeted improvements that programs across the country need       to do their jobs and support survivors.        According to the Centers for Disease Control's National       Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), 1 in 4       women and 1 in 9 men are the victim of physical violence,       contact sexual violence and/or stalking by an intimate       partner and experience negative impacts such as injury, fear,       concern for safety, or a need for services. In just one day       in 2019, 77,226 domestic violence victims and their children       received services at a local program in their community,       including emergency shelter, transitional housing,       counseling, legal advocacy, and children's support groups.       However, on that same day, 11,336 requests for services went       unmet because programs lacked the resources to meet victims'       needs. Of those unmet requests for services, 68% were for       housing. Indeed, safe housing is among the most pressing       concerns for survivors who have left or are planning to leave       an abusive relationship. Thirty-eight (38) percent of all       domestic violence victims become homeless at some point in       their lives. And among mothers with children experiencing       homelessness, more than 80 percent had previously experienced       domestic violence. We are particularly grateful that your       legislation would strengthen protections for survivors in       public housing, including by ensuring that survivors can       transfer units when necessary for safety reasons, as well as       other housing protections that are critical for survivors       seeking safety and stability.        We are also supportive of other key proposals in your       legislation, including:        Supporting Communities of Color;        Investing in prevention;        Ending impunity for non-Native perpetrators of sexual       assault, child abuse co-occurring with domestic violence,       stalking, sex trafficking, and assaults on tribal law       enforcement officers on tribal lands;        Improving enforcement of court orders that require       adjudicated domestic abusers to relinquish their firearms;        Improving access to housing for victims and survivors;        Protecting victims of dating violence from firearm       homicide;        Helping survivors gain and maintain economic independence;        Updating the federal definition of domestic violence for       the purposes of VAWA grants only to acknowledge the full       range of abuse victims suffer (does not impact the criminal       definition of domestic violence);        Maintaining existing protections for all survivors; and        Improving the healthcare system's response to domestic       violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.        Again, thank you for championing the needs of victims and       survivors and for supporting the work of domestic and sexual       violence programs across the country. We look forward to       continuing to work with you and your colleagues in Congress       to ensure bipartisan support for VAWA 2021 and to pass       legislation that will provide needed services and supports to       survivors and their families and communities.            Sincerely,                                              Farzana Q. Safiullah,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____           The National Center on Vlolence Against Women in the             Black Community,                                    Washington, DC, March 10, 2021.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      US. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Jackson Lee, Fitzpatrick, and Nadler:       Ujima Inc., The National Center on Violence Against Women in       the Black Community (Ujima, Inc.) is pleased to support H.R.       1620, the bipartisan Violence Against Women Reauthorization       Act of 2021. Ujima, Inc. is a national Culturally Specific       Services Issue Resource Center that mobilizes the Black       community and allies through its education and outreach;       training and technical assistance; resource development;       research; and public policy efforts. We work with local,       state, and national partners to promote strategies to improve       responses to Black survivors of domestic violence, sexual       assault, and community violence. We appreciated the       opportunity to give voice to the needs of Black survivors       during the collaborative process of H.R. 1585 and we are       encouraged to see the enhancements in H.R. 1620 as COVID-19,       racial justice movements, and economic strife have presented       complex challenges for those we serve since the passage of       H.R. 1585 in 2019.        Since 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has made       significant shifts in the cultural and legal landscape for       prevention and intervention strategies to address gender-      based violence. Specialized courts, prosecution units, law       enforcement departments, community-based programs,       coordinated community responses, and discretionary grant       funding for innovate solutions have been the central tenets       of ground-breaking legislation to save lives. However, Black       women still experience the highest rates of homicide related       to intimate partner violence compared to other racial and       ethnic populations. In 2018, Black females were murdered by       males at a rate nearlv three times higher than white females.       Despite the prevalence of domestic violence, Black survivors       are less likely to seek help from systems-based stakeholders       because institutional bias coupled with racial loyalty/      collectivism directly impact how she perceives, reacts to,       and reports violence in her life. Institutionalized and       internalized oppression at the intersections of race and       gender have created the foundation for unrecognized,       unaddressed trauma and violence in the lives of Black women       and they have been denied adequate resources and access to       legal systems, funding, crisis services, and other programs.        Thank you for not only hearing the needs of Black       survivors, but also addressing them in H.R. 1620 which       provides measured enhancements for the bipartisan support and       passage of such critical provisions as strengthening and       enforcing public housing protections, improving access to       healthcare options, expanding civil legal representation,       promoting firearm surrender protocols, reducing bench       warrants for victims who fear to appear in court, creating       restorative practices that are solutions-based, expanding       tribal sovereignty over specific crimes committed by non-      Native perpetrators, and prioritizing sexual assault       prevention to ameliorate intervention.        Additionally, the following provisions will greatly improve       services for Black survivors and we deeply appreciate the       inclusion of: a $40 million authorization for the Culturally       Specific Services Program; economic justice programs that       include access to unemployment insurance; and protections for       all survivors accessing services thereby preventing       discrimination.        Thank you for your unyielding and tireless efforts and       bringing the margins to the center to ensure that VAWA, after       twenty-seven years, continues to prioritize the safety of       survivors and hold perpetrators accountable in a way that is       survivor-centered, honors self-determination, and reduces re-      victimization by systems. We are deeply moved by your       commitment to social change that promotes access to services       and justice for all people, and we embrace the opportunity to       stand with you.        We are available to assist you at any time to facilitate       the passage of this landmark bipartisan bill that is the       hallmark of our work.            Respectfully,                                                     Karma Cottman,                                                Executive Director.                                                            YWCA,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of YWCA USA, a network       of over 200 local associations in 45 states and the District       of Columbia, I write today to urge you to pass the Violence       Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) of 2021 (H.R. 1620).       As identified in YWCA's Legislative Priorities for the 117th       Congress, YWCA is committed to the swift passage of VAWA in       the first 100 days of the new legislative session. We urge       you to vote yes and support strengthening services for       survivors and their children.        For over 160 years, YWCA has been on a mission to eliminate       racism, empower women, and promote peace, justice, freedom,       and dignity for all. Today, we serve over 2 million women,       girls and family members of all ages and backgrounds in more       than 1,200 communities. As the largest network of domestic       and sexual violence service providers, over 150 YWCAs across       44 states remain on the front lines providing gender-based       violence services. We are proud of our staff and volunteers       in providing these life-saving services. YWCAs get up and do       the work of providing safe and secure housing, crisis       hotlines, counseling, court assistance, and other community       and safety programs to more than 535,000 women, children, and       families each year.        Informed by our extensive history, the expertise of our       nationwide network, and our collective commitment to meeting       the needs of survivors and their families, we have seen       first-hand the importance of maintaining protections for all       survivors in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). This bill       works  [[Page H1428]]       to maintain the safety, resources, and protections critical       to all survivors, particularly women of color and other       marginalized communities. Of particular importance, VAWA       includes the following YWCA supported provisions critical to       survlvors:        Improves services for victims by reauthoring programs       administered by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S.       Health and Human Services to prevent and address domestic       violence, sexual violence, dating violence, and stalking       while preserving and expanding housing protections for       survivors;        Increases authorization levels for response and wrap-around       services especially important following a year of increased       strain on existing providers due to the COVID-19 pandemic;        Invests in prevention through increased funding for       programs such as the Consolidated Youth grants which support       engaging men and boys as allies and addressing children       exposed to violence and trauma with specialized services.       This bill also provides support to State-level health       programs to partner with domestic and sexual violence       organizations to improve healthcare providers' ability to       work with advocates, help victims, and strengthen prevention       programs;        Closes loopholes by improving enforcement of current       federal domestic violence-related firearms laws and close       loopholes to reduce firearm-involved abuse and intimate       partner homicide, which has received bipartisan support;        Increases funding for culturally-specific service providers       and increases authorization levels to hold current providers       harmless;        Improves the economic security of survivors by expanding       eligibility for unemployment insurance, strengthening       protections against discrimination in employment based on       survivor status, and increasing education on economic abuse       and economic security related to survivors.        Immediate action by Congress is needed as the COVID-19       pandemic continues to put a strain on resources and the       demand for assistance continues to rise with this silent       epidemic. Survivors cannot wait another day for the critical       protections identified in the Violence Against Women       Reauthorization Act (VAWA) of 2021. We urge you to vote yes       on this critical bill.        Thank you for your time and consideration. Please contact       Pam Yuen, YWCA USA Director of Government Relations if you       have any questions.            Sincerely,                                                Catherine V. Beane,      Vice President of Public Policy & Advocacy.                                   ____                                                National Alliance to                                             End Sexual Violence,                                                      March 4, 2021.      Hon Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Jackson Lee and Fitzpatrick: On behalf       of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence (NAESV)       representing 56 state and territorial sexual assault       coalitions and more than 1500 local rape crisis centers, I am       writing to convey our wholehearted support for the Violence       Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2021 reauthorizing       and improving the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and our       gratitude for your willingness to move forward to ensure we       renew VAWA as swiftly as possible.        With each iteration of VAWA, Congress goes the next step to       address the needs of survivors and communities. Based on       extensive conversations with local programs and advocates, we       brought forward several key enhancements, and we are very       pleased that your legislation includes many of these. From an       increased investment in sexual violence services and       prevention programs and culturally specific organizations       that serve communities of color to provisions to hold       offenders accountable on tribal lands to efforts to make our       criminal justice system more responsive to the needs of       victims, this legislation includes the realistic policies our       programs need to do their jobs.        According to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual       Violence Survey, one in five women has been the victim of       rape or attempted rape. Nearly one in two women has       experienced some form of sexual violence and one in five men       has experienced a form of sexual violence other than rape in       their lifetime. The study confirmed that the impacts on       society are enormous. Over 80% of women who were victimized       experienced significant short and long-term impacts related       to the violence such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder       (PTSD), injury (42%) and missed time at work or school (28%).       The CDC report shows that most rape and partner violence is       experienced before the age of 24, highlighting the importance       of preventing this violence before it occurs.        High profile cases of sexual assault on campuses, our       military bases, military academies, and professional sports       have resulted in unprecedented media attention. This has also       resulted in a tremendous increase in sexual assault survivors       seeking assistance from local rape crisis centers and       educators as well as community organizations requesting       prevention and training services. The media attention also       points to the need for comprehensive community responses to       sexual violence. According to data from a 2020 survey       conducted by NAESV, 62% of local sexual assault programs have       a waiting list, sometimes months long, for counseling       services and 35% lack a full time sexual assault therapist on       staff.        For these reasons, we are incredibly grateful that your       legislation increases the authorizations for the Sexual       Assault Services Program and the Rape Prevention and       Education Program. The local programs in our network see       every day the widespread and devastating consequences of       sexual violence, and this additional funding will help them       respond to community requests for services and prevention       education.        Of deep concern to NAESV, tribal governments are currently       unable to prosecute crimes of sexual assault, trafficking,       child abuse, and stalking by non-native offenders on their       lands. A 2016 study from the National Institute for Justice       (NIJ), found that approximately 56% of Native women       experience sexual violence within their lifetime, with 1 in 7       experiencing it in the past year. Nearly 1 in 2 report being       stalked. Contrary to the general population where rape,       sexual assault, and intimate partner violence are usually       intra-racial, Native women are more likely to be raped or       assaulted by someone of a different race. 96% of Native women       and 89% of male victims in the NIJ study reported being       victimized by a non-Indian. Native victims of sexual violence       are three times as likely to have experienced sexual violence       by an interracial perpetrator as non-Hispanic White victims.       Similarly, Native stalking victims are nearly 4 times as.       likely to be stalked by someone of a different race, with 89%       of female stalking victims and 90% of male stalking victims       reporting inter-racial victimization. The higher rate of       inter-racial violence would not necessarily be significant if       It were not for the jurisdictional complexities unique to       Indian Country and the limitations imposed by federal law on       tribal authority to hold non-Indians accountable for crimes       they commit on tribal lands.        We stand with you in affirming tribes' sovereignty to       prosecute non-native offenders of sexual assault, child       abuse, trafficking and stalking. VAWA 2013 restored the       authority of Tribes to arrest and prosecute offenders,       regardless of their race, for acts of domestic violence       committed within the boundaries of their jurisdiction. Since       enactment, at least 16 Tribes have undertaken the steps to       exercise the special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction       SDVCJ) restored by VAWA 2013--leading to over 120 arrests.       Tribal victims deserve justice, and we fully support these       provisions.        Many survivors of sexual assault, abuse, and harassment       have housing needs. For some survivors, home may not be a       safe place and they may need to leave due to sexual violence       they are experiencing in their home that is perpetrated by a       household member, landlord, or neighbor. Other survivors may       need to find safe housing to heal and lessen the effects of       sexual violence they have experienced either in their home or       they may need to find new housing if the perpetrator knows       where they live to stay safe. VAWA includes important       protections for survivors of sexual assault in public       housing, and these provisions are a critical part of the       safety net for survivors.        We are very pleased to support your vital legislation that       moves us forward in our work to end sexual violence. Please       contact our Policy Director, Terri Poore, with any questions.            Sincerely,                                             Monika Johnson Hostler      President.                                   ____                                                      March 8, 2021.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Representative Fitzpatrick,       and Chairman Nadler: The National Coalition Against Domestic       Violence (NCADV) applauds you for introducing the Violence       Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021. The Violence       Against Women Act (VAWA) is one of the three pillars of the       Federal response to domestic violence. First passed in 1994       under the leadership of then-Senator Biden, VAWA has been       reauthorized three times since then, most recently in 2013.       VAWA's authorization lapsed in 2018.        Every reauthorization included critical updates to enhance       America's response to domestic violence and other forms of       gender-based violence. These enhancements reflect the       evolution of our understanding of the dynamics of violence       and the needs of impacted communities. The Violence Against       Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 is the successor bill to       these previous reauthorizations and is a slightly updated       version of the H.R. 1585/S. 2843, the Violence Against Women       Reauthorization Act of 2019, which passed the House of       Representatives with strong bipartisan support before dying       in the Senate.        Like its predecessor, the updated 2021 bill invests in       prevention; keeps guns out of the hands of adjudicated dating       abusers and stalkers; promotes survivors' economic stability;       ends impunity for non-Natives who commit gender-based       violence on Tribal lands by expanding special tribal criminal       jurisdiction beyond domestic violence; and  [[Page H1429]]       increases survivors' access to safe housing. The Violence       Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 also recognizes the       disparate impact of gender-based violence on communities of       color due to systemic racism and Increases funding for       culturally specific organizations serving these communities.       The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021       expands VAWA's life-saving provisions to increase access to       safety and justice for all survivors.        It is particularly critical to reauthorize and improve VAWA       as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. In a recent       survey of domestic violence programs, 84% reported that       intimate partner violence has increased in their community       during the pandemic. Fifty percent reported the use of       firearms against intimate partners has increased, and one-      third reported intimate partner homicides have increased in       their communities. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization       Act of 2021 responds to the needs of survivors and supports       the programs that serve them.        We thank you, again, for your leadership, and we urge the       House to pass the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act       of 2021 as a matter of upmost urgency.            Sincerely,        The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.                                   ____                                                National Congress of                                                American Indians,                                     Washington, DC, March 16, 2021.      Re: Support for Passage of HR 1620, the Violence Against           Women Reauthorization Act of 2021.       Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Jackson Lee and Representative       Fitzpatrick: I am writing on behalf of the National Congress       of American Indians (NCAI), the nation's oldest and largest       organization of American Indian and Alaska Native tribal       governments, to thank you for your leadership in introducing       HR 1620, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act       (VAWA) of 2021, and to convey our support for your efforts.       NCAI has been actively involved in the development of the       tribal provisions of VAWA in each of the past       reauthorizations of the bill. Each time VAWA has been       reauthorized, it has included important provisions aimed at       improving safety and justice for Native women.        In 2019, NCAI adopted resolution ECWS-19-005 (attached),       which sets forth five priorities for reauthorization of the       Violence Against Women Act:        (1) include provisions, like those included in the       bipartisan Native Youth and Tribal Officer Protection Act and       Justice for Native Survivors of Sexual Violence Act, that       amend 25 U.S.C. 1304 to address jurisdictional gaps       including: child abuse and endangerment; assaults against law       enforcement officers; sexual violence; stalking; trafficking;       and the exclusion of certain tribes from the law;        (2) create a permanent authorization for DOJ's Tribal       Access to National Crime Information Program and ensure that       TAP is available to all tribes;        (3) improve the response to cases of missing and murdered       women in tribal communities;        (4) identify and address the unique barriers to safety for       Alaska Native women and provide access to all programs; and        (5) reauthorize VAWA's tribal grant programs and ensure       that funding is available to cover costs incurred by tribes       who are exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 1304.        We are pleased to see that your legislation continues to       build on VAWA's promise and includes the key priorities that       have been identified by tribal governments and advocates to       further enhance safety for victims in tribal communities.        As you know, tribal communities continue to be plagued by       the highest crime victimization rates in the country. A       recent study by the National Institute of Justice found that       over 80% of Native Americans will be a victim of intimate       partner violence, sexual violence, or stalking in their       lifetime. The study also found that 90% of these victims were       victimized by a non-Indian perpetrator. Sadly, Native       children are particularly affected by this violence. Native       children are 50% more likely to experience child abuse and       sexual abuse than white children. The complicated       jurisdictional framework at play in Indian Country continues       to undermine safety for victims of violence in tribal       communities.        Eight years ago, when Congress passed VAWA 2013, it       included a provision, known as Special Domestic Violence       Criminal Jurisdiction (SDVCJ), that reaffirmed the inherent       sovereign authority of Indian tribal governments to exercise       criminal jurisdiction over certain non-Indians who violate       qualifying protection orders or commit domestic or dating       violence against Indian victims on tribal lands. Since       passage of VAWA 2013, we have witnessed the ways in which       tribal jurisdiction has transformed access to justice for       some domestic violence victims, and also the ways in which it       falls short for victims of sexual violence, stalking,       trafficking, and child abuse. We welcome introduction of your       bill, which would address many of the gaps in the existing       law and make important strides toward restoring public safety       and justice on tribal lands.        We are particularly grateful that your legislation       recognizes that Native children are equally in need of the       protections that were extended to adult domestic violence       victims in VAWA 2013. The Tribal Nations implementing SDVCJ       report that children have been involved as victims or       witnesses in SDVCJ cases nearly 60% of the time. These       children have been assaulted or have faced physical       intimidation and threats, are living in fear, and are at risk       for developing school-related problems, medical illnesses,       post-traumatic stress disorder, and other impairments.       However, federal law currently limits SDVCJ to crimes       committed only against intimate partners or persons covered       by a qualifying protection order. The common scenario       reported by Tribal Nations is that they are only able to       charge a non-Indian batterer for violence against the mother,       and can do nothing about violence against the children. Your       bill would change that.        Your bill will also make strides in improving the       coordination and collaboration between tribal, local, and       federal jurisdictions, particularly with regard to criminal       justice information sharing. These reforms are desperately       needed and will make a real difference for victims of crime       in Indian Country. We look forward to continuing this       important work with your offices and thank you for your       commitment to tribal communities.            Thank you,                                                        Fawn Sharp,      President.                                   ____      The National Congress of American Indians Resolution #ECWS-19-005       Urging Congress to Pass a Long-term Reauthorization of the           Violence Against Women Act that Includes Key Protections           for Native Women        Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of       American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine       blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in       order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the       inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights       secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United       States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are       entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States       and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of       Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better       understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian       cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, safety and       welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit       the following resolution; and        Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)       was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest       national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native       tribal governments; and        Whereas, NCAI resolution STP-00-081 established the NCAI       Task Force on Violence Against Native Women, which has worked       since that time to identify needed policy reforms at the       tribal and federal levels, including in the Violence Against       Women Act (VAWA);        Whereas, VAWA was first passed in 1994, reauthorized in       2000, again in 2005, and 2013 and each of these bills       included important provisions aimed at improving safety and       justice for Native women;        Whereas, the last long-term reauthorization of VAWA expired       on September 30, 2018 and Congress has passed a series of       short-term extensions that leave VAWA currently scheduled to       expire on February 15, 2019;        Whereas, Native communities continue to experience high       levels of domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse,       stalking, murder, and trafficking, many of these crimes are       committed by non-Indians, and there is a need to amend       federal law to improve access to justice and safety for       victims in tribal communities;        Whereas, VAWA 2013 included a provision that reaffirmed the       inherent sovereign authority of Indian tribal governments to       exercise criminal jurisdiction over certain non-Indians who       violate qualifying protection orders or commit domestic or       dating violence against Indian victims on tribal lands;        Whereas, by exercising jurisdiction over non-Indian       domestic violence offenders many tribal communities have       increased safety and justice for victims who had previously       seen little of either;        Whereas, the Department of Justice (DOJ) testified before       the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2016 that VAWA 2013       has allowed tribes to ``respond to long-time abusers who       previously had evaded justice,'' but that there are       significant additional gaps that need to be addressed;        Whereas, the tribes implementing VAWA 2013 report that       children have been involved as victims or witnesses in their       cases nearly 60% of the time and federal law prevents tnbal       courts from holding non-Indian offenders accountable for       these crimes;        Whereas, according to DOJ, American Indian and Alaska       Native children suffer exposure to violencci at rates higher       than any other race in the United States, and this violence       has immediate and long term effects,  [[Page H1430]]       including: increased rates of altered neurological       development; poor physical and mental health; poor school       performance; substance abuse; and overrepresentation in the       juvenile justice system;        Whereas, a 2016 report from the National Institute for       Justice (NIJ) confirmed that 56% of Native omen experience       sexual violence within their lifetime and nearly 1 in 2       report being stalked;        Whereas, according to NIJ Native victims of sexual violence       are three times as likely to have experienced sexual violence       by an interracial perpetrator as non-Hispanic White victims       and Native stalking victims are nearly 4 times as likely to       be stalked by someone of a different race, but federal law       prevents tribal courts from holding non-Indian offenders       accountable for these crimes;        Whereas, VAWA 2005 included. a provision directing the       Attorney General to permit Indian tribes to enter information       into and obtain information from federal criminal information       databases;        Whereas, in 2015 DOJ announced the Tribal Access Program       for National Crime Information (TAP), which provides eligible       tribes with access to the Criminal Justice Information       Services systems;        Whereas, there has never been funding authorized for the       TAP program and some tribes report that they are unable to       access the program;        Whereas, on some reservations, American Indian and Alaska       Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the national       average;        Whereas, in many cases, law enforcement has failed to       adequately respond to cases of missing arid murdered American       Indian and Alaska Native women, leaving family members to       organize their own searches and community marches for justice       and without access to support or services; and        Whereas, Alaska Native women experience some of the highest       rates of violence in the country and geographical remoteness,       extreme weather, the lack of transportation infrastructure,       and unique jurisdictional complexities present unique       challenges to Native women's safety;        Whereas, certain tribes subject to restrictive settlement       acts have not been able to implement the tribal jurisdiction       provision of VAWA 2013.        Now therefore be it resolved, that NCAI calls on Congress       to move swiftly to pass a long-term reauthorization of VAWA       that will:        Include provisions like those included in the Native Youth       and Tribal Officer Protection Act and Justice. for Native       Survivors of Sexual Violence Act that amend 25 USC 1304 to       address jurisdictional gaps including: child abuse and       endangerment; assaults against law enforcement officers;       sexual violence; stalking; trafficking; and the exclusion of       certain tribes from the law;        Create a perment authorization for DOJ's Tribal Access to       National Crime Information Program and ensure that TAP is       available to all tribes;        Improve the response to and classification of incidents of       missing and murdered Indian women consistent with NCAI       Resolution PHX-16-077;        Identify and address the unique barriers to safety for       Alaska Native women, based upon meaningful findings, and       provide access to all programs; and        Reauthorize VAWA's tribal grant programs and ensure that       funding is available to cover costs incurred by tribes who       are exercising jurisdiction pursuant to VAWA;        Be it further resolved, that NCAI will oppose any VAWA       reauthorization bill that undermines tribal sovereignty,       unfairly penalizes tribes in accessing federal funds, or that       diminishes tribal inherent authority to define and address       crimes of domestic or dating violence, sexual violence,       stalking, or trafficking; and        Be it finally resolved, resolution shall be the policy of       NCAI until it is withdrawn or modified by subsequent       resolution.                                certification         The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Executive       Committee at the Executive Council Winter Session of the       National Congress of American Indians, held at the Capital       Hilton, February 12, 2019, with a quorum present.

Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Jackson Lee and Representative       Fitzpatrick: Legal Momentum, the Women's Legal Defense and       Education Fund commends you for introducing the Violence       Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021. Legal Momentum is       the nation's first and longest-serving advocacy organization       dedicated to advancing gender equality. We make these       advancements through targeted litigation, innovative public       policy, and education. Preventing and responding to gender-      based violence is a core pillar of Legal Momentum's work, in       recognition of the fact that freedom from violence is central       to achieving true equality.        Legal Momentum is proud to have been closely involved in       developing the landmark bipartisan legislation that became       the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994. Our       organization played a critical role in drafting and       advocating for VAWA's passage, beginning this effort with       then-Senator Joe Biden in 1990. We have since worked in       coalition with the National Task Force to End Sexual and       Domestic Violence to see enhanced services and protections       included in each.reauthorization of VAWA, each of which had       bipartisan support. Legal Momentum is grateful to you for       your dedication to reauthorizing VAWA-in a way that responds       to the needs of all those affected by gender-based violence.        The updates to the existing Violence Against Women Act that       are included in your bill reflect the real needs of victims       and survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual       assault, and stalking. In particular, we are pleased that       this reauthorization of VAWA meets the needs of communities       of color. We applaud your commitment to pass a bipartisan       reauthorization of this critical legislation. We support       introducing the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of       2021 and hope that your colleagues across the political       spectrum will recognize the importance of these enhancements       and join in supporting it.        Thank you for your leadership and dedication to protecting       victims and survivors.            Sincerely,                                         Lynn Hecht Schafran, Esq.,      Senior Vice President.                                   ____                                                              JWI,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Representative Fitzpatrick,       and Chairman Nadler: Jewish Women International (JWI), the       leading Jewish organization working to end gender-based       violence, applauds your steadfast dedication and leadership       in introducing the bipartisan Violence Against Women       Reauthorization Act of 2021 (H.R. 1620).        As a Steering Committee member of the National Task Force       to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, convener of the       Interfaith Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence and       Clergy Task Force to End Domestic Abuse in the Jewish       Community, and co-chair of Faiths United to Prevent Gun       Violence, JWI supports this bill that builds on VAWA's       previous successes and adds key enhancements to ensure the       safety of victims of domestic violence, dating violence,       sexual assault, and stalking.        The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is our nation's       single most effective tool in responding to the devastating       crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,       and stalking--providing lifesaving programs and services.       Since its initial passage, VAWA has dramatically enhanced and       improved our nation's response to violence against women.       VAWA is essential in the funding of programs and services       that survivors rely on every day. This commonsense       legislation protects victims and survivors, helps save lives,       and makes our communities safer places to worship, heal, and       thrive.        Even with all of the advancements in the last twenty-seven       years, there is still a tremendous amount of work that       remains. One third of all women (nearly 52 million women) in       the United States have been victims of physical violence by       an intimate partner. In 2016 alone, there were 1.1 million       domestic violence victimizations, 54% of which involved       domestic partners. The Department of Justice's Criminal       Victimization 2016 Bulletin found that more than 10% of all       violent crime is due to intimate partner violence.        The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021       responds to the urgent issues survivors face every day by       supporting programming to prevent gender-based violence,       closing Tribal and firearms loopholes to protect all       survivors, strengthening public housing protections for       survivors, expanding the ability of providers to respond to       sexual harassment, and prioritizing support for Communities       of Color.        JWI and our 75,000 members and supporters greatly       appreciate your dedication and leadership in advancing the       critical mission of passing a targeted bill that will have a       broad impact on all survivors. Congress now has an       opportunity to come together and pass meaningful legislation       to help save the lives of victims of gender-based violence--      we are grateful that you are spearheading this effort.        Thank you again for being tireless champions of survivors.            Sincerely,                                                   Meredith Jacobs,                                                           JWI CEO.  [[Page H1431]]                                          ____                                             Casa de Esperanza,                                                      March 8, 2021.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      Hon. Brian Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Nadler, Jackson Lee and Fitzpatrick: I       am writing on behalf of Casa de Esperanza: National Latin@       Network for Healthy Families and Communities to convey our       support of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of       2021 (VAWA Reauthorization, H.R. 1620). We greatly appreciate       your leadership and effort to fulfil the promise of the       landmark Violence Against Women Act of 1994.        Casa de Esperanza was founded in 1982 in Minnesota to       provide emergency shelter and support services for women and       children experiencing domestic violence. In 2009, Casa de       Esperanza launched the National Latin@ Network for Healthy       Families and Communities, which is a national resource center       that provides training & technical assistance, research, and       policy advocacy on addressing and preventing gender-based       violence in Latin@ communities. Through offering direct       services in Minnesota and nationwide advocacy, we are very       aware of the critical role that VAWA has played in enhancing       access to services, safety, and justice for all survivors.        VAWA Reauthorization is a necessary part of our nation's       commitment to ending gender-based violence. It includes       narrowly focused, yet critical, enhancements to address gaps       identified by survivors and direct service providers. Among       many provisions, the measure maintains vital protections for       all survivors, invests in prevention, improves access to safe       housing and economic independence, and includes long overdue       funding for culturally specific communities.        Since the enactment of VAWA in 1994 and during each       subsequent reauthorization of VAWA in 2000, 2005, and 2013,       Congress has continued to support and improve protections for       survivors in a bipartisan manner. During this time in which       we are experiencing the dual crises of the Coronavirus and       gender-based violence, we are reminded of the fragility of       life. It is not now or ever acceptable to merely maintain the       status quo, let alone undermine current protections and       reduce access to safety and justice for victims and       survivors, particularly those from vulnerable communities       which also have been more deeply impacted by the COVID-19       pandemic.        In addition to ensuring important pathways to safety,       justice, and well-being for all survivors, H.R. 1620 includes       important enhancements that improve access to intervention       and prevention services. We are enthusiastic about the       funding for legal and housing services that are life-saving       resources for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. We       are also very encouraged by the funds provided for culturally       specific programs in H.R. 1620.        We appreciate your commitment to moving this bill forward       with bipartisan support and continue the longstanding       commitment of Congress to support enhanced services and       protections in each reauthorization of VAWA. Thank you for       being a champion on behalf of all victims and survivors and       for your commitment to improving the well-being of       individuals, families, and communities.            Sincerely,                                           Patricia J. Tototzintle,                                                               CEO.     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1620, the  ``Violence Against Women Act of 2021,'' that will reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994.   The Violence Against Women Act is landmark legislation first enacted  in 1994 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton which has-- through policy reforms, interstate cooperation and grant allocation-- been pivotal in providing a national response to protecting half of the  population.   Equally important, it has ushered in a seismic transformation on how  society perceives violence against women.   VAWA was enacted in response to the prevalence of domestic and sexual  violence, and the significant impact of such violence on the lives of  women.   I remember those days well because I was serving on the board of the  Houston Area Women's Center (HAWC), at that time the sole shelter in  the Houston area offering sanctuary to victims and women at risk of  domestic violence.   Despite its import, VAWA has been expired since September 30, 2018,  and we as a body are now called upon by survivors to reauthorize it.   VAWA has a proven success record--in the quarter-century since it  passed, domestic violence has decreased by approximately two-thirds,  and intimate partner homicides decreased by approximately one-third.   However, despite these gains, domestic violence and sexual assault  cases I have rapidly increased during this COVID-19 crisis, where  perpetrators are spending significant amount of time at home with their  victims.   This landmark, transformative legislation is needed now more than  ever.   Police departments around the country have reported increases in  domestic violence: 18 percent increase in San Antonio; 22 percent  increase in Portland, Oregon; 10 percent increase in New York City.   A recent meta-analysis of 18 different studies concerning domestic  violence during the pandemic found that domestic violence cases have  increased an average of over 8 percent across the country.   In the United States, an estimated 10 million people experience  domestic violence every year, and more than 15 million children are  exposed to this violence annually.   According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, about  20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner.   About 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner  physical violence, sexual violence, and/or partner stalking with  injury.   Today, in Texas, 35.10 percent of women and 34.5 percent of men are  subjected to domestic violence.   We cannot forget the victims of domestic violence like Yashica  Fontenot, who was murdered in Harris County, Texas, by her husband just  one day after Christmas last year while she was trying to escape her  relationship.   Nor can we forget Debra Seidenfaden, who was murdered by her husband  in Houston after an argument.   Nor can we forget the Houston woman who was tied up and sexually  assaulted in her own home just last week; or the Houston woman who was  shot multiple times by her husband at a medical office this month; or  the Houston mother and grandmother who was murdered by her son-in law  while she attempted to protect her daughter and grandchildren.   There are countless stories like this throughout this country, which  is why it is imperative to reauthorize VAWA by passing H.R. 1620.   The stories of these women remind us of the urgency to protect  survivors now, before it is too late, because many of these deaths are  preventable.   Since VAWA's codification in 1994, more victims report episodes of  domestic violence to the police and the rate of non-fatal intimate  partner violence against women has decreased by almost two-thirds.   VAWA has also led to a significant increase in the reporting of  sexual assault.   From 1994 to 2015, the rate of women murdered by men in single  victim/single offender incidents dropped 29 percent.   In the first 15 years of VAWA's validity, rates of serious intimate  partner violence declined by 72 percent for women and 64 percent for  men.   Research suggests that referring a victim to a domestic violence or  sexual assault advocate has been linked to an increased willingness to  file a police report--survivors with an advocate filed a report with  law enforcement 59 percent of the time, versus 41 percent for  individuals not referred to a victim advocate.   Prior to VAWA, law enforcement lacked the resources and tools to  respond effectively to domestic violence and sexual assault, and this  progress cannot be allowed to stop.   Congress must continue sending the clear message that violence  against women is unacceptable.   VAWA has been reauthorized three times--in 2000, 2005, and 2013--with  strong bipartisan approval and overwhelming support from Congress,  states, and local communities.   Each reauthorization of VAWA has improved protections for women and  men, while helping to change the culture and reduce the tolerance for  these crimes.   H.R. 1620 continues that tradition, and therefore, is intended to  make modifications, as Congress has done in the past to all previous  reauthorizations of VAWA.   H.R. 1620 is a bipartisan bill, reflecting a reasonable and  compromise approach to reauthorize grant programs under the Violence  Against Women Act (VAWA).   These moderate enhancements will address the many growing and unmet  needs of victims and survivors of domestic violence, dating violence,  sexual assault, and stalking.   H.R. 1620 addresses the needs of sex trafficking victims while  creating a demonstration program on trauma-informed training for law  enforcement.   H.R. 1620 increases access to grant programs for culturally specific  organizations and ensure culturally specific organizations are included  in the development and implementation of service, education, training,  and other grants.   H.R. 1620 adds a purpose area to assist communities in developing  alternatives to housing ordinances that punish survivors for seeking  law enforcement intervention.   H.R. 1620 expands protections for vulnerable populations such as  youth, survivors without shelter, Native American women, and LGBTQ  persons.   H.R. 1620 ensures Deaf people are included in grants relating to  people with disabilities.   VAWA is central to our nation's effort to fight the epidemic of  domestic, sexual, and  [[Page H1432]]  dating violence and stalking, and we as a body are now called upon by  survivors to reauthorize it.   It is important to note that H.R. 1620 did not happen on its own.   It was the product of a collaborative effort of stakeholders,  including victim advocates.   It was the product of those willing to share their stories of the  abuse suffered at the hands of those who were entrusted to love, but  instead harmed.   The courage, strength, and resilience displayed by survivors has  reminded all that we must continue to foster an environment for victims  of violence to come forward and expose episodes of violence against  women.   Having listened to concerned stakeholders from all pockets of the  country, we have put pen to paper and produced a bill that is endorsed  by the bipartisan National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic  Violence (NTF), which is a national collaboration comprising a large  and diverse group of 35 national, tribal, state, territorial, and local  organizations, advocates, and individuals that focus on the  development, passage and implementation of effective public policy to  address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and  stalking.   This bill recognizes the urgency and dire need faced by the victims  and survivors throughout this country during a significant moment of  ongoing domestic violence caused by this pandemic and experienced by  both women and men.   The love for a spouse, the comfort of a mother and the best wishes  for a sister know no political allegiance.   I am determined to work with my colleagues and others to complete the  mission I accepted in the 115th Congress when the House passed the VAWA  legislation I authored, H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2018, all the way this time through passage by  the Senate and to presentment for signature to President Biden, a  strong supporter of the bill and the original creator of VAWA.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I stand today in a moment of history where we cannot  go back. Have we heard that before? Women cannot go back. Women cannot  continue in an intimidated fashion to tragically be subjected to men  who violently attack them.   The LGBT community cannot go back and be subjected to those who would  be violent against them.   Native American women cannot go back. They cannot go back. They  cannot go back to pueblos and reservations and not have any protection  for those who violate those sacred places, rape them, and then rush to  jurisdictions outside and think they are protected.   Immigrant women cannot go back.   That is what this legislation is about. It is a product borne of  meticulous and thoughtful research and countless engagement with those  on the ground working ultimately and intimately on these very important  issues daily.   We began this long journey and hard-fought battle under the  leadership of Republicans--I wrote the bill in 2018--who at the time  refused to engage in putting forward their own version of VAWA when it  expired in 2018 while they held the majority. The President, the  Senate, the House, they did nothing. The Judiciary Committee would not  even take the bill up, and it was supported by over 200 groups.   But we continue to push forward on behalf of all victims and  survivors to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, first  led by the President of the United States, then-Senator Joe Biden.   As we all know, VAWA is a landmark piece of legislation first enacted  in 1994. At that time, the President was Bill Clinton. This legislation  was enacted in response to the prevalence of domestic and sexual  violence and the significant impact of such violence on the lives of  women.   Statistics have revealed that this form of violence impacts us all.  In the United States, an estimated 10 million people experience  domestic violence every year. More than 15 million children are exposed  to violence annually. According to the National Coalition Against  Domestic Violence, about 20 people per minute are physically abused by  an intimate partner. About one in four women and one in nine men  experience severe intimate partner physical violence, sexual violence,  and a partner stalking injury.   Today, in Texas, 35 percent of women and 34 percent of men are  subjected to domestic violence. When discussing VAWA, we cannot forget  the victims of domestic violence like Ms. Fontenot, who was murdered in  Harris County by her husband just 1 day after Christmas last year while  she was trying to escape her relationship, and he shot at her son.   Nor can we forget Debora Seidenfaden, who was murdered by her husband  in Houston after an argument.   There are countless stories like this throughout the country. That is  why it is imperative that we reauthorize this bill. Enough is enough.  We must pass H.R. 1620 now.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the women, including Representative  Slaughter, who started this bill.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1620, the ``Violence  Against Women Act of 2021.''   H.R. 1620 is a product born of meticulous and thoughtful research and  countless engagement with those on the ground, working intimately on  these very important issues daily.   We began this long journey, and hard-fought battle under the  leadership of Republicans, who at the time refused to engage or put  forward their own version of VAWA when it expired in 2018 while they  held the majority.

This legislation was enacted in response to the prevalence of  domestic and sexual violence, and the significant impact of such  violence on the lives of women.

Congress has reauthorized VAWA three times--in 2000, 2005, and 2013-- with strong bipartisan approval and overwhelming support from Congress,  States, and local communities.   During each reauthorization, VAWA would make various meaningful  improvements to the Act to meet the varied and changing needs of  survivors.   H.R. 1620 continues that tradition, and therefore, is intended to  make modifications, as Congress has done in the past to all previous  reauthorizations of VAWA.   H.R. 1620 is a bipartisan bill, reflecting a reasonable and  compromise approach to reauthorize grant programs under the Violence  Against Women Act (VAWA).

H.R. 1620 expands protections for vulnerable populations such as  youth, survivors without shelter, Native American women, and LGBTQ  persons.   It ensures Deaf people are included in grants relating to people with  disabilities.   H.R. 1620 is supported by the National Task Force to End Sexual and  Domestic Violence Against Women, a coalition of more than 200 domestic  violence groups.   VAWA expired since September 30, 2018, and we as a body are called  upon by survivors to reauthorize it now.   As a tribute to our dearly departed Rep. Slaughter, who started this  journey with then, Senator Biden in 1994, I respectfully urge my  colleagues to join me, and the Chairman of Judiciary, along with our  Republican partners--Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. McCaul in passing H.R.  1620, a much needed thoughtful and bipartisan response to the needs of  all victims and survivors.    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this has been a long journey, and I think it is  important to take note of the many women who have helped us and to do  this in the name of so many women who have lost their lives.   I take this moment on the floor to support the en bloc amendment but,  as well, to encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle of  how somber and serious a moment this is that we do not take lightly to  the floor because so many of us in our own congressional districts have  seen the scourge of domestic violence.   We have seen the rise in domestic violence in a meteoric manner under  COVID-19. It is rabid and rampant in all our cities. Our law  enforcement officers have told us it is the most dangerous call that  they can possibly make.   I am particularly concerned about sex trafficking victims, and I am  very glad the manager's amendment has language in there that indicates  that sex trafficking victims experience sexual violence and assault,  and that the Federal recognition of their recovery is important.   We look at all aspects of this important issue in our country. The en  bloc amendment represents Members' concerns for improving the treatment  of women and men, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans, and immigrant  women who are culturally diverse.   Madam Speaker, to the 200-plus organizations of the coalition, I want  to say thank you to you for advocating with us. Writing this bill in  2018 and never giving up has been the challenge that I have taken up.   I am very grateful to the many women who have joined me. Even though  it was not passed when there was a Republican President, Republican  Senate, and Republican House, and then it was blocked by the Republican  Senate, we have now come with a fully robust and comprehensive bill  that responds to the concerns of those who cannot help themselves.    Housing and other aspects of the provisions that are  in this bill pointedly speak to needs that have been brought to our  attention by victims. This bill deals with victims, Madam Speaker, so  when you are fleeing your home because your name is not on the lease or  the mortgage, we now have provided an expedited process for you to get  housing with your children.    We intervene and have cultural sensitivity training for men and boys.  We have a cultural sensitivity office inside the office of domestic  violence so that women of different cultural backgrounds can be  responded to, along with focusing on culturally sensitive advocacy  groups to help those women.   Yes, we do prevent a convicted person who has perpetrated a stalking  or sexual assault from getting a gun, but this bill is controlled by  due process in the Constitution.   Let's pass this bill. Women are waiting. They can't wait any longer.  Men are waiting. Many communities are waiting. We can't wait any  longer, and we must pass this bill to be signed by the President of the  United States.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   The gentlewoman is right, her amendment is simple. It does nothing.  It provides no increased funding. It does not provide for women who are  desperate--and men and our indigenous community--at all.   Among other things, this amendment would merely extend for 1 year,  which is disastrous, rather than reauthorize for 5 years, essentially  gutting the bill's most critical grant programs. Some of the programs  left out of this so-called extension are as follows:   Outreach in services to underserved populations;   The rape prevention and education grant, $110 million, a 50 percent  increase from the existing bill;   Transitional housing assistance grants for VAWA victims. Women  fleeing, men fleeing, victims fleeing, children fleeing without having  housing, we expedite that;   Authorizing funding for the Tribal Access Program and;   Child abuse training programs for judicial personnel and  practitioners.   By leaving these programs out, this amendment fails to recognize the  range of needs that victims of domestic violence, sexual assault,  dating violence, and stalking violence face. It simply fails the most  desperate and needy people.   This amendment also omits all of the improvements to VAWA that are  contained in the underlying bill, H.R. 1620, which is a product of  years of consultation with a range of stakeholders, and the failed  efforts of Republicans year after year not to reauthorize. This is  built on hard work, many of whom worked directly in the field with  survivors and have a deep knowledge of VAWA's programs.   Relying in part on their expertise, this legislation contains dozens  of important improvements to the range of programs contained in VAWA to  make it an even more effective tool in addressing domestic violence.   But this amendment dismisses the needs of the victims and survivors  whose voices were our guide in developing H.R. 1620. It is shameful.   For example, the underlying legislation enhances and expands victims'  services. It improves the criminal justice response to gender-based  violence, and it expands legal assistance. It makes additional  investments in prevention. It improves access to housing for victims  and survivors.   It ends impunity for non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, which  has gone on for years. Go to the reservation of Pueblo, assault a  Native American woman, and have no accountability.   It supports communities of color and LGBTQ individuals. It protects  victims of dating violence and firearm homicide. It improves the  healthcare system's response to domestic violence, sexual assault,  dating violence, and stalking.   But the Stefanik amendment would eliminate all of these vital  programs. In essence, it would leave women and victims helpless and  without hope.   Do not be fooled. This amendment does not demonstrate support for  VAWA. It demonstrates a lack of commitment to ensuring that the  programs contained within VAWA can best serve and protect the survivors  and victims who rely on them.   Since VAWA's enactment in 1994, Congress has repeatedly enhanced the  prior versions of the law, including in reauthorizations in 2000, 2005,  and 2013. Since the last reauthorization, there has been an uptick in  demand for the essential services under VAWA due to the Me Too movement  and women coming forward out of the shadows.   There has also been an uptick in victims' and survivors' and  children's needs for services due to the financial strain imposed by  the COVID-19 pandemic. That is why H.R. 1620 both reauthorizes and  improves the law. This amendment would effectively do neither.   Victims and survivors deserve better than this half measure, and they  would look to the women of this Congress to be sensitive to their  plight.   Domestic violence providers and survivors all have spoken loud and  clear with hundreds of organizations supporting and endorsing H.R.  1620. They have asked for the underlying bill, not a bait-and-switch  that is fatally flawed and makes no meaningful improvements to the bill  or to the law.   Finally, this amendment will not help the legislation move in the  Senate. We have spoken with the leaders in the Senate on both sides of  the aisle on this issue and they agree that we must  [[Page H1474]]  improve the Violence Against Women Act. It is greatly needed in order  to stop the scourge of domestic violence, which is surging in our  Nation, and not freeze it, as the Stefanik amendment would do.   Therefore, I urge opposition to this amendment, which would undermine  H.R. 1620 and years of work, years of building on this with so many  collaborators. I thank our chairman, the many women who helped me with  writing this legislation, and those who offered substantial amendments  to improve it, even those in the last Congress.   We don't want to freeze that behavior that will be positive. This  amendment would seriously damage the Violence Against Women Act.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.   Madam Speaker, among other things, this amendment would merely extend  for one year, rather than reauthorize for five years, some of the  programs under the Violence Against Women Act, essentially gutting the  bill's most critical grant programs. Some of the programs left out of  this so-called extension are:   Outreach and services to underserved populations;   The rape prevention and education grant;   Transitional housing assistance grants for VAWA victims; Authorizing  funding for the Tribal Access Program; and   Child abuse training programs for judicial personnel and  practitioners.

We have spoken with leaders in the Senate on this issue on both  sides of the aisle, and they agree that we must improve the Violence  Against Women Act, not freeze it as the Stefanik amendment would do.   Therefore, I urge opposition to this amendment, which would undermine  H.R. 1620 and would seriously damage the Violence Against Women Act.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of  time remaining?    Madam Speaker, let me acknowledge the leadership of  the gentlewoman who has offered this amendment and the opportunities  that we have had to work together. I look forward to working with her  going forward.   I have also worked with, over the years--really starting from the  time that I stood alongside of then-Senator Joe Biden as this bill was  presented for reauthorization. It went all the way through my time on  the Judiciary Committee and the writing of this bill in 2018, when,  unfortunately, there was no effort by the Judiciary Committee to put  this bill forward for a hearing, there was no effort by the Senate  Republicans, and no effort by the Republican President in 2018 to do  anything about the scourge of violence against women and men and many  groups.   I have worked with the 200-plus organizations that are involved in  the coalition that stand against sexual assault and rape and stalking  and domestic violence. They are in many different categories and sizes,  but they are vital in their service.   I am concerned that this amendment would undermine those smaller  organizations, who are unique in their service that they provide. They  are in places where large organizations may not be. They are working  with indigenous populations, Native Americans, immigrant women, LGBTQ.  They are saving lives.   People of color, Hispanic, African American, we have a very sizeable  portion of them and in this legislation, we are reaching out to people  who cannot respond and help themselves; housing provisions, in case you  have to flee, expediting your ability to get housing.   Then I am as concerned about sex trafficking as my good friend is. I  have worked on this legislation. As a former member of the Houston Area  Women's Center, I am also well aware of the crisis as it relates to the  need for this bill. But in the manager's amendment, we do have language  that says that we should have a placeholder for sex trafficking victims  who experience sexual violence and assault; that the Federal  recognition of their recovery is important.   Throughout this bill, there are provisions that will help individuals  who are sex-trafficked. We have that in the bill in relationship to the  particular actions that are generated if you are sexually assaulted  while you are sex-trafficked.   So we know that this bill is sensitive. There is more that can be  done. We look forward to a freestanding bill that deals in specifics,  as we have done in the past.   I held the first hearing in my congressional district on human  trafficking. I have worked with advocates and continue to work with  them, and so I take issue that this bill is not sensitive to sex- trafficked individuals, and I look forward to working with the  gentlewoman as we look forward to expanded resources and expanded  response to those who have been sex-trafficked and human-trafficked,  because that scourge continues.   This legislation responds to those like that woman in my district who  lost her life in the days after Christmas and had her son shot at by  her husband. We pay tribute to her. I ask my colleagues to vote against  this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and commemorate  this historic month, Women's History Month, and to celebrate the  passing in the House of the equal rights amendment, as well as VAWA,  the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, H.R. 1620.   How grateful I am that this bill, H.R. 1620, addresses the need of  sex trafficking victims while creating a demonstration program on  trauma-informed training for law enforcement. It increases access to  grant programs for culturally specific organizations and ensures  culturally specific organizations are included in the development of  programs.   It is supported by the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic  Violence Against Women, a coalition of over 200 groups.   VAWA expired on September 30, 2018. We, as a body, are called upon by  survivors to do our job. I am delighted to celebrate Ann Kuster, Gwen  Moore, Jackie Speier, Brenda Lawrence, Lois Frankel, Debbie Dingell,  and Karen Bass, and the name of Sojourner Truth, the abolitionist  suffragist, and Ivalita Jackson, my mother, a modern-day abolitionist  and suffragist. They know that to get the job done, we must get the job  done.    This bill is on to the other body, and now it is to be signed by the  President of the United States. It is catapulted in Women's History  Month. We celebrate ERA and the Violence Against Women Act.                            ____________________
