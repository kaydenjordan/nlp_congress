 Madam Speaker, I rise today outraged that  extremist Republicans continue to play games, political theater, with  Americans' livelihoods.   Extreme Republicans, the hostage takers, are threatening to crash our  economy unless Congress guts critical programs that millions of people  rely on.   Defaulting on our debt could delay Social Security and Medicare  benefits for 6.9 million seniors in California alone.   Alicia, a constituent from Upland, recently reached out to my office  concerned about her Social Security benefits.   Alicia, along with many other seniors, are the victims of extreme  Republicans. Alicia paid into Social Security her entire life with the  promise that she would be able to retire with dignity. She deserves  better. The Inland Empire deserves better. Americans deserve better.   If there are any reasonable Members left in this Republican majority,  it is time for them to do the right thing and pay our Nation's bills.                            ____________________
