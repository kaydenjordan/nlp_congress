 Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleague from Florida  for her leadership and this opportunity to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in condemning the  Supreme Court's decision to roll back decades of judicial precedents  and strike down race-conscious admissions efforts.   Since 1978, the Supreme Court had consistently held that race-based  admission policies in colleges and universities are in the best  interest of educational institutions, but this recent radical decision  will dismantle efforts to ensure higher education is accessible to all  students, further questioning the legitimacy of this politicized  Supreme Court, which seems more eager to protect legacy admissions than  providing students who are historically disadvantaged with equal  opportunity to a quality education.                                time  2045    Diversity makes our Nation stronger, and the repercussions of this  decision will be felt for generations.   Members of the Congressional Black Caucus stand united in our fight  for a more equitable society, and we will continue to push for equal  opportunity admissions for students across this country.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove), my colleague.
