 Mr. President, as the leader and I announced yesterday,  we have an agreement in place to vote on passage of the Defense  authorization bill today and then on an amendment to the bill tomorrow,  led by Senators Udall, Kaine, Merkley, Murphy, Paul, and Lee, to  accommodate all Senators who wish to vote. That is why we are doing it  tomorrow. If the Udall amendment is passed, it would be adopted to the  Defense authorization bill even though the vote occurs afterward.   I want to thank the leader for understanding our position that the  Senate ought to vote on this important amendment, which in essence  would prohibit funds for hostilities with Iran without an affirmative  authorization from Congress. Congress gets to approve or disapprove  wars, period. It is crucial for the Senate and Congress as a whole to  examine potential conflicts and to exercise our authority in matters of  war and peace.   Let's start with the facts. Ever since President Trump withdrew from  the Iran nuclear deal, our two countries have been on a path toward  conflict. For the past month, we have been locked in a cycle of  escalating tensions with Iran. Iran attacked a tanker in the Gulf  region and shot down a U.S. surveillance drone. The U.S. Government has  responded to both provocations, and the President reportedly considered  and then pulled back on a military strike.   The American people are worried--and rightly so--that even if the  President isn't eager for war, he may bumble us into one. Small  provocations in the Middle East can often spin out of control. Our  country has learned that the hard way. When the President is surrounded  by hawkish advisers like John Bolton and Secretary Pompeo, the danger  is even more acute.   So while the majority leader says that ``no one is talking about  war,'' that is only true until the folks do start talking about war,  and by then, the chance to clarify that this President requires  congressional authorization before engaging in major hostilities may  have passed us by.   And this not talking about war? Well, the President said he was 10  minutes away from major provocation, if the reports are correct. It  would have been on Iranian soil, three missile bases. And the President  at one point said, in effect: We will smash Iran, blow it to  smithereens--or something to that effect. People are talking about war.  This President is.  [[Page S4590]]    Even though it is plainly written in the Constitution that the  legislature alone, not the Executive, has the power to declare war, the  Trump administration is already signaling that it doesn't need  Congress. The President and his team are playing up links between al- Qaida and Iran, potentially setting the stage for them to claim legal  authority under the sweeping 2001 authorization of military force to  strike Iran without congressional approval.   The President himself, asked if he believes he has the authority to  initiate military action against Iran without first going to Congress,  replied, ``I do.'' He continued, ``I do like keeping Congress abreast,  but I don't have to do it legally.''   So when it comes to a potential war with Iran, Mr. President Trump,  yes, you do. You do. You do.   The Founding Fathers--our greatest wisdom in this country--worried  about housing war powers in the executive branch for precisely this  reason.   As James Madison wrote to Jefferson, who was not there when they were  writing the Constitution--he was plenipotentiary to France--here is  what Madison wrote to Jefferson:         The constitution supposes, what the History of all       Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of       power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has       accordingly, with studied care, vested the question of war to       the Legislature.    That is Madison, who put more into this Constitution than anyone  else.   Let me read it again. It is clear as a bell. Madison wrote to  Jefferson:         The constitution supposes, what the History of all       Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of       power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has       accordingly, with studied care, vested the question of war to       the Legislature.        If there were ever a President who fits that description, it  is Donald Trump.    The Framers worried about an overreaching Executive waging unilateral  war. My colleagues know well that we haven't had an overreaching  Executive like the one we have now for quite some time, if ever. So if  it comes to it, we should expect the President to challenge Congress's  war powers. He has basically already told us that he would.   So my colleagues should vote to strengthen our ability to oversee  this President's strategy with Iran. That is what the bipartisan Udall  amendment would do--nothing more. There has been some fearmongering  about how the amendment might tie the hands of our military. It would  not. It is explicitly written that in no way should it be construed to  prevent the U.S. military from responding to an act of aggression or  from acting in self-defense.   It is high time that Congress reestablish itself as this Nation's  decider of war and peace. We have been content too long to let the  Executive take all of the initiatives and responsibility for military  action abroad. The American people are weary of the endless conflicts  in the Middle East and the loss of American lives and American  treasure.   The Udall amendment would mark the beginning of Congress reasserting  its constitutional powers. I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to vote yes tomorrow.                             G20 Economic Summit    Mr. President, President Trump has arrived at the G20 economic summit  in Japan before traveling for a state visit in South Korea. Already,  the President has managed to insult our longstanding allies, including  Germany and Japan, the host nation.   Rather than undermining our alliances, here are two important things  the President should do at the G20:   First, Russia and Vladimir Putin. When President Trump sits down with  the Russian President, he must send an unmistakable warning that the  United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections  in 2020. President Trump has no excuse. The Mueller report, FBI  Director Wray, virtually our entire intelligence community concluded  that Russia was guilty of interfering in our elections and that 2020  would be the next big show.   President Trump has a responsibility to defend the United States. By  directly challenging Putin, he will send a signal not merely to Putin  but to all of our adversaries that interfering with our election is  unacceptable and that they will pay a price--a strong price--for  trying.   Second, China and President Xi. Now that trade negotiations between  our countries seemed to have stalled, there is a chance to put them  back on track. For that to happen, the President must remain strong. He  cannot go soft now and accept a bad deal that falls short of reforming  China's rapacious economic policies--cyber espionage, forced technology  transfers, state-sponsorship, and, worst of all, denial of market  access.   President Trump, you know it. We have talked about it. You have a  once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform China's economic relations  with the world and put American businesses and American workers on a  level playing field. Stay tough. Don't give in. Make sure Huawei cannot  come to the United States and we cannot supply it. Enough with the  criticism for our allies. Aim it at our adversaries, China and Russia,  and you will have a much better chance of making the G20 a success for  American interests.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes,  equally divided.    Mr. President, I am voting in favor of the Romney  amendment, No. 861, because it does nothing more than restate the  longstanding principle that the Armed Forces of the United States have  the ability to defend themselves and citizens of the United States from  foreign attack. The  [[Page S4600]]  amendment does not constitute an authorization to use military force,  nor is there anything in the amendment that confers any new authority  on the President.   As Senator Romney, the author of the amendment, stated on the floor a  half-hour ago, ``[t]his [amendment] is not an authorization to use  military force against Iran or anyone else. . . . Under the  Constitution, only Congress may declare war.''   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2042         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
