 Mr. Chairman, I greatly appreciate everybody  recognizing the importance of the hardworking folks at the Defense  Financing Accounting Services.   Lots of our fellow Americans might not realize that DFAS has an  incredibly important function to cut the payroll checks for our men and  women in uniform, and also they pay the vendors, suppliers, and  contractors that keep our military operating; 122 million transactions  last year.   Mr. Chairman, during the past 20 years, the Pentagon has consolidated  300 DFAS offices into 10 today, and the civilian workforce has been  reduced from 27,000 to 13,000.   Mr. Chairman, I am so pleased and grateful that the Armed Services  Committee and the Rules Committee are advancing my amendment to clarify  that there is no intention by the House of Representatives to further  consolidate any DFAS location or jobs.   Mr. Chairman, I am so proud of the 600 hardworking Mainers who cut  checks for our brave military personnel at the DFAS facility in  Limestone, Maine, way up north in Aroostook County. These 600 Maine  jobs are so important to our families and also to our military  personnel.
