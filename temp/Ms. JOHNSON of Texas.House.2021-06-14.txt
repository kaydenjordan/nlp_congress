 Madam Speaker, for over 150 years, June 19th,  commonly known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day,'' has been celebrated  as a source of inspiration and encouragement for generations of African  Americans in Texas and across the nation. News of the end of slavery  did not reach the frontiers of the United States until months after the  conclusion of the Civil War, and more than two and a half years after  President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on  January 1, 1863. It was not until June 19, 1865 that Union soldiers,  led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston, Texas with  news of freedom for the enslaved.   The Roman philosopher Cicero once quoted, ``history is the witness  that testifies to the passing of time; it illumines reality, vitalizes  memory, provides guidance in daily life and brings us tidings of  antiquity.'' In honor of the spirit, of the trials and tribulations of  our ancestors, and the legacy they have left, we must never forget our  history. And we can do that by joining together to observe Juneteenth  and celebrate the progress we have made thereafter, while also  recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to the work that remains. We  can do this by remembering who we are, where we came from, and  rejoicing now in the freedom and liberties that we share--and by never  taking them for granted.                            ____________________
