 Mr. Chairman, I am asking that we include my provision  for raising funds for the Department of the Interior's assistance to  territories in this en bloc amendment.   This is a very modest uptick of the $1 million in Federal support for  the United States territories, namely the Virgin Islands, Guam,  Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. It is crucial that the  Federal Government keep its commitment to address the pressing needs of  Americans living in these territories as we face grave natural disaster  and security threats.   Right now, thousands of people are feeling the effects of one of the  most catastrophic hurricanes ever to strike the Caribbean region.  Hurricane Irma has toppled buildings and leveled many homes. Making the  Virgin Islands whole again will require massive and coordinated efforts  spanning a long period of time.   Much of the Federal Government's support for Americans in U.S.  territories comes out of this territorial assistance account, with  funding channeled toward necessary community facilities like schools,  hospitals, and critical infrastructure systems. This support is  imperative.   After this hurricane, one of our hospitals is partially destroyed.  The other faces egregious deferred maintenance issues due, in part, to  an extremely high proportion of uncompensated care because the  territories face inequitable treatment in Federal health programs like  Medicaid and Medicare.   Construction or repair to schools and hospitals account for much of  the capital improvement project expenditures that come directly out of  this assistance to the territories' account.   We are asking that the territories receive the same funding that they  have received previously, and please approve this amendment to reverse  this cut as a simple matter of fairness to the territories.
