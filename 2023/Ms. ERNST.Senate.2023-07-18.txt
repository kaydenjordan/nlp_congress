 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Bloom Floral of Algona, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Driven by her passion for designing floral arrangements, Kelsey  Thompson founded Bloom Floral in 2011 to serve customers in Algona and  the surrounding communities in North Iowa. Bloom Floral is a full- service floral and gift shop that offers a one-stop shop for fresh  flowers. In addition, the shop offers permanent botanicals, live  plants, and home decor. Bloom Floral specializes in weddings and events  with a passion for creating floral designs personalized for each  customer. Kelsey and her staff travel all over north Iowa to provide  wedding flowers, event setup, and rental items for wedding customers.  Bloom Floral's design team has over 60 years of combined experience and  is dedicated to providing the freshest flowers and top-level community  service.   In addition to teaching hands-on courses and mentoring other  florists, Kelsey runs ``Petals & Profits,'' an online resource and  content membership to help florists with business and marketing.  Additionally, she produces a podcast called ``The Retail Florist'' that  promotes her business and floral expertise. Kelsey is a nationally  accredited designer and member of the Iowa Florists' Association. In  addition to running Bloom Floral, Kelsey also serves as the president  of the Algona Chamber of Commerce and sits on the Algona Retail  Revolving Loan Fund committee. In September 2022, Kelsey won the first  place award in the Sylvia Cup Design Competition at the annual Society  of American Florists convention.   Bloom Floral's continual commitment to supplying floral arrangements  in Algona is outstanding. I want to congratulate Kelsey Thompson and  the entire team at Bloom Floral for the passion and care they put into  each and every arrangement, wedding, and workshop. I look forward to  seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
