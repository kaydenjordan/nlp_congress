 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Granger  for yielding. But first, let me acknowledge the service of our chair,  Mrs. Lowey. I am so grateful for her graciousness, friendship, and  especially the extraordinary example the gentlewoman sets in working  with Ranking Member Granger, for the shepherding of our great  committee. I thank the gentlewoman so much for her service.   I also want to thank my good friend, Chairman Bishop, for the close  working relationship that we have developed. Chairman Bishop has worked  very hard to accommodate the many requests from our side of the aisle.  I really value the constructive manner in which he was able to express  his perspective, and we were able to work together toward constructive  outcomes.   The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that this bill largely reflects the  cooperative spirit of the agricultural community in America as well as  this committee.   Now, Mr. Speaker, if I could divert for a moment, I want to tell a  little story. My daughter Christine is 17. She got up at about 4:30  this morning. Blurry-eyed, she made her way over to a local parking  lot, got on a bus, and went about 30 miles into a cornfield where she  and many other young people begin to pick the tassels off the corn,  fighting off rash and insects.   They work most of the day until it is too hot to work anymore. She  will come home tired and exhausted, and tomorrow, she and others will  get up and do it again and again.   This is a rite of passage in Nebraska. It is called detasseling. What  it does is it creates this beautiful, lifelong lesson for young people,  connecting effort to reward and the satisfaction of a job well done.   So it is with the farmer, Mr. Speaker. Agriculture, in so many ways,  both provides and unifies, and that is why I am proud to be ranking  member of the subcommittee.   Whatever policy differences we may have, particularly over budgets or  transitional work requirements, it is clear that this bill affects the  life of every American in many, many important ways.   I would like to highlight three of those: food security, rural  broadband, and our Nation's drug supply.   First, this bill makes sure that vulnerable Americans have proper  nutrition. Members on both sides of the aisle have shown strong support  for nutrition programs, including the women's, infants', and children's  nutrition program called WIC and the Commodity Supplemental Food  Program for the needy elderly. There are many other nutrition programs  that receive strong support, as well.   Our committee and the entire Congress have worked well together to  meet our current needs and to build upon these base programs to support  those who have suffered the indignity of food insecurity, which is  heightened right now during the midst of this pandemic.   Second, our health not only depends upon good food, but it depends  upon the integrity of our drug supply.   During the pandemic, America learned what we here already knew: We  are importing drugs and drug ingredients from countries that do not  necessarily share our commitment to transparency, quality, or the  protection of labor.   Approximately 80 percent of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are  sourced from outside of the United States. The bill directs the FDA to  block entry of products from those drug manufacturing plants overseas  that prevent immediate inspection just like we have in America.  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I would be more comfortable if I saw the ``Made  in America'' label on each prescription bottle.   Third, telehealth, tele-education, and telework are here to stay and  are revolutionizing the way we think about and structure community. But  here is our problem: Too many parts of the country don't have access to  high-speed internet, about 35 percent of rural areas and, as has been  noted, some urban areas as well.   A mother from Columbus, Nebraska--a community that is rural in  character of about 25,000 people--recently told us that she had to  drive to the local public school parking lot in order to access their  broadband and their WiFi to help her child do homework. I think we can  do better than this, Mr. Speaker.   This bill does provide over $1 billion of funding for the expansion  of rural broadband and new metrics to measure  [[Page H3795]]  its success. Because it is not just about service providers or wires  laid; it is about functionality and the mission of what I call creating  an ecosystem of livability.   The ideas behind what is traditionally called rural development  really do need to change. The farm of the future concept will be driven  by data-driven solutions, precision agriculture, and resilient ag  practices that increase productivity, generate value-added products,  enhance sustainability in ag communities, and put an important emphasis  on local foods in addition to the expansion of the opportunities for  telehealth, telework, and tele-education.                                time  1500    I want to also note something that Chairman Bishop has done. He has  placed an important emphasis on expanding resources to historically  Black colleges and universities, an area where we can all look for  enhanced opportunity.   Let me note the current challenges at the source of a disagreement in  the bill.   One of the objections relates to the budget used by the majority to  fund these 12 bills in violation of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.   Another objection is less about numbers and more about our commitment  to one another. The problem is that the bill permanently disallows any  future changes on work requirements in the SNAP program. From my  perspective, when times are good and the economy is strong, the program  should be allowed to adjust accordingly as persons seek meaningful  work.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing our work together to  improve this bill and, once we do so, to potentially pass it into law.
