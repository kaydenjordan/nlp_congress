 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, FLETC,  chief financial officer, Donald Lewis, who is retiring after 40 years  of Federal service.   Mr. Lewis started his Federal career when he was just a student back  in 1983 as an audit assistant for the Federal Junior Fellowship Program  at Kings Bay Naval Base in Georgia. From there, he was able to move up  into the procurement career field by taking on different positions with  the Naval Facilities Engineering Command and the Strategic Weapons  Facility.   In 2004, Donald joined FLETC and worked in different positions before  becoming the current assistant director and chief financial officer. As  assistant director and chief financial officer, he provides strategic  direction and executive oversight of FLETC business activities, which  include executing and overseeing an annual budget of over $600 million.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Lewis on his remarkable achievements  and on his upcoming retirement. His years of distinguished service are  extremely admirable.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bill because American consumers are directly impacted by the cost of  vehicles.   Unfortunately, the EPA is trying to force Americans into only being  able to pick from some of the most expensive vehicles on the market-- electric vehicles.   The Energy and Commerce Committee received testimony in April that  the average price of an EV is $13,000 more than the average price of an  internal combustion engine vehicle.   Detroit News Editorial Board reported last week that the new average  EV list price was 28 percent higher than a gasoline vehicle last month,  according to CarGurus.   In addition, insurance for an EV is also $44 more expensive per month  versus $528 more expensive per year than insurance for gas-powered  cars. EVs are 50 percent more expensive to fix in the case of an  accident, according to Forbes.   The price of a vehicle is incredibly important to my constituents and  those of my colleagues because access to a car is tied to improved  economic outcomes for low-income households.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill to preserve affordable  vehicle choices for Americans.
