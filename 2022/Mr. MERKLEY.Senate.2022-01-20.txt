 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Indian Affairs be discharged from further consideration  and that the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 482.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, that the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 28.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I believe we are all familiar with the  question: If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it,  does it make a sound? Well, here in the U.S. Senate, we can ask the  question: If we accomplish something important but fail to communicate  that to our constituents, did it actually happen?   The majority of the American people have so much on their plates that  they are not following the intricate, daily workings of this Chamber,  so they expect their Senators to speak to them on a regular basis about  the work they are doing on their behalf.   As the author and former Presidential speechwriter James Humes has  said: ``The art of communication is the language of leadership.'' That  is why each and every one of us, in turn, relies on the dedicated men  and women to help us communicate with folks back home.   I am here on the floor today to say farewell to a member of my team  who has been so instrumental in helping me communicate to the people of  Oregon.   For the past now 7\1/2\ years, Ray Zaccaro has served as my  communications director. What a 7\1/2\ years it has been, especially  when you consider how drastically the media and communications  landscape has changed in that 7\1/2\ years. We have gone from local  newspapers and cable news in serving as the dominant means of mass  communication to Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and Snapchat and  TikTok and others that are far too numerous for me to keep track of,  but that is why we have a communications team.   One day, produced video content performed the best. The next, it was  suddenly selfie-style videos. Videos used to do very well on Facebook.  When the algorithms changed, they didn't do so well. Then Instagram  reels took off, and on and on and on. It is incredible how fast the  communication world keeps changing. Since March of 2020, it has only  gotten more chaotic as the pandemic has turned everything upside down,  including how we consume information and how we communicate.   Ray Zaccaro expertly helped me and the entire team navigate this  ever-shifting media landscape. As recording studios shut down, he  mobilized the communications team to quickly transition to use a vast  array of tools, including Skype and Zoom, so that we could continue to  get our message and timely information to the people of Oregon.   That foresight and quick action are just extensions of his entire  approach to communication--always challenging the members of our team  to think outside the box and never being afraid to suggest new ideas,  no matter how crazy they might initially seem. It doesn't matter if  they work in communications or on the legislative team or with  constituent services. He believes everyone on the team has a role to  play in helping to develop and tell the story of what we are working to  do. And he has proven right, time and time again, over the last 7-plus  years.    When Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General under the previous  administration,  [[Page S388]]  gave his ``zero tolerance'' speech, I said to my team: It sounds like  he is planning for a policy of tearing children out of their parents'  arms down at the border, and I am sure that is hyperbole because no  American administration would ever do that to children.   A member of my team said: There is one way to find out. Go down there  yourself.   Well, Ray, who is sitting behind me on the bench, took that idea and  ran with it. We went down there the following Sunday, down to Texas,  and he used his cell phone to livestream our attempts to try and  ascertain exactly what was happening to young boys and girls.   At a detention facility in McAllen, we were the first legislative  team to witness that, indeed, Team Trump was ripping children out of  their parents' arms. I will never forget, as Ray and I walked into that  facility, there was a group of press outside who said: What are you  going to find?   I said: I have no idea, but I will talk with you all when we come  out.   Ray and I went in and saw those children in cages. And as we were  being given a tour, I remember this group of young boys who were in one  of the cages. They were being asked to line up--there were about 10 of  them--from the shortest to the tallest, and the youngest was knee-high  to a grasshopper. He was just maybe 4 years old.   I asked: Where did these young boys come from?   He said: Well, we brought them in that door over there, and we took  them away from their parents.   And in that warehouse room, the parents were in other cyclone fence  cages. And if the boys peered really hard, they might possibly see a  parent or a sister, a father or mother, an uncle somewhere in that  warehouse, but they had no idea what fate awaited them.   We went outside and talked to the press outside and told them what  was happening. And in a flash, it was national news about what was  going on by our government in their treatment of young children.   We went up the road to Brownsville. We had heard that there were a  few hundred boys possibly being held in a former Walmart. I thought  that was an astounding story, not possibly true, but should we go and  check it out? Ray and I decided we would.   We went up to this former Walmart. It had barriers to keep you from  parking in the former Walmart parking lot so we walked across the  grounds to the door, where, by cell phone, I called up the number that  was inside and said: We are here. I am a U.S. Senator, and we would  like to have a tour, please, of your facility, if we could speak with  your manager or your manager could come out and talk with us.  Eventually, the manager did come out. His assistant had said he would  be talking to us, but, actually, what he did was he called the police.  And he didn't come out until the police cars were arriving.   I think Ray, who was livestreaming the whole thing, secretly wanted  me to be arrested and carried off in handcuffs to magnify the impact of  the story. I am sorry, Ray, that it didn't come to that, but the story  had a tremendous impact.   They would not let me into that Walmart to see what was going on, but  the national scandal that ensued in the days that followed meant the  press of the United States of America got in the following weekend, and  a national debate started about who are we as citizens of the United  States of America and who is our government and what are we doing to  these children?   It turned out there were not a few hundred boys in that facility;  there were a few boys short of 1,500 in that single former Walmart.   The work that Ray did that day revealed the truth of Trump's actions  and shocked this Nation and moved this Nation to action. Horrified, as  we continued to learn about the realities of the situation, Ray kept up  the drumbeat with his contacts in the media throughout months that  followed to ensure that that story of traumatized children and how we  can help them continued, and those children were never forgotten.   Let me be clear. It wasn't just the power of the story or the  opportunity to get his boss--me--on television; he kept up the drumbeat  because he is a passionate person who cares deeply about others.   Countless members of Team Merkley could recount stories about a time  when Ray went out of his way to help them, to provide comfort and  support when they were going through a difficult moment in their lives,  or just a call to check in on how someone is doing or a full-blown  Italian feast delivered to the home of a fellow team member grieving  the loss of a loved one. And as his work with those migrant children  separated from their parents at the border showed, he doesn't have to  know you personally to care deeply.   One time Ray was out with me in Oregon for a series of townhalls, and  a constituent showed up who was having a personal crisis. Ray went out  of his way to make sure that man got the help he needed, while still  continuing to do the other aspects of his job: attending to members of  the media, guiding and supporting staff in their respective tasks, and  ensuring that the constituent had everything he needed.   That is just who he is, the type of person who will drop everything  if someone needs help, who will offer up his own apartment so his boss  can come film an important, last-minute video when the planned location  fell through.   I couldn't begin to count how many late nights and early mornings we  spent together sitting for media interviews. I am thinking right now,  here on the floor of the Senate, of a night a few years ago, when I was  here through the night, speaking for over 15 hours straight to protest  the theft of a Supreme Court seat by our former President and then- Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Throughout the night, there was Ray,  in between running back and forth to the office to take calls from  reporters and producers, returning to flip floor charts as my speech  proceeded.   Thank you, Ray, for all that you have done for the team, for the  people of Oregon, and for the people of this Nation. Thank you for your  tireless efforts to utilize communication tools at our disposal to  protect our democracy and enhance the important issues that face our  Nation, from healthcare to housing, to education, to living-wage jobs,  to equality of opportunity, to taking on climate chaos. Thank you for  bringing the passionate and longstanding commitment to democratic  politics and principals that were forged in your early experiences back  home in Long Island, and you brought them to Capitol Hill.   It is hard to picture what our Team Merkley experience will be after  you leave because you have been such an integral part for so long. But  know that while you will be deeply missed, we all wish you nothing but  the best in this next chapter of your life as you continue fighting to  build a better world.   Thank you.                            ____________________
