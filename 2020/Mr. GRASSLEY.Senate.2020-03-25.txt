 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, as the chairman of the Finance Committee  and the head of the Tax Task Force, I want to highlight a few areas of  the bipartisan economic relief bill we will be voting on today.   Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their  families and get through our current health crisis look like this:  $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples, and $500 for each  child. There is no minimum, no phase-in. It starts out at the lowest  level.   Anyone with a Social Security number who is not a dependent of anyone  else should be eligible for a check under the income caps.   We also have very strong unemployment compensation additions to the  present program in this bill. We also have incentives to help charities  because they play a very important role in this recovery.   My colleagues across the aisle said last week that the business tax  issues were corporate bailouts. That couldn't be further from the  truth, and I think my Democratic colleagues now agree. This is about  helping our workers keep their jobs.   Our economic relief package to recover this economy has provisions to  help businesses so that they have the cash to keep the doors open and  keep making payroll. We all worked hard, along with the administration,  to get this job done.   Now it is time to vote on this bill and deliver relief for the  American people and to recover this economy--get the strong economy  back that we had.   I yield the floor                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I know we have a very important piece of  legislation before us to turn this economy around and help in our  battle against the virus. While we are waiting to vote on that, I have  come to the floor for a couple of points that I would like to make.   The first one is to honor a famous Iowan. This month is Iowa History  Month, so I have come to the floor to speak about one of Iowa's  favorite sons, Dr. Norman Borlaug, whose birthday is today.   He is considered the father of the Green Revolution. Raised on a farm  near Cresco, IA, Borlaug is credited with saving more lives than anyone  in history with his breakthroughs in agronomy. It took him several  years to accomplish what a lot of scientists do now in a laboratory in  regard to fighting diseases in plants. He did this in Mexico and India.   His work helped to overcome malnutrition and famine across the world,  saving over 1 billion lives in the process.   His achievements won him the Nobel Peace Prize--not only that famous  prize but also the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional  Gold Medal. I think there are only five or six people who fall into the  category of winning all three of those prizes.  [[Page S2043]]    His achievements also prompted the State of Iowa to honor him with  one of Iowa's two statues in Statuary Hall here in the U.S. Capitol.                                 Coronavirus    Mr. President, on another subject, some pundits, and even Members of  this body, have suggested that it is inappropriate to criticize the  Chinese Communist Party for its mishandling of the coronavirus that  originated in Wuhan, China, because it distracts from bashing the  President. We went from mainstream media outlets routinely referring to  the virus by its origin to this being totally politically incorrect.   There is an excellent timetable published by Axios that lays out the  Chinese coverup that prevented early action to contain the virus. The  Chinese pro-democracy activist, Wei Jingsheng, warned that General  Secretary Xi is ordering people back to work prematurely, risking  another massive outbreak of what he called Wuhan pneumonia.   Telling the truth about the Communist Party's misdeeds does not  preclude talking about how we can improve our own response. We can  learn from free countries like South Korea, which has been able to  contain a widespread outbreak, and Taiwan and Japan, which appear to  have been able to prevent widespread outbreaks.   So this is not the time for political correctness or political point- scoring to get in the way of telling the truth or working together in a  clear-eyed way to address the challenges at hand.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
