 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his  remarks on American energy and American energy independence,  particularly the work we have done in Wyoming and Colorado. When you  think about the opportunities we have to free up markets for Colorado  and Wyoming produced oil or gas, it is truly remarkable.   The Senator and I also share the great work that takes place at F.E.  Warren Air Force Base. F.E. Warren Air Force Base has a significant  role to play in the nuclear triad, with facilities in both Colorado and  Wyoming. That is obviously something very important to our national  security.   One of the other things I think is important to bring to this  conversation that the Senator from Wyoming talked about is the national  security component that energy can play and the important role that it  has. We can export our energy not just to the Midwest or to the eastern  parts of this country, but we can take that gas produced in Wyoming and  Colorado and export it to Asia and Europe, to countries that want  American energy, that desire American energy resources, not energy  resources from tyrants and dictators like Russia and other places we  see around the globe.   This is an opportunity for us to really show, and I commend my  colleague for his leadership on energy.
