Technical amendments to National Emergency  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are reminded about the threats  facing our country on a daily basis. When they turn on the TV or pick  up the newspaper, they learn about the latest terror attack or plot,  foreign governments engaged in cyber warfare, and drug smugglers and  human traffickers relentlessly trying to creep across our border and  infect our neighborhoods.   Our adversaries are determined and agile. They wish to strike our  homeland and disrupt our way of life. They are constantly calling for  new attacks to be carried out against Americans with any weapons they  have available.   To stay ahead of our enemies, we need a national security apparatus  that is best set up for success and can adapt to new challenges as they  arise.   After the 9/11 attacks, the creation of the Department of Homeland  Security was necessary to help confront the threats at that time.  Unfortunately, Congress has never reauthorized DHS since it was  created. This is just simply unacceptable, and that is why eight  committee chairmen signed a memorandum of understanding at the  beginning of the year stating: ``The Department of Homeland Security  and its components should be authorized on a regular basis to ensure  robust oversight and improve its operation.''   If we are going to keep America safe, we must reform and improve DHS  [[Page H6110]]  through a first-ever comprehensive reauthorization. The legislation  before us today accomplishes several goals.   First, it reasserts Congress' Article I authority granted by the  Constitution to write laws and give discretion to the Department.  Congress has abdicated its role and responsibility in providing  comprehensive legislative direction since 2002, and has ceded power to  the executive branch. This legislation will fix that.   Second, it creates efficiencies by eliminating, consolidating, and  streamlining programs and offices. With dangers gathering and the  terrorist threat evolving, we need the most nimble DHS possible for the  Secretary to lead and carry out the Department's vital mission.   Third, this bill protects American taxpayers by making DHS more  accountable. Through new cost-efficiency efforts, we will be able to  provide the funds necessary to keep our country safe while identifying  and eliminating government waste.   Fourth, our legislation will support our frontline defenders and  first responders. This bill will provide the tools and training needed  to defeat emerging threats through important grant programs while also  allowing DHS to better focus on recruiting and training a qualified  workforce.   Finally, it improves America's security. Specifically, this  reauthorization will: strengthen the Department's ability to deny  terrorists entry into the United States; ensure that Federal agencies  meet readiness standards to respond to terror attacks and natural  disasters; expand TSA's use of explosive detection technology and  bolster security at last points of departure; it will also modernize  and replace outdated Coast Guard vessels; it will prioritize  investigations of cross-border crimes, including human trafficking,  cybercrimes, and drug smuggling.   These are necessary measures that we, as Congress, must take to fight  back against the array of ever-changing threats. This legislation is a  commonsense and bipartisan bill that is long overdue. It also enjoys  strong backing from the administration.   In testimony given to my committee, Secretary Kelly stated: ``This is  an important endeavor which will provide the Department with the  authorities it needs to carry out its mission.''   And just recently today in an op-ed that ran this morning in support  of this bill, Secretary Kelly wrote: ``There is no more important  mission--no duty more sacred--than protecting the people of the United  States, and I strongly encourage Members in both parties to support  this legislation.''   Protecting our homeland and keeping American families safe are shared  goals that should bring both parties together, not push us apart, and a  comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of Homeland Security  will be a major bipartisan accomplishment and an example of what we can  achieve when we put the safety and security of our country ahead of  partisan politics.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the majority leader for all his  efforts to help bring this to the floor. I would also like to thank  each of the chairmen of jurisdiction for signing the MOU, as well as  members of the Committee on Homeland Security from both sides of the  aisle, and the staff members who made this possible.   Let's show our enemies that we stand united in protecting our  country, our values, and our people. So I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I am writing with respect to H.R.       2825, the ``Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act       of 2017.'' This bill contains provisions within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means will not seek a sequential       referral on H.R. 2825 so that it may proceed expeditiously to       the House floor for consideration. This is done with the       understanding that the jurisdictional interests of the       Committee on Ways and Means over this and similar legislation       are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the       Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 2825       and requests your support when such a request is made.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 2825 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the       House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland Security       Authorization Act of 2017.'' I appreciate your support in       bringing this very important legislation reauthorizing the       Department of Homeland Security before the House of       Representatives, and appreciate the willingness of the       Committee on Ways and Means to forego seeking a sequential       referral.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral on this       bill at this time, the Committee on Ways and Means does not       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition,       should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would       support your request to have the Committee on Ways and Means       represented on the conference committee for provisions within       your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, June 23, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.         Dear Chairman McCaul:  I write concerning H.R. 2825, the       ``Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of       2017.'' This legislation includes matters that fall within       the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite Floor consideration of H.R. 2825, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo       action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate you working with us on the text of       the bill and request you urge the Speaker to name members of       the Committee to any conference committee named to consider       such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the       Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the       bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on       Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland Security       Authorization Act of 2017.'' I appreciate your support in       bringing this very important legislation reauthorizing the       Department of Homeland Security before the House of       Representatives, and appreciate the willingness of the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to forego       seeking a sequential referral.

In addition, should a conference on this bill       be necessary, I would support your request to have the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on       the conference committee for provisions within your       jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.                                   ____                                          Committee on Oversight and                                               Government Reform,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2017.       Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. McCaul: I am writing to you concerning the       jurisdictional interests of the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform in H.R. 2825, the ``Department of  [[Page H6111]]       Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017,'' which was       ordered reported favorably to the House by the Committee on       Homeland Security on June 14, 2017.        Our committee recognizes the importance of H.R. 2825 and       the need for the legislation to move expeditiously,       notwithstanding my recent investiture as the Chair of the       Oversight Committee one week ago. Therefore, while we have       identified matters of jurisdictional interest to the       Oversight Committee in the bill, I do not intend to request a       sequential referral. This, of course, is conditional on our       mutual understanding that nothing in this legislation or my       decision to forego a sequential referral waives, reduces, or       otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform.        The Oversight Committee's jurisdictional claim stems from       the presence of numerous provisions in H.R. 2825 that       directly implicate the Committee's jurisdiction as defined in       House Rule X. Specifically, the bill as ordered reported       includes provisions concerning and even amending title 5,       title 41 and other cross-cutting issues involving the       government writ large, as well as issues that implicate       congressional oversight and access. Just as the Committee has       jurisdiction over legislation that establishes government-      wide requirements or adds agencies or elements to those       requirements, the Committee necessarily has jurisdiction over       legislation that does the reverse--creating exceptions to or       otherwise adversely impacting the applicability of existing       government-wide requirements.        I ask that a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest be included in the       Committee Report and as part of the Congressional Record       during consideration of this bill by the House. The Committee       on Oversight and Government Reform also asks that you support       our request to be conferees on the provisions over which we       have jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference.        I look forward to working with you in my new capacity as       chair of the Oversight Committee. The Committee has been, and       remains, open to working with the Committee on Homeland       Security to ensure that the Committee on Homeland Security       and the federal government as a whole are best equipped to       address any and all national security challenges, through       robust oversight and improved operations of the Department of       Homeland Security.        Thank you for your consideration in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Trey Gowdy,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland Security       Authorization Act of 2017.'' Congratulations on recently       becoming Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform       Committee. I appreciate your support in bringing this very       important legislation reauthorizing the Department of       Homeland Security before the House of Representatives, and       appreciate the willingness of the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform to forego seeking a sequential referral.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral on this       bill at this time, the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the       future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Oversight and Government Reform represented on the       conference committee for provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.                                   ____                                        Committee on Science, Space,                                                  and Technology,                                      Washington, DC, July 19, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 2825, the       ``Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of       2017,'' which was introduced on June 8, 2017.        H.R. 2825 contains provisions within the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. In       order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego       action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our       mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or       alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,       or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and would request that you include a copy       of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record       during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in       advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, July 19, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland Security       Authorization Act of 2017.'' I appreciate your support in       bringing this very important legislation reauthorizing the       Department of Homeland Security before the House of       Representatives, and appreciate the willingness of the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology to forego seeking       a sequential referral.

In addition, should a conference on this bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Science, Space, and Technology represented on the       conference committee for provisions within your jurisdiction.

Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I  want to thank him for his close coordination in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Donovan), chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency  Preparedness, Response, and Communications of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Hunter), chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard  and Maritime Transportation of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), chairman of the Task Force on  Denying Terrorist Entry into the United States of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), chairman of the Subcommittee on  Transportation and Protective Security of the Homeland Security  Committee.

Mr. Speaker, let me give my heartfelt thanks to the ranking member  for his work on this important legislation, first ever. It was a real  team effort on both sides of the aisle. I want to thank all of the  staff on both sides of the aisle, Rosaline Cohen and Jennifer Gorski,  who worked tirelessly.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a January 11, 2017, memorandum  of understanding, signed by myself and seven other committee chairmen.     Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of Homeland                                  Security         We, the chairs of the committees with jurisdiction over the       Department of Homeland Security or its components, are hereby       recording our agreement on the following principles for the       115th Congress:        1. The Department of Homeland Security (``the Department'')       and its components should be authorized on a regular basis to       ensure robust oversight and improve its operation.        2. Committees with jurisdiction over the Department and its       components will prioritize the authorization of the       Department and any unauthorized or expiring component in that       committee's authorization and oversight plan.        3. To the maximum extent practicable, the committees with       jurisdiction over unauthorized or expiring components of the       Department shall coordinate with the Committee on Homeland       Security to produce a comprehensive authorization bill for       the Department.        4. The Committee on Homeland Security shall coordinate with       the committees with jurisdiction over unauthorized or       expiring components of the Department in the development of       any comprehensive authorization bill for the Department.        5. The Committee on Homeland Security and the committees       with jurisdiction over components of the Department shall       jointly develop a process for the vetting and pre-clearing of       base text and amendments offered at subcommittee and full       committee  [[Page H6118]]       markups of a DHS authorization bill in the Committee on       Homeland Security that fall within the jurisdiction of a       committee other than or in addition to the Committee on       Homeland Security.        6. The committees will expedite consideration of any       comprehensive authorization bill for the Department,       including timely resolution of any matters subject to a       sequential or additional referral.        7. To the extent that there are policy differences between       the committees regarding a provision of the comprehensive       authorization bill for the Department, the committees will       make best efforts to resolve any such dispute.        8. The Committee on Homeland Security shall not include any       provision in a comprehensive authorization bill that the       chair of the Committee on Ways and Means has determined to be       a revenue provision or a provision affecting revenue. If the       chair of the Committee on Ways and Means makes such a       determination, nothing in this agreement shall be construed       to preclude that chair from exercising an additional or       sequential referral over the measure, or a point of order       under clause 5(a) of Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives.        9. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as altering       any committee's jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of the       House of Representatives or the referral of any measure       thereunder.        10. Further, nothing in this memorandum precludes a further       agreement between the committees with regard to the       implementation of a process to ensure regular comprehensive       authorizations of the Department.            Signed,          Gregg Walden, Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce;             Michael T. McCaul, Chair, Committee on Homeland             Security; Devin Nunes, Chair, Permanent Select             Committee on Intelligence; Bob Goodlatte, Chair,             Committee on the Judiciary; Jason Chaffetz, Chair,             Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; Lamar             Smith, Chair, Committee on Science, Space and             Technology; Bill Shuster, Chair, Committee on             Transportation and Infrastructure; Kevin Brady, Chair,             Committee on Ways and Means.     Mr. Speaker, in conclusion of this debate, it is very  important to remember that a comprehensive reauthorization of the  Department of Homeland Security has never been done before. While  various reauthorization efforts have been tried in the past, we finally  have a chance to get it across the finish line and have it signed into  law. So let's stand together as Republicans and Democrats and show the  people we represent both parties and that both parties can work with  one another by putting our national security above politics.   This legislation is not just about good governance or bureaucratic  reforms. It is absolutely essential to making sure we are able to  defeat the grave and growing threats facing the United States.   Once again, I want to thank the ranking member and all of his staff;  leadership, as well, and their staff; and, also, all of the members of  the Office of the Legislative Counsel, who got us to this point here  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, July 18, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your follow up letter       regarding H.R. 2825 dated June 27, 2017. I appreciate your       continued willingness to work with me to bring H.R. 2825 to       the House Floor.        As I stated in my June 22, 2017 letter, the Committee on       Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that       by foregoing seeking a sequential referral at this time, the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence does not       waive any jurisdictional interest it may have over provisions       in the bill.        Regarding the provisions referenced in your recent letter,       each of the sections listed were introduced as stand alone       bills, as well as included in H.R. 2825, and the Committee on       Homeland Security was granted the primary referral on such       provisions. As discussed between our staff and in the       exchange of letters, I recognize that your Committee could       request a sequential referral on those provisions. I       reiterate my continued appreciation for the cooperation of       you and your staff in moving H.R. 2825 through the       legislative process.        Per your request, I will include your letters, my response       letters, the ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security'' and accompanying January       11, 2017 exchange of letters in the Congressional Record when       H.R. 2825 is considered on the Floor.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                                     June 27, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for your letter dated June       22, 2017, regarding H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland       Security Authorization Act of 2017.'' I appreciate your       recognition of the jurisdictional interest of the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in legislation       relating to the National Intelligence Program (NIP), as well       as the importance of the ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization       of the Department of Homeland Security'' and our accompanying       January 11, 2017 exchange of letters.        As you note, your letter of January 11 permits the       Committee on Homeland Security to report legislation       including ``Department-wide provisions that could affect       Department elements that happen to receive funding through       the NIP.'' H.R. 2825, however, contains several provisions       that are not ``Department-wide,'' but instead direct the NIP-      funded Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence       and Analysis (I&A) to take specific actions and/or provide       Congress with reports--and are therefore within the exclusive       jurisdiction of HPSCI. Those provisions include:        Section 113--``Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program''        Section 301--``Homeland Intelligence Doctrine''        Section 302--``Analysts For The Chief Intelligence       Officer.''        Section 303--``Annual Homeland Terrorist Threat       Assessments''        Section 311--``Department of Homeland Security Fusion       Center Partnership Initiative''        Per my letter of June 21, HPSCI will continue to forego an       official request for sequential referral. However, I request       that you include a copy of this letter in the Congressional       Record along with the other letters and attachments we       exchanged last week. Thank you again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland Security       Authorization Act of 2017,'' I appreciate your support in       bringing this very important legislation reauthorizing the       Department of Homeland Security before the House of       Representatives, and appreciate the willingness of the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to forego seeking       a sequential referral.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral on this       bill at this time, the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the       future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence represented for provisions       within your jurisdiction on the conference committee.        Additionally, the Committee on Homeland Security recognizes       and appreciates the importance of the Memorandum Regarding       Authorization of the Department of Homeland Security and the       letter exchange on January 11, 2017. The Committee on       Homeland Security contends that per such agreement the bill       reported by the Committee ``does not intend to authorize any       elements of the Department that are funded through the       National Intelligence Program (NIP) . . . . but may include       Department-wide provisions that could affect Department       elements that happen to receive funding through the NIP.''        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                              Michael T. McCaul,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Homeland Security.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                     Washington, DC, June 21, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: H.R. 2825, a bill ``to amend the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make certain improvements in       the laws administered by the Secretary of Homeland Security,       and for other purposes,'' was recently marked up and reported       by your Committee. Given that several provisions of H.R. 2825       implicate National Intelligence Program (NIP)-funded       activities, I am confident that upon request the bill will be       sequentially referred to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (the Committee).        As you know, we signed a Memorandum Regarding Authorization       of the Department of Homeland Security and exchanged letters       on January 11, 2017 (January 2017 Exchange of Letter), to       clarify the Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over NIP-      funded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).       The January 2017 Exchange of Letters  [[Page H6119]]       affirmed that, consistent with the Rules of the House of       Representatives, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) is       the vehicle that through which Congress authorizes annual       appropriations for the NIP, including NIP-funded elements of       the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Moreover, those       letters made explicit that the Committee on Homeland Security       would not report to the House any bill that authorizes any       elements of DHS funded through the NIP, and that if any such       bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security, this       Committee will request a sequential referral of the bill.        In order to expedite the House's consideration of the H.R.       2825, and in recognition of the unique importance of       authorizing legislation for DHS, the Committee will forego an       official request for sequential referral or consideration of       the measure. This courtesy, is however, conditioned on our       mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no way       diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with       respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matter contained in the bill or any similar measure. It is       also conditioned on the Committee on Homeland Security's       adherence to the agreement embodied in the January 2017       Exchange of Letters. In the future, the Committee will not       hesitate to take up non-conforming legislation on sequential       referral.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding and would request that you include in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 2825       a copy of this letter, your response, and the January 2017       Exchange of Letters, including the Memorandum. Thank you in       advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                                  January 11, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: In accordance with paragraph 10 of       the January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' I write to confirm our       mutual understanding of the procedure through which the House       will authorize the elements of the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) funded through the National Intelligence       Program (NIP).        I appreciate your dedication to producing a comprehensive       reauthorization of DHS that will improve congressional       oversight of the Department. As you know, Rule X(11)(b)(1) of       the House of Representatives grants the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence sole jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation . . . relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;'' and       Rule X(j)(3) of the House of Representatives grants the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over the       ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information.''        As you also know, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA)       is the annual vehicle through which Congress authorizes       appropriations for the NIP, including for elements of DHS       that receive funding through the NIP. The IAA includes a       classified schedule of authorizations, incorporated into the       statute by reference, and direction and recommendations in a       classified annex to the report of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence. Nothing in the January 2017       ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of       Homeland Security,'' shall be construed to grant the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over proposed       legislation relating to the NIP or authorizations for       appropriations for the NIP.        In keeping with these principles, the Committee on Homeland       Security will not report to the House any bill that       authorizes any elements of DHS funded through the NIP. If any       such bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security,       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will request a       sequential referral of the bill. Understanding, however, that       both of our committees have a jurisdictional interest in the       Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to       work together to ensure that the Office receives the most       effective congressional guidance.        We further agree that if the Committee on Homeland Security       reports a DHS-wide authorization bill to the House, I may       offer an amendment during consideration of the bill in the       full House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, I will not offer an amendment,       and the DHS-wide authorization bill will not contain any       provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS. We       further agree that you will oppose as nongermane all       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS in       markup in the Committee on Homeland Security. If any       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS are       subsequently offered during consideration by the full House,       you agree to consult with me before taking action.        Finally, we agree that you will support the appointment of       the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence to any committee of conference on a       DHS-wide authorization bill that includes any provisions       related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS.        In accordance with Rule X(11)(b)(2) this understanding does       not preclude either the Committee on Homeland Security or the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from authorizing       other intelligence and intelligence-related activities of       DHS, including, but not limited to, the Homeland Security       Intelligence Program. In keeping with paragraph 5 of the       January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' our committees will work       jointly to vet and clear any provisions of a DHS       authorization bill related to these other intelligence and       intelligence-related activities of DHS. Furthermore, I hope       the staff of our committees can continue to closely and       expeditiously to conduct rigorous oversight of intelligence       activities throughout DHS.        The understanding detailed by this letter is limited to the       115th Congress. It shall not constitute an understanding       between our committees in any subsequent congress.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding. I look forward to working with you to       continue congressional oversight of DHS intelligence       activities, and I thank you in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,      United States Capitol, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter supporting       the Committee on Homeland Security's plans to conduct a       comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of Homeland       Security (``the Department'') in the 115th Congress, as       expressed in the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of       the Department of Homeland Security.''        I appreciate your willingness to help ensure the Department       is fully authorized, and recognize that there may be areas of       jurisdictional interest to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (``Intelligence Committee'') in such an       authorization. Rule X(j)(3) of the House of Representatives       grants the Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over       the ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information,'' while Rule X(11)(b)(1) grants the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act.''        The Committee on Homeland Security does not intend to       authorize any elements of the Department that are funded       through the National Intelligence Program (``NIP'') as part       of the Department authorization bill it reports to the House       this Congress, although we both agree that the reported bill       may include Department-wide provisions that could affect       Department elements that happen to receive funding through       the NIP. Accordingly, I will oppose as nongermaine any       amendments which may be offered in my committee's markup       related to the NIP-funded elements of the Department. I       further agree to consult you before taking any action on       similar amendments which may be offered during consideration       of the bill by the full House.        In the interest of ensuring the most robust Department       authorization possible, we further agree that you may offer       an amendment during consideration of the bill in the full.       House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, you will not offer an amendment.       Understanding, however, that both of our committees have a       jurisdictional interest in the Department's Office of       Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to work together to       ensure that the Office receives the most effective       congressional guidance.        Finally, I reiterate my intention that nothing included in       the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security'' alters the jurisdiction of       either the Committee on Homeland Security or the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence. The Committee on Homeland       Security appreciates the past success we have enjoyed working       with the Intelligence Committee. I am grateful for your       support and look forward to continuing to  [[Page H6120]]       work together toward our mutual goal of ensuring that the       Department and its components arc authorized on a regular       basis.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
