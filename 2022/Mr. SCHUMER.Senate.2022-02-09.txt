 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I get into my remarks, just some  brief housekeeping.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I  understand that there are three bills at the desk due for a second  reading en bloc.    Mr. President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, those are all bills that we hope to move  forward, and so that is why I have rule XIV'd them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, by a margin--a large margin-- of 342 to 92, Congress took the first steps toward creating the most  important upgrade to our post office in decades by passing a bipartisan  reform package that has been years in the making.   With an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote in the House, it is my  intention for the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bipartisan,  bicameral Postal reform bill. We hope to take action here on the floor  and pass the bill before we go to the Presidents Day recess.   The post office is, quite simply, one of the most important  institutions of American life. Every day, tens of millions of  Americans, veterans, small businesses, people living in rural  communities, seniors rely on the Postal Service for their medicines and  prescriptions, for getting essential goods, for voting, for  correspondence, for their livelihoods, and to get close to one another  on special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries and things like  that.   But, nevertheless, our Postal Service has needed reform for over a  decade. Its budgets are severely strained, its delivery services are  overwhelmed, and the  [[Page S582]]  disruptions unleashed by the internet have made it harder for it to  meet its obligations to the American people and to its own employees.   Every one of us has heard objections about letters arriving far too  late. In many instances, whether they be checks that people depend on  for their livelihoods or prescription drugs or whatever, these  complaints are growing and growing and growing.   The bipartisan Postal reform bill offers a much needed reset. It will  guarantee delivery services continue 6 days a week; it will put the  post office on a path back towards solvency; and it will ensure that we  take care of our dedicated Postal workers while also saving the post  office over $50 billion.   Let me summarize again. If this legislation is passed, it would  ensure continued 6-day delivery service, make deliveries more efficient  and timely, and will put the post office on a path to stability.   I want to recognize my colleagues who have made it possible for this  legislation to move forward. First, I thank my friend and colleague  Senator Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government  Affairs Committee, for his leadership in bringing this bill together.   I also want to thank Ranking Member Portman for working across the  aisle on this commonsense reform bill.   And I want to thank all my House colleagues who worked assiduously  for a long, long time pushing for portal reform. Both the chair and the  ranking member of the relevant committees supported the bill on the  floor of the House yesterday.   I have always said Democrats will work on a bipartisan basis whenever  we can pass commonsense legislation that will improve the lives of the  American people.    Last year, bipartisan cooperation helped clear the way for such  things as the historic Anti-Asian Hate Crimes bill, a much needed  competition bill, and our bipartisan infrastructure package.   This work period alone, we have already made great progress on  bipartisan priorities, like ending forced arbitration for sexual  harassment and assault. As I have mentioned, we will soon act on the  post office.   And I expect both sides will support passage of the short-term CR  that will keep the Federal Government open before next week's deadline.   I want to thank the appropriators from both sides of the aisle for  working in good faith, and I am optimistic that soon they will arrive  at an agreement for an omnibus package, which is far more preferable to  the alternative of a yearlong CR.   We are getting very, very close to coming to an agreement on top-line  numbers, and as I said, I am more optimistic than I have been in a very  long time that we will get an omnibus bill done for government spending  for the rest of the year.   So all these priorities--forced arbitration, Postal reform, and  government funding--are bipartisan items that I expect the Senate will  act on before the recess.   As I have always said from my first day as majority leader, we will  work in a bipartisan way whenever we can. We did it in our first year  with things like the Anti-Asian hate crimes legislation, the  competition bill, and the bipartisan infrastructure package. And these  2 weeks now represent a productive continuation of that commitment.   So on this issue, I am optimistic that very soon we will see the  first major reform of America's Postal system in decades. It will be a  win for our dedicated Postal workers and for the American people who  rely on the post office every single day.    Mr. President, for the information of Members, we are  going to have four more votes tonight. I urge Members to sit in their  seats so we can get these done quickly, like we did last week.   I ask unanimous consent that the votes be 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask that the Senate now vote on the  motion to discharge the Bagenstos nomination, as under the previous  order.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the question is  on the motion to discharge.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, February 10; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar  No. 264, H.R. 4445, as provided under the previous order.    For the information of Senators, we expect to have one  rollcall vote at 11:45 a.m. and one vote at 1:45 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:56 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, February 10, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
