 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the VET PFAS  Act, legislation to ensure PFAS-exposed veterans get the healthcare  benefits that they need through the Veterans Administration.   For decades, the Department of Defense has known that toxic PFAS  chemicals cause serious health issues. Yet the VA continues to deny  veterans, like Lieutenant Colonel Sauer, coverage for PFAS-related  illnesses.   Lieutenant Sauer served in the Army for 22 years and was stationed at  10 bases with known PFAS contamination. Due to that exposure, he now  has an uncertain and uncurable form of cancer.   Lieutenant Colonel Sauer is sick because of his service to this  country, but he has been denied access to care from the VA. When  Lieutenant Sauer joined the military, we promised to take care of him  when he came home. Right now, we are not making good on that sacred  promise.   There are thousands of veterans like Lieutenant Colonel Sauer who  have been impacted by harmful PFAS chemicals. That is why I am calling  for us to immediately take up the VET PFAS Act and keep the promise we  made to the people who put on the uniform of this Nation.                            ____________________
