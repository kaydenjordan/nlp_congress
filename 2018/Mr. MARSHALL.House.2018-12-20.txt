 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  [[Page H10402]]  bill (S. 2679) to provide access to and manage the distribution of  excess or surplus property to veteran-owned small businesses.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2679         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Small Business       Enhancement Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. ACCESS TO SURPLUS PROPERTY FOR VETERAN-OWNED SMALL                     BUSINESSES.         Section 32 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657b) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(g) Access to Surplus Property for Veteran-owned Small       Businesses.--        ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `foreign excess property' has the meaning       given the term in section 102 of title 40, United States       Code; and        ``(B) the term `state agency' has the meaning given the       term, including the roles and responsibilities assigned, in       section 549 of title 40, United States Code.        ``(2) Requirement.--The Administrator, in coordination with       the Administrator of General Services, shall provide access       to and manage the distribution of surplus property, and       foreign excess property returned to a State for handling as       surplus property, owned by the United States under chapter 7       of title 40, United States Code, to small business concerns       owned and controlled by veterans (as verified by the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs under section 8127 of title 38,       United States Code) pursuant to a memorandum of agreement       between the Administrator, the Administrator of General       Services, and the head of the applicable state agency for       surplus properties and in accordance with section 549 of       title 40, United States Code.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2679, the Veterans Small  Business Enhancement Act of 2018. This important, bipartisan  legislation, introduced by Senator Duckworth and Senator Kennedy, aims  to help veteran entrepreneurs cut costs and enhance their economic  opportunity by giving them access to surplus Federal property.   The Federal Surplus Property Program allows certain nongovernment  organizations to acquire equipment and property that the Federal  Government no longer needs. This legislation adds veteran-owned small  businesses to the program's list of eligible recipients, which already  includes minority-owned and women-owned small businesses.   The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the National Association of State  Agencies for Surplus Property, and the American Legion support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentlewoman from New York  is prepared as well after her remarks, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
