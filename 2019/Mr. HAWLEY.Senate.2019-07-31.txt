 Mr. President, I oppose the confirmation of U.S. District  Court nominee Karin Immergut. She went through the committee  confirmation process in 2018, before I joined the Senate Judiciary  Committee, and subsequently, she was part of a package of judges who  were renominated and voted out earlier this year. I later learned that  the nominee had issued a questionable abortion opinion and is pro- choice.                            ____________________
