 Mr. Speaker, diplomacy with a tyrant is useless.  [[Page H5086]]    Joe Biden does not sympathize with the plight of States fighting the  border crisis. He revels in it. This is his dream: open borders and  American carnage.   Joe Biden has backed Republican Governors into a corner. They are in  fight or flight mode. Sending letters like this one demanding a meeting  with him on the border is not in the fight mode we need. To him, and  the American people, it is a white flag of surrender.   Republican Governors, do something. You are writing letters to a man  who does not give a damn about you. He does not care about your plight.  He does not care about your State. He does not care about you. Stop  sending letters and start taking action.   Stand up and defend your State today. You have the power. Use it. You  have the resources. Use them. You have the National Guard. Use it. Do  whatever it takes because the Democrats, hellbent on radicalizing  America, are barreling over us with their agenda while we push paper.   Unfortunately, this responsibility has fallen to our Republican  Governors to have to defend our borders and defend our country. If they  fail in this plight, then we will not have a country to remember.   Please, do the job that has, unfortunately, fallen on your shoulders.
