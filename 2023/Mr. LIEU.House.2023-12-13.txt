 Mr. Speaker, when Democrats were in control, we put people  over politics and passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower costs and  to create new jobs. We are also working with the Biden administration  to eliminate junk fees, and we have legislation to address childcare  costs, and to go after people who engage in price gouging.   What do Democrats care about? We care about how we lower costs,  create new jobs, and get our economy going. Because of that, we have  had record GDP growth and unemployment at a 50-year low.   What are Republicans focused on? They are focused on impeachment with  no evidence. Even today, they cannot explain what action President  Biden took that they thought was illegal or criminal.   That is right. They are going forward with impeachment, even though  they cannot explain what crime they think President Biden committed,  because he didn't commit any. It is a waste of people's time.   Republicans are, again, focused on the wrong priorities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I offer  a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 931         Resolved, That the following named Member be, and is       hereby, elected to the following standing committee of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Mr. Amo (to       rank immediately after Ms. McClellan).   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
