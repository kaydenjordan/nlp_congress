 Madam President, nearly 20 years ago, the United States  invaded Afghanistan to prevent that country from being exploited as a  platform for terrorism and extremism. In doing so, the U.S. worked  side-by-side with international and Afghan forces to remove the Taliban  from power, facilitate democratic elections, build democratic  institutions, and promote human rights throughout Afghanistan. Because  of these efforts and the commitment and dedication of the Afghan  people, the Afghanistan of 2021 is far different than the Afghanistan  of 2001. And now that Afghanistan has made this progress, we must work  with our Afghan partners to do everything in our power to preserve  these gains and leave a stable country behind us. It is both a moral  obligation and a national security priority that we do so.   As U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, the safety and security of  our Afghan allies who put their lives on the line to help our  servicemembers and diplomats must be a top priority. This is about  fulfilling a sacred promise that we made to those who served the U.S.- led mission in Afghanistan. It is a service that many Afghans have  already paid for with their lives. Like U.S. personnel, our Afghan  partners  [[Page S5214]]  died on the battlefield alongside Americans. But unlike our own  servicemembers, when the Afghans went home, they were not safe from  danger.   Earlier this year, National Public Radio shared the story of  ``Mohammad'' and his family. ``Mohammad'' is not his name, but a  pseudonym used because of the threats made upon him and his family by  the Taliban. Mohammad was an interpreter who served his country and the  U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan. For this, the Taliban threatened him  and his family. They labeled him a traitor and forced him to seek  safety in the United States through the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa  program. Mohammad was murdered by the Taliban in January, shortly after  his visa to the U.S. was approved--10 years after he applied. Last  month, his family finally arrived in the United States--to safety--but  they did so without Mohammad. His wife and six children are here  without their father, who gave his life in service to his country and  the U.S. mission.   Unfortunately, Mohammad's story is not unique. The Taliban has made  their intentions clear. They call in the dead of the night and leave  notes affixed to houses: ``We know who you are and will kill you.''   The Taliban's brutality against vulnerable populations like our  Afghan allies has increased over the last several months, but as the  U.S. withdrawal nears completion, conditions on the ground have become  all the more dangerous. If the United States does not act quickly to  uphold its promise to these Afghans, our opportunity to get our  partners to safety will pass us by. U.S. action must start with  bolstering the program that was supposed to protect Mohammad, the  Afghan Special Immigrant Visa--SIV--program, and include a secure and  efficient evacuation of our partners by the Biden administration.   There has long been bipartisan support for the Afghan SIV program in  Congress, which I originally championed with the late Senator John  McCain. John personally understood the need to fulfill our moral  obligations to our partners and the strategic value in taking care of  our allies. His example of bipartisan leadership continues today, and  it has served the SIV program well: There is bipartisan, bicameral  determination to take action. That is why Senators Ernst, Durbin,  Wicker, and I introduced the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2021 and  why I am pleased that Congress has taken decisive action to pass this  language with the supplemental budget appropriations bill. President  Biden signed the bill into law today. These actions provide additional  visas and make urgently needed process fixes to the program, which  maintains broad bipartisan support across the political spectrum. This  is necessary to help the U.S. fulfill its obligation to our Afghan  partners, not only because it is the right thing to do, but also  because of what it means for U.S. credibility in future engagements. We  must send a strong message to our current and future allies: If you  stand by our side on the battlefield, we will have your back.   However, these improvements to the process are just the first step in  ensuring our Afghan allies do not suffer for their service. The Biden  administration must now take immediate steps to implement this  legislation and provide for the safety of Afghan SIV applicants.  Congress has demonstrated that there is bipartisan support for  immediate action to protect and support our Afghan SIV applicants and  friends. Our allies around the world are watching.   There is no easy answer on Afghanistan. But one thing is clear: We  cannot leave our Afghan allies behind. With this legislation now law,  we must concentrate all U.S. efforts on supporting and protecting those  who worked with the U.S. Government, as well as those whose work is  diametrically opposed to the views of the Taliban, such as women's  equality advocates. To not do so is to make a grave moral and security  mistake.   I look forward to continuing to work with the administration and my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle in support of our friends in  Afghanistan.                            ____________________
