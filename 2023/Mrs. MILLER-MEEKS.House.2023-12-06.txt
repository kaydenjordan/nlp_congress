 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Indianola Rotary Club for giving Indianola third graders over 5,280  dictionaries since its first year in 2003.   The Indianola Rotary supports youth leadership and literacy for  children and adults. With their literacy focus, they have been able to  support and inspire children in our community. I thank Indianola Rotary  Club members for the time and effort they have donated to their  community.         Congratulating Aaron Bartholmey on His Guinness World Record     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Aaron  Bartholmey on the newly announced Guinness World Record for his pencil  collection.   In July of 2023, the Colfax Historical Society helped to certify the  tally of his record-breaking collection of 69,255 pencils with  assistance from the American Pencil Collectors Society. These wooden  advertising pencils are mostly from local businesses, and one is  recorded as over 100 years old.   His hobby began as a child, after going to a flea market with his  grandfather, and it now has grown into a world record and a passion for  history and local memorabilia.   Congratulations to Aaron Bartholmey on his Guinness World Record, and  best of luck in finding his next pencil.                          Recognizing Kelby Telander     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kelby  Telander for his bravery and resilience.   As a toddler, Kelby Telander struggled with hearing loss and  underwent many surgeries, including a life-changing cochlear implant  surgery at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital.  While a patient, he was selected to be kid captain at the University of  Iowa football game.   As many University of Iowa fans know, before games at Kinnick  Stadium, a patient from the Stead Family Children's Hospital is chosen  as kid captain to lead the University of Iowa football team onto the  field. For Kelby, this was an impressionable experience.   I am proud to recognize that over a decade later, Kelby Telander, a  former kid captain and patient at Stead Family Children's Hospital has  joined the University of Iowa football team as a linebacker. Kelby is  number 25 and recently saw his first career action in the Hawkeyes' 41- 10 win against West Michigan.   I am proud of Kelby Telander for not only joining the powerhouse  Hawkeye football team but for his bravery and resilience.  Congratulations, and Go Hawks.                            ____________________
