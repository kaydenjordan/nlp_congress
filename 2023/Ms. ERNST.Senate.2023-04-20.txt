 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Schumacher Elevator Company of Denver, IA, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   The company was founded by William and Bertha Schumacher in 1936  under the name Wm. Schumacher & Sons. That same year, William built the  Schumacher Machine Shop in Denver, IA. With his son Elmer, they  designed, built, and installed a custom lift for feed bags for a  chicken hatchery in Waverly, IA. In the beginning of the company's  history, they sold and manufactured many different types of elevators  including lifting platforms, dumbwaiters, and freight elevators. In  1966, Elmer's son Marvin ``Marv'' joined the company as president and  began to include passenger elevators in their line of products. A  fourth generation of Schumacher, Jeff, joined the company in 1993 as  the CFO and vice president of sales and administration. Jeff now serves  as the CEO, and his parents Marv and Helen serve as the president and  vice president of administration, respectively. Today, the company has  enjoyed immense success and currently employs over 250 highly trained  individuals throughout the Midwest and strives to be a premier  independent elevator company in the United States.   Schumacher Elevator Company currently manufactures and sells  hydraulic, traction, personal, and manlift elevators while also  providing installation, maintenance, and testing services. They also  make custom elevators for customers, and they have the expertise to  install elevators for new construction projects, modernize old elevator  systems, repair broken elevators, and do preventative maintenance. In  addition to quality, Schumacher Elevator Company is fast. The team can  create an elevator from raw materials to a finished product just in 1  week.   Schumacher Elevator Company is a staple of the Denver community. They  offer two scholarships for students at the Denver High School: One is  for a student that goes into the healthcare industry, and the other is  for a student that goes into a technology field of study. In addition  to this, the Marvin and Helen Schumacher Family Fund engages in  philanthropic efforts throughout Iowa. The company encourages their  employees to give back to the community, as well. Last December, a  group of employees made a generous donation to the Northeast Iowa Food  Bank that provided 4,000 meals to Iowans in need.   Schumacher Elevator Company's commitment to being trailblazers in the  elevator industry is clear. In 87 years, the Schumacher family has been  able to provide the highest quality elevators to satisfied clients  globally. I want to congratulate the entire team at Schumacher Elevator  Company and commend them for their dedication to excellence in their  work both locally in Iowa and around the world. I look forward to  seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
