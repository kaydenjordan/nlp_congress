 Mr. Speaker, it has been 297 days since the worst mass  shooting in U.S. history.   On October 1, 2017, 58 people were senselessly murdered at the  Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, in my hometown, and more than 500  people were injured.   I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I remember going to  Sunrise  [[Page H7164]]  Hospital and seeing 194 victims who had been shot or injured.   Since October 1, I have come to the House floor 58 times to honor  each of the victims and to share their stories. For the last 9 months,  my colleagues have listened to 58 separate speeches, and have looked at  the pictures of the 58 victims. These stories have been met with  silence by the majority.   Since October 1, members of the Nevada delegation have asked to, at  least, hold a hearing on bump stocks, the device that contributed to  the massive carnage in Las Vegas. Our letters have been met with  silence by the majority.   Since October 1, Democrats, and a few Republicans, have introduced no  less than 30 bills to combat gun violence in our country, yet these  bills have been met with silence by the majority.   Since October 1, there have been more mass shootings in the U.S.,  including at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas; at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; and at the  Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. These mass shootings have been  met with silence by the majority.   At what point are my colleagues in Congress going to stop being  silent?   At what point are they going to say: We have to do something; we have  to take action?   The United States is in the middle of a gun epidemic. Every day, 96  Americans, Mr. Speaker, are killed by gun violence. Americans are 25  times more likely to be murdered with a gun than people in other  developed countries.   Americans can no longer feel safe at churches, concerts, movie  theaters, work, military bases, nightclubs, restaurants, shopping  malls, grocery stores, baseball fields, congressional baseball fields,  and, even worse, our children are no longer safe at school.   Since 2009, there have been 288 school shootings in the U.S. Today,  little kids are afraid to wear light-up shoes to school because a  gunman could see them when they have to hide for their life.   From the time of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook to the mass shooting  at Parkland, the House of Representatives has held more than 40 moments  of silence related to gun violence. However, in that same time, the  majority refuses to consider any real piece of legislation, hold any  hearings, or take any action that could reduce this gun violence  epidemic.                                time  1045    And despite bipartisan support in this body to ban bump stocks,  implement universal background checks, limit high-capacity magazines,  or ban assault weapons, my colleagues say that nothing can be done to  prevent gun violence in America. If that is true, why is the United  States the only developed country that has this problem?   The truth is we can do something. We can take action. My Republican  colleagues can put the American gun lobby first and the NRA and gun  manufacturers, but the American people come first. We have to listen to  the American people. We can pass bipartisan and commonsense solutions  to prevent more shootings and to save more lives.   To my fellow Nevadans and Americans, I want you to know that, despite  these roadblocks, we will keep fighting. Every day there are people  here in Congress working tirelessly to make our country safer. Every  day we are moved by your rallying cries and your stories; and every  day, we will fight to end the gun violence epidemic in the United  States.                            ____________________
