 Mr. Speaker, the pandemic is over. Joe Biden has said  so. I don't know why he is waiting until May to do something about it,  but the pandemic is over.   It is time for the Federal Government to get back to work. It is far  past time for the policies of the Federal Government to reflect this  reality and the policies of hardworking Americans and for Federal  employees to show up and get the job done.   In my district, the Bureau of Land Management headquarters was a hot  topic of debate because this administration's--one of their first  actions, they wanted to take that from my district and move it back to  Washington, D.C. Why the haste? Why so fast to do this?   No one is going to work. The building is empty. They didn't have  anywhere to bring the employees to a new building here. In fact, the  employees that they did relocate to Washington, D.C., still only show  up to work 1 day a week.   According to one disturbing report by the Federal Times, just one in  three Federal workers has returned to their full-time job.   Equally disturbing, a leaked memo from January 2021 to the then-chief  of staff of the Department of Health and Human Services showed that  between 20 and 30 percent of the Department's employees did not log in  to work on any given day between March and December 2020.   This negatively impacts all of our constituents.   The VA has been incredibly slow to fulfill records requests so that  our veterans can get the care that they need, the care that they  deserve.   The Social Security Administration faces a massive backlog of  appeals.   As of last month, the IRS had a backlog of 2.5 million returns from  2022 that are still unprocessed.   This Republican-led Congress is moving to end Biden's emergency  powers. He won't do it at the executive level.   We have created these agencies. We fund these agencies. Now, we are  demanding that these Federal employees get back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I  strongly support it. I urge adoption.    Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 3 years since the first  national emergency declaration was issued related to the COVID-19  pandemic on March 13, 2020.   Since then, the Federal Government has authorized over $6 trillion in  response to COVID-19. Our children have suffered severe learning loss  due to school closures, and countless small businesses have been forced  to permanently close their doors.   The Democratic Party has used and abused the national emergency  authorization to push their unpopular, radical agenda, like the  eviction moratorium, student loan forgiveness, and reckless spending  that has led to skyrocketing inflation that is impacting my  constituents today--your constituents today.   When they go to the grocery store and are paying $9, $10, $11 for 12  eggs, this is a problem. They also put unconstitutional vaccine  mandates in place to put healthcare workers and our military  servicemembers, serving in all branches of our military, out of work.   COVID is over. Yet, nearly 3 years later, more than 35 National  Emergencies Acts are still in effect, and the current administration is  continuing to abuse more than 120 special statutory powers only meant  for times of emergency.   Even Joe Biden said the pandemic is over. We agreed with that long  before he said it, and we are happy he is finally saying it. It is far  past time to put an end to this abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Gosar,  for his strong leadership on this issue. I am proud to be cosponsor of  this legislation, and I strongly support it.    Mr. Speaker, first, I thank my friend, fellow Freedom  Caucus colleague, and proven fighter for the Second Amendment, Mr.  Clyde, for organizing this Special Order. I thank him for highlighting  what is going on here.   Mr. Speaker, the ATF's new pistol brace rule violates the separation  of powers. Bureaucrats don't create laws; Congress does. This rule  functions like a law that Congress never passed.   ATF--Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. In western Colorado, we call  that a fun weekend, but D.C. bureaucrats have used this agency to  infringe on the rights of the American people.   When you research how many pistol braces the ATF expects to be  registered, the number varies. Some say 10 million, others say 20  million, and it may even be 40 million.   Why such disparity? Because the ATF doesn't know how many are out  there because law-abiding Americans do not trust them enough to tell  them.   In fact, there are probably going to be many more boating accidents  this spring and summer than we have ever encountered in U.S. history  from law-abiding gun owners.   We don't trust the ATF because of their overreaching actions, exactly  like we are seeing with this rule.   There has been a lot of talk about defunding the ATF, even abolishing  the agency altogether. I am still waiting to hear a good reason why the  ATF should remain an agency at all. I have yet to hear one.   Instead of providing regulations that keep our communities safe, this  agency has made our communities more dangerous by laundering weapons to  the cartels. Operation Fast and Furious exposed the recklessness of the  ATF, how little regard they have for the rule of law, and Americans  have had a hard time viewing this agency and its rules as legitimate.   Think about it. The ATF had about 1,700 firearms that were being  tracked. They had tracers on them. They were selling to known criminals  during this Operation Fast and Furious. They lost 1,700 traced  firearms, and now they expect to go after law-abiding American citizens  for firearm accessories?   Are they really that competent to go after this many millions of  Americans for a firearm accessory, a stabilizing brace, when they had  1,700 tracked firearms in the hands of known criminals that they just  lost?   I think that alone proves the legitimacy of this agency, and I am  very excited to bring them into an Oversight and Accountability  Committee hearing so they can speak for themselves as to why they  should remain an agency in our Federal Government and not have the  appropriate features of their agency put under another, like the FBI,  once we clean that out.                                time  1830    But other than that, the Second Amendment, it is absolute.   All the regulations the bureaucrats make, the laws that bureaucrats  are trying to make, the unconstitutional laws that are passed by the  Federal Government, the State legislatures, they make our country less  safe. Gun-free zones are the most dangerous places in our country.   The Second Amendment is absolute, and it is here to stay.   A recent report states that Americans own 46 percent of the world's  guns. I think we need to get our numbers up, boys and girls.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clyde for hosting this Special Order. I  thank him for bringing us all together on this topic and, hopefully, we  can shed some light to the American people and let them know that we  are fighting against this agency and their abuse of separation of  powers.
