 Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, we honor our men  and women in blue for their courage, dedication, and commitment to  preserving law and order in our communities. We also remember the  fallen, those who made the ultimate selfless sacrifice in the line of  duty.   On this National Police Week, Congress has the unique opportunity to  not just say we back the blue but to actually take a stand against a  misguided law that severely hinders the ability of police officers in  this very city from protecting and serving the American people.   The D.C. City Council's so-called police reform bill--the  Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Emergency Amendment Act-- creates very serious undue burdens on the Metropolitan Police  Department. Amidst the raging crime crisis terrorizing the streets here  in our Nation's Capital, this law, which for 2 years has been in effect  under emergency legislative powers, puts criminals first and MPD  officers last.   MPD officers overwhelmingly oppose the D.C. Council's anti-police  law, and they are making it known with their feet. Since this  legislation has been in place, the MPD has lost more than 1,100  officers and currently operates at a 500-officer deficit. As officers  are leaving the force in droves, faster than they can be replaced, the  Metropolitan Police Department has drastically shrunk to a historic  half-century low.   Due to my commitment to our Constitution and passion for restoring  law and order in our Nation's Capital, I introduced a resolution, H.J.  Res. 42, to repeal the D.C. Council's harmful law.   Last month this body passed my commonsense measure by a bipartisan  vote garnering the support of 14 House Democrats. By passing my  resolution, the House firmly rejected the council's anti-police law,  reaffirming our support of heroic law enforcement officers and  underscored the importance of protecting Americans' safety here in  Washington.   It is now up to the Senate to act before it is too late.   Thankfully, today Senators will vote on H.J. Res. 42 as Senator J.D.  Vance is leading the fight to repeal the D.C. Council's anti-police  law. During this vote Senators will face a very simple question: On  National Police Week do they stand with the officers of the  Metropolitan Police Department, or do they embolden violent criminals  who continue to torment and attack Americans in our Nation's Capital?   Earlier this year when Congress was confronted with a similar  question as we considered my previous D.C.-related resolution, H.J.  Res. 26, to block the D.C. Council's soft-on-crime Revised Criminal  Code Act, we had 31 Democrats in both the House and the Senate join our  effort to strike down this radical law that would eliminate minimum  sentences and reduce maximum penalties for numerous violent criminal  offenses.   I now call on these same 31 Senate Democrats to join our fight, yet  again, by passing H.J. Res. 42 because failure to do so will only drive  out more Metropolitan Police Department officers and deter officers  from joining the force, meaning Washington will have fewer police  officers on the streets to combat the dangerous crime crisis plaguing  our Nation's Capital.   While D.C.'s local leadership shamelessly refuses to admit there is a  crime crisis in Washington, the data reveals that the crime crisis is  not only real, but that it is getting worse. Compared to last year,  violent crime is up 13 percent as the city has already faced more than  80 homicides in just the first 4\1/2\ months of 2023. Property crime  has increased by a whopping 30 percent, and total crime overall is up  27 percent.                                time  1030    Clearly, the crime crisis in our Nation's Capital is dire, which is  why residents, small businesses, visitors, and the brave officers of  the Metropolitan Police Department are counting on Congress to act.  They are depending on  [[Page H2357]]  us to use our authority outlined in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of  the Constitution to prevent our Nation's Capital from becoming the next  New York City, Chicago, or San Francisco. They are calling on us to  support MPD officers, help them restore law and order, and improve  public safety in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to put people over politics. Join our  effort to repeal the D.C. Council's antipolice law and send this  commonsense bill, H.J. Res. 42, to the President's desk.   I implore President Biden to abandon his senseless veto threat so we  can take another crucial step in bolstering the ranks of the  Metropolitan Police Department and boosting public safety in D.C.   We shoulder the responsibility and the authority to make our Nation's  Capital a safer place for all Americans, and we cannot take this duty  lightly. It is time for the Senate to take a stand in not only  protecting Americans in Washington but in protecting MPD officers who  risk their lives to defend law and order in D.C.   On this National Police Week, fulfilling our constitutional duty to  strike down a law that will continue to severely damage the  Metropolitan Police Department is the least we can do to show that we  do, in fact, always back the blue.                            ____________________
