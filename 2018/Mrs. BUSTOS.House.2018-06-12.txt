 Mr. Speaker, the opioid epidemic has claimed the lives  of too many across our Nation. Although no corner of our country has  remained unscathed, the crisis is worse in rural America, where drug- related deaths are 45 percent higher.    When I travel around my district, a vast district--7,000 square  miles, 14 counties--I am told time and time again that access to  treatment remains one of the largest barriers to recovery in many of  the small towns and rural communities that I serve. We don't have  enough doctors. We don't have enough treatment centers. If we don't  have those things, too many people don't have a chance.   That is why I worked with my colleague from Georgia, Congressman  Buddy Carter, who also happens to be a pharmacist, to introduce the  Special Registration for Telemedicine Clarification Act, with Democrats  and Republicans working together in this endeavor.   This bill is a commonsense measure that cuts through the red tape to  provide more treatment options to underserved communities through the  use of telemedicine. Saving our sons, our daughters, our brothers, our  sisters, our nieces, and our nephews from this epidemic is a priority  for Democrats and for Republicans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to  support this legislation.
