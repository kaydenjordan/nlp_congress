 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I get into my remarks, I noted  that my dear friend and colleague, the Senator from Illinois, is giving  remarks to say a fond and, I am sure, a somewhat poignant farewell to  Reema Dodin, who has done a great job for him, for the Senate, for  Senate Democrats, and for me for decades. We are going to miss her very  much. The only consolation is that she is going on to the new  administration and even bigger and better things.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate returns to session today for  what will be a very busy and consequential period. Tomorrow, we will  celebrate one of democracy's core attributes: the peaceful transfer of  power, albeit under much different circumstances than most Americans  are used to.   Rioters, insurrectionists, White supremacists, and domestic  terrorists tried to prevent the transfer of power. They were incited by  none other than the President of the United States. They have failed.  Though they have made the transition of power anything but peaceful,  democracy's oldest and most revered tradition, the peaceful passing of  the torch, will take place tomorrow.   We must remain vigilant. We must remain strong. If we do, democracy  will always prevail. Despite what these evil terrorists tried to do,  the peaceful passing of the torch will take place tomorrow as it has  for generations.   In the weeks since the attack, the Nation has learned about the  heroism displayed by many Capitol Police officers on January 6. I want  to again thank those officers who protected Members and staff. Let us  also recognize the bravery of one officer in particular, Brian  Sicknick, who was killed in the line of duty.   I also want to acknowledge those members of the fourth estate for  their efforts during these difficult times, for continuing to shine a  light on what is happening at the Capitol, sometimes at great personal  risk.   Now, in the wake of the despicable assault on the U.S. Capitol on  January 6, we have taken precautions to ensure the safety of the  Inauguration of President-Elect Biden tomorrow. Senate leadership has  been in close and constant communication with the Secret Service, the  FBI, the National Guard, and the D.C. police. As we speak, there are  more troops around the Capitol than there are in Afghanistan. No  force--no force--will prevent tomorrow's constitutional proceedings  from taking place.   Tomorrow, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be administered the oath  of office. They will be sworn into the Presidency and Vice Presidency  of the United States, and the powers vested in our Chief Executive will  flow to a new office holder, a peaceful passing of the torch, as it has  been for over two centuries in the grand tradition of democracy in the  United States of America.   Tomorrow, the country will turn the page on the most chaotic and  divisive Presidency that can ever be remembered. We will begin again  the hard work of unifying and healing this Nation, defeating the  pandemic, recovering our economy, and repairing our standing and  stature in the world--and this is just the beginning.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Inauguration of a new President and  the start of a new administration always brings a flurry of activity to  our Nation's government, but rarely-- rarely--has so much piled up for  the Senate as during this particular transition. Over the next several  weeks, the Senate must accomplish three essential items: a second  impeachment trial of Donald Trump; the confirmation of President  Biden's Cabinet and other key officials; and legislation to provide  much needed--almost desperately needed--COVID relief.   Again, there are three essential items of business. No. 1, as  mandated  [[Page S51]]  by law and Constitution, once the House of Representatives delivers  Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, we will conduct and complete a  trial of Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection against these United  States.   No. 2, the Senate will confirm key members of soon-to-be President  Biden's Cabinet. Those Cabinet officials in charge of national security  must be confirmed quickly, as well as those in charge of responding to  the current health and economic crisis.   No. 3, the Senate will take up legislation to provide the country  additional relief from the pandemic.   On impeachment, the Senate has solemn responsibility to try and hold  Donald Trump accountable for the most serious charge ever levied  against a President: the incitement of an insurrection against the  United States of America.   The events on January 6, make no mistake about it, were not a  spontaneous demonstration. President Trump invented the lie that  motivated these criminals. He exhorted them to come to Washington. He  then directed them at the U.S. Capitol, and his demagoguery whipped  them into a frenzy.   We need to set a precedent that the severest threat ever committed by  a President will be met by the severest remedy provided by the U.S.  Constitution: impeachment and conviction by this Chamber, as well as  disbarment from future office.   In 230 years, the House of Representatives has impeached the  President of the United States only twice. In just the past 13 months,  it has impeached President Trump twice more. President Trump is a  threat to our constitutional order whether he is in or out of office.  Even now, he has not accepted responsibility for what he has done and  still falsely maintains that the election was stolen.   Once he leaves office, do we really expect him to change his tune and  accept the truth? Of course not. He will continue spreading lies about  the election and stoking the grievances of his most radical supporters,  using the prospect of a future Presidential run to poison the public  arena at a time when we must get so much done. After what he has done,  the consequences of which we were all witness to, Donald Trump should  not be eligible to run for office ever again.   All of us want to put this awful chapter in our Nation's history  behind us, but healing and unity will only come if there is truth and  accountability, not sweeping such a severe charge, such awful actions,  under the rug.   So let me be clear. There will be an impeachment trial in the U.S.  Senate. There will be a vote on convicting the President of high crimes  and misdemeanors. And, if the President is convicted, there will be a  vote on barring him from running again.   Now, the Cabinet. As I mentioned, the Senate must also fulfill its  constitutional duty to advise and consent on soon-to-be President  Biden's executive and judicial nominations, particularly his Cabinet.  Today, there are no fewer than five Senate hearings on Cabinet-level  officials for good reason. The violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol  on January 6 showed us we need qualified Senate-confirmed people in key  national security positions on day one. That means tomorrow.   The Senate will be in session tomorrow after the conclusion of the  Inauguration of the 46th President of the United States. With  cooperation, we can confirm key national security nominees at State,  the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Treasury, and the  intelligence community. The health and economic challenges our Nation  faces and the need to get vaccines out quickly also require having key  health officials and key economic nominees confirmed and on the job as  soon as possible.   In 2017, the Senate confirmed President Trump's Secretary of Defense  and his Secretary of Homeland Security on Inauguration Day. President  Biden should have the same officials in place on his Inauguration Day  at the very least. That is the expectation and tradition for any  administration, but especially now in the midst of a Homeland Security  crisis.   As I said, the way the Senate works, it will take cooperation from  our Republican colleagues to swiftly confirm these highly qualified  national security officials. But make no mistake, the Senate will move  quickly to consider and confirm President Biden's cabinet.   Finally, on COVID and the legislation that is needed, once the Senate  has confirmed key nominations for the incoming administration, it will  turn to the subject of additional COVID relief items, including key  items such as an increase in direct payments to American families;  strong, further support of vaccine distribution which must be improved;  help for small businesses, schools, and State and local governments.  Very soon, the country will pass another tragic milestone: 400,000  American deaths from COVID-19. There is no issue more urgent then  defeating this pandemic, and the Senate will immediately set to work on  that goal as the first order of legislative business.   There will be much more work for us to do in the following months.  Working with President Biden and our House colleagues, the Senate will  finally address the major challenges facing our country that have for  too long been ignored. We will consider bold legislation to defeat the  climate crisis by investing in clean infrastructure and manufacturing,  which will create millions of good jobs for Americans, regardless of  ZIP Code. We must move significantly to improve our healthcare and  childcare systems. To fix and restore our income and equality problem,  we will fight to restore workers' rights and fairness in the Tax Code.   Today, we announce the first bill, S. 1, which will be a package of  long overdue reforms to protect our democracy after it has been so  attacked in 4 years and will guarantee every American's right to vote.   One issue that has been long important to me is immigration reform. I  always felt that comprehensive immigration reform with a path to  citizenship is one of the most important things a Democratic Congress  can do. To me, passing comprehensive reform is a very high priority, so  I was pleased that President-Elect Biden has crafted a proposal and  will call on Congress to take up this important subject. I am studying  the President-elect's proposal, and I look forward to working together  with him and the new administration and with my colleagues in Congress  to get comprehensive immigration reform signed into law.   As I said at the beginning of this talk, the next several months will  be very, very busy and a very consequential period for the U.S. Senate.  Let us begin our work in earnest.   I yield the floor.
