 What I felt in the Capitol behind us is something       that I hadn't felt since I was in Afghanistan when I was an       Army Ranger. And to think that as a Member of Congress, in       2021, in the U.S. Capitol on the House floor, that I was       preparing to fight my way out of the people's House against a       mob is just beyond troubling.    Representative Pat Fallon was humbled by his experience on January 6.  He described the events as ``surreal'' as they unfolded here in the  Capitol.   (Text of video presentation.)
