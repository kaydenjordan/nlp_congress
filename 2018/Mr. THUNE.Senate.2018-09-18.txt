 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, many in the Carolinas and other communities  in our eastern States are dealing with wind, flooding, and storm surge  damage caused by Hurricane Florence. In the lead-up to this hurricane  and in the ongoing response to it, Federal agencies have played and  continue to perform critical roles in forecasting, public safety,  rescue, and recovery.   One of the key agencies involved in this effort is the Commerce  Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.  NOAA houses the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane  Center, which is responsible for issuing watches, warnings, and  forecasts of these hazardous weather events.   Despite its responsibility for critical functions, NOAA has been  without a Senate-confirmed Administrator for nearly 2 years due to  obstruction by Senate Democrats. Barry Myers, the President's nominee  to lead NOAA, was first approved by the Commerce Committee, of which I  have the privilege of chairing, in December of 2017. Ten months later,  his nomination sits stalled on the Senate floor, and he is far from  alone.   During and after disasters like a hurricane, Americans use products  such as portable generators, ladders, and power tools in greater  quantity and frequency than during other times. The Consumer Product  Safety Commission has a critical public safety mission to ensure that  such products sold on store shelves or over the internet are safe. When  there are safety issues, the Commission is charged with taking action.  But nominations for this critical agency have also been blocked in the  Senate. The same is true for the country's leading highway safety  regulator. For months, Democrats have blocked the nomination of Heidi  King to be the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration. While she has shepherded the agency in an acting  capacity, she has been denied the full weight and authority of a  Senate-confirmed leader. So have other Commerce Committee-approved  nominations for the Departments of Transportation and Commerce, Amtrak,  and the Surface Transportation Board. All of these agencies play  critical roles in promoting public safety. What is most frustrating is  that this all feels like deja vu.   We have already seen this disturbing pattern play out with other  safety nominees earlier in this Congress. The nomination of Ronald  Batory to lead the Federal Railroad Administration had been stalled in  the Senate for more than 6 months over demands by Senate Democrats  concerning a parochial infrastructure project. Only after three deadly  passenger rail accidents did Democrats finally relent and allow this  critical railway safety official to assume his full agency leadership  duties.   In another instance, Senate Democrats blocked nominees for the  National Transportation Safety Board. This opposition only subsided  following a deadly Missouri duck boat tragedy that claimed 17 lives.  Once the Board was sent out to investigate and attention moved toward  the blocked vacancies, Democrats finally relented to their  confirmation.   Maybe Hurricane Florence will have a similar effect on some of these  other blocked nominees, but it shouldn't take a tragic national  disaster for Democrats to stop making unrelated demands that obstruct  nominees from working in critical posts.   I urge my colleagues to stop this dangerous obstruction and instead  give qualified nominees approved in committee the chance to lead their  agencies so that we are all well prepared for the next natural  disaster, safety recall, or serious accident.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 2017, more than 72,000 Americans died  from drug overdoses, and 49,000 of those deaths were related to  opioids. Opioid overdoses have surpassed motor vehicle accidents as the  leading cause of accidental death in the United States. Whole  communities have been devastated by the opioid epidemic. The situation  is rightly described as a crisis.  [[Page S6210]]    Here in Congress we are focused on doing everything we can to support  the fight against substance use disorder. In 2016, we passed the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which authorized a variety of  grants to States to boost their efforts to reduce opioid deaths and  help individuals overcome opioid addiction. That same year, we also  passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which provided $1 billion in State  grants over 2 years to combat the opioid epidemic.   In March of this year, Congress passed an appropriations bill that  provided $4.7 billion to address the opioid crisis. Today, we voted on  an appropriations bill that will provide another $3.8 billion to fight  this epidemic. Overall, Federal funding to address the opioid crisis  has increased by nearly 1,300 percent over the past 4 years.   Then there is the bill we passed last night. The Opioid Crisis  Response Act, which passed the Senate yesterday evening, is the product  of months of work by five Senate committees. It contains more than 70  proposals from Senators of both parties and represents the serious  efforts Congress has made to address opioid addiction on a number of  fronts.   This legislation will support critical treatment and recovery  efforts. It will help babies born in opioid withdrawal. It will help  support family-focused residential treatment programs, and more. Just  as importantly, it will also take steps to address what I see as the  supply side of the opioid epidemic. It will help stop the movement of  illegal drugs across our borders through the mail--the work of the  Senator from Ohio, Rob Portman. It will promote research into and fast- track approval of new nonaddictive pain management alternatives. It  will help stop the practice of ``doctor shopping'' by improving State  prescription drug monitoring programs.   The bill also provides grants for law enforcement agencies to help  protect law enforcement officers from accidental exposure to deadly  drugs in the course of their duties.   I am proud that this legislation includes a bill that I introduced,  the Expanding Telehealth Response to Ensure Addiction Treatment Act,  which will help expand access to substance use disorder treatment for  Medicare recipients by using telehealth technology.   The Opioid Crisis Response Act also includes my legislation to close  a safety gap in railroad drug and alcohol testing regulations and  require the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department  of Transportation to include fentanyl in the drug-testing panel.   Opioid addiction destroys lives, not just the lives of the addicted  but the lives of their children, their parents, their siblings, their  spouses, their relatives and friends. The Opioid Crisis Response Act  and the funding that we passed today will help move us forward in the  fight against this deadly epidemic. We will continue to make combating  opioid addiction a top priority here in the Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, before I close, I want to mention the good  economic news that continues to pour in. The economy created more than  200,000 jobs in August, beating expectations, and the unemployment rate  was yet again below 4 percent.   Economic growth in the second quarter was even stronger than we  thought--a robust 4.2 percent. Average hourly earnings for workers are  rising at the fastest rate since 2009. Middle-class income hit its  highest level ever last year.   In 2017, U.S. job openings have hit a record high of 6.94 million  jobs. In fact, the number of job openings has exceeded the number of  unemployed in this country for the past 5 months. Think about that. The  number of job openings--the number of jobs available to people in this  country--has exceeded the number of people who are unemployed in this  country for the past 5 months. That has never happened before in the  history of tracking those two statistics.   Consumer confidence is at an 18-year high. Small business optimism  shattered its previous record high to reach a record high in August.  The poverty rate has dropped to its lowest level since 2006. The  percentage of Americans listing economic issues as the most important  problem in the United States dropped to a record low, and the list  continues.   These are all facts. These are indisputable facts, and they are the  results of policies that are put in place with an eye toward growing  this economy at a faster rate and creating better paying jobs and  higher wages for people in our economy.   Since President Trump took office, Republicans have focused on fixing  those things that have been holding the economy back. We removed  burdensome regulations. We passed historic comprehensive reform in our  Tax Code to put more money in Americans' pockets and to remove barriers  to job creation and economic growth. Now we are seeing the results:  strong economic growth--as I mentioned, 4.2 percent in the second  quarter of this year--thriving small businesses, with optimism and  investing confidence unlike anything we have seen in history, more  money in families' paychecks, new jobs, better paying jobs, better  benefits, and more opportunities for American workers.   Mr. President, America is back in business, and it is American  families and American workers who are benefiting from that. We intend  to continue to work on an agenda that creates policies that will drive  and fuel economic growth in this country and provide more  opportunities, a better standard of living, and a higher quality of  life for all Americans.   I yield the floor.
