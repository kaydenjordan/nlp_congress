 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tom Neubauer, the  recipient of the 2018 Defense Community Leadership Award.   Tom is a highly respected leader of the defense community in Florida  and a personal friend of mine back in Bay County, which is my home.   Tom has been the leading communicator between our military and  civilian communities for as long as I can remember. He was instrumental  in bringing the MQ-9 Reaper Wing to Tyndall Air Force Base and worked  tirelessly to support and protect the Military Mission Line.   Both Tom and his wife, Margaret, are Air Force brats. Their love for  our soldiers, sailors, and airmen shines through in all that they do.  Tom has been building better relations and a  [[Page H5294]]  tighter sense of community between military and civilian communities  not only in Bay County, but throughout Florida and the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Tom Neubauer on  receiving this prestigious award and thanking him for his work for  military communities throughout this country.                            ____________________
