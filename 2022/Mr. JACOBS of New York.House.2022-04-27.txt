 Madam Speaker, today, on Holocaust  Remembrance Day, I honor the life of Gerda Weissmann Klein, who passed  away on April 3.   Gerda was born in Poland in May 1925 and was only a teenager when her  homeland was invaded by the Nazis. In 1942, she was sent to the Gross- Rosen camp system.   In 1945, Gerda was taken on a 3-month death march through  Czechoslovakia. Luckily, the failed ignition of an incendiary device  saved Gerda and 120 other women, who were liberated soon after.   After the war, Gerda immigrated to western New York, my home, to  raise her family, and she traveled the country sharing her story.  Gerda's first book, ``All But My Life,'' told her story and was adapted  into an Oscar-winning documentary called ``One Survivor Remembers.''   Gerda has received numerous honors and awards, including the  Presidential Medal of Freedom. Gerda also spoke before the United  Nations General Assembly on the first International Holocaust  Remembrance Day.   Gerda is survived by 3 children, 8 grandchildren, and 18 great- grandchildren. May her memory be a blessing to us all.                            ____________________
