 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to  the resilience of residents of Houston, Pasadena, and our neighbors in  Deer Park and Baytown that were hit by the tornado earlier this week.   We were hit hard, and it devastated our area, but the people are  resilient. The tornado left dozens of families displaced in my district  with homes without roofs and surrounded by debris. Thankfully, there  were no deaths or serious injuries, and our spirit is not broken.   In this time of recovery, it is important to remember that our  communities always come together in time of need.   I thank all the first responders, the workers who helped restore our  electricity, the people who picked up the debris, and those who were  there immediately to help our neighbors. That is what we are all about,  helping each other. We continue to rebuild our communities because we  are strong together.   As long as I continue to represent Texas-29, I will ensure that our  district is well prepared and has the best available resources and  information for recovery.   We are Houston strong. We are Pasadena strong. We are Texas strong.                            ____________________
