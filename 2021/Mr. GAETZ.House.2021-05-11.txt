 Mr. Speaker, it is with great concern that I report to the  House that the Civil Rights Division of the Biden Justice Department is  actually working against the civil rights and the voting rights of our  citizens.   Brave patriots in Arizona have undertaken an election audit to ensure  that an actual human being is attached to a vote that was cast. This  will inform better public policy prospectively. But Pamela Karlan, the  head of the Civil Rights Division of the Biden Justice Department, has  worked to stop that endeavor, and we know Dr. Karlan from her testimony  in the Judiciary Committee where she made fun of President Trump's  son's name and where she said that conservative Republicans didn't want  to even live around one another because apparently we are so repulsive.   This is deeply unfortunate. This person should not even have a job at  the Justice Department, and she certainly should not be working to  perpetuate the true big lie and that is that there is not a tremendous  amount of work left to be done on election integrity.                            ____________________
