 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving  Access to Manufactured Housing Act.   As the vice chairman of the Financial Institution Subcommittee and  the cosponsor of this legislation, I urge my colleagues to support its  passage.   Representative Barr's bipartisan bill--and I really appreciate the  comments from Mr. Scott, my colleague from Georgia on this bill--will  remove misguided barriers that block access to affordable manufactured  homes while preserving consumers' protections.   It is important to keep in mind that the challenge of finding  affordable housing is not exclusively an urban problem. Housing  affordability is a challenge in many rural areas, including parts of my  district.                                time  1000    Manufactured homes can be a solution to this affordability challenge.  They can give many low- to moderate-income families the chance at  homeownership.   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, the current regulatory environment is  taking competition out of this market to the detriment of consumers.   Nationwide, 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes. In my  State of Pennsylvania, manufactured homes comprise almost 5 percent of  the housing stock. Manufactured homes account for 73 percent of all new  homes sold under $125,000, and the average income of a manufactured  home purchaser is less than $40,000 per year.   The manufactured housing business also sustains thousands of  families. Sixteen thousand workers in Pennsylvania are employed in this  industry. Unfortunately, the misguided rules from Washington threaten  to choke off access to manufactured housing.   The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act will address these  harmful rules that are making manufactured homes unaffordable for  perspective customers while preserving important consumer protections.  It is important to keep in mind that the Truth in Lending Act and State  consumer protection laws will still apply after enactment of this  legislation.   Representative Barr's bill is narrowly focused, common sense, and a  bipartisan effort to target a specific challenge facing perspective  purchasers of manufactured homes. The bill will preserve access to this  affordable option for millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a member of the  Progressive Caucus who is always on the side of consumers.
