 Mr. President, I object.    Objection.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, despite all Senate Republican leaders'  efforts to keep this mean bill hidden from public view, patients and  families know the truth.   This legislation would cause families' healthcare costs to spike. It  will gut Medicaid, and it will deny tens of millions of people their  healthcare coverage. It will defund Planned Parenthood and take away  critical healthcare services that women and men rely on, especially in  our rural areas where it is already hard enough to get the care you  need. TrumpCare would also completely pull the rug out from under  patients with preexisting conditions. I could go on.   I hope every one of my colleagues joins me in voting against this  awful legislation, but this vote is far from the last time Senate  Republicans need to reject TrumpCare, if they are really serious about  protecting patients and families from the damage it would do, because  if any version of this awful bill leaves the Senate, extreme  Republicans in the House are going to do everything they can to make it  even  [[Page S4183]]  more damaging--and anyone who believes differently is refusing to see  the writing on the wall.   I urge my Democratic and Republican colleagues to vote against this  bill and every other version of it that we are going to see in the  coming hours and days.   Mr. President, I yield back all of our time.    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending  amendment violates section 311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act  of 1974.
