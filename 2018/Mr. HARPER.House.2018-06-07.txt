 Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order against the  following provision contained in H.R. 5895 because it violates clause 2  of House rule XXI.   This provision is on page 66, line 14, through page 66, line 20, and  relates to the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Under clause 2(a)(1)  of rule XXI, ``an appropriation may not be reported in a general  appropriation bill . . . for an expenditure not previously authorized  by law. . . . ''   Mr. Chairman, the Committee on House Administration is responsible  for providing funding for House Committees, other than for the  Committee on House Appropriations.   Sections 5 and 7 of H. Res. 1451 of the Commission's enabling  resolution, which is carried forward through H. Res. 5, make clear the  Commission is not authorized to receive a direct appropriation. The  Commission's enabling resolution specifies the role of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs in providing staff and resources for the Commission, as  well as funding for the Commission.   In fact, consistent with H. Res. 1451, at the request of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on House Administration  adopted Committee Resolution 115-9 earlier this year authorizing  $200,000 from the Committee's reserve fund to provide for support for  Commission personnel.  [[Page H4925]]    In summary, Mr. Chairman, there is no authorization for the  Commission to receive a direct appropriation of funds, and I reiterate  my point of order.   I ask for a ruling of the Chair.
