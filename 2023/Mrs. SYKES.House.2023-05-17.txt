 Mr. Speaker, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy put forth  a joint resolution recognizing Peace Officers Memorial Day as May 15.  On May 15 of this year, the Nation came together to pause and recognize  officers who have been killed in the line of duty.   Two of those officers who were recognized are from Ohio's 13th  Congressional District and served honorably in the Akron Police  Department. Those officers, Kenneth ``Kenny'' Jones and Officer Edward  Stewart, affectionately known as Stew, were both recognized on May 15  of this year.   Officer Kenny Jones was a dedicated officer who selflessly served  Akron and protected our citizens with courage and commitment. Officer  Jones was a lifelong Akron resident who attended Garfield High School  and the University of Akron.   A graduate of the Akron Police Academy, Officer Jones was with the  Akron Police Department for nearly 26 years.   Officer Jones exemplified the very essence of what it means to be a  public servant. Day in and day out, he served his community, embodying  the values of integrity, honor, and duty.    Officer Jones went above and beyond to build bridges of trust and  understanding within the Akron community. His colleagues noted that he  always had a smile on his face, and he would even pray for and with  strangers he served in the community.   Officer Jones was also a leader to his fellow officers, who looked up  to him not only because he was a towering 6-foot-5, but because he  served as a role model for how to treat people with respect and  kindness.   Sadly, Officer Jones' life was tragically cut short. This unexpected  loss reminds us of the sacrifices our law enforcement officers make,  often facing unforeseen dangers and enduring stress while on the job.   On behalf of the entire Ohio 13th Congressional District community, I  extend my deepest condolences to Officer Jones' family, his friends,  and his colleagues. His unwavering service and dedication will forever  be remembered, and the joy he brought to the community will never be  forgotten.   Officer Edward Stewart, affectionately known as Stew, was a longtime  veteran of the Akron Police Department who also dedicated his life to  humbly protecting and serving the people of Akron.   Officer Stewart began his career as a civilian employee in 1993  before pursuing his passion and joining the police academy in 1993, as  well. After graduating from the academy, Officer Stewart served the  community as a transport wagon officer for his entire career.   Officer Stewart embodied the essence of public service as someone who  was always willing to step up and assist those in need, whether that be  his fellow officers or members of the community.   Officer Stewart, sadly, passed away in 2020, one of too many  exceptional frontline responders who were lost after contracting COVID- 19 in the line of duty.   I was able to speak with Officer Stewart's wife, Lisa, this week to  offer my sincere condolences on behalf of the entire Ohio 13th  Congressional District.   Lisa shared that Officer Stewart was a loving husband, father, and  grandfather whose intelligence and thirst for knowledge was admired by  his family, friends, and colleagues.   Officer Stewart's selfless acts of public service will never be  forgotten, and we will continue to uphold his legacy by continuing to  work toward a safer community and safer future for all.   Both of these officers left behind families, a community, and loved  ones who truly respected and cared for them. On behalf of Ohio's 13th  Congressional District, I extend my sincere and deepest condolences to  those who loved them, those who cared for them, and those who will miss  seeing them every single day.   Peace Officer Memorial Day is an opportunity for us to stop and pause  to remember those who lost their lives in the line of duty and thank  them for their never-ending service to our communities.   We thank Officer Stewart and Officer Jones. May their memory be a  blessing.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on Congress to commit  to paying its bills and ensure that the significant investments of the  Inflation Reduction Act are protected.   The Inflation Reduction Act is a historic investment that tackles the  climate crisis and strengthens American energy security, all while  lowering costs for families and businesses, creating millions of good- paying jobs for American workers, and delivering on a clean energy  future for our children and grandchildren.   What does this mean for Ohio's 13th Congressional District?   It means because of the Inflation Reduction Act, my constituents can  save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars every year by taking  advantage of tax credits to promote clean and efficient energy.   It means that in just the few months that I have served here in  Congress, Ohio has already received millions of dollars through the  Inflation Reduction Act to reduce climate pollution in our community so  all people in Ohio's 13th District can breathe clean air and drink  clean water and live in a safe and healthy environment.   Despite these benefits, House Republicans are falsely claiming we  only have two options: default on our debt and cause economic  catastrophe or default on America by slashing environmental spending  and cutting clean energy jobs funded through the IRA.   We must reject the majority's false choice.   The clock is ticking. I will not allow partisan politics to threaten  the livelihoods of people and families in Ohio's 13th District.                            ____________________
