 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 4996) to ensure funding of the United  States trustees, extend temporary bankruptcy judgeships, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
