 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   With that mask, it is a lot easier to do that, too.   I appreciate the offer to be involved in this lameduck session here  today. It is one of those things that you have to take in some kind of  stride.   One assumes that if you are coming back here for a lameduck session,  there are major issues that need to be done before we actually go back  and the next session of Congress can actually take up. Although, I do  remember the first time I was elected here, we were voting in January  on the budget from the last session of Congress that they had failed to  do.   But in all of that, we look at the things that are still before us  today, and they are huge issues: what we are going to do with the  coronavirus, funding to help with that problem, national defense  authorization still yet having to be done, appropriations bills still  yet to be passed.   Instead of dealing with those this week, we find ourselves here with  these suspensions, most of which will not have a chance of actually  going all the way through the system. Many of them should start over  again and be done separately. But, at any rate, this is what we have  been called back to do.   The Germans had a good word for it: kleinigkeiten.   It is those little things. It is not the major issues of the day. It  is the small stuff. Now, admittedly, kleinigkeiten, those little  things, sometimes can enable one to get a victory and they can also  cause a problem that stops one from success. But what we are dealing  with today here on the floor is a whole bunch of kleinigkeiten. So I am  happy to be invited to be part of this effort that is here.   I also want to say one another thing, too, as well, because the bills  that are on the floor, when they are printed, when they are talked  about, will have the sponsors' names, Members of the House, sometimes  Senators who are involved in this, and what is never listed  [[Page H6095]]  on here is actually the people who make this possible.                                time  1715    I want to make one mention of the staff that we have. It is the staff  that does the research. It is they who actually write the bills. It is  they who actually conduct the talking points. It is they who organize  the session so it can run smoothly.   So the staff that is sitting to your left over there does a huge  amount of work that will never be credited in any way, shape, or form,  but it should be; working into the night to make sure that what we do  here on the floor is possible, and we should recognize them and be  grateful.   The staff on my right over here has done the same thing. Lisa  Pittman, to my right, has been here for 33 years working in this body,  making sure that we do things the right way. She will have forgotten  more than--no offense to the Parliamentarians--the Parliamentarians  will ever know about how to do things properly, effectively, and with  civility. She works tirelessly without asking for the limelight or the  effort.   Lisa, at one time, I got you on C-SPAN when you had to come down in  the well and hand me a piece of paper. I hope to get you in the  Congressional Record right now.   To realize that in a month from now I am going to be gone and no one  cares; but a month from now, you will also be gone, and there will  never be--it will be decades before somebody can actually replace you.   So to the staff that is here, the staff that is on the floor, the  staff that has worked on the committee, they should be recognized as  best we can for the work that they do to make everything possible. Even  though we get the headlines and we get the names in bold type in the  articles, there should be given some recognition to staff.   We have a bill that is before us that deals with heritage areas. I  congratulate the sponsor of this for taking on something that needs to  be done and, even if this does not happen, or if it does happen, still  has work that needs to be done on this topic area.   The idea of heritage areas was actually pushed on us by the National  Park Service, who wanted to find a way of stopping all the Members from  trying to create more national parks in their areas; giving them an  alternative.   The idea was to get local governments coming together and forming a  cooperative so that they could actually use and increase the tourism  and the opportunities for getting people to come and visit these  particular areas.   Now, everything that is done in a national heritage area does not  need the Federal Government to be involved. Every heritage area could  simply, by an interlocal cooperation agreement, simply come to do  everything that happens in a heritage area.   The two problems that heritage areas have had in the past are dealing  with: number one, ignoring property rights of individuals. The local  government can solve that problem by themselves. They don't need us to  do it.   Or the idea of assuming responsibilities and powers from local  governments. Local governments in an interlocal cooperation agreement  can do that by themselves. They don't need a heritage area to  accomplish that.   But one thing that heritage areas do that local governments can't do  by themselves is give themselves money and that, unfortunately, is why  most heritage areas exist, because they will get $700,000 to $800,000 a  year just to run these.   See, this was the nice part about it. When this was established in  1994, the chairman of the Parks Subcommittee was from Minnesota, and he  claimed that the amount of support is going to be limited. There is a  limit of time or the amount of money that the Federal Government can be  in a heritage area; 10 years, we are out of there. And then they are on  their own, and they will get all the benefits of that conservation.   The idea was heritage areas would be for a limited time with a  limited amount of money. And as the gentleman from Hawaii suggested,  there are still 55 heritage areas. Not one of them has ever  disappeared. Years after the time has gone by, they are still there and  still they are getting that $700,000 to $800,000 to run their programs.   The heritage areas are no longer there to try and get the people so  they can make things for themselves and handle it. Heritage areas are  simply a drain on the budget that no one wants to control.  Appropriators don't try and control the spending; authorizers don't try  and control the spending. Even the administration, though they talk and  complain about it, don't try and do it.   The Clinton administration had a problem with this. The Bush  administration asked us to quit doing heritage areas. The Obama  administration cut the funding for heritage areas in their proposed  budget by 50 percent. And the Trump administration also tried to limit  what we were doing with heritage areas.   That is the problem. What we do with heritage areas makes no sense.  It doesn't have value to it. It doesn't have responsibility and we are  not even rational.   Tennessee has a heritage area for Civil War--what is it really  called? Civil War something. The heritage area is the entire State of  Tennessee. That is illogical. That is not what it was intended to do.   We have corrupted the idea of heritage areas. And I compliment Mr.  Tonko for what he is trying do. He is saying, look, if we are going to  have these stupid heritage areas--and it looks like no one has the  responsibility to actually go back and do what we originally intended  to do; appropriators won't, and we don't seem to do it by ourselves-- then at least have some rational reason for why heritage areas are  established. Have some kind of standard.   Now, what Mr. Tonko is doing is the first step in coming up with some  way of doing this appropriately. It is not near enough. The bill does  nothing about the root problem of heritage areas just sucking up  $700,000 to $800,000 a year and never, never going away, never getting  off the Federal dole. That still needs to be addressed. It doesn't  happen in here.   But that is why I appreciate Mr. Tonko going forward with this  particular bill because, for once, we need to sit back and say, why are  we doing these heritage areas? What is their purpose? What is their  value?   If we are not doing it in an intelligent way, then all this becomes  is simply pork barrel for certain people to take the money back home to  their district, pound themselves on the chest and say, look what I have  done, even though it sets the country on a dangerous precedent.   The Federal Government and our Federal spending are in trouble, not  because we spend too much, but we spend money on too many things. And  that is why we, as a Federal Government, have to prioritize, and so  should heritage areas be part of that priority process, and we don't do  that.   So, Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman, I appreciate this. Whether  this gets all the way through, I doubt it. But I hope the gentleman  will pick it up again in the next Congress and continue to work forward  so we try and look at these heritage areas and say, why are we doing  this? What is the purpose? And how can we avoid the objections, the  obsessive, the abuse that has happened in many of these areas in the  future; so that Tennessee cannot be one heritage area.   So the gentleman is really trying to get local people to work for  their own local advantage to appreciate it, and make sure that we do it  right way.   So, with that, having tried to emphasize the fact that this is a huge  problem, I do want to be very clear that I support this particular bill  and I support the gentleman's effort.   We haven't gone far enough, to be honest. There is an amendment we  tried to make in the committee which would force heritage areas to  lower the amount of money they keep getting from the Federal Government  until they are finally weaned off the system. I still think that is the  right thing to do. We can talk about that in the future because that is  an issue still before us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice), who is the sponsor of  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, is there any time remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hice for everything that he is doing on this  particular bill. He left already. He is the one who has the accent. But  I have to admit, back where I live, this would be called Kettle Crick,  not Kettle Creek, so if you can make that change.   But the problem is, obviously, battlefields are disappearing. What  Mr. Hice has done is try to go about this the proper way, by doing the  study that sets the parameters of what we need, and with a great deal  of concern and consideration for the other people who are living in  that area, for private property in that area, for the other concerns  that take place in there.   So, I am proud of this because Mr. Hice is doing it the right way.  This is the way all of our studies should take place. This is the way  all of our concerns should take place, and it is appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of our Congress, so he can speak on  this bill, and then I will correct the Record afterwards.   (Mr. YOUNG asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo).    Mr. Speaker, I am assuming I have the traditional  15 minutes remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two  documents. The first document is the dissenting views that Republicans  filed on this bill in the committee. The second is the summary of  problems that the Department of Commerce Inspector General, the GAO and  the NOAA itself have found with the corps, which included a conclusion  that the corps does not meet the criteria for military benefits;  converting officers to civilians would result in a net savings; that a  NOAA Corps officer using a government computer onboard a NOAA ship was  accessing child pornography; purposeful violations of the Clean Water  Act by NOAA Corps-operated vessels; and a very damning observation that  ``insufficient oversight and circumvention of statutory requirements as  institutionalized organizational behavior and culture'' within this  NOAA Corps.                         Dissenting Views H.R. 2406         No doubt the members of the National Oceanic and       Atmospheric Administration Corps of Commissioned Officers       (NOAA Corps) are hardworking men and women who are honorably       serving our Nation, especially those who pilot into the       turbulent hearts of hurricanes. However, there is no       justification that this small, underutilized uniformed       service should continue to exist, much less be greatly       expanded with unprecedented benefits under this legislation.        We are not the only ones who agree with this assessment.       The House of Representatives reported or passed (by voice       vote) multiple bills that eliminated the NOAA Corps; the       Administration itself attempted to shift the Corps into       civilian status; and none other than Vice President Al Gore       slated the NOAA Corps for elimination as part of his       reinventing government initiative. In part because of the       Corps' higher expenses for its military- and veterans-type       benefits, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has       determined that the functions of the Corps could be       accomplished less expensively using civil servants or private       contractors. More seriously, GAO identified the Corps itself       as a major impediment to more efficiently and effectively       accomplishing its primary missions--to collect coastal and       geodetic data, conduct fishery surveys and produce nautical       charts--because of its continued insistence that it must use       its own ships to accomplish these goals and its reluctance to       schedule time on other, newer vessels like the University-      National Oceanographic Laboratory System ships or the new       $127M National Science Foundation regional class research       vessel. Moreover, the Corps is greatly resistant to creating       private-sector jobs by utilizing equally qualified       contractors--like those hired by the Army Corps of Engineers,       the Navy and the Environmental Protection Agency--to command       and staff NOAA ships or conduct coastal surveys. In 1990, the       Department of Commerce Inspector General concluded that NOAA       Corps members assigned to shore-based duties were 59% more       costly than equivalent civilians. If H.R. 2406 is enacted,       that cost differential will be even higher.        The Corps recognizes its life-line connection to the NOAA       fleet of civilian ships, which has fallen from 21 to 16 since       2008, noting that if NOAA does not invest in recapitalizing       its fleet there will be ``significant'' personnel impacts.       The most recent NOAA Fleet Plan (which conveniently omits any       costs) notes that half of NOAA's ships are due to be       mothballed by 2028. While the Plan calls for the replacement       of these ships, Congress has not supported greatly expanding       this expensive fleet, providing partial funding for       preliminary designs for only a single vessel to date since       2016. Instead, Congress has worked around the Corps,       supplying millions to NOAA line offices to conduct fisheries       surveys through vessel leases while admonishing NOAA for       endangering the lives of those aboard the NOAA vessel       Hi'ialakai which apparently suffered hull failure. In fact,       because of their age, many of the NOAA vessels spend       considerable time in dry dock (4 in the most recent NOAA       Fleet update) or are otherwise home in port. Perhaps this       explains why the most recent billet roster for the 321 NOAA       Corps officers show only 94 assigned to ships (including dry-      docked ships), while the vast majority are deskbound       providing ``mission support'' or rotating short-term through       civil service positions (like ``cetacean photo specialist'')       in NOAA program offices. These latter positions could       otherwise be filled by less expensive civilians with       expertise in the subject matter area and with a longer-term       commitment to the program.        These numbers illustrate why the average NOAA Corps officer       is more likely to face a paper cut than an IED, which begs       the question why multiple military and veterans benefits are       extended to the Corps under H.R. 2406. During the world wars       some NOAA personnel were temporarily assigned to the armed       services; this has not recurred, and according to GAO the       Department of Defense has no plans to commandeer NOAA Corps       officers. However, the modern Corps has used this potential       assignment authority as a justification for access to       military benefits, like burial at Arlington Cemetery or the       G.I. bill. We hope that the House Armed Services and the       Veterans Affairs Committees, which received referrals of this       legislation, will take a hard look whether these benefits       gratefully provided to those who have fought for our freedom       should be extended to persons who are not under the Code of       Military Justice, whose appointments are not reviewed and       approved by the Senate and who apparently aren't even subject       to a physical fitness requirement (see section 104 of the       bill). Again, we recognize the special case of the NOAA Corps       aviators, and would support their transfer to the Coast Guard       or another armed service so that legislation like this would       be unnecessary.        Giving the sinking NOAA fleet, one of the most troubling       aspects of H.R. 2406 is the 55% increase in the size of the       Corps and the removal of the legal constraints on the number       of officers and certain flag officers. These numbers can be       increased even further because the legislation allows the       Corps to rehire retired officers or to designate officers       serving in ``positions of importance and responsibility'' who       don't count against these caps. In addition, the Corps can       have an unlimited number of paid officer candidates to       populate the Corps ranks. Under current law, the Corps is       restricted to 321 officers and this number can be raised to       379 only if appropriate funding is available and, most       importantly, the Secretary of Commerce has ``justified       organizational needs for the commission corps for each such       fiscal year''. Not only has the Corps failed to justify this       massive increase, but this legislation strikes these       requirements while inflating the Corps officers' count to an       all-time high of 500. The Corps already struggles with       funding its handsome benefits and generous retirements, as       witnessed by several budget bills to revamp their retirement       and benefit system (there are more retired Corps officers       than those currently serving, and because Corps officers can       retire with as little as 10 years of service, more will join       these ranks). Moreover, serious allegations of sexual assault       and harassment have also plagued the NOAA Corps, resulting in       a recently enacted sexual harassment law specifically       targeted to the Corps and Corps funding for sexual assault       prevention. The NOAA Corps should get its house in order       before recruiting three to six new platoons into its ranks.        Apparently, even with these issues, the NOAA Corps has       apparently had no problem filling its current recruitment       quota if it needs such a large personnel increase.       Understandably so--it is a great gig with almost all the       benefits of a military career with few of the risks. Despite       this and with no justification, H.R. 2406 creates lavish and       expensive new perks and extends even more existing armed       forces benefits to current, future and retired Corps members:        Paid three-year sabbatical with travel and transportation       allowances and continued medical and dental care;        The ability to opt out of promotion boards. The Corps is       supposedly an up-or-out organization but based on a GAO       decision analysis, it appears that an officer who failed to       be promoted twice can be retained on staff until the officer       can qualify for early retirement;        Every single benefit provided to retired or separated armed       services members, including employment preferences and       assistance, medical and dental care, and commissary and       exchange access;        All benefits relating to armed services family programs,       including free admission to national parks;        An elaborate student loan repayment program of up to $60K a       year (currently the limit for military doctors and other       armed forces health professionals) for as little as one year       in service;        A student pre-commissioning program for tuition, fees,       education materials, monthly subsistence allowance, and a       clothing allowance, where repayment can be waived by the       Corps if the student fails to be commissioned and where any       obligation can be discharged in bankruptcy under certain       circumstances.        Payment for advanced degrees (tuition, room and board) as       well as professional credentials for employment post-Corps;        Eligibility for special payments (up to $60K), including       personal money allowances; Mandatory hiring preferences in       federal agencies;        Certain senior officers allowed to retain their higher rank       and pay while not serving in those positions if approaching       retirement; and        Repayment for failure to satisfy service requirements for       appointments, training and promotions is discretionary with       the Corps, and any obligation can be discharged in bankruptcy       under certain circumstances.        Finally, we note that this legislation was not originated       or transmitted to Congress by NOAA and was reviewed by the       Office of Management and Budget only after the markup of the       bill. During the Obama Administration, the Senate Commerce,       Science and Transportation Committee contemplated slightly       less generous NOAA Corps bills in the past, albeit without       any hearings. Perhaps it is just a coincidence that a senior       NOAA Corps officer was recently detailed to the Democrat       Natural Resources Committee staff who was previously assigned       to the Senate Commerce Committee. Given the Committee       Democrats'  [[Page H6122]]       focus on Trump Administration ethics, we hope that       appropriate measures have been put in place to prevent       conflicts of interest with this assignment.                                   ____                               NOAA Corp Issues         In a 1999 Government Accountability Office (GAO) letter to       Chairman Ken Calvert, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment,       House Committee on Science, indicated that GAO has for years       ``urged NOAA to aggressively pursue more cost-effective       alternatives for acquiring needed marine data.''        ``[NOAA] continues to rely heavily on its aging in-house       fleet of ships--many of which are costly and inefficient to       operate and maintain and lack the latest state-of-the-art       technology . . .'' and is ``reluctant to give serious       consideration to the many innovative and more modern ways       that private sector . . . could meet its basic marine data       needs.''        In a 1996 program evaluation, the Department of Commerce       Inspector General recommended that NOAA terminate its fleet       modernization efforts, cease investing in its ships, and       immediately begin to decommission, sell, or transfer them;       and contract for the required ship services.''        In a 1997 testimony from NOAA's Director of Information       Resources Management, the agency expressly stated that NOAA       Corps does not meet criteria for receiving military       compensation, converting officers to civilians would result       in annual net savings, and that entitlement to military rank       was an outgrowth of temporary assignments during the second       world war, but defense officials envision no role for them in       the future.        In 1998, the DOC IG included NOAA's fleet as one of the top       10 most serious management challenges facing the Department       of Commerce.        In 2017, GAO released a new report on NOAA Corp's functions       and again found that the Corp has not succeeded in expanding       private sector involvement in data collection--a       recommendation made by GAO as early as their 1999 report and       the IG's 1996 recommendations. The report also found NOAA was       significantly understating agency costs to conduct data       collection functions compared to the private sector.        GAO's reviews of NOAA's cost comparison reports from '06-      '16 found that NOAA had not reported significant costs such       as acquisition of a $24 million new vessel, nor did NOAA       factor in major vessel maintenance into their operational       cost estimates. Ultimately, NOAA Corp simply used costs to       measure a single square nautical mile surveyed to compare       costs, ignoring those above and other significant operational       costs.        This review ultimately found that NOAA Corp did not develop       a strategy for expanding private sector, cost effective, data       collection as required by law.        NOAA Corp also did not include administrative costs in       their comparisons because they ``do not have the software to       track contract administration costs.''        Ultimately, NOAA determined that carrying out actions in       regard to the recommendations of this report would be       difficult because it would ``[require] the coordination of       multiple offices within NOAA . . .''        In 2015, a NOAA Corp officer was found to have had website       traffic on a government computer aboard the NOAA ship Ron       Brown, which was linked to a ``notorious presence of child       pornographic images and is frequented by pedophiles.''        In 2014, DOC OIG found the improper discharge of untreated       water from a NOAA Corp vessel was an apparent practice--a       violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.                                   ____                               NOAA Corp Issues         In 2008, a NOAA Corp employee was found to have used a       government purchase credit card to purchase $18,000 in       aftermarket parts to their motorcycle.        In 2004, NOAA Corp was found to have consistently failed to       follow requirements for Senate confirmation of appointments       and promotions since at least 1986. Furthermore, it was found       that seventy-five percent of promotions were made without       first securing Senate confirmation. The report identified the       causes for this problem: insufficient oversight and       circumvention of statutory requirements as institutionalized       organizational behavior and culture.     The NOAA Corps is a very small, underutilized but  uniformed service group. It prevents questions with this type of group,  with their history that they have, first of all: Why should they exist  in the first place? But more significantly, why should they greatly  expand and grant unprecedented benefits that this legislation gives to  this group?   Congress, the administration, and even Vice President Al Gore all  slated this NOAA Corps for elimination. In part, it was because the  corps' higher expenses because of their military-type benefits, even  though they perform no military-type activities.   The Government Accounting Office, GAO, determined that the functions  of the corps could be less expensively given using civil servants or  private collectors. More seriously, the GAO said that the corps itself  is a major impediment to more efficiently and effectively accomplishing  its missionary statement, which is to collect coastal data, to conduct  fishing surveys, and to produce nautical charts.   Now, why is this the case?   Well, in one part because the corps insists that it must use their  own ships, which are failing. They are resistant to ever contracting  with qualified contractors like the Army Corps of Engineers does and  the Navy does and even the EPA does. Even this bill recognizes that  problem. If you go to look at section 501, it mandates that at least  two private-sector charting and surveying contracts must be given. They  recognize that what is happening right now is not effective, it is not  efficient, and it is a failure.   The fleet for this corps has gone from 21 down to 15 since 2008, and  the GAO also noted that the NOAA fleet plan is to mothball half of  their ships by 2028. Congress has only partially funded a single vessel  since 2016, but the money that has been gone is still in the millions,  and it goes to line officers, not for Naval vessels or for their  leases.   If one looks at the recent billet roster, you would find that the  NOAA Corps has 94 of its 321 officers assigned to ships. Only 94. That  includes the dry-docked ships. The vast majority of their officers are  desk-bound, providing, as NOAA says, mission support like having a  whale photographer.   Now, giving the sinking number of the NOAA fleet, the increased cost  of the NOAA officers, the most troubling aspect of this particular bill  is a 55 percent increase in the size of the corps; not in the amount of  work to be done, but in the size of the corps.   The corps now is restricted to 321 officers. It can be raised to 379  officers only if there is appropriate funding from Congress. Most  importantly, the Secretary of Commerce will justify organizational  needs for the commissioned corps for that particular year.   Not only has the corps failed to justify an increase--this massive  increase, but this legislation strikes those reasonable requirements of  ever going forward in the future. And it does conduct and create an  all-time high of 500 billet spots in there whether it is needed or not.   It is no surprise that there are those in the administration that do  not support this personnel increase.   The NOAA Corps' roster illustrates why the average corps officer is  far more likely to face a paper cut than any other kind of accident in  their careers in this corps military function. Which means if that is  the situation, if these are desk jobs in the first place, why are there  multiple military and veteran benefits extended to the corps under this  bill?   During World War II, this corps was temporarily commandeered and put  into the Navy service. Unfortunately, today, the Department of Defense  has no plans whatsoever to commandeer any of the NOAA Corps or their  officers. However, the corps still uses that history, that example  during World War II when they were desperately needed and used to  justify claiming military and veteran benefits that are normally given  to our Armed Forces.   I don't think there is anyone here that has any doubt or would have  any kind of grave problem giving benefits to those who fought for our  freedom, but the corps is not that type of a group. They do not fall  under the Code of Military Justice. Their appointments are not reviewed  and approved by the Senate. They aren't even subject to physical  fitness requirements of the military.   Moreover, and what is really problematic, is there have been serious  allegations of sexual assault and harassment that have plagued this  NOAA Corps, resulting recently in the enactment of a corps sexual  harassment law and targeted funding for sexual assault prevention.   Is this the kind of group, in all sincerity, that deserves mandatory  Federal hiring preferences? That would require student loan repayment  at the same rate as you would any military, like a military doctor? Is  that the same requirement that would have a 3-year paid sabbatical or  free graduate school for post-employment work or even pocket money for  their admirals?                                time  1845    All of you, if you were serious about this, should sign up for these.  The benefits are great, and all you have to do is photograph a couple  of whales.   This bill, finally, was not transmitted to Congress by the  administration. No, no. Perhaps it is coincidental  [[Page H6123]]  that there are two NOAA Corps officers who have been detailed to our  Natural Resources Committee staff, one of whom was previously assigned  to the Senate Commerce Committee staff where this bill originated.   Given that concept, given that connection, we need to have serious  measures put into effect to maybe prevent these conflicts of interests  in the future that have created this NOAA Corps dream bill where they  get all the benefits but don't have the responsibilities and they don't  do the same work.   When I said we were dealing with kleinigkeiten today, this is the  smallest of all the kleinigkeiten.   This is not a good bill. This is not something that we should forward  on. We do need to look seriously at this corps in the future.   And this is not something that is new. There are those who have been  working on this issue and dealing with this corps for the last 30 years  and still have not come up with the proper solution to it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again I appreciate the comments that are made in  defense of this organization, but as I said before, this is a 30-year- old problem.   Unfortunately, NOAA Corps is not part of the military. They don't do  military-type functions. The National Health Services, the other  uniformed corps, they don't get these same kind of benefit.   The gentleman is right; there is a provision, and there has been, on  the ability of expanding this corps if there were appropriations for it  and if the Secretary of Commerce would justify it. The problem is this  bill removes  [[Page H6124]]  that. So it will now be up to the corps to decide what their size is  and what their justification is.   It is the wrong thing to do. This is the wrong approach. This is not  the right way of doing it. And I am sorry, the studies have shown that  repeatedly over and over and over again.   If, indeed, there are some people who want to do this, it is wrong.  It is simply wrong. This is not a military. To insist that they get  military benefits is an abuse of the system. It doesn't happen anywhere  else. It is only with this. So I am sorry.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I don't have to play this game of reserving.  I would be happy to, but I think we are the only ones left on this  topic on the floor. No one else actually cares.   So, if the gentleman is ready, I will yield back, urging a ``no''  vote on this particular bill because it is the wrong thing to do and it  is not--not--justified.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate this opportunity. This bill has got one thing that I  think is going for it very heavily in that it authorizes the  opportunity of having the Federal Government being forced to actually  deal with the local community on management practices. That is  something we have been trying to get in all land management policies in  the United States. This does that, that is why we support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is a good bill, and we obviously have no problems with this  particular bill.   When I started, I talked about kleinigkeiten on the small stuff. As  good as this is, it is still small stuff and, actually, it is taken  out--it is a portion of S. 886, which deals with Indian water rights  settlements and extensions. That entire bill, if you really want to  help out Native American populations, if you really want to solve some  of these problems for them, especially during this time, with the  pandemic going on and hitting those areas even harder than some of the  others, that entire Senate bill should be taken up and passed.   Now, the fact that you have taken a small portion of that out and put  it here as a separate bill still makes this a decent bill and I am  supportive of it. But if we really cared, and we were really important  with what we did, take the entire Udall bill, bring it over here and  pass the damn thing so that we can get it signed and get it enacted  into law. That is really what would help people and that wouldn't be  kleinigkeiten. That is a big deal.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Is the gentleman sure he really wants the Federal  Government having a forest in his place?    Twenty years from now, come back here, and we  will tell the gentleman we told him so.   Madam Speaker, I have no objections to the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, once again, I have no objection to this particular  bill. I do have objections to the process we are going through.   The House has already passed a bill. It went to the Senate. The  Senate passed a bill. It came back here. Now, we introduced a new bill  to go up there with different changes in it going back to the Senate.  We should have fixed it the first time. But having said that, go with  it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, with apologies, lions and tigers and bears, oh my. I  have to say that before somebody else does it. But we also have to  realize, as we are going through the kleinigkeiten of this day's  efforts, that this is one of those kleinigkeiten coming again here. We  should also realize that Oz was not reality, it was a movie, and that  reality TV is not that of which should be the basis of public policy.   This bill, contrary to what I have been hearing so far, is not about  protecting the public from big cats. It is about hurting small, family- run zoos across the country. It is a power play of some kind, which is  one of the reasons why the Zoological Association of America expressed  their grave concerns with this bill in a very pointed letter addressed  to the committee chairman, that this represents an unwarranted Federal  intrusion into the rights and responsibilities of wildlife exhibitors  and will have significant negative impacts on federally licensed  zoological facilities.   Madam Speaker, the issue is that, under current law, anyone who has  one of these exhibitions must obtain a class E exhibitor license, and  that is given by the United States Department of Agriculture under the  Animal Welfare Act. So a licensee under the Animal Welfare Act has to  abide by all the  [[Page H6134]]  rules that govern housing and keeping and care of the animals and are  subject to unannounced inspections under the direction of the  Department of Agriculture. And it is doing its job. It is doing its job  effectively and efficiently.   Madam Speaker, this bill ignores all of that under the guise of  animal welfare, denying responsible Federal license facilities and  predicating these class E exemptions on animal rights ideology, not  necessarily the policy of what has been taken during the past.   What happens now is that this particular bill has, special interest  groups having drafted it, now amends the Lacey Act--not the Animal  Welfare Act, but the Lacey Act--and now has the Department of the  Interior being the ones who are responsible for what is going on here.   So what is illegal now under the Lacey Act changes would be legal  under the Animal Welfare Act, which is still going to be on the books.  If nothing else, we should actually ask those people who are  responsible for this bill just to come clean and try and make sure that  they write the bill so there is consistency so you don't have  conflicting acts, because you have conflicting policy with this.   And this bill also provides some huge loopholes for big, well-funded  zoos and will crush those small but well-regulated private facilities.  That is not the way we should be running that particular policy.   Madam Speaker, the smaller facilities are well-regulated. It is done  by the Department of Agriculture. There are specific rules and  guidelines. The laws are specific and they are there.   What this bill will do is put conflicting guidelines, which means,  pass this bill, if you wish, but--well, very little chance of it  actually going all the way, but even if you want to pass this bill, you  are going to have to come back and fix the two because you have, now,  two bills that are still on the books that are in conflict. So at least  do it the right way.   This bill was pushed by special interest groups. It is poor policy  that is not backed by science but is backed by radical ideology, and it  does not fit the reality of what is taking place. The Department of  Agriculture is doing their functions properly and effectively and  efficiently, and we should not pass this bill.   Madam Speaker, with all the significant things we could be doing in a  lameduck session, with all the stuff we can do with the pandemic, with  both Republicans and Democrats in both the House and the Senate  agreeing on so many things, so much low-hanging fruit, we could easily  pass something that would have a major impact, something that would be  real, or actually put the NDAA on here and do something that is real,  or actually come to an agreement on a CR, at least, if not the  resolutions of all our appropriations. That would be big. That would be  sufficient. That would be worthy of us actually coming back here to the  floor today.   But instead, we are coming here closer to 8 o'clock at night dealing  with the small stuff, the insignificant stuff that is not going to go  further throughout the process, which I guess is one of the reasons I  think we should be happy. At least we know this will be the last time  that this will be discussed here in the Capitol building at any time.   Madam Speaker, as a Congress, we can do much better. We ought to do  much better. We ought not to spend our time coming up here dealing with  the kleinigkeiten.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
