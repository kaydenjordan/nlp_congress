This division may be cited as the ``Additional Emergency       Appropriations for Coronavirus Response''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here today in these very trying and  unprecedented times to act on an emergency interim funding package that  I am pleased has strong bipartisan support. But we did not arrive here  without significant efforts by our Democratic colleagues.   When we began negotiations with the Senate, we were presented with an  insufficient proposal that did not address the public health crisis  that has now claimed the lives of nearly 48,000 Americans. The measures  that we fought for will now bring real relief to the American people  and prioritizes resources to combat this virus. This means more funding  for hospitals and healthcare workers. It also means resources  designated for testing.   I am encouraged that the administration has committed to a national  testing strategy which will be necessary to reopen our economy. We are  all painfully aware that the American people are worried about their  health, their jobs, the economy, and what life will look like after the  emergency subsides. It is our responsibility to give our communities  the confidence that we will get through this crisis, and that,  eventually, we will return to normal lives.   To do this, we must protect our small businesses on Main Street, and  that is why we fought to increase funding for the Paycheck Protection  Program and target the funds to community-based lenders, small banks,  and credit unions. The legislation before us today is a marked  improvement from where the Senate majority started, but I want to be  clear: This does not come close to addressing the staggering needs of  the American family. That is why my fellow chairs and I have already  begun working on COVID four.   Our next legislative package must be grounded in the understanding  that restarting our economy can only happen when Americans are healthy  and have the confidence to return to work. For our part, the Committee  on Ways and Means will prioritize funding for hospitals and assistance  for those on the front lines--and I know Mr. Brady agrees with us on  that--as we proceed.   In addition, our State and local governments are feeling the pain of  slashed revenue from this pandemic. Without our support, essential  workers who have been risking their lives are at risk of losing their  jobs.   Finally, we must look at what the most vulnerable in our country are  facing by putting money into their pockets with another round of  stimulus payments so they can pay for essentials. Similarly, we need to  extend Federal unemployment compensation into the fall and help take  the pressure off of overwhelmed State governments at the moment.   Since this crisis began, Members and staff have made Herculean  efforts to address the challenges we are now facing. We still have much  work to do to ensure that we put the needs of our neighbors first, and  we need to acknowledge--and I know Mr. Brady feels as I do--the work of  the Committee on Ways and Means' staffers in bringing us to this  moment. Together, we will rise to this challenge.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), whose career has been marked by a steadfast  determination to expand healthcare coverage for all members of the  American family and continues to be a champion for the least, the last,  and the lost, who are feeling part of the grip of this pandemic.

Next, our deepest gratitude to fellow committee chairs and their  contributions and shrewd negotiation of this package.   Small Business Committee Chairwoman Velazquez and Financial Services  Committee Chairwoman Waters deserve our thanks for securing funding for  small businesses that will need it the most.   Thanks to Frank Pallone from the Energy and Commerce Committee for  fighting for national testing as a strategy and securing funding to  combat this public health crisis.   Each coronavirus relief package has been a herculean effort, and this  one is no different.   With that, I want to close and wish good health to our colleagues and  our fellow Americans, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we need to establish clarity in the Record.   This legislation is much improved over what came over to us from the  Senate. This includes an additional $75 billion for our hospitals, $60  billion that is directed at people at the bottom end of the small  business community.   In addition, we all agree in this Chamber that the following has to  occur: testing, testing, testing. That was not in the legislation until  we decided on this side to establish that as a marker. This  legislation, on every basis, has been improved.   And let me just say this: President Trump has said more money for  State and local governments, Republican Governors across the country  and Democratic Governors, including the Republican Governor of  Massachusetts who has spoken to me personally on this issue, as we go  forward.   This is about the police, the fire, the EMTs. This is about the  schoolteachers. This is about those individuals who make a difference  in our lives, the postal workers every day, and not to forget those  individuals whom we depend on and we have come to see just how  important they are to all of us in the last few weeks. That is what the  additional phase four will look like.   And with that, Mr. Speaker, with gratitude, I want to recognize the  gentlewoman from New York. I must tell you that not only did she do a  great job with authoring this legislation, but her patience in  answering questions from colleagues during the course of the last 2  weeks has been remarkable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
