 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate Deacon William  Francis Xavier Kane.   Deacon Kane served as an Army intelligence officer in Vietnam. He  received a Bronze Star and the Soldier's Medal for Heroism in the war.   When he came home, he became an FBI special agent; and after a long  career, he went to seminary school and  [[Page H4179]]  became a deacon for the Archdiocese of Boston. He ministered to inmates  and learned Spanish to reach more people. Later in life, he organized  mission trips abroad.   Deacon William Kane served us, but we failed him. On May 10, he died  from the coronavirus while under the care of the Veterans  Administration. He is among the 2,083 veterans in the VA's care that  this virus has killed.   It is on us to use the powers of this body to protect veterans, and  everyone, from this virus. We must get to the bottom of the mistakes at  the VA that allowed the virus to spread. It is the least we can do for  the memory of Deacon William Francis Xavier Kane.                            ____________________
