 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my relief that this  political witch hunt into the President's alleged and now disproven  ties with Russia is finally over.   Most of us knew all along there was no smoking gun, including the  majority of my Democrat colleagues who have been parroting these lies  for more than 2 years. Now, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has all but  confirmed the President's innocence, his report finding there was no  evidence of collusion with Russia.   This whole thing started because the left couldn't accept that they  had lost an election, and the American people have suffered through  this divisive investigation as a result.   Those in Congress or in the media who perpetrated this false  narrative for 2 years should be ashamed of themselves. Believe me, the  American people know who you are, and they will not soon forget.   Even worse, still now the response by some--the lack of acceptance of  Mr. Mueller's findings, the need to dig deeper and deeper--shows they  still haven't learned a thing.   But I believe Americans will accept this truth, as most have all  along. I pray that we as a people can now finally begin to move on from  this disgraceful chapter in American history.                            ____________________
