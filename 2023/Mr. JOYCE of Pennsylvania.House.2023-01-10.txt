 Mr. Speaker, this week, we will take  historic steps to reverse the crises created by President Biden's  administration and fulfill our Commitment to America.   For the past 2 years, the Biden administration has chosen to appease  the radical left that continues to undermine American families. Now, it  is time to turn the page. It is time to return to serving the American  people.   Pennsylvania families need results. They do not need empty promises.  That is why on day one we voted to stop IRS agents from going after  small businesses who are simply trying to follow the law. That is why  we will vote to keep American oil from being sold to the Chinese  Communist Party. That is why we will vote to support our law  enforcement and send the clearest message yet that Republicans will  never allow the far left to defund the police. And we will vote to save  the lives of unborn children by finally passing the Born Alive  Survivors Protection Act.   These pieces of legislation are the beginning of enacting our  Commitment to America. It is time to build an economy that is strong;  it is time to fortify a Nation that is safe; and it is time to deliver  a government that is accountable. That is our commitment to  Pennsylvanian families. That is our Commitment to America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the growing  threat posed to the American people by the influence of the Chinese  Communist Party.    Let us be clear, the greatest influence, the greatest challenge that  we face from an outside source today, is from the Chinese Communist  Party. From intellectual property theft to deceptive trade practices,  and the acquisition of farmland to the consolidation of the rare earth  minerals industry, the Chinese Communist Party continues to pose  challenges to America as we speak.   Americans are waking up to the threat. From combating global public  health threats to defending our networks and equipping Americans to  lead in global innovation, we must act now to confront the growing  threat of the CCP.   Having served on the China Task Force, I was proud to work with my  colleagues to address these challenges. Together, we delivered over 400  commonsense and workable solutions to  [[Page H127]]  help address the challenges that we certainly recognize we face today.   In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked to shed light on the  vulnerabilities of our medical supply chain. We worked to strengthen  our national security, protect our American values, and secure our  place in international leadership for years to come.   Now, it is time to continue that mission by creating the Select  Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and  the CCP. This select committee will finally give the threats posed by  the CCP their due congressional attention and ensure that American  innovation and American ingenuity continue to outpace the threats to  global security and global stability that is perpetrated by the Chinese  Communist Party.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
