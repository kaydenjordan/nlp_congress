 Madam Speaker, by adopting this rule, we are now lining up  at the runway in preparation to land the plane on Build Back Better.   As we wait for the CBO to complete its work and produce its analysis,  which I believe will confirm an estimate from the White House based on  the Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis of the bill's revenue  impact, and the preliminary scoring from CBO that this bill is fully  paid for.   Now, I am not saying it doesn't spend money. It does not create debt.  When the Republicans passed their tax bill, of course, they gave  themselves a ceiling of $1.5 trillion that they did not pay for on the  assertion that that tax cut would pay for itself.   The problem is none of their tax cuts have ever paid for themselves.  None. Zero. Zip. This bill is paid for. And what it will do for the  American people will be life changing for working families and moms and  children in this country.                                time  2120    Today, we are going to pass a rule, which will allow for the  consideration of this bipartisan infrastructure bill to invest $1.2  trillion.   I was talking about Build Back Better. I am now talking about the  bipartisan infrastructure bill, 69 Senators voting for the bipartisan  infrastructure bill, which will make an extraordinary difference in the  lives of the people in this country and, as importantly, job creation  in this country, a million jobs per year. That is what this rule will  do.   This bill will help our businesses create millions of good jobs here  in our country, and it will make significant investments in promoting  the deployment of clean energy technologies and making our  infrastructure more resilient against climate change. That is what this  bill will do.  [[Page H6224]]    And again, I am referring to the bipartisan infrastructure act passed  with 69 votes in the United States Senate, almost half of the  Republicans voting for it. This legislation will mean that our majority  has delivered a major victory for the American people in a bipartisan  way, and passing this rule will mean that next up is the  transformational legislation to invest in America's human  infrastructure--our children, our families, and opportunities for the  most vulnerable in our country to access the American Dream.   Unlike our Republican friends who passed their tax bill, which was  about 85 to 90 percent of it going to the wealthiest Americans, this  bill deals with all Americans, particularly those who are the most  vulnerable, most challenged, and having the most difficult time in our  country.   So let's get this done today and show the American people that their  Congress works for them. We ought to vote ``yes'' on this.   Now, let me say what this rule provides for: a bill which will add  1\1/2\ million jobs per year. This bill, the Build Back Better bill,  will add 1\1/2\ million jobs per year and, on average, across the whole  decade, increase labor force participation and accelerate the return to  full employment; increase our total GDP by $3 trillion throughout the  next decade; keep prices stable and decrease inflationary pressures as  we continue our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.   The Nation has long underinvested in its infrastructure.   Now, I am sure as my friends across the aisle will remember, in 2016,  President Trump was then campaigning for office, and he pledged to the  American people that he would present a trillion-dollar infrastructure  program for this country. 2017, no such infrastructure bill. 2018, no  such infrastructure bill. 2019, no such infrastructure bill. But in  early 2019, the President said $1 trillion is not enough; we ought to  do $2 trillion. That was President Trump. $2 trillion was his  suggestion.   And we asked him: Mr. President, we will support that. Tell us how  you think we ought to fund it. Oh, we have to fund it?   The President never came forth with either a bill or with funding for  a bill. So we didn't pass that.   This President said, no, we do need infrastructure, and the figure  that Trump used is not, certainly, what this country needs, but it is a  very good start. So he sent down a bill to accomplish that objective.  That bill was not the one we passed because eight Senators from the  Republican side of the aisle and eight Senators from the Democratic  side of the aisle got together and talked about what we can agree upon.   I hear so much, particularly when I have colloquies with the minority  whip about bipartisanship, that we ought to come together, that we  ought to work together. Well, eight Senators on the Republican side and  eight Senators on the Democratic side did exactly that. And what  happened? They then went down to the White House; they talked to the  President; and the President worked with them, and they agreed.   So this is a bill that the President, 19 Republican Senators, and 50  Democratic Senators agreed was good for America. And that is what we  are enabling tonight.   The Nation, unfortunately, has long underinvested in its  infrastructure and social needs and has been slow to respond to the  threat posed by climate change. Our national security apparatus,  including the four-star generals who lead our various service arms, has  said the most existential threat to the security of the United States  of America is climate change, global warming. This bill deals with that  existential threat.   The policies being considered would direct the benefits of the  stronger growth to lower income Americans. Now, that may be why it is  sort of not what my Republican friends think ought to be done. Although  the whip talked about that somewhat, that is not what their bill did.   It addresses the long-running skewing of income and wealth  distribution in America, the richest country on Earth, where we have so  many people in poverty, so many children who don't have a good  education, so many children who don't have the healthcare they need.  This bill addresses those issues.   On November 3, 2021, according to the Economic Policy Institute,  ``The Build Back Better Act's macroeconomic boost looks more valuable  by the day.'' They said their analysis shows that the U.S. economy is  not overheating due to too much fiscal relief and recovery provided  earlier this year. Expert after expert says that.   Did we have pent-up demand? We did. Are we having a supply side  problem because of the pandemic? That is absolutely accurate. The Build  Back Better agenda will ease bottlenecks and improve the resiliency of  our supply chains.   It also boosts long-term growth and economic security through public  investments and deeper social insurance. It provides a macroeconomic  insurance policy against aggregate demand growing too slowly in coming  years.   An open letter from Nobel laureates in support of the economic  recovery agenda said this: ``Success in the 21st century will require  building upon the bipartisan infrastructure deal that has passed the  Senate, which prioritizes investments in our Nation's `hard'  infrastructure.'' That is what this rule will provide for.    Furthermore, they say: ``The President's Build Back Better agenda  employs a broader conception of infrastructure by making critical  investments in human capital, the care economy, research and  development, public education, and more, which will reduce families'  costs.''   ``Because this agenda invests in long-term economic capacity,'' they  went on to say, ``and will enhance the ability to more Americans to  participate productively in the economy, it will ease longer term  inflationary pressures.''   That was Nobel laureates talking about this economic recovery plan.  It was signed by 15 of those Nobel laureates.   Madam Speaker, the last 20 months have presented our Nation with  challenges we could neither have foreseen nor envisioned. A global  pandemic took the lives of nearly three-quarters of a million  Americans. If you went out to the lawn surrounding the George  Washington Monument, you saw rows and rows and rows of white flags  indicating those over 700,000, almost now 750,000 Americans who lost  their lives as a result of this pandemic.   We responded in a bipartisan way, and because of it, we did not go  into a depression. Because of it, we saved literally hundreds of  thousands of lives, maybe millions of lives.                                time  2130    Because of our investment, we saved businesses. Because of our  investment, we saved jobs for literally millions of Americans.   From February 2020 to February 2021, 2.3 million women in our country  left the workforce, in many cases, to care for children who had to stay  home from school or care for a sick loved one. Very frankly, this bill,  as well as the Build Back Better Act, will address the critical  shortage of childcare in this country.   Thankfully, because of the swift development and deployment of  lifesaving vaccines, our economy is coming back. I don't know whether  any of my Republican friends mentioned that we created over 500,000  jobs last month. This administration has enjoyed over 5 million new  jobs in America. That is twice the number of jobs that Mr. Trump had in  his best year. And 7 million more jobs, because Mr. Trump in his last  year lost 2 million jobs--now that was because of the pandemic, we  understand that. But to say that 500,000 new jobs is not an economy  that is growing and providing sustenance for its people.   The delta variant continues to impact, of course, that recovery,  which is slower than we would like to see. Our economy, however, has  brought back nearly 5 million jobs since President Biden took office:  now 5.5 million jobs. Americans are getting back to work. And what this  bill will do is to encourage the continuance of the growth of our  economy, continue to grow the ability to educate and raise our  children, the ability of women and single parents--male and female--to  be in the workplace. We need their expertise, we need their talent, we  need their energy. And providing safe, reliable, affordable childcare  will make such a difference.   Madam Speaker, this bill that we provide for, being considered as we  end  [[Page H6225]]  this debate, will help America grow. And the bill that the rule  provides to consider at some time in the near future, will provide  Americans with a better, safer, more secure life. For them, for their  children, for their friends, and their neighbors, let's pass both of  these bills.   Let's pass the bipartisan infrastructure framework tonight. And let  us in the very near future, as this rule provides, pass the Build Back  Better Act.
