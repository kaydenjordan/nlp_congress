 Madam President, today--in fact, in a few minutes from  now--the Senate will act in an effort to protect farmers, ranchers, and  producers from the unnecessary consequences of listing the lesser  prairie-chicken.   Even as I say the words, it brings back so many instances in which we  have had this conversation on the Senate floor, going back to my  earliest days in the Senate. This issue has been with us now for a long  number of years.   Range-wide studies over the last decade have shown that conservation  efforts are helping bird populations in the five habitat States,  including Kansas. So the lesser prairie-chicken is a native bird to  five States in our part of the country, and its populations are  important to us in Kansas and to those other States and to the country.   What strikes me is that this administration claims that American  agriculture is at the heart of needing to list the lesser prairie- chicken as either an endangered species or as a threatened species  because agriculture is causing harm to the populations.   A quote from the rule states:         Grazing by domestic livestock is not inherently detrimental       to lesser prairie-chicken management and, in many cases, is       needed to maintain appropriate vegetative structure.    That is a pretty good paragraph to indicate the value of production  agriculture when it comes to the well-being of the lesser prairie- chicken.   In other words, what that is saying is that agricultural management  practices and voluntary conservation practices of grasslands, including  grazing by ranchers, improve--improve--their habitat.   Listing the bird as a threatened or endangered species is not the  answer. Plain and simple, we need more rainfall. We need moisture in  Kansas and in other States in the West. We need more rainfall, not more  regulations.   I conclude here by saying that farmers and ranchers have always been  and will always be the original conservationists. Their livelihoods  depend on the continued conservation efforts of the soil and water they  use to produce crops and raise livestock. I am confident there are ways  to conserve the species without hindering economic opportunity in rural  communities, and I will continue to push for what Kansans have been  pursuing for years now--voluntary solutions.   I yield the floor.
