 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of our Nation's  fallen first responders, Sergeant Mike Stephen, who was killed in the  line of duty on July 18.   Sergeant Stephen was a true public servant, having served Arkansas  and our Nation as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, and soldier.  [[Page H7251]]    Sergeant Stephen began his career as a first responder when he was  just 16 years old, following in his father's footsteps by joining the  Calico Rock Fire Department.   As a soldier, Mike Stephen rose to the rank of sergeant first class.  As a firefighter, Mike Stephen led the Pineville Volunteer Fire  Department while he served as a sheriff's deputy. He instilled his  values and dedication to public service and his family, all of whom  served as volunteer firefighters. Whenever a call came to the Stephen  home, the entire family responded.   As a career law enforcement officer, Sergeant Stephen served in the  Mountain View Police Department, Arkansas Department of Corrections,  and, ultimately, the Stone County Sheriff's Office. Beloved by his  colleagues, Sergeant Stephen viewed public service as more than a job.  He was always on call 24/7, ready to assist his community in any way.  He advocated for first responders by testifying before the Arkansas  General Assembly.   On Thursday, July 18, Sergeant Stephen responded to his final call.  Early that morning, Sergeant Stephen responded to a domestic welfare  call in Leslie, Arkansas. As Stephen performed his duties, shots were  fired, and Stephen was struck fatally, as was the suspected shooter.   As Arkansas mourns the loss of Sergeant Mike Stephen, I ask my  colleagues to join me in extending my condolences to the Stephen family  and honoring the life of a true public servant who gave his life  protecting the community he loved.                            ____________________
