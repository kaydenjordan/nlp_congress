 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and career  of Detective Herman Moody, who passed away on February 25, at the age  of 98.   Herman Moody was the first Black police officer in the Las Vegas  Metropolitan Police Department. He attended Las Vegas High School and,  [[Page H1337]]  afterward, honorably served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.   After the war, in 1946, he began his 31-year service to the Las Vegas  community as part of the police department, when the town was still  segregated and there was not even a police academy for him to learn.   He was undeterred, however, and taught himself how to file reports  that would stand up in court. He found books about Nevada law so he  could make good arrests, and he shared that knowledge with his  colleagues to raise the standards of the entire Las Vegas police force.   While he battled discrimination and was passed over for promotions,  he never let that deter him from his goal. He rose to the highest rank  and served as the second highest senior officer in the Las Vegas  Metropolitan Police Department.   My condolences to his wife, Magnolia, to the Las Vegas Metropolitan  Police Department, and to the entire family.   Detective Moody, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________
