 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our  Constitution, in support of the military members in harm's way who  defend our Constitution, in support of Gold Star families who keep  faith that their loved one's sacrifice was justified.   I rise today in support of the oath I first took at 17 upon entering  the Naval Academy and took five more times in my 20-year Navy career;  an oath that comforted me in the years I spent away from my family,  deployed around the globe; an oath that encouraged me to remain  vigilant on the bridge of the ship at night; an oath that strengthened  me when in command, as I sent my fellow sailors into harm's way; and  today, an oath that gives me resolve to do what is right and not what  is politically expedient, resolve to stand with the President at the  White House last week, and resolve to stand up to the President in this  House today.   I ask my colleagues to have the same strength and the same resolve.
