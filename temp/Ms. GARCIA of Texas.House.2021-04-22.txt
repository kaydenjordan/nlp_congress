 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 1- year anniversary of Vanessa Guillen's death.   Vanessa was one of my constituents before she was transferred to the  Fort Hood military base for her Army training. She was a rising star  before her life was tragically cut short.   As Members of Congress, and as a nation, we have the moral obligation  to honor Vanessa's memory and enact change that will end violence in  our military installations. Her story has captivated Americans of all  backgrounds. It brought much-needed attention to sexual assault in the  military. It has led to changes being implemented at Fort Hood and at  military bases throughout the world.   Madam Speaker, I will not rest until there is justice for Vanessa  Guillen and her family. My thoughts and prayers are with them today.                            ____________________
