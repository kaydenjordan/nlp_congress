 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  Robert Edington. Robert's countless accolades and recognitions reflect  a lifetime of devotion to his hometown of Mobile.   This impressive list includes a 2012 Mobile Area Veteran of the Year,  the 2007 Mobilian of the Year, State president and national director of  the Navy League of the United States, chairman of the USS Alabama  Battleship Commission, and a member of the Alabama House of  Representatives and Alabama State Senate.  [[Page H3994]]    Robert was active duty with the U.S. Navy from 1951 to 1955, then  started in the Navy Active Reserve until his retirement as a commander  in 1980. As a Navy Air Operations Officer, he received numerous awards  and designations.   As a fellow graduate of the University of Alabama School of Law, I  had the pleasure of working with Robert on many occasions, and I will  miss his passion, professionalism, and friendship.   I offer my sincere condolences to his beloved wife, Pat, and their  children. They can be proud of the legacy of service that Robert leaves  behind.                            ____________________
