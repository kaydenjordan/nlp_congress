 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that would  cut funding for the student financial assistance account by $9.25  billion.   The student financial assistance account is being funded at $22  billion for fiscal year 2024. This account provides funding for grants,  loans, and other financial assistance to students who choose to pursue  higher education, but the Federal Government's subsidization of higher  education costs for individuals has actually created perverse  incentives for higher education institutions to raise prices for all  students and prospective students.   This is a spiral and cycle that has been going on for decades. A 2017  study from the Federal Reserve found the average tuition increase  associated with expansion of student loans is as much as 60 cents per  dollar.   Federal student loan subsidies don't help students with the cost of  higher education. These subsidies actually result in increased costs  for higher education, tuition, fees, and expenses.   With the Federal Government bearing the brunt of student loans,  colleges are guaranteed to get the funding they ask for at the expense  of the American taxpayer. This is a cycle that only leads to higher  spending each fiscal year.   Cutting funding for this program would claw back billions that could  be diverted to lowering the national debt and the financial burden on  the taxpayer.   The Federal Government should not have a place in the monetary  affairs of its private citizens. That is a matter for private banks,  colleges, and students.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as it stands today, Americans owe over $1.7  trillion in student loan debt, more than 5 percent of the Nation's  total $33 trillion debt.   The annual cost of attendance for students living on campus at a  public 4-year State institution is 26 grand, or over $104,000 for a 4- year degree. Out-of-State students pay $27,000, or over $108,000.  Private nonprofit university students pay 55 grand, or more than  $225,000.   Do you know what is a new low? Do you know what is cruel? Do you know  what is unconscionable? It is sending kids out with worthless degrees  with debt that they can never sustain.   It is a new low to oppose something like this because you know what  is driving this? It is the exponential growth of children and kids who  are coming up who cannot afford education because your grants, your  continued giving of taxpayer funding to the universities has actually  increased the number of people who have to get assistance.   Why? Because tuition has spiked. It is growing multiples of the  inflation rate. That is what is cruel. That is what is unconscionable.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, what is driving the increased costs of tuition?  Well, most of that is because the bureaucratization of academia. That  drives costs higher every year.   Let's go back to that 2017 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York. The average tuition increase associated with expansion of student  loans is 60 cents for every dollar. So when your tuition is going up a  buck, 60 cents of it is because of expansion of student loan programs.    The Biden administration's efforts to eliminate student loan debt is  wrong--wrong because they force everyday Americans to pay for the  student loans taken out by others and wrong because they doubled down  on a failed public policy that incentivizes price increases. You  incentivize tuition to go up. Why would a university ever reduce its  tuition or its costs? They know that they have the Federal Government  to backstop every student who wants to go in.   The way to curb the rise in both college tuition and student debt is  to get the Federal Government out of the student loan business. The  result will bring about more fiscally responsible citizens and a more  fiscally responsible Federal Government. This would make the loan  market more responsible and cause colleges to rein in their costs and  reduce tuition so fewer students would need Pell grants or private aid.   Private lending would also limit taxpayers' exposure to billions of  dollars in student loan defaults. Did I say billions? I meant to say  trillions because that is where we sit.   Now, I want to respond in the time I have left to the cynical  statement by the previous speaker who was talking about aid to Israel.  We passed aid to Israel by a 226-196 vote. How did that happen? Mr.  Chair, 196 of my friends across the aisle did not want to provide aid  to Israel in that circumstance.   Mr. Chair, I urge people to adopt this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of my amendment that  would strike funding for the Student Aid Administration.   The Student Aid Administration provides funding for the government to  administer student financial assistance programs, including funding for  the office responsible for ensuring accountability for higher education  institutions who receive Federal dollars.   Unfortunately, under this administration, this regime, the Department  of Education has developed a pattern of attacking large, higher  education institutions that have a religious affiliation.   I will give you two of these today.   The Department of Education has repeatedly gone after Grand Canyon  University, the largest private Christian university in the country.  The Department of Education levied a $37.7 million fine. This is the  largest fine in the Department's history.   GCU was a nonprofit from its inception in 1949 until 2004 when they  partnered with private investors in order to avoid closing.   In 2018, GCU returned to its nonprofit status and is recognized by  the IRS, the Higher Learning Commission, the State of Arizona, Arizona  Private Postsecondary Board, and the NCAA. However, despite all this,  the Department of Education has refused to acknowledge GCU's nonprofit  status for purposes of Federal student financial aid.   By not acknowledging GCU's nonprofit status, the Department of  Education is able to target GCU and others as ``bad actors due to the  disproportionate number of Americans who attend those schools and then  default on Federal student loans.''   However, GCU provides much higher levels of transparency than are  legally required, and it is considered a leader in education  transparency. The Department of Education, for instance, only requires  universities to provide cost estimates for the first year in college-- for first-year, first-time students, and only for undergraduate  programs, but GCU goes beyond these requirements by providing cost  estimates for each year of the program study and for all of its degree  programs, including the doctoral level.   Rather than apply what GCU has done, the Department has attacked  them, making this fine all the more troubling. The Department of  Education is trying to make the claim that GCU lied to students about  the cost to attend doctorate programs, but that is inaccurate.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, GCU's degree program calculator provides the  total estimated cost for a 60-credit doctoral program the exact same  way it does for other degree programs. That is not required under the  Department of Education, but the Department of Education still goes  after them.   GCU in its effort for clear transparency in red print above the  calculator makes clear both the average number of continuation courses  and cost for continuation courses that students may need to complete a  doctoral dissertation.   The Department of Ed even acknowledges that GCU provides this  disclosure, but nonetheless, continues to go after them. GCU graduates  are incurring less debt than the national average due to its affordable  tuition rates, and still, the Department of Ed goes after them.   A GAO report found that 91 percent of American colleges have  misleading information in their financial aid offers, but GCU is the  only nonprofit university being attacked from the Department of  Education.  [[Page H5790]]    At the same time, Liberty University is being threatened with a  similar $37 million fine by the Department of Education, alleging Clery  Act violations based on a preliminary report in May of this year.   Liberty University has fully cooperated with the Department's  investigation and found the Department made significant errors,  misstatements, and unsupported conclusions in their findings.   Why is Liberty University getting threatened with what would be  another $37 million fine from the Department of Education when they are  fully cooperating?                                time  1530    These two big universities are two of the largest Christian  universities in America. Is that why they are being attacked by this  Department of Education? It certainly seems to be the case.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask my friends: Do you support a tax on  private Christian universities by the Department of Education, the very  Department that I am trying to defund?   When you talk about the American Dream, student loan debt is crushing  graduates, which is why when you look at polling, it indicates very  clearly that young graduates do not believe they will attain the  American Dream that their parents had access to. They are coming out  with crushing student debt at the same time that that same Department  is trying to crush very fine universities.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I am going to respond to the ``scurrilous''  comments made in the last statement. Nothing in my amendment addressed  online, for-profit private colleges, postsecondary. That was a  deliberate mischaracterization of what I said, because the two  universities I talked about are both nonprofit universities, recognized  as postsecondary education institutions.   GCU is recognized by the IRS as nonprofit, Higher Learning  Commission, State of Arizona, and the Arizona Private Postsecondary  Board. Liberty University is equal in their classification.   To say what was said for 2\1/2\ minutes, to actually misdirect and  try to misattribute my purpose, was an ascribing of motivations which  should have been taken down.   Mr. Chair, I rise now to speak in support of my amendment, which  would strike funding for the higher education account. It appropriates  over $2.7 billion. This account provides appropriations for grant  programs that provide direct taxpayer support to higher education  institutions.   The effect of government subsidy and control has been more damaging  than anyone has yet realized. Coupled with student assistance programs,  direct government assistance to institutions has led to increased  education costs and administrative costs.   Let's think of it. College costs are out of control. Harvard, the  total cost of attending for 4 years is now around $300 grand. College  costs have risen to this level because D.C. is heavily subsidizing  tuition through Federal grants and loans, leaving colleges and  universities free to increase their prices because they know the  Federal Government is going to pick up the tab in between.   In FY 2023, we enacted a level of $2.994 billion, $600 million more  than fiscal year 2019.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it is a shame that people make aspersions on  the floor when they don't know anything about a subject.   I think of Grand Canyon University and the 35,000 students on campus,  on a physical plant, in Phoenix, Arizona. I just heard that they are an  online school. Go tell those people who commute or live in the dorms at  one of the fastest growing physical plant campuses in the country.   It is like saying the University of Arizona is an online school, with  their 35,000 students, because they have an online program where you  can get a bachelor's degree without ever setting foot on campus, or ASU  or BYU, or any of the hundreds of other campuses.   How can you misdirect and try to attack an amendment when you simply  don't know what is going on with what you are saying? It is astounding.  It is astounding.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, nobody wants to revoke postsecondary  education. What we want to do is acknowledge what the Federal  Government has done to distort the cost of education.   The New York Fed itself has said it is eating it up, and 60 percent  of every tuition increase is coming because of this aid. We want to get  it down so it is affordable again. We want nobody leaving college  crushed by the student debt that they have. That is what is going on  here.   The fiscal year 2023 enacted level was $3 billion. That is $600  million more than just a few years before in 2019. The 2024 number is  slightly less, but it doesn't do enough to cut spending when we are  $35.5 trillion in debt.   Let's talk about what is happening. Universities are discriminating  against conservative-leaning students. We see that. We had a hearing on  that just last week. A recent University of North Carolina study found  that conservative students within the UNC system face distinctive  challenges when it comes to free speech and expression.   Nearly 68 percent of conservative students are at least slightly  concerned about possible social consequences that may come from voicing  one's true opinion in class. It is a massive problem that higher  education fosters.   It is time that we move the Federal Government out of this business  because they don't have any constitutional authority to be there in the  first place.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which strikes funding for the Institute of Education Sciences.   The current funding in the fiscal year 2024 bill is $707 million. The  institute puts this funding toward programs such as governing boards of  institutions of higher education, which is interested in the disclosure  of gender, racial, and ethnic composition of governing boards of higher  education to promote DEI institutions, which is a pointless use of  information and resources.   This institute puts funding toward programs such as cross-sectional  studies. This is a program launched to provide real-time data about the  impact of COVID-19 on public K-12 education. The content focuses on how  COVID-19 is affecting the delivery of education and how schools are  navigating recovery efforts from that epidemic.   The Department of Education requested $4 million initially to further  expand the survey across districts nationally. It is not a mission that  the American taxpayer needs to fund, and it is a direct waste of our  budget.   It is offices such as this that contribute to the rapid wasteful  spending that has become so commonplace in our country under our  Federal Government.   As far as the grant programs under the Institute of Education  Sciences, they go toward post-COVID-19 research. This is research to  accelerate pandemic recovery in special education grant programs and  improve pandemic recovery efforts in education agencies' grant  programs.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, under the Institute of Education Sciences, they  will establish two research networks, the pre-kindergarten through  grade 12 recovery research network and the community college recovery  research network to study pandemic events. It is a grant that pertains  to gender-integrated classrooms to see if boys and girls are better  equipped to learn together or separately in the classroom.   The fiscal year 2019 enacted level was over $615 million, but 2024 is  currently set at over $707 million. That is a $90 million increase in  just 5 years. This rate of growth is not sustainable.   This program is part of what we could safely call the educational- industrial complex. Over the years, our predecessors created a  constituency and expanded on it every year by giving more money. They  justify it by putting more mandates and doing more studies that don't  mean anything. They come back and do it again and again.   Thus, we are well over $33 trillion in national debt. Our structural  deficit last year was over $2 trillion. Fiscal year 2024 looks like it  is going to be about the same, except we are going to be north of $35  trillion, $36 trillion in national debt. That is crushing.   Mr. Chair, I take my colleagues back to the New York Fed and its  study. Of every dollar of tuition that increased, 60 percent of that,  60 cents of that, goes to the fact that the Federal Government is  meddling in postsecondary education. That is what is happening here.  That is the educational-industrial complex.   In December 2020, the Trump administration nominated Steve Hanke and  John Yoo, both professors, to the advisory board for the IES. Education  Secretary Miguel Cardona refused to acknowledge the appointments,  deliver their credentials, or facilitate statutorily required board  meetings.   That is the educational-industrial complex that we are facing today.  It is crushing. It is crushing our students who want an education.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the greatest strength of this body is that we  represent constituents who send us here knowing that we are constrained  in protecting their rights because we are limited by what we can and  cannot do by that great document, the Constitution.   I stand here willing to learn and find out where in the Constitution  there is any specific authority for this body to meddle in  postsecondary educational choices of the American people. That is the  educational-industrial complex at work, for what we are seeing in the  arguments against my amendments today.   I support postsecondary education. I do not support the Federal  Government meddling in the choices of individuals to get that education  and how they are going to get it and the institutions that are  providing it--the harassment that some of those institutions are  receiving from this administration.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which will prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services from  making any voluntary contributions to the World Health Organization.   The World Health Organization failed the world and America with its  response to COVID-19 and has continued to fail the world and the U.S.   The WHO helped perpetuate the Chinese Government's wholly inaccurate  claims and even praised their handling of the outbreak. The WHO  Director-General applauded President Xi's very rare leadership and  China's transparency. The WHO was complicit in its deception, willfully  accepting what China had claimed and spread to the rest of the world  instead of doing its job and verifying the claims that were made.   Further, in 2021, the WHO dismissed the COVID lab leak theory as  being ``extremely unlikely'' after a visit to China. The WHO even  returned from that trip with the theory that the virus was transmitted  to humans through frozen food, which was an absurd claim.   Then, in 2022, 2 years after COVID, the WHO changed its tune and  recommended more investigation into the lab leak theory, the same  theory that it had so eagerly dismissed as a conspiracy theory because  President Trump suspected what was going on back in 2020. It turns out  President Trump was right to withdraw funding from the World Health  Organization.   In addition, the World Health Organization has allowed North Korea to  sit on its executive board. North Korea lacks any qualifications to  justify a seat on the board. North Korea lacks any sort of transparency  in its management of the COVID-19 outbreak. North Korea's track record  of responses to public health issues raises significant concerns that  it is able to participate in the WHO's decisionmaking process.   How is it that North Korea, a country that has a well-documented  history of human rights abuses and atrocities, is allowed to sit on the  World Health Organization's executive board, an executive board that  sets and enforces the organization's agenda and policy? The human  rights record of North Korea is often considered one of the worst in  the world.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Chair, I have been talking about North Korea. At the  same time that we put North Korea on the board, you see North Korea on  the executive board of the WHO, Taiwan is excluded. Why? Because China  isolates Taiwan.   If you are concerned about China taking our place in WHO, China  already has incredible resources and influence over Director Tedros.  That is what is going on.   Let's talk about this because I think that what we just heard was a  conflation--a conflation, all the things, all the good things the WHO  is doing, this and that. Guess what? We paid mandatory fees to them of  $200 million in 2021. In the 2021 report to Congress, the excess  amount, or the voluntary amount, was $99 million.   Since the despicable attack on Israel by Hamas, the World Health  Organization and its subsidiary in Gaza has  [[Page H5815]]  spent weeks using their platform to advocate for an immediate cease- fire, a position that has been the rallying cry for the Hamas- sympathizing political left right here in the United States.   On October 18, the Twitter account for the WHO in occupied  Palestinian territory--in other words, in Gaza--issued a statement on  the explosion in the parking lot of the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, which  turned out to be bogus.   We are saying we will keep paying a mandatory amount. We are not  going to give up our seat, but we are not going to pay a $99 million  voluntary amount.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I remind everyone that this is only the  voluntary amount that we give above our membership allotment to the  World Health Organization.   We should all be in support of this.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would prohibit the use of funds to  pay for the salary and expenses of the Department of Health and Human  Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is currently occupied by  Director Robin Dunn Marcos.   ORR's negligence has led to the endangerment of unaccompanied alien  children.   In March of 2021, ORR weakened its safety protocols by eliminating  the proof of address requirements for sponsors and exempting other  household members from submitting to a background check or providing  identification.   ORR has prohibited asking whether a sponsor of a UAC is a citizen and  doesn't consider a sponsor with deportation orders as disqualified. In  addition to this, criminal history and a refusal to submit to a  background check also are not considered disqualifiers for individuals  becoming sponsors.   Think of this: Children, unaccompanied minors, who have come into the  U.S. that we have placed into the care of ORR are being given to people  who may have a criminal history, but those people with a criminal  history are not disqualified for being a foster parent for this UAC.   It is an abject failure that the lack of a vetting process is in  place to allow for an individual to become a sponsor when they have a  criminal history or deportation orders that are not considered.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    You know what I think is a disgrace? I think it is  disgraceful when the person who is in charge of placing those children  has lost contact and communication with more than 85,000, according to  The New York Times, and that was 7 months ago. The real number now  exceeds 100,000. Mr. Chair, that is 100,000 children that this  individual has lost contact with--her office and the Department has  lost contact with. That is what is disgraceful.   If we are talking about policy and that she is merely carrying out  the policy of the administration, are you telling me that it is the  policy of this administration to lose contact and not adequately vet  people? You know, you have some people who received literally a dozen  or more individuals--little children--into that home, and that person  was not qualified and not adequately vetted.   Two-thirds of all UACs that leave HHS's care work illegal, full-time  jobs, often in factories and in hazardous conditions.   ORR has an agreement that the sponsor is supposed to sign to protect  the UAC from being trafficked or exploited, but that doesn't seem to be  very effective.   Caseworkers within ORR claim that HHS regularly ignored obvious signs  of labor exploitation, such as single sponsors sponsoring multiple UAC,  hot spots in the country where many UAC sponsors are not the children's  parents, UAC with significant debts, and direct reports of trafficking.   These sponsors that are inadequately vetted by ORR and HHS can be  dangerous, and they are sending these children to work in factories and  other hazardous work environments.   You want to know what is disgraceful? That is what is disgraceful.   This person should not be in this position. If this is the Biden  policy, that is disgraceful. I don't think that is really what this  administration wants done.   This amendment would remove this person from office, and let's get  somebody in there who is interested in taking care of those kids and  making sure they are cared for.   I get down to the border regularly. I go to the border often. I can't  tell you how many times I have come upon groups with unaccompanied  children, knowing that we have no idea whether they are going to be  cared for in our country or not.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Again, you know what I think is disgraceful? That we are  going to start discussing someone's livelihood and say, oh, they have  an impeccable background. Do you know who doesn't care about their  livelihood and impeccable background? How about the kids that have been  misplaced, over 100,000, many working in illegal labor jobs. They don't  care about her livelihood. They would like to be cared for humanely.  How about the children who have been sex trafficked? They don't care  about her livelihood or her impeccable background, and I don't either.  I care about those children.   I think it is disgraceful that this administration continues to allow  this kind of policy to be implemented if that is their policy. The  vetting requirements that this director put in place facilitates this  trafficking and abuse of these children. It is disgraceful.   Mr. Chair, I urge people to adopt my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
