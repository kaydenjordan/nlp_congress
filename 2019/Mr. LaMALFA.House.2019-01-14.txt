 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and great  sadness that I rise today to mourn the loss of 22-year-old Davis,  California, police officer Natalie Corona, who was shot and killed a  few days ago after what seemed to be a routine response to a traffic  accident.   The motive remains unclear, but then what does it matter what the  motive is? We have lost a beautiful, amazing young officer.   It comes just a few months after she was pinned as a new officer by  her father, Merced Corona, who himself spent 26 years as a veteran of  the Colusa County Sheriff's Office.   Young Natalie, after spending much of her time volunteering with the  police force in Colusa County, graduated from the academy in July, an  eager rookie, ready to protect and serve her community.   Even before joining the force herself, she frequently posted on  social media to honor fallen officers and show support for the thin  blue line.   Her police chief, Darren Pytel, had these words to say: ``She was  just an absolute star in the department and someone that pretty much  every department member looked to as a close friend, a sister. . . .  She just worked like you can't believe.''   This is on the heels of Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. We are  losing too many of our great officers in this country and California as  well, especially a vibrant, young lady like Natalie Corona.   God bless her family and her memory.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative  Hartzler, for having this Special Order tonight and for allowing me to  be part of it.   I join her in my great concern for the crisis that is happening at  our southern border. I agree with our President that it is a  humanitarian and national security crisis that has been ignored for far  too long.   Being from California, I can name three names, just right off the top  of my head, that are the sign of our porous borders and the tragedy we  have seen from them.   We all remember Kate Steinle, killed in San Francisco with her  family; Jamiel Shaw from southern California, needlessly killed; and,  as Mrs. Hartzler mentioned, most recently, Ronil Singh from central  California, a police officer, as she mentioned, who did it the right  way, serving in honor to help keep our streets safe, all mowed down by  illegal immigrants in our country.                                time  1945    Now, some will downplay this. Some downplay the necessity of a strong  fence at our southern border. There areas of our border that already  have barriers that are significantly better at preventing illegal  trafficking.   In San Diego, illegal traffic has decreased by 92 percent since a  physical barrier was constructed back in 1992. There are few situations  that I can think of where 92 percent isn't seen as a win and as  effective. The fact is that these barriers work.   There are long stretches of our southern border where even more  sturdy fences would be more effective. Many of my Democratic colleagues  seem to know this, but they are apparently more interested in  obstructing this President than in reaching a compromise to reopen our  government, secure our border, and provide disaster funding to the West  Coast and the Southern States.   Now, this is only a few years after passionate speeches by major  Democratic leaders and the votes to back it up. We saw, again, Mrs.  Clinton, President Obama, Senator Schumer, as well as President Bill  Clinton right at this dais a few years ago passionately speaking about  the need for this.   It is about giving Border Patrol agents the tools they need to be  successful in protecting our Nation's sovereignty from gunrunning,  human trafficking, and the mass flow of high-risk drugs, as so  eloquently outlined by Mrs. Hartzler, by all of these violent gangs  that have free access to our borders.   The complete and total lack of negotiation by our Democratic  colleagues is telling. They are not happy to reopen the government.  They are just fine with our porous border the way it is. I guess, does  this poll well?   I believe the overwhelming majority of Americans are not happy with  it. They want solutions for border security, for the coyotes who are  preying on those who are seeking passage into this country--unspeakable  things that happen to women in these crossings by these coyotes and  others who take advantage of them. Is that compassion?   We seek legal entry for people who seek work permits for agriculture  and other work needs and a DACA solution that we can all come to the  table and find common ground on. So, indeed, real negotiations need to  happen in good faith to reopen our government and secure our border, as  is our duty to our sovereign Nation that we swear an oath to protect.   I thank Mrs. Hartzler for yielding me the time.
