 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2353.   Not only does this legislation authorize more available funding for  CTE programs, it also gives States more freedom to support CTE  activities in rural districts like mine.                                time  1415    This bill also gives authority back to the States to approve CTE  plans rather than require Federal approval.   In the short time I have been in Congress, I have seen firsthand the  unique differences across each of our States and districts. Increasing  flexibility will enable States to have the flexibility to create and  support programs that fit their unique workforce needs.   I am excited to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and look  forward to its passage later today. Helping our young people transition  from school into meaningful careers is one of the best ways we can move  our Nation into a vibrant 21st century economy.
