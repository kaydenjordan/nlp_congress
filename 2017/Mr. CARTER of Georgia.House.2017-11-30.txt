 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Gary Lewis who passed away on November 20 at 65 years of age.   Mr. Lewis was well known in Jesup, Georgia, for serving his community  with his dentistry practice. For years in Jesup, he served all corners  of his town with quality dental care, and, after his retirement, Dr.  Hugh Armstrong continued his legacy of dentistry.   Mr. Lewis' dedication to his community is exemplified by his work  with Help a Child Smile Mobile Dental Program. In this program, Mr.  Lewis would go into schools and use his expertise as a dentist, free of  charge, to serve students whose parents may not have the funds, the  time, or the ability to regularly take their child to a dentist.   Outside of dentistry, Mr. Lewis enjoyed hunting and fishing and was  an active member of the Jesup Primitive Baptist Church.   I know the entire Jesup community will miss Mr. Lewis' bright spirit  and helping hand.                            ____________________
