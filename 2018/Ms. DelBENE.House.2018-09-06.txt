 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Reverend  Alexander, or Lex, Breckinridge, and to thank him for offering this  morning's prayer. Father Lex serves as the rector of St. Thomas  Episcopal Church in my hometown of Medina, Washington.   He always felt the call to ordained ministry in the church, but it  took him awhile getting there. He was born in West Virginia. He went on  to school in New Hampshire and North Carolina, and practiced law in New  Orleans before attending a seminary in Austin, Texas. After serving the  church in Austin, he found his way to the great Northwest and to our  community.   Reverend Breckinridge is joined today by his wife, Zonnie. They have  three children and have enriched the Medina community for 9 years. We  value his service and appreciate his leadership and guidance that  continues to impact so many lives. We appreciate him flying across the  country to be with us today.                            ____________________
