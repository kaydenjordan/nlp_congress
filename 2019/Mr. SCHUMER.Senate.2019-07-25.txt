 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we all know that yesterday former  Special Counsel Mueller testified before two House committees. I  believe it was crucial for the American people to hear straight from  Robert Mueller's mouth that the President was not--underline ``not''-- exonerated by his report, despite what the President claims. It is  utterly amazing. Mueller says something, and the President says the  exact opposite to the media. We have never had a President who has lied  so often. He knows what Mueller said, but he thinks he can dupe people  when he says it, and I hope it is not true.   It is important for the American people to hear straight from Robert  Mueller's mouth that the President is not telling the truth when he  claims that Mueller found no obstruction. Mueller did not. Anyone who  watched the hearing saw it. It was as plain as could be, but that is  not the subject of my remarks today.   My remarks are about election security. Above all, it was important  for all of us to hear straight from Robert Mueller's mouth that the  threat from Russia and other foreign adversaries seeking to meddle in  our elections was very real and still very much ongoing.   When asked about Russian interference in our democracy, Mr. Mueller  responded:         It wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit       here. And they expect to do it during the next campaign.    Leader McConnell, let me read you those sentences, if you care about  America. Mueller said about Russian interference:         It wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit       here. And they expect to do it during the next campaign.    He went on to say that many more countries were developing  capabilities similar to what Russia has. He reminded members of the  House Intelligence Committee that Russian fake images reached nearly  126 million people on Facebook alone.   As if it even needed to be spelled out, Mr. Mueller added: ``Much  more needs to be done in order to protect against these intrusions, not  just by the Russians but by others as well.''   Mueller's testimony was a clarion call for election security.  Mueller's testimony should be a wake-up call to every American-- Democrat, Republican, liberal, and conservative--that the integrity of  our elections is at stake and to be manipulated by a foreign power.   This is all about the future of this country. If we lose faith in our  electoral process, democracy begins to walk away from us, and we will  be a different country than the glorious country we have been since  1789. Yet our Republican colleagues put their heads in the sand.   Donald Trump, as usual, with his enormous self-ego, doesn't want to  admit the Russians interfered--even though he encouraged it publicly-- because he feels it will cast some illegitimacy on his election. The  election is over. He is President. I wish he weren't. But that is not  the issue here.   The issue is the future of our democracy. And our Republican  colleagues, who, once again, either are afraid of President Trump or,  even worse, seeking advantage from Russian interference, are keeping  their heads in the sand.   We have tried. We have worked with our Republican colleagues to craft  several bipartisan bills--Democrats and Republicans alike--to safeguard  our election infrastructure and deter any foreign adversary from  targeting our democracy in 2020. We have asked the Republican majority  on the Appropriations Committee to devote more resources to harden  their election systems but to no avail.   Leader McConnell has refused to bring these bills to the floor.  Republicans have rebuffed our request for additional appropriations  this year. Election security goes into McConnell's legislative  graveyard, even though it should be the most nonpartisan of issues.   He has refused--refused--to let us consider anything, using his power  as majority leader. And he is backed up by every single Republican who  is complicit in not stopping the Russians, as Putin seeks to stretch  his long arm and delve into the sacred process of how we elect our  officials.   What could possibly be the downside of ensuring our elections are  fair and  [[Page S5075]]  free from foreign interference? Why would Leader McConnell and every  one of our Republican colleagues, who now have failed to step up to the  plate even though some of them work with our colleagues on bills,  ignore the admonitions of the Founding Fathers, who said that foreign  interference is a grave danger to democracy? What could be the downside  of ensuring our elections are fair and free? I ask that question of  Leader McConnell.   The only excuse I have heard is he says that additional action isn't  necessary. Well, Mr. Mueller, who has done far more investigative work  on this than just about anybody else, cleared up all of that yesterday.  He didn't say we have done enough already. He didn't say we are on top  of it. He said that much more needs to be done.   Leader McConnell, do you disagree? Is Mueller wrong? Are all the  experts wrong--the FBI, appointed by President Trump; the NSA,  appointed by President Trump; and all those leaders who say we need to  do more? We have heard them.   We are going to continue our fight for election security. We are not  going to let Leader McConnell put the bills passed by the House into  his legislative graveyard without a fight. You are going to hear from  us on this issue over and over again.   The legislative graveyard of Leader McConnell is known from one end  of the country to the other. Americans know he doesn't want to help  them. He doesn't want to help middle-class Americans.   The graveyard of our Republican colleagues, in obeisance to powerful  and special interests, gets larger, more stunning, and more  debilitating to this country every day.   Yesterday, Democratic Senators requested unanimous consent to pass  some election security legislation that they have worked on, much of  which was bipartisan. The Republican majority blocked them. Soon--I  believe in about an hour--I will be asking unanimous consent on the  House-passed election security bill. It is sitting here. It is in the  leader's drawer. Is he going to let this go to the legislative  graveyard? We will see in an hour. I hope at least one of my Republican  colleagues will come to the floor and urge that we vote on this or at  least debate it and amend it--one.    The Republican leader's intransigent resistance to this effort is  inexplicable. Why he wants to put election security in his legislative  graveyard is impossible to explain on a logical basis. I believe his  intransigence and his resistance are untenable.   When I move in about an hour for unanimous consent to bring the House  bill to the floor, maybe something will be chirping in some of the  brains of some of my colleagues here and say: We can't allow the  Russians to interfere, and we have to do something.   If they don't agree with what the House passed, let them propose  amendments or let them propose an alternative, but let us debate. This  is a national security issue of paramount importance.   I urge my friend the leader to stand down and let election security  come to the floor. If he doesn't, all of America will know, when Russia  interferes, why.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter--this is on deficits.  I am not in the habit of commenting on every opinion issued by  newspapers I don't typically agree with, but this week, the Wall Street  Journal wrote such a howler of an editorial that I feel compelled to.   The Wall Street Journal editorial board criticized the latest budget  agreement for its increase in domestic spending, wringing its hands  over the effect on deficits, while simultaneously praising defense  spending, which the editorial board believes, for some reason, has  nothing to do with deficits.   This, by the way, is the same editorial board that played head  cheerleader for the Republican tax bill, which contained such mammoth  tax cuts for the biggest corporations and the already wealthy that it  will add $2 trillion to our deficits--$2 trillion. Huge tax cuts  contributed more to the deficit than all of these spending programs put  together, but the Wall Street Journal cheered on the tax cuts and now  says: Don't spend for the middle class on things like education and  infrastructure that have broad support in America and helping kids go  to college. Don't spend on that because it increases the deficit, but  it is OK to pass massive tax cuts for the rich and the big corporations  that are already profitable.   So, for the sake of the record, the Wall Street Journal editorial  board believes deficits are really bad but only if they are caused by  investments in Americans' healthcare or education or infrastructure.  When deficits are caused by defense spending and when deficits are  caused by tax cuts for the wealthy, they are peachy.   The truth is, so many of my Republican friends have engaged in the  same egregious bit of hypocrisy. So I have a few words this morning for  my deficit-scolding friends Mick Mulvaney and the Wall Street Journal  editorial board: A deficit is a deficit is a deficit. They try to make  the argument that massive tax cuts won't create a deficit, but all the  numbers that are coming in now and are projected in the future say that  is just not true. If the Wall Street Journal really cared about  deficits above all, they wouldn't have supported the tax bill.   When the Senate debated these tax cuts in 2017, there were several  proposals on the table--many Democrats and Republicans supported them-- that would have reduced taxes on corporations while remaining deficit- neutral. Many would have changed the Tax Code in ways I didn't support,  but nonetheless they would have held revenues and expenditures in line.  We didn't hear a peep out of the Journal to support those proposals-- oh, no. Democrats even put together a deficit-neutral middle-class tax  cut at the time, but Republicans ignored it and pushed through Congress  a bill that lined the pockets of the wealthy--blowing a $2 trillion  hole in our deficit. The Wall Street Journal could have said something  then. They didn't. They were asleep at the switch. They were asleep at  the switch then, and they are crying now.   The fact is, Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars in  the Middle East, championed by George Bush and the Republican Party,  are the big drivers of the Nation's debt and deficit, not nondefense  domestic spending.   President Obama, to his credit, cut the budget deficit in half during  his term. The last time we had a surplus was under a Democratic  President, Bill Clinton. In fact, every single Republican  administration has added to the deficit, while every single Democratic  administration has shrunk it since 1981--Reagan, deficit increased; H.  W., deficit increased; Bill Clinton, deficit goes down; George Bush,  deficit increased; Obama, deficit goes down; Donald Trump, deficit  going up. What does that say?   So, to the Wall Street Journal editorial board and my Republican  friends who are silent about Trump-era deficits but rail against  domestic spending, I say: Spare us. Enough. Enough with this deficit  hypocrisy.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on climate, I want to  congratulate my dear friend, one of the most intelligent, hard-working,  articulate Senators we have, Sheldon Whitehouse, on reaching a  rhetorical milestone. Usually ``rhetoric'' and ``milestone'' don't go  together, but in his strong eloquence on the environment, they do.   Yesterday, Senator Whitehouse gave his 250th speech on the subject of  climate change. Many Members of this Chamber have yet to speak 250  times on the floor in total, much less on a single topic. Senator  Whitehouse's speeches have covered everything from sea level rise to  polar cap ice melting and the effect of climate change on our economic  security and our national security. He has diligently shone a light on  the impediments to legislative progress on climate change, and he waxes  fervent and poetic, condemning the web of dark money that funds  fraudulent climate research and lobbies against climate action.   Much more important than Senator Whitehouse's milestone, of course,  is the issue he is talking about. Each passing week brings another  proof point that climate change is happening  [[Page S5076]]  right now and reshaping our planet for the worse, moving so quickly  that, at some point, we will not be able to recover no matter what we  do.   The world will be so much worse for our children and grandchildren. I  think of my 8-month-old--just turned 8 months on the 24th--my little  grandson. Will his world be the same as ours? Will it be just as  beautiful, or will it be flooding and fires and changes that make his  life and the lives of his whole generation far more difficult? If we do  nothing, that will happen.   Carbon levels in the atmosphere are at the highest point ever in  human history. Just days ago, NBC reported that this will be the  hottest July on record. Last month, June, was the hottest June on  record.   We all know the consequences will be devastating, just devastating to  our planet if we fail to take action soon. It is time for the Senate to  debate serious, significant policies to address climate change. And,  parenthetically, it is another place McConnell's legislative graveyard  unfortunately gains--gains more and more. He will not do anything on  climate change, as important as it is.   Let me thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership on this issue.  Maybe Leader McConnell will read his 250 speeches and have a change of  heart. I doubt it, but who knows? I wish that all of my colleagues on  the other side would listen to him and join Democrats in our efforts to  pass legislation to combat climate change.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, one more point on Puerto Rico.  Last night, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, announced he  will resign on August 2. I am glad that the Governor has listened to  the voices of the people of Puerto Rico. It is clear he lost their  trust, their respect, and certainly the mandate to govern. The most  important thing now is a quick and orderly transition of power so that  our fellow citizens on the island can turn the page on this difficult  chapter and move forward.   No matter what, we have to stand with the people of Puerto Rico. The  island is still a far way off from recovery after the devastation of  recent hurricanes. It is essential that the local Puerto Rican economy  continue to recover and that basic services performed by the government  continue undisturbed as that process continues.   As a new Governor enters office, we pledge to do whatever we can to  ensure the people of Puerto Rico receive the aid and the support they  need. We fought incredibly hard on the disaster bill to make sure the  people of Puerto Rico are not treated worse than any other U.S.  citizens. The events of the past 2 weeks should in no way inhibit that  aid from reaching the island quickly and efficiently. It is so badly  needed. I will be watching and doing everything in my power to  guarantee that is the case.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I  know my colleague from Connecticut has one as well. In deference to the  leader's schedule, I will speak for a few minutes on mine, and then I  will yield to Senator Blumenthal. He will speak for a few minutes on  his, and then we will wait for the leader, who is supposed to come out  in about 5 minutes, to object, if he so chooses. We will make the  request after that.   Now, yesterday, everybody heard Special Counsel Mueller, and there  was a lot of dispute about obstruction of justice and things like that.  There was virtually no dispute about two facts that Mueller said. One,  the Russians interfered in our elections in 2016, and, two, they plan  to do it in 2020.   We rise on the floor because, when Russia or any foreign power seeks  to interfere in our elections, it eats at the wellsprings of our  democracy.   The Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, said that one of the greatest  threats to our democracy was foreign interference. Now we are faced  with the specter of it, and we are asking our Republican colleagues to  join with us in doing everything we can to stop it. This is serious  stuff.   Mr. Mueller said yesterday:         Russian interference wasn't a single attempt. They are       doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it in the next       campaign.    That is Robert Mueller, one of the most authoritative voices on this  issue.   Mueller warned that ``much more needs to be done'' to fortify against  future attacks, not just from Russia but from others looking to  interfere in our elections as well.   Mr. Mueller is not the only one calling for action on election  security. FBI Director Wray, appointed by President Trump, has said the  same. Director of National Intelligence Coats, also appointed by  President Trump, has stressed that foreign actors ``will add new  tactics as they learn from 2016.''   So we must do more. This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican  issue. This is not a liberal issue or a moderate issue or conservative  issue. This is an issue of patriotism, of national security, of  protecting the very integrity of American democracy--something so many  of our forebears died for.   And what do we hear from the Republican side? Nothing. There is no  credence to the claim made by the leader that we have already done  enough in this Chamber. Mueller, Wray, and Coats all said that we need  to do more--all of them.   Here in the Senate, the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Senator  Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, has recommended we do more. They  too say otherwise. Yet Leader McConnell and the Republican majority  refuse to do anything.   So in a moment I am going to ask unanimous consent to pass  legislation that safeguards our election. This legislation passed the  House nearly a month ago. It would provide immediate resources for the  States to modernize their election infrastructure and establish a  consistent funding stream to maintain it.   The States say they need more money. It will require the use of paper  ballots. Almost every expert agrees that that is needed to protect  elections from manipulation, because if they manipulate the machines,  the paper ballots will be a safeguard.   It would require States to conduct postelection risk-limiting audits,  and it would shore up the cyber security of voting systems and ensure  that election technology vendors are held to the highest standards so  the Russians or no one else can hack into these machines and interfere.   These are not revolutionary changes. They are basic commonsense steps  to greatly improve the security of our elections after President Putin  conducted a systemic attack on our democracy and intends to do it  again.   The House has passed this bill already. We could deliver it to the  President today.   Now, the Republican leader has already indicated his intention to  bury this bill in the legislative graveyard. That is a disgrace. That  would be as if we said: We don't need a military. We don't need ships  off our shores or planes in the air.   Attacks on our elections are as great a threat to our national  security as any other, and yet, for reasons inexplicable, the  Republican leader refuses to bring legislation to the floor,  legislation that has been crafted in a bipartisan way.   Many of the bills that are before us have Democratic and Republican  sponsors, and if the rumors are true, the leader urged the Republicans  to back off.   There are only two inferences, neither good. One is that the  Republican side doesn't care about interference in our elections, and  the other is that they want it because maybe they think it will benefit  them.   I know that President Trump doesn't like to talk about this. He  childishly thinks this will cast aspersions on the legitimacy of his  election. That is sort of a very babyish, selfish thing to think when  our security is at risk.    But where are our Republican colleagues when our national security is  threatened? Where are our Republican colleagues? If we invite the  Russians to interfere by not doing enough and they do and Americans  lose faith in the fundamental wellspring of America, our grand  democracy, this is the beginning of the end of democracy in this  country.   As George Washington, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin warned us,  we must do all we can to prevent foreign interference in our elections.  By allowing this UC request to go through, we will be taking a giant  first step. I hope the leader goes along.   And, again, if he says the States don't need it, the States say they  do. They are the judge.   I will be asking my request in a minute, but first let me yield to  Senator Blumenthal, who will also have a UC request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record a letter from 21 attorneys general saying they need more  election assistance to protect against foreign interference.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 State of Minnesota,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                        St. Paul, MN, June 18, 2019.      Hon. Richard Shelby,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.      Hon. Roy Blunt,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Vice Chair, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Amy Klobuchar,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,           Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Committee Members: The undersigned Attorneys       General write to express our significant concern regarding       the persistent threats to our election systems and to urge       Congress to take action to protect the integrity of our       election infrastructure.        Intelligence officials and the Department of Justice       continue to warn that our election systems have been a target       for foreign adversaries and that those same adversaries are       currently working to undermine the upcoming elections. The       Special Counsel's Report concludes that Russia interfered in       our elections in a ``sweeping and systematic fashion.'' New       reports confirm that Russia successfully breached election       systems in Florida and the Department of Homeland Security is       reviewing computers used in North Carolina after the state       experienced irregularities on Election Day. In addition,       documents leaked by the National Security Agency show that       hackers working for Russian military intelligence installed       malware on a voting systems software company used in eight       states, including North Carolina. Russia's military       intelligence service also broadly performed reconnaissance on       state and local election boards, researched--and in some       cases targeted--the election infrastructure of all 50 states,       successfully invaded state election websites to steal       sensitive information from tens of thousands of American       voters, and hacked into a company that supplies voting       software to states across the U.S.        In the wake of these attacks on our democracy, the Congress       and Federal Government have taken some important steps to       address the threats facing our democracy. The Department of       Homeland Security is working with states to improve election       security, and in the 2018 Omnibus, Congress provided $380       million in grant funding to help states secure their election       systems. The Election Assistance Commission, the federal       agency charged with disseminating and auditing the election       security grants, projects that states will spend       approximately $324 million, or 85 percent of the grant funds,       prior to the 2020 elections. This funding was an important       first step in helping to secure our election infrastructure,       however more must be done. Our state and local election       officials are on the front-lines of the fight to protect our       election infrastructure, but they lack the resources       necessary to combat a sophisticated foreign adversary like       Russia. Therefore, we respectfully request that you provide       additional assistance to states seeking to modernize their       elections systems and take the following actions to protect       our elections from future attacks:        Provide additional election security grants to states and       localities. Today, more than at any other time in our       nation's history, election officials face unique challenges       that require access to federal financial support. Additional       funding for voting infrastructure will not only allow states       to upgrade election equipment and voter registration systems       and databases, it will allow them to further fortify their       election systems from  [[Page S5080]]       future cyberattacks. Sustained federal funding is necessary       to pay for continued training, equipment replacements,       software upgrades and implementation of security controls.       This funding is vital if we are to adequately equip our       states with the resources we need to safeguard our democracy.        Support the establishment of cybersecurity and audit       standards for election systems. It is critical that the       federal government work with elections officials and       technical experts to establish guidelines and best practices       for election security. We believe that the U.S. Election       Assistance Commission should update its standards for voting       machines and take a stronger regulatory role in testing       voting equipment before it is sold to states. The federal       government should also keep state elections officials closely       informed about suspected breaches, alerts, and related       intelligence. There should be clear channels of communication       so that local and state officials can share information with       federal authorities.        Pass election-security legislation. Last year, a group of       state attorneys general voiced support for the Secure       Elections Act, bipartisan legislation that would improve       information sharing and strengthen election security. We       reiterate our support for action on election security reform.       The National Association of Secretaries of State and our       state elections officials can be a valuable resource as       Congress considers specific proposals.        The nature of the threat against our election systems       requires the federal government to provide increased       assistance to the states. Securing our election systems is a       matter of national security and we hope that you will take       immediate action to protect our election infrastructure and       restore Americans' trust in our election systems.

Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2722     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rules  Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2722, the  SAFE Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that  the bill be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action of debate.    Mr. President, just for a moment, there are bipartisan  bills on this issue which the Republican majority has objected to. I  suggest to my friend the majority leader, if he doesn't like this bill,  let's put another bill on the floor and debate it. So far, we have done  nothing--absolutely nothing in this Chamber to protect our country and  its election security.   I yield the floor.
