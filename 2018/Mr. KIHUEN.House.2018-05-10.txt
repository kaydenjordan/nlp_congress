 Mr. Chair, today I rise to speak in opposition to H.R.  3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act.   Mr. Chair, I find it offensive. I sit here and listen to all my  colleagues, and they all want to send nuclear waste to the State of  Nevada. They are all generating this nuclear waste, and they want to  send it to my backyard right in the Fourth Congressional District.   Bottom line is this, Mr. Chair: If you generate nuclear waste, you  should keep it in your own backyard. Don't be sending it to our  backyard.   I have met with various people out at Nellis Air Force Base and  Creech Air Force Base and the Hawthorne Army Depot. These are very  important military installations in the Fourth Congressional District  for our entire country. They don't want this nuclear waste passing  through their own backyard.   It is offensive. It is offensive that we have a State that depends on  tourism, that depends on people coming into the State, and we want to  bring all this nuclear waste to my backyard. We want to send it to  Yucca Mountain, a place that hasn't even been deemed safe.   It is disappointing, Mr. Chair, that we have all this nuclear waste  and we can't pick any other place in the country. It has to be  somewhere where we have military bases. It has to be somewhere where it  hasn't been deemed safe, where there is seismic activity. Just a few  weeks ago, there was an earthquake there.   Mr. Chair, I am seriously concerned for Nevadans. I am seriously  concerned for our military bases. I am concerned about our tourists who  are going to be  [[Page H3898]]  coming from all over the country. I am concerned about every single one  of the congressional districts and its constituents where this nuclear  waste is going to be traveling through. These are some serious concerns  that have been brought up that none of us, none of my colleagues have  been able to address.   Mr. Chair, I am here to oppose this project. I am here to speak on  behalf of 80 percent of Nevadans who oppose bringing nuclear waste to  our backyard, and I am here to send a message that we are going to  continue fighting this tooth and nail right here in Congress, in the  Senate, here in the House, and, also, if need be, we are going to  continue fighting this in the legal courts.   Mr. Chair, I am here to speak in opposition and to speak on behalf of  all Nevadans.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of John  Phippen. John attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   John was the father of six and grandfather to one. His life revolved  around his friends, children, and grandkids.   John showed his true character the night of the Route 91 festival  when he died while shielding a stranger with his body from the gunfire.   John was a kind and gentle man who enjoyed the simple things in life.  His favorite thing to do was spend time with his family and friends in  the sand dunes at Lake Havasu or camping at the beach. Everyone who  knew John remembers him for being a wonderful, selfless, and sweet man.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to John Phippen's  family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State  of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
