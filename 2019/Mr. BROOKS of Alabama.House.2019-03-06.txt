 Mr. Speaker, America recently blew through the  $22 trillion debt mark with no end in sight.   In January, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned  Washington that America faces an unending stream of trillion-dollar-a- year deficits beginning in FY 2022 and culminating in a $1.4 trillion  deficit in FY 2028, the amount Congress spends each year on our  discretionary budget that pays for the military, NASA, ATF, FBI, and  almost every other Federal agency.   The cumulative effect of these deficits is a debt that explodes from  $22 trillion today to $33 trillion in a decade.   As debt goes up, so does debt service. The CBO warns: ``In CBO's  projections, outlays for net interest increase from $325 billion in  2018 to $383 billion . . . in 2019, and more than double by 2029, to  $928 billion'' a year, which is the rough equivalent of almost 50 NASA  programs.   Compounding matters, this past weekend, on March 2, the Federal  Government hit the debt ceiling, which means the Federal Government's  operational costs are being paid for via extraordinary measures, such  as borrowing from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.   Washington's response to this financial firestorm is akin to that of  Roman Emperor Nero, who fiddled as Rome burned.   Rather than be proactive and work to prevent a debilitating national  insolvency and bankruptcy, Congress emulates an ostrich that buries its  head in the sand and denies lurking danger.   In sum, America's sea of red ink and projected financial path is  wholly and completely unsustainable.   America must learn from financially reckless nations like Greece and  Venezuela, and from Puerto Rico, an American territory that defaulted  on its $70 billion debt.   Unfortunately, the vast majority of American voters are oblivious to  America's lurking financial dangers, in large part because of minimal  national media coverage.   American voters are too often seduced by debt-junkie politicians who  promise free stuff to get elected, while knowing full well America  can't pay for it. If American voters do not elect financially  responsible officials to Washington, America will succumb to the same  debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that wreaks havoc in Greece and  Puerto Rico, with one major difference; unlike Greece, which has been  bailed out three times by the European community, and unlike Puerto  Rico, which may yet be bailed out by American taxpayers, there is no  one, no one who can or will bail out America.   Instead, America will be more like Venezuela, whose annual inflation  rate now exceeds 2 million percent, where the International Monetary  Fund reports there are: ``Widespread shortages of essential goods,  including food, exacting a tragic toll,'' where grocery stores have  rows and rows of empty shelves and Venezuelans can't find food to feed  their families.   Worse yet, Venezuela's bankruptcy has made it one of the most violent  countries in the world, with a chilling 82 homicides per 100,000  population, roughly 20 times worse than America's homicide rate.  Caracas, Venezuela's capital is the world's most violent city, with a  war-zone-like 120 murders per 100,000 citizens.   Mr. Speaker, America must learn from the financially irresponsible  mistakes of others. As the adage says, We can either learn from  history, or we are doomed to repeat it.   American voters must wake up and stop being seduced by the wily ways  of debt-junkie politicians who promise anything to get elected, who  pretend to be Santa Claus, when, in fact, they are the Grinch that  stole America's future.   Time is running out. The American people must start being good  stewards of our Republic, and elect Washington officials who both  understand the threat posed by defaults, and deficit, and debt, and  have the backbone to fix it. America's future depends on it.                            ____________________
