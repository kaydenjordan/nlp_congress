 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, the American people saw for  themselves the glaring contrast between Democrats, who will fight to  protect women's rights to make decisions about their own bodies, and  MAGA Republicans pushing to send mothers and doctors to jail and  institute nationwide abortion bans.   With Roe on the brink of elimination, this issue will not go away. As  Americans vote later this year, they will choose between radical MAGA  Republicans, who want to get rid of Roe, push national bans on  abortion, and even throw doctors and women in jail, or pro-choice  Democrats, who will protect a woman's right to make her own decisions  when it comes to her body.   Let me say that again.   The contrast facing the American people is now simple: Either elect  more MAGA Republicans, who want to push for sweeping national bans on  abortion, or support pro-choice Democrats, who will protect a woman's  rights to make her own decisions about her body.   Either elect more MAGA Republicans, who want forced pregnancies and  who champion bans without exceptions even for rape or incest, or  support pro-choice Democrats, who will protect a woman's right to make  her own decisions.   Either elect more MAGA Republicans, who want to prosecute and even  imprison women and doctors for carrying out abortions--and mere friends  who give rides to clinics--or support pro-choice Democrats, who will  protect a woman's rights.   Americans are going to see that contrast again and again and again as  Democrats keep highlighting this very important and vital issue.   And as much as Republicans will try to deflect, distort, or distract,  the unbendable truth is that their anti-women views are wildly out of  step with the American people. Just look at what is happening across  the country. Democrats across the country are confidently highlighting  their support for a woman's right to make her own choices; and while  the MAGA Republicans may want to brag about their plans for a  nationwide abortion ban and sending women and doctors to jail, the  clear majority of Americans disagrees with that extremist position.  That is why Republican campaign committees are urging their candidates  to avoid the subject of abortion--because they know their views are out  of step.  [[Page S2466]]    Again, Democrats across the country are now talking about this issue,  even doing campaign ads about this issue. The Republican spinmeisters  are telling their colleagues to avoid the issue. So it is obvious to  everyone who is on what side.   Republicans can run but can't hide from the horror they have created.  Yesterday's vote was only one step, not the end, of our fight to  protect women's rights. This issue will keep coming back up again and  again and again between now and when voters go to the polls later this  year.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am offering this unanimous consent on  behalf of myself and Leader McConnell. Let me explain the unanimous  consent.   As the war in Ukraine extends into its third month, we have a moral  obligation--a moral obligation--to stand with Ukraine in its fight  against Putin's immoral war.   Earlier this week, the House passed a Ukraine package with  overwhelming bipartisan support. It should be no different here in the  Senate. The package is ready to go. The vast majority of Senators on  both sides of the aisle wants it. There is now only one thing holding  us back. The junior Senator from Kentucky is preventing the swift  passage of Ukraine aid because he wants to add, at the last minute, his  own changes directly into the bill. His change is strongly opposed by  many Members from both parties. He is not even asking for an amendment;  he is simply saying: My way or the highway.   When you have a proposal to amend a bill, you can't just come to the  floor and demand it by fiat. You have to convince other Members to back  it first. That is how the Senate works. If every Member held every bill  in exchange for every last little demand, it would mean the total and  permanent paralysis of this Chamber. The junior Senator from Kentucky  knows that perfectly well. He knows that is not how this Chamber works.   Again, when you have a proposal to change a bill, you have to  convince Members to support it. The junior Senator from Kentucky has  not done that.   So right now, in conjunction with Leader McConnell, I am giving  Senator Paul an opportunity to do just that. I am offering to hold a  vote on his amendment, even though I disagree with it. Let the Chamber  speak its will. Let both sides of the aisle have input. And, for  Heaven's sake, let's get Ukraine funding done ASAP.   We must keep our promise to the people of Ukraine, and I hope the  junior Senator from Kentucky does not stand in the way of keeping that  promise. If Senator Paul persists in his reckless demand, we will not  allow him to insert his language into this bill without a vote, and all  he will accomplish is to singlehandedly delay desperately needed  Ukraine aid.   I yield to the Republican leader.    Madam President, on behalf of myself and Leader  McConnell, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  legislative session and proceed to the immediate consideration of  Calendar No. 366, S. 4190, Senator Kennedy's bill on Ukraine oversight;  that the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on  passage of the bill; further, that upon disposition of the Kennedy  bill, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No.  368, H.R. 7691, a bill to provide aid to Ukraine; that the only  amendment in order be the Paul amendment, which is at the desk; that  the Senate vote on the Paul amendment with 60 affirmative votes  required for adoption; that the bill be read a third time and the  Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended; and that  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table,  all without intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object, it is clear from the  junior Senator from Kentucky's remarks, he doesn't want to aid Ukraine.  That is not the case for the overwhelming majority here.   Again, all he will accomplish with his actions here today is to delay  that aid, not to stop it. It is aid that is desperately needed by a  valiant people fighting against authoritarianism and defending  democracy. So I will not modify it.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 368,  H.R. 7691.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 798.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 802.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 799.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.  [[Page S2487]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, May 12, be  waived.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 704, 720, 866, and  867; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in  the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; and that the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I have five requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, May 12, 2022, at 9:30 a.m. to  conduct a hearing              COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION    The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation is authorized  to meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday, May 12, 2022, at  10 a.m., to hold a meeting of the conference committee on H.R. 4521.
