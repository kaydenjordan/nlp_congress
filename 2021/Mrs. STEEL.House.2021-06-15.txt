 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Veterans of the  Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Day. June 19th is ARVN Day, which  honors the service and sacrifice of the South Vietnamese soldiers who  fought to defend a free Vietnam.   Thousands of South Vietnamese soldiers fought alongside our U.S.  Armed Forces in the Vietnam war in defense of freedom and democracy.  They deserve our appreciation and respect for their service.   After the fall of Saigon, many who fought with the South Vietnamese  forces fled Vietnam to escape tyranny. Many found a home here in the  United States. Today, there are over 100,000 veterans from the Republic  of Vietnam living in California.   On ARVN Day, we honor the sacrifice of those who served and remember  those who paid the ultimate price in the pursuit of freedom.                            ____________________
