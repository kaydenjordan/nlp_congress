 Mr. Speaker, the Endangered Species Act was passed to  increase protections for and provide for the recovery of vanishing  wildlife.   Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen countless attacks on the  ESA and science-based decisions, and this bill is no exception. This  bill would hastily remove Endangered Species Act protections for all  gray wolves in the lower 48 States without a rulemaking process or the  opportunity for judicial review.   Although the population of gray wolves has started to recover, it is  now only 5 percent of the number that existed historically. Scientists  are just beginning to understand the role of gray wolves in the larger  ecosystem, and listing and delisting decisions should be based on  science, not politics.   Mr. Speaker, there are so many more important things we need to be  doing today. Today, instead of undermining the Endangered Species Act,  we should be reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund,  passing the Violence Against Women Act, and the list goes on.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
