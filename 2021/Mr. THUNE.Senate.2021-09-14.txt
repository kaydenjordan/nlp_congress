 Mr. President, in just a moment, I want to talk a little  bit about the situation in Afghanistan. But before I do that, I just  wanted to speak to something that the majority leader said earlier  regarding some of the upcoming business that we have to deal with this  fall.   We have a whole series of deadlines in front of us. The fiscal year  ends on September 30, meaning that we have to at some point fund the  government, which presumably would be in the form of a continuing  resolution. We are told that the House of Representatives, when they  move that and send it over here, will include a debt-limit increase.   The debt limit does run out, and we will hit that at some point.  There are varying estimates of when exactly that would be--some say as  early as mid-October; some say perhaps mid-November--but inevitably  that will be upon us. There has been a discussion here about how that  ought to be lifted and who ought to deliver the votes to get that done.   I just want to make the point that the majority leader, as he was  down here making his remarks earlier, indicated that this was all debt  that was accumulated during the previous administration. Certainly  there was some debt because, obviously, during the coronavirus  pandemic, all of us responded in a very bipartisan way. Most of the  debt was at that point in time. It was the votes that we made in March  of 2020 and subsequently to that.   Of course, there was another $2 trillion earlier this year in  February, which no Republican voted for--that was all Democratic  votes--most of which had nothing to do with the virus; most of which  had to do with other elements of their agenda, including expanding the  government.   But, nevertheless, when the debt limit hit its expiration at the end  of July, it reset, and it covered everything up until that point. What  we are talking about now is raising the debt limit to accommodate  trillions and trillions of new spending proposed by the Democrats here  in Washington and by the President and his administration.   It strikes me, at least, that that being the case, if the Democrats  on their own, without a single Republican vote--and there won't be any  Republican votes for the $3\1/2\ trillion bill they are talking about,  which the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says really isn't  $3\1/2\ trillion; it is $5\1/2\ trillion--$5\1/2\ trillion of new  spending, massive expansion of the government, financed some with tax  increases but inevitably some with adding to the debt--that it would  make sense, since the Democrats are going to do that through  reconciliation, which is a purely partisan exercise, with only their  votes, that it could accommodate  [[Page S6467]]  an increase in the debt limit to pay for all of that spending.   I think that is a fair--very fair way to look at this. It strikes me,  at least, that since the Democrats have embarked upon this one-party- rule approach, that if they are going to spend another $3\1/2\ to $5\1/ 2\ trillion, that they ought to raise the debt limit to accommodate all  that additional spending. I think that is a reasonable way to approach  this, and I, frankly, think it is consistent if you look at what has  happened in the past.   The last time we raised the debt limit was in the summer of 2019.  That was a bipartisan deal, and it was a bipartisan deal that actually  put caps on spending. We were limiting spending as we were raising the  debt limit. Republicans and Democrats joined together at the time to do  that.   The spending that I referenced in March of 2020, the $4\1/2\ trillion  or thereabouts that was spent on the response to the pandemic, was also  bipartisan. In fact, it was so bipartisan, it passed in the Senate 96  to 0. Does anybody here ever remember anything around here passing 96  to 0, particularly of that consequence? Clearly--clearly--there was  strong bipartisan support for doing something that needed to be done in  response to the worst pandemic we have seen in this country in a  century.   Those were things that were done in a bipartisan fashion. Now, this  is an entirely different scenario. And I don't think anybody can  dispute the fact that the Democrats, as they embark upon this $3\1/2\  trillion reckless tax-and-spending spree, and, again, other estimates-- the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says it is not $3\1/2\  trillion; it is actually $5\1/2\ trillion when you look at the spend  out in the various budget windows and timelines.   But let's just say for the sake of argument that it is $3\1/2\  trillion to $5\1/2\ trillion. It is still a massive amount of spending,  none of which is related to the coronavirus, all of which is part of a  dramatic expansion of government, which I have referred to before here  on the floor as the ``free everything'' bill--literally cradle to  grave, the government, the Federal Government, will take care of you-- in addition to a lot of other leftwing agenda priorities like green  energy provisions and all sorts of things in this that are Democratic  priorities with no buy-in from Republicans, no attempt to reach out to  Republicans or to do anything in a bipartisan way.   This is a strictly, purely partisan exercise in which the Democrats  are trying to include things that have absolutely no relationship to  spending, debt, or revenues, which is what the reconciliation process  is designed for.   They are talking about doing immigration--immigration--major, major  policy that needs to be done on a bipartisan basis that affects this  country in a profound way, as we can see from the crisis at the border.  Already in the month of July of this year, there was a 420-percent  increase over the previous year in the number of illegal crossings. Two  hundred and twelve thousand people came across the border illegally  just in the month of July. It is a major, consequential crisis. The  Democrats are going to try to do something to legalize people who are  here illegally without addressing the other elements of the immigration  debate on a strictly partisan basis as a part of the reconciliation  bill. This is a purely, purely partisan exercise done without any input  from Republicans.   I don't think there is a single Republican who ought to be pushed  into or feel like they in any way need to support the massive expansion  of government we are talking about here, the trillions and trillions  and trillions of dollars in new spending.   That is what the debt limit is about. It is about raising the amount  of debt, the amount that this country can borrow, to pay for a massive  expansion--massive expansion, reckless expansion--of our government  that moves us more in the direction of a Western European social  democracy rather than the American country that I think we all know and  love.   We have a heritage in this country. It is built around freedom. It is  built around individual responsibility. It is built on the need to  protect our country and maintain a strong national defense. I think  that is one thing I hope that, as we look at spending, we can agree  upon.   But this massive expansion of what they call social or human  infrastructure is nothing more and nothing less than the biggest  expansion of government that we have seen literally in decades, and it  will be financed--some--with tax increases, which I could spend a lot  of time talking about, which will harm the economy, but also with  additional debt.   And that debt, the debt that is acquired for the huge runup in  spending that will be supported purely by Democrats through  reconciliation, a procedure that is a partisan procedure, that ought to  be paid for--that ought to be done by Democrat votes. And it can be  done. There is a way in which the reconciliation procedure can be used  to raise the debt limit to pay for all of the new spending that the  Democrats have in this bill.   So when they get down here and talk about how important it is to be  bipartisan, well, it would be one thing if there was actually any kind  of a bipartisan negotiation going on, but there isn't. And the last  time the debt limit was raised, there was, in 2019, and at that time it  was about caps. It was about reducing spending. There was a bipartisan  agreement to reduce spending as the debt limit was being increased.   The other thing I would mention in response to what the majority  leader said earlier is that the debt that was accumulated in the  previous administration, much of which was done on a bipartisan basis  in response to the biggest pandemic that this country has seen in a  hundred years, in March of 2020--$4.5 trillion of that debt was put on  the bill because of a bipartisan agreement that was reached, as I said  earlier, 96 to 0. Ninety-six to 0 was the vote here in the U.S. Senate.   So Democrats want to go down this path. If they want to spend, spend,  spend like there is no tomorrow and tax, tax, tax like there is no  tomorrow and borrow, borrow, borrow like there is no tomorrow, then  they ought to pay, pay, pay with their votes when it comes to raising  the debt limit and, unfortunately, handing the bill for that to our  kids and grandkids.
