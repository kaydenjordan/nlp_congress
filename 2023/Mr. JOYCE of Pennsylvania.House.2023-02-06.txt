 Madam Speaker, tomorrow evening, President  Biden will deliver his second State of the Union Address and attempt to  defend his failed agenda, an agenda that has led to high inflation,  crumbling supply chains, and, worst of all, an open southern border  that has led to far too many deaths from drugs like fentanyl.   We have seen reckless government spending drive the price of  household goods out of reach for so many families. We have seen  businesses forced to shut down assembly lines because of ridiculous  vaccine mandates that led to critical components rusting in our ports  instead of arriving on time at factories in Pennsylvania. As we stand  in this body today, the number one killer of Americans between the ages  of 18 and 49 is fentanyl poisoning.   We need the President to show that he is willing to work with  Congress to address the crises that his administration has caused. We  need to cut spending. We need to slow inflation. We need to see that  real American families have an administration that is listening to  them. We need to end the public health emergency that has led to a  shortage of healthcare workers. We need to finally see a plan to  address the crisis that we all recognize at our southern border.   Two weeks ago, parents from Franklin County, Pennsylvania, Ray and  Deb Cullen, came before the Energy and Commerce Committee and told the  story of their son Zach, who lost his life to fentanyl poisoning just a  few short months ago.   It is time for President Biden to address this crisis that has killed  thousands of men, women, and children across Pennsylvania and offer us  a concrete solution to secure our border and put a stop to these  needless American deaths.   American families are struggling, and so far, we have seen shockingly  few attempts from the Biden administration to confront kitchen table  issues that face every American.   Pennsylvanians do not need a Green New Deal-focused EPA that  threatens to take away their gas stoves. Families in my district do not  need more government handouts that only raise the price of groceries,  gas, cars, and housing and continue to grow our national debt.   What Americans need tomorrow night here in this Chamber are answers.  We can't afford another year of emptiness. We cannot afford another  year of President Biden's failed policies.                            ____________________
