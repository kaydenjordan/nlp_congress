 Mr. President, the Middle East poses some of the most  difficult diplomatic challenges faced by our Nation. The region is  troubled, unstable, sometimes dangerous. Conflicts span over centuries.  Peace throughout the region seems distant and far away. And the  problematic powers, like Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Russia, promote  their own interests in the area, sometimes violently, and those  interests are often contrary to ours.   The United States is deeply involved throughout the region. Israel is  America's staunchest ally in the Middle East and one of our closest  friends on the world stage. The United States has had and will continue  to have a special relationship with Israel, and our country will  continue to protect and aid Israel to help secure her survival.   I am a strong supporter of Israel. I believe that a qualitative  military edge is necessary for the safety of Israel, and I have always  voted to support military aid. I have also been a strong supporter of  the two-state solution. A peaceful resolution between Israel and the  Palestinian people would help heal the source of many of the  insecurities facing Israel, but peace has eluded Israel and the  Palestinians for decades. Mutual distrust runs deep. Tensions are high  between Israel and many of its neighbors.   For all these reasons, the ambassadorship to Israel is one of the  State Department's most important diplomatic posts and one of the most  sensitive. Since Israel became a nation, the post has been held by 18  of some of our most experienced, skilled, and knowledgeable diplomats.  The vast majority were career Foreign Service officers. Many served in  both Republican and Democratic administrations. All had significant  international and government experience prior to their appointment.   The Ambassador to Israel must be able to thread the needle between  Israel and its neighbors. He or she needs to have the confidence,  respect, and trust of powers throughout the region. He or she must be  seen as an honest broker and have the temperament and finesse to defuse  conflict while able to stand one's ground and have the capacity to find  common interests and common ground.   However, with David Friedman, the President has put forth a nominee  who has no diplomatic experience whatsoever, no government or  international experience, who is known for his offensive statements  toward Jewish groups and others with whom he disagrees, and who has  repeatedly expressed extreme policy views--views antagonistic to any  realistic peace process with the Palestinians. Mr. Friedman is not a  seasoned diplomat; he is the President's bankruptcy lawyer. President  Trump and Mr. Friedman clearly have a lot of experience with  bankruptcy, but it is hard to think of a pair of personalities less  suited to diplomacy in a volatile region.   Mr. Friedman has vocally opposed a two-state solution--a cornerstone  of U.S. foreign policy for peace in the region since President Ronald  Reagan. He not only supports but has generously funded Israeli  settlements--settlements long considered as an obstacle to peace by the  United States and deemed illegal by much of the international  community.   Mr. Friedman's intemperate remarks have been widely reported. He  lashed out that liberal Jews ``suffer a cognitive disconnect in  identifying good and evil.'' He said that the State Department has  ``[a] hundred-year history of anti-Semitism'' and that President Obama  is ``an anti-Semite.'' Most horrific, he said:         J-Street supporters . . . are far worse than kapos--Jews       who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps. . .       . They are just smug advocates of Israel's destruction       delivered from the comfort of their secure American sofas--      it's hard to imagine anyone worse.    Five former U.S. Ambassadors to Israel, serving under both Democratic  and Republican administrations, called Mr. Friedman ``unqualified'' to  assume the role of chief diplomat to Israel.   Twenty-nine Holocaust scholars objected to his ``kapo'' remarks. The  historical record shows, they said, ``that kapos were Jews whom the  Nazis forced, at the pain of death, to serve them in the concentration  and extermination camps. . . . These Jews faced terrible dilemmas, but  ultimately were made into unwilling tools of Nazi brutality. . . . To  brand one's political opponents, members of one's own community, as  kapos, merely for engaging in legitimate debate, is historically  indefensible and is a deeply disturbing example of the abuse of the  Holocaust and its victims for present political gain.''   A group of Holocaust survivors called his use of ``kapo''--and I  quote a group of Holocaust survivors--``slanderous, insulting,  irresponsible, cynical and immensely damaging to our people.''   More than 600 rabbis wrote that his remarks were ``the very  antithesis of the diplomatic behavior Americans expect from their  ambassadors.''   While Mr. Friedman apologized during his confirmation hearing for his  abusive language, I don't believe it erases his past behavior and  suddenly qualifies him for the job.   This post should be earned over time, through actions and words that  demonstrate without question that the nominee has the right judgment,  temperament, and skills. Mr. Friedman has not come close to  demonstrating that. We should not risk confirming him to this important  post. We have seen how distracting and destructive hotheadedness is at  the seat of power.   During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Friedman also walked back his  positions on a two-state solution and Israeli settlements, which  prompted the committee chair to wryly ask him why he even wants the  Ambassador position if he has to ``recant every single strong belief  you've had.''   I am a strong supporter of Israel. I want to see the State of Israel  prosperous and secure forever into the future. I believe in the right  of the Palestinians to self-determination, to chart their own course  and their destiny. I want to see peace between Israel and the  Palestinians and between Israel and her neighbors. That is what the  vast majority of Americans want. The United States has a strong  national interest in securing this peace. The last thing we need is  another active military conflict in the Middle East, which could draw  in U.S. forces. That is why over 40 years U.S. policy has held that the  only realistic path to peace is through a two-state solution. The  Palestinians are entitled to a homeland. A two-state solution is the  only viable path forward for Israel.   As Secretary Kerry said, ``If the choice is one state, Israel can  either be Jewish or democratic. It cannot be both.''   Given Mr. Friedman's past staunch support for a one-state solution  and expansion of Israeli settlements, is he really ready and able to  embrace and put forward opposing policy positions? Can he ever be  viewed by the Palestinians and the international community as an honest  broker?   I am under no illusion about how difficult it will be to achieve  peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Many Presidents and able  diplomats have tried and failed to achieve settlement. But the United  States must continue to do its best to reach an accord. Above all, we  should not make the current situation worse. We need a steady hand in  the Middle East.   I am not convinced that Mr. Friedman is qualified for this job, with  no diplomatic experience and a history of extreme positions and  intemperate language. His contrition is too little, too late. I am  worried that by ignoring these huge red flags with his nomination, we  run the risk of a diplomatic incident that could needlessly increase  risk of conflict in the region. Therefore, I must vote no on this  nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a member of my  staff, Tannis Fox, be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the  115th Congress.
