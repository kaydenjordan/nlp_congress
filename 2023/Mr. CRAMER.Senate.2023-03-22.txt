 Madam President, this is a time of year when  sports seasons wrap up and tournaments and final competitions crown new  champions. I have the privilege today of recognizing one team of  outstanding figure skaters from Bismarck, ND. They are the Capital Ice  Chips, 22 high school girls under the age of 18 who this month skated  their way to the gold medal in the U.S. National Synchronized Skating  championships.   The Ice Chips are not strangers to this national competition, which  was held in Peoria, IL. They have qualified for nationals for the past  13 years and have stood on the winners podium nine times. This year,  they were on the top step for the first time after competing against 12  other teams hailing from much larger metropolitan areas in California,  New York, Illinois, New Jersey, and Arizona.   The 20-year-old Bismarck Figure Skating Club has been dominant in  national competitions because it begins training young skaters as young  as preschoolers. With considerable support from parents and top-notch  teachers and coaches at every stage of learning, these young skaters  also start synchronized skating at an early age. Most of this year's  Capital Ice Chips are veteran skaters who have attended many regional  and national competitions.   I want to commend the coaches, notably Rebecca Gallion, who has been  with the Bismarck Figure Skating Club for all of its 20 years, as well  as Selena Morris and Hayley Trom. Previous skaters have become  instructors and coaches and have been instrumental in helping the Ice  Chips advance to the level of excellence on display at the national  competition this year.   The skaters on the Capital Ice Chips national championship team are  Emily Appert, Elyse Bock, Nora Carlson, Gabriella Deeter, Chloe Dwyer,  Isabelle Ersland, Brooklyn Gallion, Tatum Gietzen, Ella Haar, Miah  Hamar, Kamri Hopfauf, Ashlyn Iverson, Nora Luckenbill, Taryn Nelson,  Addison Rakness, Kadence Rambur, Addisen Renton, Morgan Schatz, Lexi  Stenberg, Reece Theel, Ethnie Zahn, and Kinzie Zahn.   North Dakota's legendary winters bring out a love of winter sports,  including those played on ice rinks across my State. Figure and  synchronized skating require teamwork and discipline in these young  athletes, and I congratulate the Capital Ice Chips for their dedication  and hard work that earned them this championship. I join the rest of  North Dakota in thanking the Bismarck Figure Skating Club and the  Capital Ice Chips for inspiring all of us to achieve excellence. They  have demonstrated what can be achieved by combining faith and passion  with determination and teamwork.                            ____________________
