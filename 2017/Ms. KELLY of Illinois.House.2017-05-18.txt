 Mr. Speaker, I rise yet again to challenge you  to put country before political party. For too long, candidate and now  President Trump has been playing a game of dangerous liaisons with  Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime.   He called on Russian spies--that is right, the KGB--to hack his  opponent. He fired the Acting Attorney General who warned him. He fired  the FBI Director investigating him. And he has shared highly classified  intelligence with Russia, posing a direct threat to our brave assets on  the ground.   When is enough enough?   Mr. Speaker, how much longer before you do your job and bring up the  bipartisan Protecting Our Democracy Act that is cosponsored by 199  Members of this House?   Show us that you have the courage to put country before political  party. Show us that you meant it when you said ``against all enemies,  foreign and domestic.'' Show us that you will do what is right by our  country and stand up to this President.                            ____________________
