(b) Contents.--The study required under subsection (a)       shall include--        (1) the identification of where bottlenecks or chokepoints       are most prominent within the United States supply chain;        (2) the identification of what common shipping data is       created with each hand-off of a container through the United       States supply chain and how such data is stored and shared;        (3) the identification of critical data elements used by       any entity covered by subsection (c), including the key       elements used for various supply chain business processes;        (4) a review of the methodology used to store, access, and       disseminate shipping data across the United States supply       chain and evaluation of the inefficiencies in such       methodology;        (5) an analysis of existing and potential impediments to       the free flow of information among entities covered by       subsection (c), including--        (A) identification of barriers that prevent carriers,       terminals, and shippers from having access to commercial       data; and        (B) any inconsistencies in--        (i) terminology used across data elements connected to the       shipment, arrival, and unloading of a shipping container; and        (ii) the classification systems used across the United       States supply chain, including inconsistencies in the names       of entities covered by subsection (c), geographical names,       and terminology;        (6) the identification of information to be included in an       improved data sharing system designed to plan, execute, and       monitor the optimal loading and unloading of maritime cargo;       and        (7) the identification of existing software and data       sharing platforms available to facilitate propagation of       information to all agents involved in the loading and       unloading of maritime cargo and evaluate the effectiveness of       such software and platforms if implemented.        (c) Collection of Information.--In conducting the study       required under subsection (a), the National Academy of       Sciences shall collect information from--        (1) vessel operating common carriers and non-vessel       operating common carriers;        (2) marine terminal operators;        (3) commercial motor vehicle operators;        (4) railroad carriers;        (5) chassis providers;        (6) ocean transportation intermediaries;        (7) custom brokers;        (8) freight forwarders;        (9) shippers and cargo owners;        (10) the National Shipper Advisory Committee;        (11) relevant government agencies, such as the Federal       Maritime Commission, the Surface Transportation Board, and       the United States Customs and Border Protection;        (12) to the extent practicable, representatives of foreign       countries and maritime jurisdictions outside of the United       States; and        (13) any other entity involved in the transportation of       ocean cargo and the unloading of cargo upon arrival at a       port.        (d) Facilitation of Data Sharing.--In carrying out the       study under subsection (a), the National Academy of Sciences       may solicit information from any relevant agency relating to       the United States supply chain.        (e) Report.--Not later than 18 months after entering into       an arrangement with the Secretary under subsection (a), the       National Academy of Sciences shall submit to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate, and make available on a       publicly accessible website, a report containing--        (1) the study required under subsection (a);        (2) the information collected under subsections (b) and       (c), excluding any personally identifiable information or       sensitive business information; and        (3) any recommendations for--        (A) common data standards to be used in the United States       supply chain; and        (B) policies and protocols that would streamline       information sharing across the United States supply chain.       SEC. 17. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY AUTHORITY.         (a) Public Input on Information Sharing.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Federal Maritime Commission shall       issue a request for information seeking public comment       regarding--        (A) whether congestion of the common carriage of goods has       created an emergency situation of a magnitude such that there       exists a substantial adverse effect on the competitiveness       and reliability of the international ocean transportation       supply system;        (B) whether an emergency order described in subsection (b)       would alleviate such an emergency situation; and        (C) the appropriate scope of such an emergency order, if       applicable.        (2) Consultation.--During the public comment period under       paragraph (1), the Commission may consult, as the Commission       determines to be appropriate, with--        (A) other Federal departments and agencies; and        (B) persons with expertise relating to maritime and freight       operations.        (b) Authority to Issue Emergency Order Requiring       Information Sharing.--On making a unanimous determination       described in subsection (c), the Commission may issue an       emergency order requiring any common carrier or marine       terminal operator to share directly with relevant shippers,       rail carriers, or motor carriers information relating to       cargo throughput and availability, in order to ensure the       efficient transportation, loading, and unloading of cargo to       or from--        (1) any inland destination or point of origin;        (2) any vessel; or        (3) any point on a wharf or terminal.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4996, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr.  DeFazio. Congressman Dusty Johnson and I announced our intention to  pursue this bipartisan legislation, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of  2021, just this past June. In late August, we introduced H.R. 4996 and  have since earned the support of more than 90 bipartisan cosponsors. On  November 17, the Biden administration put out a public statement  endorsing our bipartisan bill.   Now, less than 4 months since we first began to develop this  legislation, I am thrilled--in fact, I am awed, and I am amazed but  very happy--that the House is taking up our comprehensive reform.   The amendment in the nature of a substitute reflects relatively minor  changes and a reorganization of H.R. 4996 as introduced. In other  words, it is not important to the substance of the bill. I am thrilled  with the compromise legislative text reached by the committee's  majority and minority staff and the members.   This is what the voters sent us here to do, to identify problems,  develop practical solutions, and then work together across the aisle to  reach a compromise to achieve a result. That is exactly what the House,  both Democrats and Republicans, are now doing in taking up this  bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 on this date.   I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio); the  gentleman from California (Mr. Carbajal); the ranking member, the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves); and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Gibbs) for working with me and my Republican counterpart, the gentleman  from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) to get this result.   I will very, very briefly go through what the bill attempts to do. We  are all aware that the pandemic highlighted the longstanding issues of  the ocean shipping industry and also the staggering vulnerabilities in  the integral supply chain that drives global commerce.   The Ocean Shipping Reform Act would be the first overhaul of Federal  regulations for the international ocean shipping industry since 1998.  For decades, the United States has run a significant trade imbalance,  due in large part to export-driven, nonmarket economies like mainland  China.   In 2001, the People's Republic of China was granted permanent normal  trade relations with the United States, the so-called most favored  nation status, following that country's admission to the World Trade  Organization. There has since been considerable consolidation among the  foreign-based ocean carriers, coinciding with the continued decline of  the U.S.-flagged international fleet in favor of foreign flags of  convenience.   A handful of foreign-flagged ocean carriers now dominate the global  ocean shipping industry, three of which are from China, another from  Korea, and a fifth from Europe, several of which are effectively  controlled by these foreign governments. Foreign business access to the  American market and our consumers is a privilege; it is not a right.   In 2001, the United States' trade imbalance with the People's  Republic of China was approximately $83 billion in nominal dollars. In  2020, our trade imbalance with mainland China was $310 billion, having  increased year over year most every year.   This legislation would ensure reciprocal trade to help reduce the  United States' longstanding trade imbalance with export-driven  countries like China.   California agricultural exporters and other businesses are willing to  pay to ensure that their products reach markets in Asia, but they can't  pay a fortune to do it. One example, Jelly Belly, the candy company in  my district, last spring would pay $3,000 for a container full of candy  to ship to the Western Pacific. Today it is $31,900. That is the  problem.   The Ocean Shipping Reform Act does make critical reforms requested by  major U.S. importers, like the National Retail Federation's member  companies. There are many, many examples. I will let those go for now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa) who alerted me to this problem early last  summer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington State (Ms. Schrier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Occasionally, we toss words back and forth across the aisle here, and  I would like to toss a word back across the aisle to Mr. Johnson.   He said compliments my way. The actual compliments go his way. It is  not often that we spend time, and we spend a good deal of time working  together on these bills, and we ought to do more across the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure working with Mr. Johnson and his  team, and I thank him. I thank him for stepping forward, as have other  Members on your side and my side of the aisle, stepping forward and  saying, Hey, there is a problem. It is a problem out there. There are  problems of retention and demurrage charges that are, Well, how could  that be.   An importer of plastic Christmas trees and wreaths and other  ornaments from China could not get his containers off of the port. Yet,  he was being charged $4 million, which pretty much puts him out of  business. He is not the biggest company in the world, but he would like  to be. And given the unfair situation that he was facing, he may never  become a major company in the United States. So we need to set up rules  of the road, words that Mr. Johnson laid out so clearly. Rules of the  road; the guardrails. Within these rules, operations, free enterprise,  market competition can take place, but right now, it is a wide-open  system in which there is a gunfight on the street, and that is leading  to companies not being able to get their goods on the ships to export.   And comments that you have already heard from Mr. Costa, California  is a big agricultural export, and so is South Dakota, and so is the  Midwest, and so is the Southeast. All of America wants to export, but  when you cannot get a container, you are not going to export and you  are likely to be out of business, and you are going to incur a very,  very significant charge.   So we set up a system in which these charges and the availability are  regulated in a mechanism that will be conducted by the Federal Maritime  Commission. We can go on and on here, and we probably ought to, but I  won't take my full 10 minutes. I will say, as Mr. Johnson said earlier,  this isn't the silver bullet, this isn't going to solve all the  problems, but when you consider what has already occurred in  legislation here--specifically, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, that piece of legislation will provide $2.5 billion to the ports  so that they can upgrade their facilities, so that they can, the next  time around, be able to avoid the kind of congestion that is plaguing  all of the commerce in this Nation.   We also look to the Build Back Better legislation, which has another  $2.5 billion in it to deal with additional infrastructure that is  necessary to connect the ports to the rest of the transportation system  in this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, we need this bill. We, the American farmer, needs this  bill. We, the American export industry--whether it is heavy, light--and  the import community, all need this bill. So I urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and in that process, we will, I believe, have  a much better market system here in the United States, one that has  guardrails, one that provides an equitable and balanced system for the  importers and the exporters.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take an opportunity here to thank some very  important people. The staff that put this together, on our side of the  aisle, Matt Dwyer, the lead person on the Subcommittee on Coast Guard  and Maritime Transportation; CheriAnn Thompson on that committee;  Cheryl Dickson; and Iain Hart from my own staff.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr.  Johnson) if he would like to thank his staff.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
