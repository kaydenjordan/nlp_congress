 Madam Speaker, I rise today on a solemn  occasion. I have the honor of representing Newport News, Virginia, and  last week, the Newport News community lost Police Officer Katie Thyne,  who was tragically killed in the line of duty.   Officer Thyne was only 24 years old and was the mother of a 2-year- old daughter. The Newport News community has lost someone who dedicated  her life to public service.   In addition to serving with the Newport News Police Department,  Officer Thyne was a Navy veteran, and she also spent time volunteering  as a basketball coach at the local Boys and Girls Club.   Only 11 Newport News police officers have died in the line of duty in  the last 100 years, and the last loss of an officer in the line of duty  occurred over 25 years ago. Officer Thyne was the first woman.   I want to send my deepest condolences to the friends and family of  Officer Thyne, as well as members of the Newport News Police Department  who are dealing with this tragic loss of a colleague.                            ____________________
