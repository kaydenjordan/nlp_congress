 Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm Steven  Engel to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal  Counsel.   The Office of Legal Counsel, which we refer to as the OLC in the  Judiciary Committee, functions as legal advisor to the President and  executive branch agencies, providing advice on complex questions of  constitutional and statutory interpretation. The OLC essentially serves  as the general counsel to the executive branch.   Mr. Engel is well equipped to lead that office, both from the  standpoint of academics and from the standpoint of background. Mr.  Engel received his undergraduate degree from Harvard, his master's of  philosophy from Cambridge University, and his law degree from Yale Law  School.   Following his graduation, Mr. Engel clerked for Judge Kozinski of the  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and for Justice Kennedy on the Supreme  Court. Mr. Engel joined the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis after clerking  for Justice Kennedy. Mr. Engel's practice focused on appellate and  commercial litigation matters.   In 2006, Mr. Engel joined the OLC as counsel to the Assistant  Attorney General at that time and was later promoted to Deputy  Assistant Attorney General. There he provided legal advice to the  Attorney General, to the White House counsel, and other executive  branch clients on a variety of legal matters.   In 2009, Mr. Engel joined the law firm of Dechert as a partner in the  white collar and securities litigation group and later in that same  firm as a member of the complex commercial litigation group.   Mr. Engel's nomination has broad support across the legal community.  The Senate Judiciary Committee received a number of letters in support  of his nomination. One such letter is signed by former Attorneys  General Mukasey and Gonzales, as well as former Deputy Attorneys  General Filip, Morford, and McNulty. Other letters of support were  received from his coclerks on the Supreme Court, a group of Mr. Engel's  former colleagues, Yale Law School classmates, and Harvard Law  Professor Jack Goldsmith. Mr. Engel also received an endorsement from  the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the city of New York, which  is the largest police union in New York City.   Another letter from former senior government officials and legal  officers of the executive branch, including Kenneth Wainstein and  Michael Hayden, noted their ``enthusiastic support'' for Mr. Engel's  nomination. Wainstein and Hayden wrote: ``We are confident that as head  of OLC, Steve will render legal opinions with the highest level of  professional integrity and according to his best understanding of what  the law and the Constitution require.''   Mr. Engel and I met this summer, and we discussed the importance of  congressional oversight and the essential role played by Members of  this body and the House of Representatives. He assured me that he  agreed that each Member, whether or not a chairman of a committee, is a  constitutional officer entitled to the respect and best efforts of the  executive branch to respond to his or her requests for information.  Further, he committed to review the May 1, 2017, OLC opinion on this  very issue and to consider whether a more complete analysis of the  issue is necessary.   You may remember that my interest in this whole thing goes back to  early in this new administration, when people working for the President  and presumably speaking for the President said that the only oversight  letters that would be responded to would be those from chairmen of  committees. Now, you can imagine that leaves out  [[Page S7040]]  at least 30-some Republicans that would never get answers to their  oversight letters, and it would leave out 48 Democrats that would never  get answers to their letters. Consequently, most of Congress would not  be able to do their constitutional role of oversight, making sure that  the executive branch is in enforcing the laws and spending the money  according to what we require. So I raised that issue through a 7-page  letter to the White House, and they came and visited with me about it.   I think they had some misunderstanding of what oversight was all  about. They wrote a letter that said they are going to respond to every  Member of Congress on oversight issues, which satisfies me from the  standpoint of their intent.   As I just said in my remarks here, Mr. Engel committed to review that  May 1, 2017, OLC opinion on this issue and to consider whether a more  complete analysis of the issue is necessary because every Member of  Congress should be able to do oversight, and every Member of Congress  ought to expect an answer to their letters from the executive branch of  the government, whether they are a chairman or not, whether they are a  Republican or not, whether they are a Member of the House or a Member  of the Senate. I want to make sure that we follow through on this,  although I will give this administration credit for almost totally  reversing an opinion that they issued way back in May.   The head of OLC is a highly important role at the Department of  Justice, and it is a role whose importance is felt throughout the  Federal Government. Just to show you how it is felt throughout the  entire government, let me tell you that they issued an opinion in the  previous administration on something to do with the work of inspectors  general throughout the government, previously, or maybe originally,  intended to say what the inspectors general could demand or not demand.  We understand that the law passed in 1979 says that an inspector  general can be entitled to any information he wants from that  department, but they issued an opinion--the OLC person at that time-- along the lines of, well, there are some areas that maybe the head of  the agency has to review, which means that the 1979 law isn't being  carried out in the spirit. That is kind of an example because that  opinion from the Justice Department was used by general counsels  throughout the administration of Obama to keep Congress from doing its  oversight work. That is how important the person who is the head of the  Office of Legal Counsel is in determining what goes on in the executive  branch of government--enough to stifle the oversight work of the  Congress of the United States or the work of the inspectors general of  each department.   So I see Mr. Engel as a person who is going to be a friend of  congressional oversight and, if he isn't, I am going to be very, very  disappointed. He has satisfied me through his testimony before our  committee and through the promises he made in letters to me and in the  privacy of my office that he is going to do that. So we are ending up  with a Mr. Engel who is, as you can see, very well qualified to take on  such a role as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal  Counsel.   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Engel's nomination and confirm  him to this important position.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, allegations of sexual harassment against  a growing number of people have surfaced recently. Some facing the  accusations have issued public apologies, while others have maintained  their innocence. But the allegations continue to mount, and as each new  one surfaces, so grows my concern about whether we're doing enough to  combat this problem.   There are many things on which members of this chamber don't agree,  but one thing on which we can and should agree is this: sexual  harassment has no place in the workforce. And it certainly has no place  in the halls of Congress.   To signal how seriously I take this issue, I last week called on the  Senate Rules Committee to impose a requirement of sexual harassment  training for every employee in this chamber. Today, I'm introducing a  bipartisan resolution to ensure that the Rules Committee has the  authority necessary to ensure that every member of this chamber, every  employee on the Senate payroll, and every unpaid Senate intern receives  anti-harassment training.   This is not an onerous requirement, and it's one that's long overdue.  Training materials on harassment already exist, thanks to the  Congressional Office of Compliance and our Office of the Senate Chief  Counsel for Employment. It's already mandatory for my Judiciary  Committee staff and personal office staff to take anti-harassment  training. The executive branch and some private employers already have  instituted similar training requirements for their employees.   More than two decades ago, I sponsored the Congressional  Accountability  [[Page S7066]]  Act as a sign of our commitment to promoting fairness in the workplace.  This 1995 statute requires Congress to follow the same civil rights,  labor, workplace safety, and health laws to which other employers are  subject. The law also established our Office of Compliance to implement  the law's dispute resolution, education, and enforcement provisions for  Congress. That office not only mediates sexual harassment complaints  but also has developed sexual harassment training for congressional  offices. The Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment also  makes anti-harassment training available to Senators and staff.   The resolution I'm introducing today also calls for the Sergeant at  Arms to develop an anonymous survey on the prevalence of sexual  harassment in the Senate. This survey, which will be conducted every  two years, is to be developed in consultation with the Office of  Compliance and Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment.   I have tremendous respect for my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle. I believe each of you works hard to ensure that your offices are  professional, free of harassment, and places where merit's rewarded.  But I think we have to acknowledge that in our society, despite our  best efforts and intentions, sexual harassment remains a serious  problem. And we must work together to make sure that the Senate remains  free from harassment.   Some may say that policies regarding sexual harassment should be left  to the discretion of each office. But I believe it's important for  every Senate office to have a consistent stance on this particular  issue. Every office should receive the same training so the Senate  maintains a culture in which harassment is not tolerated. This is a  common interest we all share. The voters who sent us here expect the  best. We owe it to the American people to hold ourselves and our  employees to the highest standards of conduct and professionalism.   Mr. President, I want to close by thanking Senators Feinstein,  Klobuchar, Ernst, and Gillibrand for working so closely with me on the  development of this resolution. I urge my colleagues to embrace a  common sense approach to preventing sexual harassment by supporting its  passage.                            ____________________
