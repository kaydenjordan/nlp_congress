 Madam Speaker, I rise today denouncing hate.  Whether hate manifests as Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, transphobia, or  any other form, hate has no place in our communities.   Madam Speaker, that is why I am supporting Mr. Nadler's plan to  combat anti-Semitism by implementing the U.S. National Strategy to  Counter Anti-Semitism and increasing funding for the Nonprofit Security  Grant Program.   It is why I am supporting Mr. Green's two-state solution resolution.   It is why I signed on to Ms. Wasserman Schultz's letter regarding the  safety and security of our college campuses.   Condemning hate is not just about words, it requires action.   The resolution I am introducing will not merely condemn hate, it will  support the implementation of comprehensive policies to prevent and  respond to hate crimes, including education and training on prevention  and response and acknowledgment of the challenges facing vulnerable  groups.   Madam Speaker, together, we can build a future where compassion  prevails.                            ____________________
