 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleagues on another  successful Congressional Baseball Game. Sadly, my Democrats were bested  this year, but I will tell you this: This year was a rebuilding year  for us, and just look at the level of talent we displayed this year.    =========================== NOTE ===========================            On July 17, 2023, page H3627, in the third column, the following  appeared:  Mr.  Speaker, I congratulate my colleagues on another successful  Congressional    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Congressman Deluzio and Congressman Aguilar were stellar on the  mound. Congressman Panetta displayed some Gold-Glove-worthy defense in  the outfield, and freshmen Congressmen Jeff Jackson and  Greg Casar  showed some major speed on the base paths.   Our MVP of the game, Kevin Mullin, had two spectacular catches in  left field and a hit to boot. That deserves a round of applause.   Mr. Speaker, I have long said that the biggest winners in the  Congressional Baseball Game are the charities that we raise money for.  This year, I am proud that we raised over $1.8 million for charities  like the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, the Washington  Literacy Center, and the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund.   That is money that will go to things like Little League programs in  D.C., language classes for adults learning English, and the families of  Capitol Police officers wounded or killed in the line of duty. Those  are just a few of the charities that will benefit from the money that  we have raised and that, Mr. Speaker, makes the game worth it.   Anyone who knows me knows that my heart is in baseball. I love the  game, and I love this event.   I thank the Congressional Sports for Charity Group for another  successful year, the over 20,000 fans who came out to the game to  watch, and my players, both veterans and newbies alike, for leaving it  all on the field.   To Coach Williams and his squad, I congratulate you, but I will say  this: Polish up that trophy because we are coming for you next year.
