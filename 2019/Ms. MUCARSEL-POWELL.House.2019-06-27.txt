 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this  rule.   Right now, there are thousands of children detained in temporary  facilities, facilities like the ones in Homestead, which is right in  the middle of my district. We have no answers. We have no idea of when  these kids are going to be released. It is an overcrowded facility,  with kids who are sleeping in warehouse areas on bunk beds, of more  than 144 kids.   They are living in prison-like conditions. Many have been there for  months. These kids should not be detained without their freedom and  their rights. What we are asking from the Senate are reasonable  requests for the safety and for the well-being of thousands of  children.   We have to pass these provisions put forth by the House. We must put  in writing that no child can be held and detained in a temporary  facility like Homestead for more than 90 days.    Madam Speaker, many of the children have  families living right here in the United States that they could be  reunited with. But those who are running the facilities have no  incentive for reuniting them.   The Senate bill does not have a timeline. The Senate bill is  inadequate. We must pass the House-amended bill.
