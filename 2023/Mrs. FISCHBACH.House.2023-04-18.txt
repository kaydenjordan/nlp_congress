 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday night, Pope County Deputy  Sheriff Josh Owen was tragically shot and killed in the line of duty.  He and two other law enforcement officers were responding to a domestic  violence call in Cyrus, Minnesota, when the suspect opened fire. It was  his 44th birthday.   Deputy Owen spent nearly 12 years with the sheriff's office and  recently received a Distinguished Service Award for his actions  responding to a house fire.   He is pictured here with his K9 partner, Karma.   He was also a military veteran serving with the Minnesota National  Guard and deploying to Iraq for 22 months.   Josh leaves behind a wife, Shannon, and a 10-year-old son, Rylan.   Those of us with ties to law enforcement, who see loved ones risking  their lives every day to protect and serve others, share their pain.   Josh's colleagues placed a squad car on the front lawn of the  sheriff's office on Sunday, and the community has made it into a  memorial to pay their respects to this outstanding member of the  community and show his family how loved he was.    Yesterday, there was a procession to bring his body home. Law  enforcement agencies from across the State turned out to honor their  fallen brother. This is a devastating, heartbreaking reminder that our  men and women of law enforcement put their communities above all else  every single day.   I am praying for Deputy Owen's family and for Pope County and  Minnesota law enforcement communities as they mourn the loss of this  hero and continue to serve and protect us every day.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, while responding to a  domestic violence call, Deputy Sheriff Josh Owen of Pope County was  tragically shot and killed.
