 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6082, the Overdose  Prevention and Patient Safety Act. This legislation would greatly harm  our efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. If we really want to turn  the tide on this crisis, we must find ways to get more people into  treatment for opioid use disorder.   In 2016, there were about 21 million Americans aged 12 or older in  need of substance use disorder treatment, but only 4 million of those  21 million actually received treatment. That means 17 million people  are going without the treatment they need. Failure to get individuals  with opioid use disorder into treatment increases risk of fatal and  nonfatal overdoses as people continue to seek out illicit opioids as  part of their addiction. The increasing presence of fentanyl in our  drug supply only heightens this concern.   Strategies that increase the number of people getting into and  remaining in treatment are particularly important because, as these  treatment statistics show, major challenges exist to getting people  with substance use disorders to enter treatment in the first place. And  this House should not--and I stress ``should not''--take any action  that puts at risk people seeking treatment for any substance use  disorder, but particularly opioid use disorders.   Unfortunately, this bill risks doing just that: reducing the number  of people willing to come forward and remain  [[Page H5328]]  in treatment because they worry about the negative consequences that  seeking treatment can have on their lives. And this is a very real  concern.   This bill weakens privacy protections that must be in place for some  people to feel comfortable about starting treatment for their substance  use disorder. Ensuring strong privacy protections is critical to  maintaining an individual's trust in the healthcare system and a  willingness to obtain needed health services, and these protections are  especially important where very sensitive information is concerned.   The information that may be included in the treatment records of a  substance use disorder patient are particularly sensitive because  disclosure of substance use disorder information can create tangible  vulnerabilities that are not the same as other medical conditions. For  example, you are not incarcerated for having a heart attack; you cannot  legally be fired for having cancer; and you are not denied visitation  to your children due to sleep apnea.   According to SAMHSA, the negative consequences that can result from  the disclosure of an individual's substance use disorder treatment  record can include loss of employment, loss of housing, loss of child  custody, discrimination by medical professionals and insurers, arrest,  prosecution, and incarceration. These are real risks that keep people  from getting treatment in the first place.   While I understand that the rollback of the existing privacy  protections to the HIPAA standard would limit permissible disclosures  without patient consent to healthcare organizations, this ignores the  reality: It may be illegal for information to be disclosed outside  these healthcare organizations, but we know, Mr. Speaker, that  information does get out. Breaches do happen.   Remember the recent large-scale Aetna breach that disclosed some of  its members' HIV status?   But there are also small-scale breaches that don't make the news that  can have devastating consequences for patients trying to recover and  get treatment. For example, a recent ProPublica investigation detailed  instances where a healthcare organization's employee peeked at the  record of a patient 61 times and posted details on Facebook, while  another improperly shared a patient's health information with the  patient's parole officer. Breaches such as this are very concerning and  could occur more often as a result of this legislation.   While I appreciate the sponsor's efforts to alleviate these concerns,  I do not believe the potential harm that could be caused by eliminating  the patient consent requirement under existing law for treatment,  payment, and healthcare operations can be remedied through the measures  included in this bill. The inclusion of these provisions cannot  compensate for the risk of stigma, discrimination, and negative health  and life outcomes for individuals with opioid use disorder that could  result from the weakening of the existing privacy protections, and that  is why every substance use disorder patient group has come out in  opposition to this bill.   According to the Campaign to Protect Patient Privacy Rights, a  coalition of more than 100 organizations: ``Using the weaker HIPAA  privacy rule standard of allowing disclosure of substance use disorder  information without patient consent for treatment, payment, and  healthcare operations will contribute to the existing level of  discrimination and harm to people living with substance use  disorders.''   The Campaign goes on to say: ``This will only result in more people  who need substance use disorder treatment being discouraged and afraid  to seek the healthcare they need during the Nation's worst opioid  crisis.''   This is a risk we simply should not take, and yet the majority is  bringing this bill to the floor today, despite the very real concerns  of these experts. These groups uniquely understand what is at stake  from this legislation because many of their members live with or are in  fear of the negative consequences that result from the disclosure of  substance use disorder diagnosis and treatment information.    In fact, the negative consequences that will result from the  disclosure of someone's substance use disorder would solely affect that  individual and their family. They will bear the burden if we get this  wrong. They could be at risk of potentially losing custody of their  child and their freedom by the increased risk of improper disclosure of  their medical record if this bill becomes law.   These risks may simply just keep them from seeking potentially  lifesaving treatment. That is why substance use disorder treatment  providers have also raised concerns.   The South Carolina Association of Opioid Dependence explained: ``Even  with the growing awareness that substance use disorders are a disease,  the unfortunate truth is that persons with substance use disorder are  still actively discriminated against . . . such as a baby being taken  away from a new mother because she is on methadone for an opioid use  disorder, despite longstanding compliance with her treatment and  abstinence from illegal drug use.''   Another provider, Raise the Bottom Addiction Treatment, one of two  medical-assisted treatment facilities in Idaho, explained that ``our  patients come from every walk of life, including professionals and  executives within our community. Their anonymity and privacy is of  utmost importance because their careers, families, and livelihood often  depend on it.   ``Knowing that people may seek treatment without fear of backlash and  discrimination is often a deciding factor when considering entering  treatment.   ``To undo this protection will deeply affect one's ability and  willingness to seek help. . . . Not only can the members of our  community not afford to lose their right to confidentiality, but we as  a nation cannot afford to move backwards in our fight to combat this  opiate crisis.''                                time  1300    So again, Mr. Speaker, these are the words of experts on the  frontline fighting this epidemic. People who suffer from substance use  disorder should be able to decide with whom to share their treatment  records from programs and for what purposes. Those rights are taken  away from them under this legislation, and I believe that is wrong.   As we face a tragic national drug abuse problem, the scale of which  our country has never seen, I believe maintaining the heightened  privacy protections under existing law remains vital to ensuring all  individuals with substance use disorder can seek treatment for their  substance use disorder with confidence that their right to privacy will  be protected. To do otherwise at this time is just too great a risk,  and I strongly urge my colleagues to listen to the experts on the  subject and to vote ``no'' on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, proponents of this legislation argue that taking away  patients' privacy rights related to substance use disorder treatment  records is okay because we would be applying the HIPAA standard that  applies to other sensitive health conditions like HIV, but I strongly  disagree.  [[Page H5330]]    Individuals with substance use disorder face risk because of their  medical conditions that those with other medical conditions do not.  According to SAMHSA, those negative consequences include loss of  employment, loss of housing, loss of child custody, discrimination by  medical professionals and insurers, arrests, prosecution, and  incarceration.   Unlike other medical conditions, including HIV, you can be  incarcerated, legally fired, and denied visitation with your children  due to your substance use disorder.   So let me paint this picture with a few examples.   A 20-year-old pregnant woman in Wisconsin voluntarily went to a  hospital to seek treatment for addiction to the opiate OxyContin.  Rather than providing treatment, the hospital called State authorities  to report this woman. She was taken into custody and held for several  weeks before a judge ordered her released.   Another example provided to the committee from a provider in Maryland  explained:         Some time ago, we had a young lady in our methadone       maintenance program who committed suicide. She had turned her       life around. She was in college, working full time, owned her       own car, was purchasing a house, and was no longer using       illicit substances. She had to complete probation for her       crimes that she had committed while she was actively using       these drugs.        Her mother did not know she was in methadone treatment. She       did not want her mother to know because her mother did not       agree with methadone, and the judge found out she was in the       methadone maintenance program and disclosed it in a court       hearing with her mother present.        The judge and her mother insisted that she ``get off that       stuff,'' and she complied only because of the pressure from       both to do so.        She began abusing illicit substances and participating in       illegal activity to obtain those substances. The guilt and       shame of returning to what she described as a life of hell       led her to write a suicide note and end her life.                                time  1315    Experiences like this, in addition to stories of individuals with  substance use disorder who have lost jobs, housing, and child custody  because of their substance use disorder, are reasons that some  individuals with substance use disorder fear coming forward to enter  treatment due to the negative consequences that result. It is why more  than 100 groups, including AIDS United, joined the campaign to protect  patient privacy rights. They have joined together to fight to protect  the heightened privacy protections that exist under existing law.   Further, unlike the proponents of this legislation contend, the  existing law is not an anomaly. States like Florida have laws requiring  written patient consent for the sharing of a patient's substance use  disorder and mental health treatment records, while others like New  York, Kentucky, and Texas have such requirements for the sharing of HIV  records. Other States have such requirements for reproductive health  treatment records.   Further, the existing law is consistent with the confidentiality  protections applied to substance use disorder treatment records. In  fact, the law governing the confidentiality of VA medical records, 38  U.S.C. 7332, is consistent with and broader than part 2. Unlike that  law, the VA cannot share a patient's substance use disorder, HIV, or  sickle cell anemia treatment records with another provider without  written patient consent.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to stress that I do believe that we can learn  an important lesson from our response to HIV, particularly during the  height of the AIDS epidemic. A critical part of this Nation's response  to the AIDS epidemic was increasing the privacy protections applied to  HIV medical records. Such action was taken because people were afraid  to enter treatment for HIV/AIDS because of the negative consequences  that could result.   In the midst of the opioid epidemic, this bill would result in doing  just the opposite: lowering the privacy protections applied to  substance use disorder medical records despite the fact that, like  during the AIDS epidemic, some individuals with substance use disorder  remain afraid to enter treatment because of the negative consequences  that result. And in many cases, they only do so out of the part 2  assurances that they can control to whom and for what purposes their  treatment record is shared.   The increased stigma, discrimination, and criminalization faced by  people with substance use disorder support the maintenance of the  heightened privacy protections under existing law, in my opinion. And  for some individuals, it is these privacy protections that make them  feel safe to enter and remain in treatment for their substance use  disorder. I am afraid that by passing this bill we could be creating a  barrier that will keep people from getting the treatment they need, and  that is a risk I am simply not willing to take.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5331]]    Mr. Speaker, some of the proponents of this bill also mentioned the  opiate use disorder situations in emergency rooms as a justification  for the legislation, but I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, I think it is  important to note that the existing law includes an exception to the  patient consent requirement. A provider can access a patient's  substance use disorder treatment records in the case of an emergency as  determined by the provider without patient consent.   Additionally, nothing in the existing law prevents any provider from  asking their patient about their substance use disorder history before  prescribing any opioid, especially in the midst of the opioid epidemic.  Every provider should ask patients about their opioid use disorder  history, and, therefore, under the existing law and every other privacy  law, the doctor can learn of a patient's opiate use disorder history by  simply asking the patient that.   That remains, in my opinion, the optimum way of learning a patient's  medical history, because currently our electronic health records aren't  interoperable in many cases. Those underlying interoperability issues  that prevent information sharing, including the part 2 information in  cases where a patient has agreed to share their information with  providers, aren't going to be solved by this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned earlier the various groups that are opposed  to this legislation because of the privacy concerns, and I actually  would like to read or go through some sections from this letter that  was sent to Chairman Walden and me from over 100 groups, including the  New Jersey Association of Mental Health and Addiction Agencies.   And they say, Mr. Speaker:         Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone:        We, the undersigned national, State, and local       organizations strongly support maintaining the core       protections of the Federal substance use disorder patient       confidentiality law and its regulations, referred to       collectively as part 2.    And they say:         We remain concerned that using a weaker HIPAA privacy rule       standard of allowing disclosure of substance use disorder       information without patient consent or other purposes will       contribute to the existing level of discrimination and harm       to people living with substance use disorders. This will only       result in more people who need substance use disorder       treatment being discouraged and afraid to seek the healthcare       they need during the Nation's worst opioid crisis.        We strongly support maintaining part 2's current core       protections for substance use disorder information instead of       those weaker HIPAA privacy standards for the following       reasons.    And there are five.         One, the heightened privacy protections in part 2 are as       critical today as they were when they were enacted more than       40 years ago and must be preserved.        Two, in the midst of the worst opioid epidemic in our       Nation's history, we must do everything possible to increase,       not decrease, the number of people who seek treatment.                                time  1330         Three, substance use disorder is unique among medical       conditions because of its criminal and civil consequences and       the rampant discrimination people face.        Four, with so much at stake, patients in substance use       disorder treatment should retain the right to consent when       and to whom their records are disclosed, as currently found       in part 2.        Five, effective integration of substance use disorder       treatment with the rest of the healthcare system is       critically important, and information exchange in accordance       with confidentiality law and current technology is now       possible. To facilitate that process, SAMHSA recently amended       the part 2 regulations to further promote the integration of       confidential substance use disorder information into general       health records.    They finally conclude, Mr. Speaker, by saying:         We respectfully request that the House Energy and Commerce       Committee maintain the current confidentiality protections of       part 2 to support individuals entering and staying in       substance use disorder treatment and recovery services.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from these patients.                                         Campaign To Protect Patient                                                  Privacy Rights,                                                      June 18, 2018.      Re Opposition to H.R. 6082--``Overdose Prevention and Patient           Safety Act''.       Representative Greg Walden,      Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and           Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.      Representative Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy           and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: We, the       undersigned national, state, and local organizations strongly       support maintaining the core protections of the federal       substance use disorder patient confidentiality law (``42       U.S.C. 290dd-2'') and its regulations ``42 CFR Part 2,''       (referred to  [[Page H5332]]       collectively as ``Part 2'') to effectively protect the       confidentiality of patients' records. The Substance Abuse and       Mental Health Service Administration (``SAMHSA'') recently       amended Part 2's patient privacy regulations in 2017 and       2018, which accomplishes the bill's proposed objective of       providing coordinated care between substance use disorder       (``SUD'') and other health care information.        We remain concerned that using a weaker HIPAA Privacy Rule       standard of allowing disclosures of SUD information without       patient consent for treatment, payment, health care       operations, or other purposes other than those currently       allowed by Part 2--will contribute to the existing level of       discrimination and harm to people living with substance use       disorders. This will only result in more people who need       substance use disorder treatment, being discouraged and       afraid to seek the health care they need during the nation's       worst opioid crisis.        We strongly support maintaining Part 2's current core       protections for SUD information, instead of those of a weaker       HIPAA Privacy standard as described in H.R. 6082 for the       following reasons:        1. The heightened privacy protections in Part 2 are as       critical today as they were when they were they were enacted       more than 40 years ago, and must be preserved.        2. In the midst of the worst opioid epidemic in our       nation's history, we must do everything possible to       increase--not decrease--the number of people who seek       treatment.        3. SUD is unique among medical conditions because of its       criminal and civil consequences and the rampant       discrimination people face.        4. With so much at stake, patients in SUD treatment should       retain the right to consent when and to whom their records       are disclosed, as currently found in Part 2.        5. Effective integration of SUD treatment with the rest of       the health care system is critically important, and       information exchange in accordance with confidentiality law       and current technology is now possible. To facilitate that       process, SAMHSA recently amended the Part 2 regulations to       further promote the integration of confidential SUD       information into general health records.        We respectfully request that the House Energy and Commerce       Committee maintain the current confidentiality protections of       Part 2 to support individuals entering and staying in SUD       treatment and recovery services.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say in conclusion today, that amidst the  worst opioid epidemic our country has ever faced, I think it is really  important that we not take any action that could result in any  individual with an opiate use disorder not seeking or remaining in  treatment for this life-threatening condition.   I understand the opinions on both sides, but I do think that if we  don't protect the existing privacy and keep the current law with regard  to privacy that we will see many individuals not seeking treatment or  remaining in treatment. That is why I strongly oppose this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am opposed to H.R. 6082.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would maintain the privacy rights  provided to individuals with substance use disorder. Those patients  would retain their right to determine with whom and for what purpose to  share their substance use disorder treatment records from part 2  programs.   Rather than strip away patients' privacy rights, my amendment would  incorporate section 509 from the bipartisan Alexander-Murray bill, S.  2680, the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, that was reported out of  the Senate HELP Committee on a bipartisan basis, and that was  incorporated in the underlying legislation.   That provision requires the Secretary to support the development and  dissemination of model training programs for substance use disorder  treatment records under part 2. It would help ensure that more  patients, families, and providers understand how information can be  protected and shared under part 2.   My amendment would also help us to better understand the privacy  needs of individuals with substance use disorder as well as how to  balance those needs with the information needs of our health system to  provide the highest quality care.   Specifically, my amendment would require the Secretary to conduct or  support a study to better understand the patient experience with part 2  through the examination of information-sharing behaviors of individuals  who obtain substance use disorder treatment at part 2 programs.   This study will provide critical insight into the central question  under debate today: What is the appropriate level of privacy  protections that should be applied to substance use disorder treatment  records?   While there are a lot of opinions and persuasive evidence to support  both sides of this debate, there is a lack of research on this issue  generally or as it specifically relates to part 2. Such information  will help us better understand the level of control individuals with  substance use disorders need over their medical records to ensure their  privacy concerns are not a barrier for such individuals accessing  potentially lifesaving treatment.   It would also help us better understand what is the appropriate  balance between the needs of these individuals regarding the privacy of  their substance use disorder treatment information with the needs of a  coordinated healthcare system to best serve its patients.   We know that today, under current law, some patients who receive  substance use disorder treatment from part 2 programs choose not to  share their treatment records with any provider outside of their  substance use disorder treatment provider. On the other hand, there are  others who choose to share with only a few of their nonsubstance use  disorder treatment providers.   So I just believe it is critical we understand the reasons why such  individuals have made these decisions as well as how the right to make  such a decision affected their willingness to seek or remain in  treatment.   This amendment is consistent with the recent recommendations from the  Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. As part of their June  2018 report to Congress, the commission stated that at this time the  commission does not recommend alignment of part 2 and HIPAA. Instead,  the commission recommends additional subregulatory guidance, education,  and training on part 2.   As I have made clear, Mr. Speaker, I have concerns that the  underlying bill would hurt our efforts to respond to the opioid  epidemic and could increase the odds that fewer individuals with opiate  use disorder enter and remain in treatment, a risk I believe too great  to take during the worst drug abuse epidemic our country has ever  faced.   However, I realize there is another side of this argument as advanced  by the proponents of this bill, and we should not be concerned that  this bill will affect the uptick of treatment, and, in fact, we should  believe that this will only improve treatment.   Rather than undertake the 50-State experiment to see which side is  right, we should support the thorough study of this issue before taking  any action to weaken the privacy protections provided by part 2. In  that way, we can determine the actual effect on taking away from  individuals with substance use disorder the ability to decide how their  treatment information is shared. That way we would have no doubt on  both the intended and unintended consequences of eliminating the  patient consent requirement for treatment, payment, and healthcare  operation purposes as proposed by the underlying bill.   I think the stakes are too high to get this wrong. I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment to increase the awareness of  patients, families, and providers about how their treatment records are  protected and can be shared under part 2 as well as to increase our  understanding of the privacy needs of individuals with substance use  disorders.   I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I stand in opposition to H.R. 5797, the IMD CARE Act.   I think we all agree that we need all the tools available to us to  address the opioid crisis. Inpatient treatment centers that focus on  the treatment of behavioral health needs of patients with substance use  disorder are part of that. Congress must do what we can to ease access  to care.   But I believe this legislation, as drafted, is misguided. It is also  counterproductive and an ineffective use of scarce Medicaid dollars.  But more importantly, it may undermine the ongoing efforts to improve  the full continuum of care for people with substance use disorders.   This policy spends more than $1 billion in Medicaid to pay for a  policy that is far narrower in both scope and flexibility than what  many of our States already have and any State could do through Medicaid  substance use disorder waivers.   In addition, as countless data has indicated, there are many gaps in  treatment for Medicaid beneficiaries with substance use disorder. Yet  this bill does nothing to incentivize States to provide the full  continuum of care.   Community-based services are necessary for both people not treated in  residential inpatient facilities and also for people who leave  residential inpatient treatment and need community-based services to  continue their treatment and recovery.   We already face a shortage of community-based care for substance use  disorder and should be working with States to increase this capacity.  Yet this bill doesn't tie Federal funds for IMD care to improvements in  community-based services. Without that connection, States simply will  not pursue these needed improvements.   Without incentives to improve access to treatment more broadly,  repealing the IMD exclusion to only a narrow population--in this case,  opioid use--through legislation may simply encourage greater use of  expensive inpatient treatment, including for people for whom it may not  be the best option.   We can't push a system where people cycle in and out of institutions.  People with substance use disorders need a range of supports to stay  well and sober long term, not just a limited stay in an IMD.   Existing guidance from both the Obama and Trump administrations  allows States to waive the IMD exclusions if the States also take steps  to ensure that people with substance use disorder have access to other  care they need, including preventive, treatment and recovery services.   So far, there are 22 States, Mr. Chair, that have waivers approved or  pending before the administration. I think these waivers are important  to support.   My home State of New Jersey has approval for a waiver right now.  Under that waiver, they expanded access to all substance use disorder  services in their Medicaid program. We should build on that policy,  which emphasizes the full continuum of care, with any bills that repeal  the IMD exclusion.   In addition, I have concerns about creating a system in States  whereby only some of our Medicaid beneficiaries with substance use  disorder have access to the full continuum of care they need.   This bill specifically limits residential treatment to adults with  opioid use disorders, with the possible addition of an amendment for  cocaine use disorders. But it doesn't help the overwhelming majority of  individuals with other substance use disorders, such as alcohol, which  is far more commonly abused.   Treatment for substance use disorder, especially in the midst of our  opioid crisis, must include a comprehensive approach that addresses the  entirety of a patient's medical and psychological conditions. This  legislation creates a perverse incentive toward individuals reporting  opioid abuse or going out and getting addicted to opioids, for  instance, in the hopes of gaining access to the treatment they need.   Expanding access to inpatient residential treatment in a vacuum I  think would undermine State efforts to ensure the availability of  substance use disorder treatment that meets the needs of all patients  in the most appropriate environment.   In the short time this legislation has been publicly available,  countless stakeholders have weighed in vehemently on particulars of  this bill, echoing my concerns today. In fact, coalitions with more  than 300 groups as well as other mental health, substance use, and  disability groups have sent letters in opposition. I think we need to  work with stakeholders. This issue is too important to get wrong.   For these reasons, Mr. Chair, I oppose H.R. 5797. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to speak briefly on a point that I think is being  lost here.   This bill presumes that expanding access to residential treatment is  the answer, and it is not necessarily. Without any requirement that  States address gaps in Medicaid community-based services, I think there  is a possibility that we risk more harm than good.   The former director of national drug control policy has reminded us  that most of these IMD facilities provide detoxification services. But  detoxification is only the first stage of addiction treatment. Indeed,  it may increase the potential for overdose if patients do not remain or  have any support when released, since, with detoxification, their  tolerance for opioids is significantly reduced.   The proposal before the House will likely create an overreliance on  institutional treatment and may exacerbate  [[Page H5337]]  the dearth of community-based health services.                                time  1400    People with substance use disorder often find themselves unable to  access intensive community-based behavioral health services when they  need it. Likewise, many cannot access services in the community when  they are discharged following a crisis.   Incentivizing inpatient care may actually increase opioid overdose,  the very harm that Congress is seeking to prevent. Experts have raised  serious concerns with this bill's institutional focus because recent  data suggests that inpatient detoxification is an important predictor  of overdose, largely because many who receive inpatient care aren't  then connected to community-based treatment programs or put on  medication, leaving them extremely vulnerable.   Again, I am concerned that we may be contributing to this crisis with  this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, in closing and in urging opposition to this bill from my  colleagues, the reason the IMD exclusion was put in place in the  beginning was because of the fear that people who had overdosed, who  had opiate problems, would be put into institutions, if you will, and  then throw away the key. In other words, they put them in there, maybe  they get detoxed, and then they come out. But without any treatment or  any followup, community-based treatment, they would just go back to the  same thing again; they would overdose again and end up back in the  facility.   So the fear was that we would have these large facilities where they  go in and, without any kind of continuum of care, the cycle just keeps  repeating itself. I just want my colleagues to be mindful of that.   What happened was, during the Obama administration, States had asked  for waivers from the IMD exclusion, and the Obama administration  decided they would do that if they provided a continuum of care and  community-based services so that the problem that led to the IMD  exclusion would not repeat itself.   I guess my fear is, today, that this seems like such a simple  solution: Okay. We will get rid of the 16-bed exclusion because we need  people to go into these institutions.   However, since we are not providing any continuum of care or  community care in eliminating this exclusion, it goes back to the same  problem, which is we don't want people to just be warehoused to detox,  come out again, overdose again, and go back in without any kind of  community services.    That is why I am making the argument that the actual waivers that  exist now, which I think almost half of the States have, is a much  better alternative than just lifting and getting rid of the exclusion.  That is why I believe that this bill is misplaced and why I would urge  my colleagues to oppose it, because I think it may actually go back to  the days where we were just warehousing people and we are not actually  giving them the kind of treatment that they need.   Mr. Chair, I would urge my colleagues to vote against the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I support Mr. Rush's amendment, but I remain in strong  opposition to the underlying bill. I support my colleague's, Mr.  Rush's, work to add cocaine use disorder.   As Mr. Rush noted in our committee, cocaine use claims more African  American lives than opioid use and has been a larger problem than  opioid use disorder for more than 20 years, yet incarceration, not  treatment, is far too often the response.   Unfortunately, adding a single additional drug does not make this  legislation whole. Nearly half of all States already reimburse for IMDs  for all individuals with substance use disorder. We can and should  build on that policy and strengthen the full continuum of care with any  IMD policy this body passes.   There is no good reason, policy or otherwise, for us to leave the  overwhelming majority of Medicaid beneficiaries out in the cold because  they have the misfortunate to be addicted to, for instance, alcohol or  meth instead of cocaine or opioids.   So, again, I support the amendment, but I remain in strong opposition  to the underlying bill.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I support my colleague's, Representative Kildee's,  amendment to this legislation. It is certainly important to require  States to report information on individuals with co-occurring disorders  and what disorders are suffered, and it is equally important to have  information on access to community care for individuals suffering from  a behavioral health issue other than a substance use disorder.   Mr. Chairman, I want to stress that this information is important,  but the underlying problem with the IMD CARE Act continues. I believe  this bill is, at best, an ineffective use of scarce Medicaid dollars.  More importantly, it may undermine ongoing efforts to improve the full  continuum of care for people with substance use disorders.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
