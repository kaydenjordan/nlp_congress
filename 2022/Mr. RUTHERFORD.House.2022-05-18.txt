 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so that we can  immediately consider H.R. 7809, the Communities Deserve Cops Act. My  bill will make retention and hiring bonuses allowable for COPS grants.   Madam Speaker, I spent over 40 years in law enforcement, including 12  as sheriff, and I know firsthand the challenges that agencies all  across America are facing in hiring, training and retaining their  personnel. However, the challenges I faced as sheriff pale in  comparison to what these agencies face today.   Police departments across America are in the middle of a hiring  crisis. After years of far-left politicians defunding, demoralizing,  and delegitimizing police officers, we are seeing now the disastrous  results. A recent survey, as was mentioned earlier, found some cities  are facing shortages as high as 17 percent. Just last year, retirements  nationwide went up 45 percent.   And guess what? Violent crime also increased in every major city  across the Northeast almost. Less officers equals more crime, plain and  simple.   Madam Speaker, this pattern of retirements and difficulty recruiting  new officers is unsustainable and will have disastrous effects.   My legislation makes a very small but necessary change to how COPS  grants are utilized. In addition to using COPS funding to hire, train,  and equip officers, agencies will be able to use Federal dollars to  offer financial bonuses up to $5,000 to keep officers on the force and  to attract and hire new officers.   I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim to  support law enforcement. So I ask you: Join with us in this important  moment. Join with us in voting ``yes'' today that you will fund and not  defund the police.   As we wrap up National Police Week, let's show the police officers  across America that we have their back.
