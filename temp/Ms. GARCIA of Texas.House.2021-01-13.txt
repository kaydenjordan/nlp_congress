 Madam Speaker, this President took an oath to  protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has chosen to betray  and attack our sacred democracy.   This President violated his oath. He abused the power of his office,  attempted to betray the will of the American people, and incited  insurrection against this very House.   During the last impeachment trial, I reminded all Americans that  democracy is a gift that each generation gives to the next. We must do  all to protect it for our children and our future.
