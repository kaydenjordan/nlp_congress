 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I will share a conversation that I had with Anna Kate,  who is a constituent of mine in my district. She called my office  absolutely distraught; this was late in the day of the shooting. She  said that parents have really reached their breaking point right now  and that she is afraid, and she is afraid for her 7-year-old son.   She said, I want to tell my child, you will be safe in school.   What a simple sentence that most parents--any parent--would want to  say. ``You will be safe in school.''   But I can't, she said.   Children continue to die, and this is on all of us, all of our  conscience. There is no issue more important than this.   We can do something starting today, something real. We can finally  pass this legislation. Let's do it.
