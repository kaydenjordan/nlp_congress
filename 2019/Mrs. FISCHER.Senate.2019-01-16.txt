 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the thousands  of people who will travel to our Nation's Capital this week to join us  in the March for Life. Marching proudly among them will be many, many  Nebraskans--families, neighbors, student organizations, and church  groups. They are going to brave the snow and freezing temperatures to  march along the National Mall as part of a peaceful rally that draws  attention to pro-life and pro-women policies.   Since I first started my career in public service, I have supported  commonsense pro-life measures that protect women and unborn children.  All too often, women are faced with unplanned pregnancies, and they  experience condemnation instead of compassion. These women shoulder  despair, pain, and judgment when they should receive comfort,  assistance, and reassurance. These mothers should always know that they  have support as they face challenging years ahead.   In the Senate, I am proud to pledge my support for several pro-life  bills.  [[Page S253]]  This afternoon, I would like to highlight a few of them.   Once again, I am cosponsoring the Pain-Capable Unborn Child  Protection Act. This legislation would prohibit abortions after 20  weeks unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother or the  pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. Twenty weeks, as advances in  science and medical technology tell us, is the point at which an unborn  child is capable of feeling pain.   When I served in the Nebraska Legislature, we passed the first ban on  abortions after 20 weeks. Republicans and Democrats, pro-choice and  pro-life Senators, voted in its favor because it is sound policy. We  should enact this commonsense legislation at the Federal level as well.   I am also a cosponsor of the Protect Funding for Women's Health Care  Act. This bill would prevent the Federal funding of Planned Parenthood  or any of its affiliates. In 2016, Planned Parenthood received nearly  $544 million from the Federal Government. I believe that Congress must  redirect this funding to where it belongs, and that is to our community  health centers.   In Nebraska we have seven community health centers, with 44 clinic  sites all across our State. I have had the opportunity to visit these  sites, and I have seen firsthand the high-quality, compassionate care  they provide to women in need. Our patients in Nebraska would be better  served if this Federal funding were directed toward these centers and  also these clinics, which serve all Nebraskans--all Nebraskans  everywhere in our State--not Planned Parenthood.   The Protect Funding for Women's Health Care Act is another  commonsense solution that will protect life and help provide  comprehensive healthcare for women. Finally, I will once again support  the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full  Disclosure Act, introduced by the senior Senator from Mississippi.  Since the 1970s, the Hyde amendment has prohibited Federal funds for  abortions, but it requires a yearly passage through Congress. This  measure would permanently establish in statute the protections of the  Hyde amendment. These are a few of the important pro-life policies that  I am working on in the Senate.   Again, I want to welcome all of the Nebraskans who are traveling over  1,000 miles to take part in the March for Life. It is great to see the  pro-life movement building such momentum. More and more young people  are joining the cause and standing tall for this timeless value, and I  want to thank each and every one of them for their courage and for  taking a stand for what they believe in and for what science tells us.   They march not with anger or condemnation, but with love and hope.  They will be living out the direction of Mother Teresa, when at the  1994 National Prayer Breakfast she said:         A sign of care for the weakest of the weak--the unborn       child--must go out to the world. . . . then really you will       be true to what the founders of this country stood for.    So to all of the Nebraskans and to all Americans who will gather here  in Washington for the March for Life, please know that I support your  every step.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise to discuss the state of our  national defense. First, I want to recognize the brave Americans who  were killed in a suicide attack in Syria today. Our deepest sympathies  are with the families of those killed and the injured. We are so  grateful to these Americans for their service and for their sacrifice.   As I enter my seventh year on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I  can't help but reflect on our past successes. I am proud of what we  have accomplished by working together to fulfill the first  responsibility of our Federal Government to provide for the common  defense. Together, we have continued the committee's longstanding  bipartisan tradition of working to strengthen our military, and we have  been effective on a variety of fronts.   We have provided our brave men and women in uniform with the  resources they need to carry out the missions we give them every year  through the National Defense Authorization Act.   Importantly, for the last 2 years, Congress and the administration  have worked together to rebuild the Department of Defense and reorient  it to today's threats. As the administration's National Defense  Strategy correctly identifies, the primary challenge to U.S. interests  today comes not from terrorist groups but from Russia and China.   In recognition of this fact, Congress increased funding to restore  readiness and expand force structure from near-historic lows. While  progress has been made, significant challenges remain.   The bipartisan support for increased defense spending must continue,  and Congress must ensure our service men and women have the necessary  training and equipment for the great power competition that defines the  current geopolitical landscape. As part of this effort to ensure our  military is prepared for the new threat environment, we must continue  modernizing our nuclear forces.   Once again, this Congress I will chair the Armed Services Committee's  Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, and this issue will be my top  priority. Since the end of World War II, our nuclear deterrent has  formed the bedrock of our Nation's security. With Russia and China  increasingly seeking to challenge U.S. interests and to reshape the  geopolitical landscape in their favor, the unique role our nuclear  forces play in deterring conflict and preventing war is becoming  increasingly important.   Meanwhile, our warheads and delivery systems age toward obsolescence,  as does the infrastructure that maintains our deterrent. Many of these  systems have aged far beyond their designed lifetimes. They cannot be  sustained indefinitely. Put simply, as our nuclear deterrent becomes  more important to our Nation's defense, the need for nuclear  modernization only grows.   This conclusion is echoed in the administration's National Defense  Strategy, its Nuclear Posture Review, and the bipartisan National  Defense Strategy Commission, which described nuclear modernization as a  ``critical imperative.''   The previous administration, under President Obama, also recognized  the need for modernization and began an effort to recapitalize our  nuclear forces. Right now, major programs are underway to replace our  legacy systems. This includes the B-21 bomber, which will replace the  B-52 and B-2 bombers, and the long-range standoff weapon, which will  replace the existing nuclear-armed, air-launched cruise missile. The  ground-based strategic deterrent is replacing the Minuteman III  intercontinental ballistic missile. Finally, the Columbia-class  submarine will replace the Ohio-class submarines that are currently in  service.   The command and control networks on which our nuclear forces rely are  also in need of replacement, as is the scientific infrastructure that  maintains our stockpile of aging warheads.   In some cases, such as with the production of plutonium pits-- essentially the cores of our nuclear weapons--we must reconstitute lost  capabilities. Adding to the challenge, as a result of decisions to  delay and defer funding, there is no margin for error in the schedule.   This is the position we find ourselves in. Our existing platforms are  simultaneously aging out just as their replacements are scheduled to be  ready. Something General Selva, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, refers to as just-in-time modernization. That means any  delay, any error, could put at risk our ability to field an effective  nuclear deterrent in the future. We cannot allow that to happen. In the  face of growing threats, our deterrent must remain strong.   As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I understand I  carry the solemn responsibility to make sure the nuclear forces that  have deterred conflict, safeguarded our livelihoods, and preserved our  Nation's power for decades continues to protect the next generation of  Americans. While U.S. Strategic Command is located in Sarpy County, NE,  it is a national asset with a global mission--over 180,000 soldiers,  sailors, airmen, marines, and civilians are working every day around  the world in support of the command's mission.   During this Congress, I am looking forward to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this key priority and  continuing our work in providing for a strong national defense.   Thank you.  [[Page S261]]    I yield the floor.
