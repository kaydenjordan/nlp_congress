 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would  like to address Senator Durbin's comments and his unanimous consent  request through the Chair.   First, I am glad the Senator from Illinois wants to reduce infant  mortality rates and wants to reduce maternal mortality rates. I agree  on both of these goals.   On the subject of infant mortality, the Senate is going to vote on  one infant mortality bill in about an hour. The senior Senator from  Illinois said a moment ago that there are two anti-choice pieces of  legislation this afternoon. For reporters and the public paying  attention, Lindsey Graham's bill is about abortion. I support Senator  Graham's bill. I don't exactly agree with the characterization of it as  leading with the anti-choice language, but it is an abortion bill.   The second piece of legislation we are considering today is not in  any way an abortion bill. The anti-choice legislation rhetoric that you  are using doesn't have anything to do with the actual legislation that  we are considering this afternoon.   Yet I hope that you would consider on the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act the fact that it is addressing some cases of  mortality by making sure babies who have survived abortion get care.  These are babies who are already born and outside the mother.   The Senator's passionate speech about infant mortality suggests that  either we are doing more cynical posturing around here or that folks  plan to actually support this bipartisan piece of legislation. I hope  it is the latter. I sincerely hope that the Senator would vote in  accord with the positions he took earlier in his career and that we  would vote in favor getting important stuff done on this legislation.   In addition, as for the comments he made on the subject of maternal  mortality rates, I agree with him. Many of these tragedies are  preventable and, I believe, despite being the second or third or fourth  most conservative Member of the Senate by my voting record and  believing in small government, I agree we underfund a lot of these  pieces of public health investment, and I would like us to do more to  address preventable maternal tragedies as well.   Therefore, in a moment, I am going to ask if the senior Senator from  Illinois would agree to modify his unanimous consent request to include  the Grassley amendment. I will use all of the appropriate parliamentary  language at the end but, for public understanding, this amendment, the  Grassley amendment, would give States $2.5 billion new dollars to  address maternal health and at-risk communities. In addition, this  amendment would give $200 million to address maternal mortality under  the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Program. We are  talking about more funding, fully offset, for at-risk moms--no  politics, no gimmicks. It is in line with the policies that the senior  Senator from Illinois was just advancing.   It is my belief the pro-life position is pro-baby, pro-mom, and pro- science. If the Senator from Illinois wants to spend another $2.7  billion to help moms, I am aligned with him. It would be great if we  could get that done forever. If, however, we are trying to change the  subject from the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and that  means we can't advance a deal to protect these moms and babies, that  would be disappointing.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify his request to  include  [[Page S1131]]  the Grassley substitute amendment, which is No. 1240. I ask unanimous  consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from its consideration  and that the amendment be considered agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, in reserving the right to object and in  turning this all the way around, we have an objection to an objection  to an objection, but let me just agree to the last point my colleague  from Illinois made.   I think it would be great if this Chamber had 80 or 90 or 95 or 100  people in it instead of how it is now. We are at three today, which is  a high-water mark. Usually, there are one or two people in here.  Senator Barrasso is here. We have four. We are setting a record.   I don't think a lot of us think that the month we all spent here was  ideal. Last month, during the impeachment, there was one thing that was  new in that a lot of Senators spent time talking to each other. So, to  the Senator's grand point of wishing we were debating, we are aligned.   I do want to say one more thing before I object, which is the Senator  said he is not questioning my sincerity. I appreciate that. The Senator  asked that I not question his sincerity, and I am not. I am questioning  his logic, though, because he summarized it as if there were two issues  at play. He said anti-abortion legislation and maternal health funding.  Yet there are three issues at play on the floor today.   One of them is Lindsey Graham's pain-capable bill, which is a pro- life piece of legislation. One of them is Senator Durbin's funding  request about maternal delivery health. Those things are true, but  there is a third thing which, again, he obscured by saying the debate  here is that of funding maternal health or of having anti-abortion  legislation. The piece of legislation we are voting on today--the Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act--is not about abortion. I am  pro-life, and I am going to support Lindsey Graham's bill. Yet the bill  we are voting on does not change anyone's access to abortion. It  doesn't have anything to do with Roe v. Wade. It is about babies who  are already born. This morning on TV, those on CNN made up this insane  phrase. They said it was a fetus that had been born. What the heck is  that? It is another way of saying they don't want to debate the actual  debate we are having on the floor today.   We are going to vote once on Lindsey Graham's pro-life legislation,  and I am going to support it. We are also going to vote on a piece of  legislation called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.  These are about babies who are born, who are outside their mothers.  What is actually happening is that the senior Senator from Illinois is  wanting to obscure the debate because he wants to use euphemisms about  choice so that we don't have to admit to the American public that what  is actually happening on the floor today is probably going to be like  it was last year--with 44 Democrats filibustering an anti-infanticide  bill.   There is nothing in the bill that is about abortion--nothing. It is  about infanticide. That is the actual legislation. We have 44 people  over there who want to hide from it and talk in euphemisms about  abortion because they don't want to defend the indefensible because  they can't defend the indefensible. We are talking about killing babies  who are born. That is the actual legislation we are voting on today in  the Senate. That is what the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act is. Is it OK in the eyes of the U.S. Senate for us to say: ``Well,  you can't actively kill the little baby. You can't take a pillow and  put it over her face and smother her to death, but you can back away  and kill her that way''?   That is what Ralph Northam--the disgraced Governor of Virginia--was  talking about when he said: Well, once the baby is born, if she  survives an abortion--and we wish that it would not happen--then we  will figure out a way to keep her calm for a little while, while the  doctors debate what they want to do. What he means is, kill the baby,  and that is the legislation we are voting on today.   There are three buckets. Lindsey Graham's Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act is a bill about abortion. There is another bill  that is about babies who have already been born.    News flash, CNN: If you are a baby and if you have been born and if  you are outside of Mama, nobody calls that a fetus. You just want to  call it a fetus because you don't want to cover the actual story that  is being voted on in the Senate today.  [[Page S1132]]    Then there is a third piece of legislation, which is Senator Durbin's  counterproposal about maternal preventable deaths and investments in  that category. I am interested in that category as well, but the  Senator from Illinois doesn't actually want to talk about the  legislation that is on the floor, so he is changing the subject.   Therefore, I object.    Madam President, just for the record and just so we all  have it clear, the Senator talks about infanticide, and he is right.  Active infanticide is illegal under Federal law as there are no crimes  for it in half of the States.   More fundamentally, what the Senate is considering today is passive  infanticide. Whether they are born in glistening NICUs at fancy  hospitals, with a lot of rich cars in the parking lots, or whether the  babies are born in the unfortunate circumstances of abortion clinics in  strip malls, whether they are 1 day old or 5 days old, it turns out  that they die if you wander away from them and deny them care. If you  don't give them warmth and if you don't give them food, they die.  Passive killing, passive infanticide, is not illegal under Federal law.   The Senator said infanticide is illegal, and he is half right. Active  infanticide is illegal under Federal law. You cannot take a pillow and  smother a newborn baby to death. What you can do and what does happen  in abortion clinics across America--and it is why we held a Judiciary  Committee hearing on this 2 weeks ago so as to hear from medical and  legal community experts who know what the practice looks like--is the  taking of that vulnerable, innocent, little, tiny fetus, putting her on  a cart, walking her down the hall, putting that cart in a closet, and  leaving her to die by exposure. That is what we should prevent, and  that is what this legislation is about.   I thank the Presiding Officer.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this afternoon, we are going to vote on  the simplest bill in the history of the U.S. Senate. It is the simplest  bill we have ever considered here. It says that if a newborn baby  survives an abortion, she deserves medical care. That is the bill. That  is it.   Sadly, a lot of Senators are going to come to the floor, and they are  going to read or they are planning to read--I hope they will  reconsider--but they are planning to read talking points that were  written for them by Planned Parenthood, and they are going to talk  about a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the  bill we actually have before us.   Senators are going to muddy the issue, and, sadly, too many in the  press are going to report with headlines like ``Abortion Restrictions''  and with anti-science jargon like ``A Fetus That Was Born.'' That was  an actual portion of the headline this morning: ``A Fetus That Was  Born.''   Sadly, a lot of folks seem determined to look the other way. Looking  the other way from the issue that we are considering today in this body  shouldn't be an option, so let's start with four straight, undeniable  facts--four simple facts.   First, Federal law does not criminalize the denial of care to newborn  babies who survive abortions. Federal law doesn't criminalize the  denial of care to babies who survive abortions.   Second, we know that babies sometimes survive abortions, and the data  backs that up. If Senators don't like this inconvenient fact, they can  take it up with the CDC and the States that have mandatory reporting  about babies who survive abortions.   Third, this bill, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,  simply says that if a baby survives an abortion, she should get the  same degree of medical care that any other baby would get at that same  gestational stage. It is really important--same care that would be  provided to any other baby at the same gestational stage.   It is a short bill. I know my colleagues are busy, but all of them  could read the bill. So instead of coming to the floor and reciting  prepackaged talking points that Planned Parenthood wrote for you, take  a few minutes and actually read the bill, and you will find that the  talking points don't actually match up with the actual bill you are  called on to vote on today. Those are the facts.   Finally, this is not about abortion. My colleague, the senior Senator  from South Carolina, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has a  really important piece of legislation that he is going to speak on in a  moment, and I am going to support his legislation. It is a really  important pro-life piece of legislation. I am in favor of it.   But my legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,  is not actually about abortion. It is about babies who have already  survived a botched abortion. My legislation is not about Roe v. Wade.  It is about what happens after a baby is already born when an abortion  failed to accomplish the purpose it had--the sad purpose, in my view-- the purpose it had to terminate that pregnancy. This is about the  babies who have already been born. This is about whether that baby who  has survived the abortion and is now lying on the abortion table or on  the medical table--whether or not that cold, naked baby alone has a  right to medical care.   We all know the answer. The answer is, of course she does. Every baby  dies if you leave her to passively die of exposure. Whether she was  born in a gold-plated hospital with a lot of fancy, expensive cars in  the parking lot outside that NICU unit or whether she was born in the  unfortunate circumstances of an abortion clinic in a strip mall, every  little baby who has already been born--they will die if you deny care  to them. So, of course, we shouldn't do that. Of course, the U.S.  Senate should stand up and defend those babies.   We all know that denying care to the most vulnerable among us is  barbaric, and this body ought to be able to stand 100 to 0 against that  barbarism. It is inhumane, and it is passive infanticide, and the  Senate should today condemn and prohibit that practice. Is that  practice what my colleagues really want to defend? I can't believe they  do.    The 44 who filibustered this legislation a year ago this week, when  you talk to them one to one, they get really uncomfortable, and they  try to change the subject to all sorts of other culture war debates  because they don't want to have a conversation about the actual  legislation and the actual babies we are considering today. Why?  Because they are scared to death of Planned Parenthood's army of  lobbyists, that is why. It is not because any of them really want to  defend the morally reprehensible and the morally indefensible practice  that is passive infanticide. None of them want to defend it. They are  just scared.   Last year, 44 Senators filibustered this legislation. They said that  it was OK to look the other way while newborns were discarded. They  said that Federal law should not ensure that these babies are treated  with care. They seem to have a hard time saying that human beings  outside the womb have the same right to life as you and I ought to have  and that we get care; we need care. They need care, and they should get  care.   Put down your talking points. Please read the bill before you vote  today. Read the expert testimony that the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee allowed us to hold in his committee room 2 weeks ago, where  we brought in both medical and legal experts to talk about what happens  in these abortion clinics.   For those in this body who are not on the Judiciary Committee or who  didn't do the preparation for today's vote, I want to summarize the  testimony of one of the people who came before our  [[Page S1134]]  Judiciary Committee--Jill Stanek, who now works for the Susan B.  Anthony List. She was at an Illinois hospital in the 1990s and early  2000s. Here is a quote from her:         Of 16 babies Christ Hospital aborted during the calendar       year 2000, four that I knew of [were born alive, and they]       were aborted alive.    That is 25 percent--4 out of the 16 abortions at that hospital.   She continues:         Each of those babies--[there were] two boys and two girls--      lived [somewhere] between 1\1/2\ and 3 hours. One baby was 28       weeks' gestation [age]--7 months old--and weighed two pounds,       seven ounces.    Numbers from the CDC and the States that report data on abortion  survivors--that is about 8 of the 50 States that do some reporting and  data collection on this--tell a story of babies who were breathing,  whose hearts were beating, who stretched their arms, wiggled their  fingers, and kicked their legs. This is the actual data. You want to  talk about being pro-science--being pro-science is pro-baby.   What happened to the babies? Medical practitioners have testified  before Congress about walking into rooms where living babies were lying  naked and alone on countertops, where they would be left to expire by  themselves--alone, cold, naked, and denied care.   Opponents of this bill don't want to deal with the facts. They prefer  to stick to talking points and claim that this never happens. If they  will not listen to the medical experts, perhaps they will take the word  of the Governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam.   In January of last year, disgraced Governor Northam was explicit  during a radio interview in which he said that a baby born alive during  an abortion ``would be kept comfortable. . . . then a discussion would  ensue'' about whether that baby should be left to die. That is actually  what Governor Northam was talking about on the radio in Virginia.   What he did is make the terrible faux pas of saying in public the  true stuff about this procedure and this practice of walking away and  backing away from these babies and letting them die. He just decided to  talk in public about the reality of what happens in some of these  abortion clinics.   Governor Northam is not an outlier. Just 3 weeks ago, one of the  Democratic candidates for President was asked point blank on national  television about infanticide: Would he be comfortable if a mother  invoked infanticide to kill her now already born-alive child? Mayor  Buttigieg's response: ``I don't know what I'd tell them.''   Really? Somebody asks you if you can kill a baby who has already been  born, and you say you don't know what to say?   Every one of us, especially somebody running for the highest office  in the land to uphold the laws--laws that promise to protect the right  to life--should be able to say without any hesitation that leaving  babies to die is unacceptable.   This isn't horrid stuff, people. There are actually some horrid  debates we have in this Chamber. This isn't one of them. This is about  babies who have been born alive and whether you can decide to kill  them. There is really no debate to be had here, which is why so many  people who were planning to speak on the other side decided not to  speak this afternoon, because you can't defend the morally  reprehensible procedure that is backing away, that is passive  infanticide.   There are no exceptions. There are no special circumstances. We  should protect every human being, no matter how small they are, no  matter how weak they are. And if the Senate says that it is OK to  ignore born-alive babies, what we are really saying is that we are OK  with a society where some people count more than other people. We would  be saying that we want a society where some people can be pushed aside  if other people decide those folks are inconvenient, a society where we  can dispose of you if you happen to come into the world a certain way.   It is unbelievably telling that Planned Parenthood, NARAL, which is  the extremist abortion lobby and their armies of lawyers and slick  public relations teams and influence peddlers, cannot draw this line.  It is pretty amazing.   This bill is not about abortion. Again, I want to be clear. We are  voting on two things today. One of them is a piece of legislation about  abortion. It is the pain-capable bill. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, is going to speak in favor of it in a minute.  I am an original cosponsor of his legislation. I support it, and I am  going to wholeheartedly vote for it.   But the other piece of legislation we are going to vote on today  isn't actually even about abortion. This should be 100-to-0 no-brainer.  This bill is not about Roe v. Wade. This bill will not change one word  of abortion law in the United States. My colleagues can vote up or  down, but they can't pretend that they don't know the stakes of what we  are talking about.   America is a country built on the beautiful principle of equality,  and the terms of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act are  intended to reflect that. A child born alive during a botched abortion  should be given the same level of care that would be provided to any  other baby born at that same gestational stage, which is just to say  that a born-alive baby is a human being with fundamental human dignity,  which is undeniable. They should receive the care and affection due to  every other human being.   Today, we have a chance to advance our commitment to human dignity.  We can protect those babies who come into the world under the worst of  conditions. We can welcome them into a world with love and hope and  help and care.   My colleagues, please do not turn your backs on those babies.   I yield the floor.
