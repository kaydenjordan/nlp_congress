 Madam Speaker, it was Thomas Jefferson  who said that, if he had to choose, he would prefer newspapers without  government over government without newspapers.   Now, that is quite a dramatic statement, but I think it highlights  how critical journalism is to holding government accountable. Indeed,  as my lapel pin notes tonight, ``Democracy demands journalism.''   Now, journalism is not a comfortable duty. I suspect every good  reporter has faced the wrath of a wronged politician and has had  disgruntled viewers or readers or listeners cancel their patronage.   It is tempting for us to be among the disgruntled, but if we want a  free society, we have to support a free press, one whose loyalty is not  to partisan endeavors or to stoking division and conflict but, rather,  is to the truth.   Yes, Madam Speaker, democracy does demand journalism.                            ____________________
