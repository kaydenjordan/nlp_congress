 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes,  evenly split between Senator Corker and me, to speak on the NATO  amendment.    Mr. President, I would add that my fellow Ohioan, Senator  Portman, is a cosponsor of this. Special thanks go to Senator Graham-- this is the Graham-Brown NATO amendment--also to Senators McCain,  Rubio, Casey, and Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island.   This is especially important to the Ukrainian community in my State.  A number of them have been in town the last couple of days. They know  how critical support for our allies is and how important it is that  this amendment sends a clear message that the United States will uphold  our half-century commitment to NATO, combined with a strong signal to  Russia to clean up its act. That is the importance of this amendment. I  ask support from my colleagues.   I yield to Senator Corker.
