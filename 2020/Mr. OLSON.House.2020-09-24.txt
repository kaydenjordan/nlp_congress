 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with sadness and joy; sadness  because our leader at Alvin Community College, ACC, Dr. Christal  Albrecht, announced she will retire as our incredible president on  August 31 of next year; joyful because of the 7 amazing years she gave  us as our president.   She arrived as our sixth president in May of 2014. She came aboard  with a great school; she leaves an even greater school.   She was able to corral groups like faculty, students, donors, who  sometimes have a break with the herd mentality. She put through a 5- year strategic plan with these groups. All those goals will be finished  when she leaves.   Her trademark is listening; asking students, What do you want to do  with your life, or asking industry, What do you need from your  employees? Christal met every challenge head-on.   And I will close with one final challenge. Alvin's mascot is a  dolphin named Blue. Our challenge, on behalf of the students, faculty,  and lovers of ACC, is Christal, wear this uniform, this mascot's  uniform, for a game or a day on campus before you leave. Thank you. God  bless you.  [[Page H4898]]                                ____________________
