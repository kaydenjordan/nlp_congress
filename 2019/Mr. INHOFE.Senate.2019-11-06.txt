 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized  as in morning business for such time as I may consume.    You know, we don't hear that very often. I just heard the  term from the Senator from Nebraska ``under budget and ahead of  schedule.''  [[Page S6439]]    You did something right. Good for you.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory of  Gregory E. Pyle, Chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, who passed  away last week. Chief Pyle was a dedicated servant and leader of the  Choctaw Nation for 30 years. After more than 13 years as the Assistant  Chief of the Tribe, in 1997, he became Chief of the Choctaw Nation  until his retirement in 2014.   Chief Pyle was a man of vision and action. He put families first by  focusing on health, jobs, and education. Under his thoughtful  leadership, the Choctaw Nation focused on economic development, which  resulted in new business and job opportunities for Tribal members.   One of my fondest memories with Chief Pyle was when we worked  together to pass the historic Code Talkers legislation, which awarded  Congressional Commemorative Medals to the Code Talkers of the Choctaw  Nation of Oklahoma, along with other Tribes, in recognition of their  service during World Wars I and II. Not many people remember this, but  Chief Pyle and I started on our journey to honor these heroes in 2002,  and it wasn't until 2008 that we were able to get it done. This measure  along with many others not only speaks to his character, but also to  his unwavering dedication to the Choctaw people.   The Choctaw Nation and the State of Oklahoma are grateful for his  dedication and humble leadership. His legacy will benefit generations  to come.

Throughout his life, MSG Matthew Williams displayed tremendous  confidence, competence, and determination. He graduated from Angelo  State University with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and  completed the hardest training the U.S. Army has to offer: Special  Forces Assessment and Selection, the Special Forces Qualification  Course, and SERE training.   Master Sergeant Williams is a master and expert in his chosen  profession--18 Bravo, U.S. Army Special Forces weapons sergeant--and  has proven himself to be a consummate professional with service in  numerous positions: weapons Sergeant operational Detachment Alpha 3336,  senior weapons sergeant Operational Detachment Alpha 332, senior  instructor/writer, Delta Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Warfare  Training Group, and operations sergeant, Alpha Company 2nd Battalion,  3rd SFG (A).   Master Sergeant Williams has a proven commitment to service and to  this Nation by repeatedly answering the call to action with a  deployment in support of Operation JUNIPER SHIELD and multiple  deployments in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. He displayed  conspicuous gallantry on April 6, 2008, as a member of Operational  Detachment Alpha 3336, during Operation Commando Wrath, a mission to  capture or kill high-value targets of the Hezeb Islami al Gulbadin in  the Shok Valley of Afghanistan. With numerous U.S. soldiers and Afghan  commandos pinned down by intense enemy fire, Master Sergeant Williams  continuously disregarded his own safety and concern, braved rocket- propelled-grenade and heavy machinegun fire in order to lead a group of  Afghan commandos on a counterattack across ice-covered boulders and a  fast-moving, ice-cold, waist-deep river to help reinforce and evacuate  four wounded teammates and set-up a critical firing position to allow  his other teammates and Afghan commandos to escape safety.   For his actions that day, Master Sergeant Williams was awarded the  Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest medal, on 30 October 2019, by the  President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.   Kevin Stitt, Governor of Oklahoma, proclaimed November 6, as Master  Sergeant Matthew Williams Day, and I encourage all citizens to  recognize the achievements and contributions by Master Sergeant  Williams to the U.S. of America and to the United States Army Special  Forces.                            ____________________
