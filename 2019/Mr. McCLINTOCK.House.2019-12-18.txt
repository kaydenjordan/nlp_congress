 Mr. Speaker, nullifying a national election requires  an overwhelming case of high crimes supported by indisputable evidence  that the vast majority of the Nation finds compelling.   Now, article I is a made-up crime called abuse of office. It does not  charge that the President broke any law, but that Congress doesn't like  the way he lawfully discharged his constitutional duties. This would  reduce the Presidency to that of a minister serving at the pleasure of  Congress, destroying the separation of powers at the heart of our  Constitution.   Article II is another made-up crime called obstruction of Congress.  It means the President sought to defend his constitutional rights and  those of his Office. This removes the judiciary from our Constitution  and places Congress alone in the position of defining the limits of its  own powers relative to the President.   Our Bill of Rights guarantees every American the right to confront  their accuser, to call witnesses in their defense, to be protected from  hearsay, and to defend these rights in court. The Democrats have  trampled them all in their stampede to impeach. Even in this kangaroo  court, the Democrats' hand-picked witnesses provided no firsthand  knowledge that the President linked aid to action--in fact, two  witnesses provided firsthand knowledge  [[Page H12141]]  that he specifically ordered no quid pro quo.   Any case that charged no actual crime and offered no legally  admissible evidence would be laughed out of court in a heartbeat. That  is the case before us today. It would redefine the grounds for  impeachment in such a way that assures that it will become a constant  presence in our national life. Now we know just how reckless is the  Democrats' chant of ``resist by any means necessary.'' This is a  stunning abuse of power and a shameless travesty of justice that will  stain the reputations of those responsible for generations to come.
