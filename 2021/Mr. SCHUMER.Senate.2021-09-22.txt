 Mr. President, yesterday evening, the House of  Representatives approved a continuing resolution that will keep the  government open through December, provide emergency funding for Afghan  refugees and Americans affected by natural disasters, and suspend the  debt ceiling through the end of 2022.   The bill now comes to the Senate, where both parties must pass it  together to steer the United States away from a number of fast- approaching crises. Absent congressional action, the government will  shut down in just over a week. The United States could face a first- ever default soon thereafter, and it will be American families who will  suffer most.   Now our Republican colleagues say they don't want a shutdown. They  say they don't want a credit default. They say they want hurricane aid.  Then they should vote yes on this bill.   You want to avoid a default, Republican colleagues? Vote yes.   You want to avoid a government shutdown? Vote yes.   You want to provide hurricane aid? Vote yes.   You want to help the Afghan refugees? Vote yes.   That is the bill that will be on the floor. Those who will vote yes  will vote to avoid default, to avoid a government shutdown.   Those who vote no will be saying: We are OK with default and we are  OK with a government shutdown.   To say, ``Do it another way,'' that doesn't cut it. This is what is  on the floor. This is what the House passed. And, again, the kind of  sophistry that we have heard from the Republican leader doesn't make  any sense, either through past history or through practicality and what  we need today.   At the end of the day, it is how we vote that matters most. Our  constituents sent us here to vote, plain and simple. So Republicans  face a choice. Vote yes to pay our bills and keep the government open;  or vote no, which means you are OK with default and a government  shutdown.   Every single Democrat will support this bill. Whether or not we avoid  default is simply entirely up to the Republican Senators. It is up to  them, plain and simple.   The President has the proposal. The House has passed the proposal. I  will put that proposal on the Senate floor.   And remember, this is not just a political fight. The last time  Republicans played with the debt ceiling in 2011, the credit of the  United States was downgraded for the first time ever. And all  [[Page S6596]]  indications are that if Republicans succeed in causing a default this  time around, the consequences will be catastrophic.   According to a sobering new analysis by Mark Zandi at Moody's  Analytics, a default would erase up to 6 million jobs in the economy.  It would cause unemployment, which we have worked so hard to bring down  during this COVID season, to spike up again to as much as 9 percent.  And as much as $15 trillion of household wealth will be wiped out of  existence. Every American family will suffer from the Republican desire  to play political games and send our Nation into default.   Let me say that again: $15 trillion of household wealth. And that  means thousands of dollars for each family--for many families-- thousands.   That is not fair. All for the sake, Leader McConnell, of a political  gain. Political gain. It is an incomprehensible number. I can't think  of a worse gut punch to the American people who spent the last 19  months fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic than to see their life  savings disappear because Republicans won't pay the bills and are  simply trying to gain mere political advantage.   There is no scenario on God's green Earth where it is worth risking 6  million jobs, 9 percent unemployment, and $15 trillion of household  wealth just to stick it to your political opponents. But that seems to  be the MO these days of the Republican leader: not caring at all about  the American people and what matters to them and playing political  games in an effort--I believe a futile effort--to gain political  advantage.   It won't succeed. Everyone knows who is doing what around here.   So, over the past few weeks, Republicans have advanced a number of  dishonest and duplicitous arguments to rationalize their opposition to  the debt ceiling, to play political games that the minority leader is  involved in.   I expect we will be hearing these arguments over and over again, so  let's set the record straight on two of their main points.   First, our Republican colleagues have argued that raising the debt  ceiling should exclusively be the domain of one party when it controls  all three branches of government. Of course, this is nonsense.   Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been raised about 80 times under  both unified and divided government.   As recently as 2017, Leader McConnell, as majority leader, put  forward a bill to raise the debt ceiling when there was a Republican  President, a Republican Senate, and a Republican House; urged Democrats  to join him.   And, of course, we did because it is the right thing to do. We don't  want to hurt the American people. We don't want to play games with the  livelihood of Americans the way the Republican leader seems to revel in  doing. And rather than play political games and rather than engage in  an ill-considered game of chicken, Democrats worked with the other  side.   Second and even far more dishonest, Republicans say they don't want  to raise the debt ceiling because they don't want to clear the way for  more domestic spending. This statement is false, pure and simple.   Our proposal to suspend the debt ceiling is not about future  spending. Raising the debt ceiling is about paying the bills that have  already been racked up. The proposal the House sent over is designed to  help pay for the $908 billion that we approved last year in the depths  of the COVID crisis.    That legislation was drafted by Republicans, voted for by  Republicans, put on the floor by Leader McConnell, and signed by a  Republican President. It is the Trump debt--the Trump debt--that we now  must pay.   For Republicans, after voting for it, after going back to their  districts and claiming credit for some of the things in that bill, to  now decide they have changed their minds and they don't want to pay the  debt that they willingly took on and brag about the spending that  incurred that debt is the height of irresponsibility and the height of  hypocrisy. It is a dine-and-dash of unprecedented proportions. And if  they have their way, it is going to be the American people who will  foot the bill.   The full faith and credit isn't a game. It is the bedrock upon which  our economy stands. No lawmaker can vote to refuse to pay the bills and  then say they have the best interests of the American people in mind.   So, again, here is what is on the line with this vote: the well-being  of tens of millions of Americans--everyone from small business owners,  homeowners, veterans, Active Duty military, Social Security  beneficiaries, and American consumers everywhere.   And Senator Warner has made a very good point. If we default or even  if the risk of coming close to default raises interest rates by 1  percent, that will cost the government more--more--than some of the  spending programs--many of the spending programs that the Republicans  say they don't like, even though they voted for it.   There is a very simple answer to avoiding this entire problem. When  the CR comes to the floor, Republicans vote yes and put this needless  crisis to an end. But if they choose to vote in favor of default by a  cynical political blame game, it will ultimately be the American people  who will pay the price. And the American people will know who did  this--the Republican Senate. Because there will be a proposal by the  Democratic President, the bill will pass the floor, and Democrats and  Republicans will each have to vote yes or no, simply put, on whether we  want to default.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on nominations. Last night, I filed  cloture on seven nominations that have, to date, been tied up by  Republican obstructionists.   These individuals will play a critical role in advancing U.S.  diplomacy across the globe, from Europe to East Asia to Africa. One  will be tasked with international narcotics law enforcement; another  will advise on military affairs.   These are not controversial nominees. Quite the contrary, they were  all reported out of committee with overwhelming bipartisan support and  would normally be confirmed by this Chamber without much fuss.   Now a few on the other side have decided they are going to hold these  critical nominations hostage for the sake of scoring political points  with the far right. It is a sort of a manic dash, who can be the most  irresponsible to please the far right of people who seem to be  interested in running for President in 2024.   They want to drag out what should be an easy process, wasting the  Chamber's time and energy and hindering the government's ability to  protect American interests.   The Republicans who are delaying the confirmation of these nominees  are deliberately making the American people less safe just so they can  try to enhance their political fortunes, which, in my judgment, if  there is any gain, it will be short term and the loss of doing this  will be much greater to them.   Everyone here knows what is really going on, but despite Republican  obstruction this week, we are going to make sure these important  nominees are confirmed by the Senate. I hope we can come to an  agreement to ultimately move them quickly through this Chamber, but  either way, we are going to stay here until these nominees have been  confirmed.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
