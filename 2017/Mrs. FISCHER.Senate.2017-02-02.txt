 Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of  Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.   I will address Mr. Gorsuch's qualifications and his extensive legal  experience in a moment, but first, I invite my Senate colleagues to  consider: What do we seek in a nominee to our Nation's highest court?   Maybe it is easier to say what we don't want. We do not want a  lawmaker. Washington has plenty of those, 100 Senators and 435 Members  of Congress. We do not want a crusader for a cause. Most of all, we do  not want a trailblazer.   What we want is a follower of the Constitution. We want a Supreme  Court Justice who will follow the laws, as written, and uphold the rule  of law. This demands discipline; it requires the rarest of virtues:  humility. There is no room for hubris on the Supreme Court.   We do not want a Justice who believes he knows better than our  Founders. That is not his job. A Supreme Court Justice should neutrally  apply the laws as written by Congress and as understood by the Framers  of our Constitution. They must not impose their personal preferences  upon the law or upon the American people. I want to say again that we  want someone who will follow the law and uphold the rule of law.   We also seek a keen legal mind. A nominee must possess the sharpest  intellect and only the most rigorous academic qualifications. This  person may be one of nine human beings who will resolve questions  affecting the freedoms and the rights of millions. Therefore, in  addition to ironclad commitment to the rule of law and brilliant  intellect, this person must be a known quantity. There must be a  reliable record for us to carefully assess.   In exercising our constitutional power of advice and consent, we  don't make guesses here in the U.S. Senate. We hold hearings; we ask  probing questions. This is how we will determine if Mr. Gorsuch is the  legal disciple, brilliant mind, and known quantity the American people  need and the person the American people deserve. The evidence so far  suggests that he is.   As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Mr.  Gorsuch has served 10 years in extraordinary fashion. He was confirmed  by a voice vote here in the U.S. Senate. His opinions reflect a history  of upholding the rule of law. His conduct on the bench demonstrates an  exemplary judicial temperament. He is enormously well qualified. His  educational background is impressive: an undergraduate degree from  Columbia, a law degree from Harvard, and a Ph.D. from Oxford  University. Judge Gorsuch clerked for the Supreme Court. Further, he is  well within the mainstream.   Among his many impressive academic distinctions, he is a Truman  Scholar. This sizeable financial award is given by the Harry S. Truman  Scholarship Foundation to young people pursuing a career in public  service. I note that my colleague from Delaware, Senator Coons, is a  Truman Scholar. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright serves as  president of the Truman Foundation. Senator McCaskill of Missouri is a  board member. All are highly respected Democrats. It should be telling  that the organization, now headed by Secretary Albright and Senator  McCaskill, helped Mr. Gorsuch fund his graduate studies.   Jeffrey Rosen of the nonpartisan National Constitution Center had  this to say about the judge: ``He sometimes reaches results that favor  liberals when he thinks the history or the text of the Constitution or  the law require it, especially in areas like criminal law or the rights  of religious minorities.''   Norm Eisen, Special Counsel for Ethics and Government Reform in the  White House for President Barack Obama, attended law school with Mr.  Gorsuch. He called him, simply, ``a great guy.''   There is much more that can and will be said about the nominee in the  days to come. Much of it will contribute to a vigorous confirmation  process. Sadly, I suspect much of it will not. Many, including some in  this Chamber, have said they will oppose any nominee, no matter how  qualified.   Americans deserve better than this bitter feud in the U.S. Senate.  The Presidential campaign is over. As the Washington Post recently  editorialized, ``A Supreme Court nomination isn't a forum to refight a  presidential election.'' The newspaper's editors urged against ``a  scorched-earth'' response.   Senate Republicans gave President Bill Clinton an up-or-down vote on  his first two Supreme Court nominees. Senate Republicans gave President  Obama an up-or-down vote on his two first Supreme Court nominees. This  is a chance for my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to show how high- minded they can be. They can permit a similar up-or-down vote on this  President's first Supreme Court nominee.   I invite them to engage with me in a respectful, civil dialogue as we  carry out our duty of advice and consent. We need a vigorous  confirmation process, and I will work for that vigorous, open,  respectful, and transparent process. I  [[Page S627]]  hope all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in  that.   Mr. President, I yield back the remaining proponent debate time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponent's time is yielded back.   The Senator from Delaware.                           Nomination Neil Gorsuch
