Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on H.R. 6398, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 6398, the Department  of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act.   This legislation authorizes the Department of Energy, DOE, to conduct  collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the VA,  in order to solve complex, big data challenges in order to improve  veterans' healthcare and basic research in advanced computing and data  analytics.   The VA hosts one of the world's largest and most valuable health  datasets. Through its voluntary data collection program entitled the  Million Veterans Program, MVP, the VA has collected detailed health  information and  [[Page H8870]]  genomic data volunteered by over 600,000 veterans.   In order to better use this data to provide better healthcare for our  veterans, the VA needs more advanced computing capabilities,  infrastructure, and expertise than it has in-house.   As a world leader in high performance computing, DOE is well suited  to meet this need. In its national laboratory system, DOE possesses a  unique set of cutting-edge research capabilities.   It hosts six of the world's top 10 fastest supercomputers, including  the Summit computer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is the  world's fastest supercomputer. DOE also funds robust research in  computational sciences and data analytics, which can be used to solve a  range of complex big data challenges in the physical sciences.   The interagency partnership authorized in my bill combines the VA's  clinical and population science expertise with DOE's big data science  in advanced computing expertise in order to solve critical health  challenges for our veterans while creating another path forward for the  advancement of big data science tools for the American researchers.   This partnership, called the Million Veterans Program-Computational  Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now, or the  MVP-CHAMPION program, will use DOE supercomputers to analyze VA health  data and look for patterns that will help inform and improve medical  treatment for heart disease, traumatic brain injury, and cancer.   Ultimately, the goal of this legislation is for the DOE national  laboratories to provide the VA with information it can use to improve  healthcare services for veterans.   The bill also requires the Department to establish data storage  facilities to securely transmit and store data that the VA provides.  This will make certain that privacy and security are maintained for  veterans who volunteer for the program.   In addition, this legislation establishes a pilot program within DOE  to create a cross-cutting research initiative in artificial  intelligence, data analytics, and computational research.   This program will help American scientists stay on the cutting-edge  as the computing landscape changes and international competition  increases, and will promote the development of the computing tools  needed to address big data challenges.   These tools will both help improve the existing MVP-CHAMPION  partnership and will advance key DOE mission goals in nuclear security,  energy technology, and innovative science research.   Our veterans should have access to better healthcare services and our  scientists should remain leaders in advanced computing. The Department  of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act promises to deliver on both  fronts.   Once again, I would like to thank Chairman Smith and the 15 other  Science, Space, and Technology Committee members who cosponsored this  legislation for supporting my bill.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 20, 2018.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Space, Science, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       6398, as amended, the ``Department of Energy Veterans' Health       Initiative Act.'' As you know, there are provisions in the       legislation that fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this legislation, I       am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its       jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       6398, as amended, and into the Congressional Record during       consideration of this legislation on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                Washington, DC, September 20, 2018.      Hon. David P. Roe,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs jurisdictional interest in       H.R. 6398, the ``Department of Energy Veterans' Health       Initiative Act,'' and your willingness to forego       consideration of H.R. 6398 by your committee.        I agree that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has a valid       jurisdictional interest in certain provisions of H.R. 6398,       and that the Committee's jurisdiction will not be adversely       affected by your decision to forego consideration of H.R.       6398. As you have requested, I will support your request for       an appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your       Committee in the event of a House-Senate conference on this       or similar legislation should such a conference be convened.        Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this       response in the Committee Report and in the Congressional       Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you       again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Weber), the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Smith, Representative  Dunn, Representative Higgins, Representative Lucas, Representative  Weber, Representative Knight, Representative Rohrabacher,  Representative Hultgren, Representative Babin, Representative Comstock,  Representative Abraham, Representative Biggs, Representative Marshall,  Representative Lesko, Representative Lipinski, Representative Rosen,  Representative Bilirakis, Representative Gallagher, Representative Bill  Johnson, and Representative Walter Jones for their continued leadership  in providing support for our veterans and enabling critical science  research.   I would also like to thank the stakeholders and researchers who have  provided valuable feedback as we develop this legislation.   H.R. 6398 supports a program that will encourage innovation in basic  science and big data research at DOE, and ensure that we as a Nation  are doing everything we can to improve healthcare for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this commonsense legislation and  yield back the balance of my time.
