 Mr. Speaker, we are in interesting times. I think it was  Confucius who said to live in interesting times is a great opportunity.  It is.   Unfortunately, the rule of law and democracy are at stake. And as  they are and as the Intel Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, and  the Oversight and Reform Committee have hearings--and later, there will  be public hearings--we are seeing American heroes emerge.   Today, an American hero, a lieutenant colonel who earned a Purple  Heart, will be testifying. Colonel Vindman listened to the conversation  between President Zelensky and President Trump, and he will testify as  to what happened. It won't be a memorandum; it will be what really took  place on that call and why it alarmed him so much.   The administration doesn't want Colonel Vindman to testify, but he is  testifying because he is a patriot, because it is his duty, and because  he knows what is at stake.   What is at stake is democracy. What is at stake is our Constitution.  What is at stake is our Republic.                                time  1045    We have had other people testify, the Ambassador who was removed 2  months early because she refused to go along with what was taking  place, and Ms. Fiona Hill. These are heroes. These are patriots.   Unfortunately, on some news networks that are mouthpieces for the  administration, they have had their patriotism questioned, and they  have been vilified.   This is the beginning of despotism. When heroes who come forth with  proud careers of service in the State Department or the military,  without a blemish on their record, and without trying to benefit  financially from anybody at all, except doing their job for the United  States of America, are questioned because they come forth to testify as  to information that threatens our Constitution, that shows abuse of  power and an effort to not comply with our Constitution and carrying  out congressionally-mandated spending to protect a country fighting  Russian aggression in their own territory.   These are not people like Manafort, and Flynn, and Carter Page, who  wanted and got money from Ukrainians, and Turks, and Russians, and  others to benefit themselves from countries that do not have our  interests at heart.   So, as we live through these interesting times, let us appreciate the  heroes that are emerging, giving testimony, and putting their jobs and  their future security and their reputations at risk because,  unfortunately, rather than being hailed as the heroes that they truly  are, they are being vilified; and that is dangerous, and it is  concerning to me.   Some of the people that vilify them praise people like Flynn and  Manafort, who sold our country out for their own personal advancement  and riches.   America, beware, and honor those who stand up for you.                            ____________________
