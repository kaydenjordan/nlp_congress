 Mr. President, I appear in a very timely way to make clear  that our military will be paid if the House Republicans do not shut our  government down. But in the off chance that they do, because of  Democrats, in the last shutdown we had, we got a bill passed that  guaranteed that all of them will at least receive backpay. In earlier  shutdowns, that was never a guarantee. So people were forced to come to  work not knowing whether they would be paid.   But during the last shutdown, in early 2019, I forwarded a bill to  the floor. I used a procedural objection to recess at the end of a  week. And using that objection, we were able to get a guarantee in  place that all Federal employees, including members of the military,  will not be punished when ne'er-do-wells and malefactors in the GOP  decide to shut the government down.   Why do I make it so partisan? It is because only the GOP ever  threatens to shut government down. In 2013, 2018, 2019, right now--only  the GOP threatens to default on the national debt. We in the Senate,  with a little cooperation from our Republican colleagues, will pass an  overwhelmingly bipartisan continuing resolution within the next couple  of days. And if the House will only do their job and agree to be as  bipartisan as the Senate is, nobody needs to worry about losing a  paycheck. But at least we have put a guarantee in place that nobody  serving our Nation, whether in uniform or otherwise, will be at risk of  losing pay because of an unnecessary shutdown.   Just a few months ago, the Speaker and the President negotiated a  deal to avoid a default, and they set the stage to fund government  spending bills. Since then, bipartisan colleagues in the Senate  Appropriations Committee have worked in an impressive way.   The Presiding Officer is part of that team, working impressively and  in a bipartisan manner to pass 12 appropriations bills out of  committee.   But now, Members of the House are backtracking on the agreement that  we just made 4 months ago. We made an agreement on spending limits, and  the Senate Appropriations Committee has written their bills to those  numbers. And yet the House is using Federal shutdown as a bargaining  chip to undo the deal they just voted for and to try to get more  draconian cuts and unnecessary policies in this year-end deal.   I am a Senator from Virginia. Some of the hardest effects of shutdown  will be seen in my State, and they are already starting. Even before we  get to midnight on Saturday, September 30, my office has been flooded  with more than 600 constituent comments expressing their concerns about  government shutdown. And what I would like to do is just share some of  the stories that I am hearing from Virginians.   April, from Orange County, writes:         My husband is a member of the Army Reserves and [he] is       preparing for a deployment to Africa next year. His training       has been delayed due to funding with the close of the fiscal       year, and a shutdown will certainly delay [the] training       [even further].    So what does that mean? Do you deploy without adequate training or  does the deployment date change? Families have planned around this.  Employers have planned around this. A government shutdown affects April  and her family.   Jennifer from Norfolk writes:         My husband is a USMC veteran who utilizes [the] VA. . . . A       government shutdown places an undue financial and emotional       burden on [my] family.    Kelsey from Harrisonburg wrote:         My parents, along with two friends, are on a 7-week post-      retirement [celebration] camping trip to visit National       Parks. [The park] closure would significantly . . . [affect]       this trip.    Katie from Fredericksburg, whose husband is a civilian DoD employee  wrote:         I work directly with families through the Head Start       program in Stafford County. A shutdown to include so many       important social services will be devastating to so many       families I see and serve every day.    It is interesting that Katie, whose own husband is a Federal  employee, does not write about her own family but writes about other  families relying on Head Start services.   Mary, who lives in Virginia, but whose husband is overseas in Foreign  Service, writes:         It's a huge problem for my family to go without pay for an       unknown period of time. I have a son with a chronic illness       whose medications are very expensive. This could impact our       ability to purchase his . . . medications. As a foreign       service family, we spend every day representing our nation       and making sacrifices on behalf of our nation. We hope that       Congress will do the same and work hard to resolve the issue       before the deadline later this week.    Lauren from Glen Allen, near where I live in Richmond, wrote and  shared that government shutdowns are a reason she has lost faith in the  system. In a letter to my office, she wrote:         My family and I purchased plane tickets to visit Utah about       6 months ago. Our entire itinerary is to visit National Parks       . . . and it is heartbreaking to realize now that on the cusp       of our trip--    They are supposed to leave on September 30--       we may not get to visit the locations and hike the trails       that we have been looking forward to for [many] months now.       It may seem like a trivial matter to you, but we saved money       for over a year and [we] managed our own household budget in       order to afford this trip. Now Congress is on the verge of       ruining it.    Amber from Williamsburg wrote:         We recently PCSd--    That is the military phrase for moving to a new duty station--       and a shutdown could not only cost us my husband's paycheck,       but it would also delay the reimbursement from our       personally procured move. We could face missing payments       on the [credit] card we used to pay for our move and my       husband's student loan, taken out so he can pursue a       degree he needed for [a] promotion. Not to mention that he       will continue to work, doing the job of many more that       will be furloughed until a resolution is agreed upon. We       are a family that has served this country for generations,       and we are still serving, but I am hesitant to encourage       my son that dreams of enlisting to pursue a career for a       country that is so quick to ignore the needs of its       military families.    Cheryl from Centreville writes:         My husband's business will be affected, as he has several       government contracts. He will be required by law to pay his       employees, whether he receives government funding or not. I       also have several friends who will be required to keep       working without pay, just as they did last time--and the time       before that. They have families to feed.    Tracy from Virginia Beach, who recently relocated to Virginia from  California, is worried about how a shutdown will impact relocation and  the ability to pay bills. She wrote:         My family . . . has experienced government shutdowns       previously. My husband has been a federal employee since       2005. It always creates stress and worry and having to figure       out how to pay basic expenses while he has to work without       pay.    Lori from Falls Church writes:         As an active duty military family whose income depends on a       government job, a shutdown will have a real and lasting       impact on our family. The government shutdown affects our       ability to pay our mortgage, to pay for groceries, medical       expenses . . . the struggle is [very] real. . . . We have had       some extra medical expenses from an illness my son has that       Tricare won't cover. . . . This is just too much pressure on       active duty families.    Yesterday, I met with the director of the Shenandoah National Park.  He told me that there are many couples who have weddings planned for  this weekend and the following weeks, during the most beautiful month  of the year in the Shenandoah National Park. And they are ringing the  phone off the hook at the Shenandoah National Park office. They asked  what will happen if that park closes and their weddings can't go  forward as planned.   This might seem like a minor one compared to people who have medical  bills or in whose businesses they have to keep paying their employees  when they are not getting paid. This is supposed to be the happiest day  of your life. It is supposed to be the happiest day of your life. And  because the House wants to backtrack on a spending deal they just  reached a few months ago and they are unwilling to act in the same  bipartisan manner that the Senate is acting in, these couples, who are  going to pledge themselves to each other for the rest of their life,  now, don't know whether their weddings will go forward.   Some politicians out there are saying shutdowns aren't that bad. I  can assure you these 600 people--and they are writing in, more every  day, and it will only get more intense--what they are saying tells you:  Don't believe those who say a shutdown isn't a problem.   More than 100,000 Virginians would either be furloughed or forced to  work  [[Page S4706]]  without pay. And while I am proud of the fact that we worked together  to get this backpay guarantee, in an extended shutdown, a backpay  doesn't pay the grocery bills, doesn't pay the medical bills, doesn't  pay the rent bills. You might be able to take the guarantee to a  landlord or to a school that needs a tuition payment and get them to  cut you a break. But in an extended shutdown, a backpay guarantee,  though OK, is not the same as getting your paycheck.   A shutdown affects us in so many ways. The SBA has to stop approving  or modifying small business loans. The FDA delays food inspections.  That is not a good thing. Air traffic controllers and TSA agents are  working without pay, which in the past has contributed to significant  flight delays all across the country. Nutrition benefits are  potentially at risk in an extended shutdown, programs that help food  insecure Virginian kids put food on the table.   I mentioned my Shenandoah National Park example. October is the  busiest month of the year for Virginia communities that surround our  National Parks, especially the Shenandoah National Park and the  Chincoteague National Seashore and National Wildlife Refuge. These  small communities that surround these two beautiful natural assets have  reoriented their economies around tourism, and October is the peak  season, especially in Shenandoah. This is not just the park itself and  weddings that would take place in the park. This is the outdoor  outfitters and the hotels and the B&Bs and the restaurants and diners  that are in these small communities that surround these National Parks.  This is their busy season. They count on this month of October as being  the way they will have a successful year or an unsuccessful year. And  if you shut down--because we saw this in October 2013--we have seen  this before. If you shut down right at this time of year, they lose  business that they will never get back, because the people who want to  go in the peak of leaf season to have a vacation with their family,  when the park reopens, maybe in a couple of weeks or a month, they are  not going to say: OK, the leaves are all brown in November, but let's  go. No, they are not going to do it. And so these small businesses  don't recoup the revenue they lost during their busiest time of the  year.   So whether it is closed parks or people who can't have a wedding or  whether it is military members or Foreign Service overseas or people  stressing about medical bills, this affects every ZIP Code, every last  crossroads in this country, and it affects hundreds of thousands of  Americans who are living abroad, serving this Nation in other  countries, whether they be serving in the military or in a civilian  capacity.   And, most of all, it is completely unnecessary. The President and the  Speaker came to a bipartisan, bicameral agreement. It was voted  positively in the House. It was voted positively here.   The only reason we are here is that a small but loud minority of  House GOP Members who didn't like the deal that we reached, who voted  against it, are now trying to use the leverage of shutting down the  government of the greatest Nation on Earth to try to get their way.   I don't know if you noticed one thing they did earlier today. The  Members who were loudly in the House, fighting in many instances for  shutdown, cast a vote to reduce the salary of the Secretary of Defense,  Lloyd Austin, to $1. This is the complete lack of seriousness with  which these Members are taking this issue. The head of the American  military? I am on the Armed Services Committee. One of my kids is a  marine reservist. Somebody overseeing the military of the most  important nation on Earth, a nation that has, through leadership,  inspired the democracies of the world to link arms and stand up against  an illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia--the United States has forged  a global coalition, and on the verge of a shutdown that would hurt our  military members, what is the House doing? Are they even sending us  legislation? They can't get their act together to do that. But in a  voice vote earlier today, they could get their act together, in the  middle of the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, to suggest  that the salary of the Secretary of Defense should be reduced to $1 a  year.   The biggest threats we face as a nation are not external to this  Nation's borders. They are exemplified by the dysfunction that we are  seeing with the House majority that refuses to abide by a deal they  just voted on, who would put our military and all others--all other  citizens--at risk.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to salute the Society  for Human Resource Management, known today simply by its initials SHRM.   For 75 years, SHRM has contributed to opportunity in our Nation's  workforce. The human resource profession emerged in the early 20th  century and was known as ``Personnel Administration,'' as personnel  departments over time began developing hiring procedures and employee  handbooks to manage personnel according to fair, consistent policies.  In 1948, the American Society for Personnel Administration--ASPA--was  born. By 1950, ASPA had 130 members and launched Personnel News, which  eventually became HR Magazine and remains one of the Nation's longest  running association publications. In 1954, the term ``human resources''  emerged, reinforcing the value of the profession. In 1964, ASPA  launched a nationwide student chapter program, which today hosts  chapters at more than 200 colleges and universities. This period also  saw the creation of SHRM's research arm to advance higher standards of  performance in personnel administration. SHRM Research is now a leader  in studies focused on the intersection of people and work.   In 1966, the association created the ASPA Foundation to mobilize  members for positive change. Today, the SHRM Foundation supports  initiatives on topics like mental health and wellness, inclusive  workplaces, and military veterans. In 1968, as ASPA turned 20, its  leaders made a commitment to articulate a defined body of HR knowledge.  The ASPA Accreditation Institute was born; in 1976, the first HR  certification exam was given to 80 test takers, and today, more than  120,000 people are SHRM-certified.   In 1973, ASPA opened its first DC office, and that same year and for  the first time, ASPA provided testimony in a congressional hearing on  pending legislation, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.   In 1984, with national legislation becoming a growing focus for ASPA  the association moved its national headquarters to Alexandria, VA.  Today, SHRM has approximately 275 Alexandria-based employees located on  its multibuilding campus, with another 75 employees across the United  States. SHRM has 18 chapters throughout Virginia and approximately  11,148 Virginia human resource professionals and business executives  who play an active role in this vibrant trade association. SHRM  Government Affairs has since become the go-to source for workplace  legislative and legal issues. Today, the SHRM Advocacy Team includes  more than 17,000 HR professionals in all 435 congressional districts  who inform public officials on how legislation will impact employers  and employees. Today, SHRM has offices in eight locations worldwide  servicing members in 165 countries.   Finally, in 2020, the HR profession faced its biggest challenge  ever--and rose to the moment. The COVID-19 pandemic gave HR  professionals the opportunity to lead their organizations through every  phase of the public health crisis and helped inform businesses and  policymakers on the changing landscape of work and offer thoughtful  advice on the evolving human resources issues brought on by the  pandemic.   Over the past 75 years, SHRM has become the voice of all things work.  Their long history of advocacy before State and local government and 50  years of advocacy of workforce policy before the Congress, Federal  Agencies, and the executive branch in the United States. Today, I  salute the association and its 325,000 members for their positive  impact on our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I want to discuss legislation I am  introducing, the Modernizing the Federal Calendar Act.   This bill would shift the start of each fiscal year from October 1 to  January 1 and, in doing so, align the deadline for appropriations with  the deadline that Congress typically sees as the real target. This bill  would eliminate the risk of government shutdowns in October, reduce the  time spent on CRs, and lead to a higher probability of completing  government funding work on time.   Congress's recurring reliance on continuing resolutions, CRs, to  temporarily fund the government from the start of the fiscal year until  the winter holidays poses significant challenges for Federal Agencies  due to delays to contracts, grants, and hiring while operating under  CRs. Even if Congress misses the December 31 deadline, changing the  fiscal calendar will still yield benefits, as it will give Federal  Agencies more time to enact the appropriations bills once passed and  eliminate the annual uncertainty around a short-term CR in September  among Agencies, government employees, and industries that rely on  government operations.   In addition, Americans are forced to worry about a potential  government shutdown if Congress can't reach an agreement on a year-long  government funding bill or CR, creating unnecessary stress and  uncertainty for the millions of Americans who work for or with the  Federal Government, as well as the countless people and small  businesses that rely on full-scale government operations and services.  Starting  [[Page S4724]]  the fiscal year on January 1 will not end the possibility of shutdowns,  but it will eliminate need to pass a CR by October 1 to fund the  government and help ensure that Congress passes government funding  bills without a shutdown.   Today, as the Federal Government rapidly approaches the end of the  fiscal year, I am reminded that Congress has never passed all 12  appropriations bills by the October 1 deadline during my entire time in  the Senate. Since the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974  updated the start of the fiscal year from July 1 to October 1, there  have only been 4 years where Congress has passed yearlong government  funding bills by October 1. The last time Congress did so was for  fiscal year 1997. This trend makes clear that Congress already sees the  December holidays as the real deadline and that the time to improve the  certainty and reliability of the appropriations process is now.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I want to discuss legislation I am  introducing, the Modernizing the Federal Calendar Act.
