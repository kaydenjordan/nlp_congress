 Madam President, I am on the floor today with Senator  Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire to join in a colloquy regarding what  is happening in Ukraine. This is the 20th time in so many weeks that I  have come to the floor to talk about the illegal, unprovoked, and  brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia.   Today, I look forward to being with my colleague Senator Shaheen, a  member of the Ukraine Caucus and someone with whom I have traveled to  Ukraine and also to the border of Ukraine and Poland to meet with the  refugees.   Senator Shaheen is going to talk, I think, a little about how we got  to where we are and what we do going forward. I was also recently made  aware of the fact that we are going to take up the NATO ratification  vote today. And this is to have the United States approve the addition  of Sweden and Finland to the NATO alliance. This is great for the  alliance. It is great for the United States. And I believe it is also-- otherwise, they wouldn't be interested--very good for the people of  Finland and Sweden.   They add a lot to the NATO alliance. They are militarily and  economically in a position to be valuable contributors. They also, in  the case of Finland, share the largest land border with Russia of any  country. They have understandable concerns with what they see happening  in Ukraine.   I just believe it is very much in our national security interests and  the interests of people I represent to have, in addition, even further  strengthening of the NATO alliance through the addition of these two  partners.   Vladimir Putin thought he was going to split NATO apart when he began  his invasion of Ukraine, I believe. And today, he is finding just the  opposite has happened. NATO has come together in ways we have never  seen. And we now have, again, the addition of two very strong members  of NATO who are longtime allies of the United States and will add  significantly to the NATO alliance.   With regard to Ukraine, let's start with a little history. Ukrainians  have faced adversity from Russia for hundreds of years. This is not new  to them. Russia's oppression of Ukraine is not a 21st century issue.  For 300 years, under the brutal rule of the Russian czars, Ukrainians  were subjected to repeated efforts to stamp out their language, their  culture, and their identity.   In January of 1918, Ukrainians got their first taste of national  freedom. While Russia was dealing with the chaos of the Bolshevik  Revolution, Ukraine declared its independence from the Russian Empire.  Unfortunately, this freedom was short-lived. Just a few years later,  the Bolsheviks conquered Ukraine and subsumed it into the Soviet Union.   As an unwilling member of the Soviet Empire, Ukrainians suffered  horrific atrocities at the hands of their Soviet overlords. In 1932 and  again in 1933, the Stalinist regime confiscated grain harvests across  Ukraine and imposed a premeditated manmade famine against the people of  Ukraine. This horrific atrocity is known as the Holodomor. Millions of  men, women, and children were starved to death in a deliberate effort  to break the Ukrainian nation's resistance to communist occupation.  Stalin even ordered the borders of the country to be sealed to prevent  anyone from escaping this manmade starvation and to prevent the  delivery of any international food aid.   In 2018, Senator Durbin and I introduced a resolution to commemorate  the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor and to recognize the Commission  on the Ukraine Famine's findings that the Holodomor was a genocide--no  question.   I am grateful to Senator Shaheen, Senator Tillis, and others who are  in the Chamber today for cosponsoring that resolution. It passed in  October of 2018 unanimously here in the U.S. Senate.   The Holodomor failed to extinguish the Ukrainian people's identity,  as hard as they tried, but it was not the end of the Soviet oppression.  In the 1970s, the Soviet leadership imposed a crackdown on Ukrainian  intellectuals and those with any sort of leanings toward independence  or toward the West. The prisons and gulags became filled with Ukrainian  political prisoners as the Soviet Union once again tried to assault  Ukrainian identity.   But then, in 1991, after years of oppression, Ukraine finally broke  away from its Russian rulers for good. Ukraine declared its  independence on August 24 that year, and in December, the declaration  was confirmed by a referendum in which over 90 percent of  [[Page S3884]]  the Ukrainian people voted in favor of independence.   This chart shows the amazing response of the people of Ukraine to  that. Ninety-five percent of the people in the Kyiv area, as you can  see, supported independence.   By the way, Russians often say that Crimea really was not part of  Ukraine. Well, more than half of the people in Crimea were for  independence as well. But Russia's crimes against the people of Ukraine  continue to this day.   Last week, a video was circulated online of a Russian soldier  torturing and mutilating a Ukrainian prisoner. Unfortunately, it is not  an isolated incident. After this, the Ukrainian soldier was shot dead  and dragged with a rope into a shallow grave by his Russian captors.   We have all seen the pictures from Bucha--people assassinated, people  with their hands tied behind their back. Elsewhere in Ukraine, a  Russian missile attack struck a prison in Donetsk that was housing  Ukrainian prisoners of war. This chart shows that prison and the fact  that it was attacked by missiles.    Many of these soldiers were involved in the heroic defense of the  Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol. They held out for weeks against  Russian assaults on the plant. At least 40 Ukrainian POWs, maybe more,  were killed in this assault. These are POWs. These were soldiers who  were lawful prisoners of war, supposedly protected by the Geneva  Convention. Russia's murder of these POWs is a war crime. And Russia  must be held accountable for this and all its countless crimes in  Ukraine.   But following its usual playbook, Russia is spreading massive amounts  of disinformation regarding this incident and so many others. They  claim that the Ukrainian forces killed these prisoners as a way to  discourage other soldiers from surrendering.   This, of course, is nonsense. Among other things, Ukraine needs the  manpower. Why would they kill their own soldiers instead of getting  them back in a prisoner swap that everybody assumed was going to  happen? It makes little sense, but it has never stopped Russia from  propagating lies to deflect blame from its own crimes. And,  unsurprisingly, the Red Cross still has not been granted access to the  site by Russia, which clearly needs more time to cover up the evidence  of its involvement before they allow any kind of inspection. Let the  Red Cross in.   Those responsible for these atrocities must be held to account. This  is one reason why Senator Shaheen and I last week cosponsored a  resolution to recognize what is happening in Ukraine as genocide.   Across the country, Ukrainian women and children have been subjected  to indiscriminate Russian missile strikes and airstrikes. It has killed  thousands of innocents; not combatants, noncombatants--children.   A few weeks ago, I spoke about little Liza, a 4-year-old girl with  autism who was killed by a Russian missile strike in Vinnytsia. When  Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska was in town a couple of weeks ago,  she spoke about a 3-year-old boy who just learned how to use a  prosthetic. Imagine that, an innocent 3-year-old boy who has been  forced to learn how to use a prosthetic limb because of a Russian  airstrike on civilian targets.   These stories are hard to hear and hard to tell, but the world must  know about them. This is the reality that all Ukrainians are facing.  Unsurprisingly, the people of Ukraine are responding to these  atrocities. A possible Ukrainian counteroffensive may be unfolding in  the south, in the direction of Kherson. We have heard about this in the  popular media.   Kherson is here. It is near the Black Sea Port of Odesa. This  southern part of Ukraine is incredibly important for Ukraine's economy,  and Russia knows that.   Remember, Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall to the  Russian forces after Russia's full-scale invasion began in February of  this year. But now, Ukrainian soldiers are conducting missile strikes  against Russian military infrastructure in the area to weaken Russia's  defenses. They are also conducting limited ground attacks and  liberating parts of this territory that Russia has illegally taken. You  can see that in light blue.   The significance of recapturing Kherson cannot be overestimated. It  would undo one of Russia's earliest successes in the war. It is also  important that Ukraine regain control of much of its Black Sea coast as  possible. This is the Ukrainian economy's primary connection to the  rest of the world. Russia, of course, has sought to capture this  coastline in order to economically strangle Ukraine.   We talked last week about what they are doing in Odesa. They finally  decided they were going to let ships come out of Odesa, and they made  an agreement that they would not continue to bomb Odesa and certainly  not bomb any port facilities. Within 12 hours, they bombed port  facilities in Odesa. That is how much the Russian commitment meant. But  a ship finally has sailed from Odesa, and we hope many more will go.   If Ukraine is successful in its efforts here in the south, it will  undermine President Putin and his attempts to make a Russian victory in  Ukraine, something that the Russians say is inevitable.   While Ukraine is making progress in the south, Russia is laying the  groundwork to try to annex occupied land, particularly in the east, in  this area near Donetsk.   Occupation means that the Russians themselves are distributing  Russian passports, paying salaries in Russian rubles, and expediting  Russian citizens for Ukrainian citizens. There are reports that Russia  will stage a sham referendum in this area to try to legitimize their  illegal annexation.   Senior Kremlin officials have warned Russia will never leave areas of  Kherson, in the south here, where Russian forces have been occupying  the territory. Before the invasion, these cities were home to more than  2.5 million Ukrainians in this area--2.5 million Ukrainians.    One prominent Kremlin propagandist said:         Ukraine as it was cannot continue to exist.    This person continued.         There will not be the Ukraine that we have known for many       years. It won't be Ukraine any longer.    Clearly, that is the Russian intent. Vladimir Putin has said his  ambition is even more. It is to fully restore the borders of the old  Soviet Union. We must make sure he knows that Ukraine in 2022 is not  Ukraine of 1921, which the Russian Bolsheviks conquered and forced into  the Soviet empire.   We know how to help Ukraine to keep this from happening. It is to  provide them what they need to defend themselves. We have recently  provided Ukraine with what we call High Mobility Artillery Systems, or  HIMARS. Many of us have been advocating for that. We are glad to see  that there are some HIMARS now in the theater. These have been critical  to the recent Ukrainian military successes.   So this Congress has made a difference. We provided funding. We have  gotten some equipment into the area that the Ukrainians need to be able  to defend themselves and to have some sort of a level playing field  with Russia's much bigger Army.   Officials have said that with the help of these HIMARS, Ukraine has  taken out Russian high-value targets and destroyed them and saved  countless Ukrainian lives. These include ammunition depots and targets  from long distances. HIMARS have also conducted many of these strikes  in southern Ukraine, I talked about earlier, to make progress here in  the Kherson area.   Russians have similar long-range artillery that previously allowed  them to fire on Ukrainian forces with impunity. They could sit back and  fire and level cities and kill civilians and kill Ukrainian military  personnel. But they couldn't be reached by the Ukrainians. Now the  Ukrainians have taken themselves out of that danger zone because these  HIMARS can balance the playing field and have that longer range and the  accuracy they need.   I think there are about 15 in theater now. There are also a few from  Germany and a few from the UK. But they need more. They said they need  40 to 50 and the munitions to be able to make them effective. That is  something that we should be focused on. We should be focused on  providing them, again, what they need to actually win this conflict.   I believe we also have to continue to provide the Ukrainians with  other weapons as well, including the Army Tactical Missile System, or  the ATACMS. This missile, which can be  [[Page S3885]]  launched from the same HIMARS launchers that we have already been  giving to Ukraine, has a longer range of 300 kilometers.   In a war like this one that is increasingly becoming an artillery  duel, range is a decisive factor. These missiles would allow Ukraine to  turn the tables on the Russians, whereas Ukraine used to be outranged  by the Russian artillery. With the ATACMS missiles, we would be able to  help Ukraine be able to strike important Russian targets with impunity  themselves.   This is important because Ukraine is now using these weapons in this  counteroffensive in Kherson. The Institute for the Study of War--a  think tank here in Washington, DC--has said recently this offensive to  take out Russia is in the works, and Ukrainians are using HIMARS to  strike targets effectively 50 miles away. It is helping. We made a  difference.   Former security adviser to the Ukrainian Government Alexander Khara  told Newsweek the state of Russian morale in the south means a  counteroffensive ``has an excellent chance of success.''   He continued.         The Russians suffer from poor morale, logistical troubles,       and the horror of HIMARS.    So the evidence is clear as to why we should continue to send them  weapons they need to be able to not just survive but to win this  conflict.   By the way, we have hundreds of HIMARS in our stocks that are  currently not with Active units. So we have the ability to help more.   This war has now crossed over the 5-month mark. Since before the  invasion began, I have come to this floor a number of times to talk  about what needs to be done, as has Senator Shaheen, as have others. I  have mentioned the fact that we sent billions in military aid and  humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and that it is working.  Particularly, as we see with some of these new weapons, it is making a  difference.   It will help these brave warriors and their most vulnerable  noncombatants--the kids and the children--be able to survive and be  able, in the case of the military, to be able to start making progress  to push out the Russian invaders.   Democrats and Republicans alike have sounded the alarm with  bipartisan pushes and legislation to help Ukraine. We have urged--with  success, by the way--that the United States cut off our own Russian oil  and gas. We are now urging the Europeans to do the same.   We have talked about the need for more weapons, for more sanctions,  to remove all of Russia's banks' access to the global financial  system--or the SWIFT system--to suspend our tax treaty with Moscow, to  explore options to remove other tax benefits, and to remove access to  the U.S. market.   All of this is necessary, on the military side, the humanitarian  side, the economic side, and the sanctions side in order to have a  victory. I fear sometimes with regard to the military assistance that  we have been doing too little, too late.   We can't continue to do too little, too late. This is a struggle. It  is a struggle between freedom and democracy and the right of self- determination on the one hand and on the other hand, Russian aggression  unprovoked, a brutal conquest, authoritarianism, and tyranny.   President Putin's ambitions lie well beyond Ukraine. We must continue  to show him the West continues to stand united. We need to show Ukraine  the world stands with them. This is why it is so important that Sweden  and Finland have chosen to join NATO, and we must support them in that.   All this, by the way, transcends the political spectrum, and I have  certainly seen that. Senator Shaheen and I have shown that in our work  to aid Ukraine. It is not a political issue. It is not a Republican or  Democrat issue. We are stepping up in support of our democratic ally  together.   As the fight rages on, the perseverance and self-determination of  Ukrainians seem to grow even stronger. We have seen their resilience in  the face of daily bombardments. We have seen their resilience in the  face of Russia's broken promises when, counter to their commitments,  Russia has attacked ports, as I said, and humanitarian corridors.   The Ukrainian people are fighting for their homeland, for their  families, for their freedom. It is impressive and inspiring to see what  they are doing.   The Senate is going to break for an August recess here in the next  few days. Even though we won't be on the floor every week to continue  to fight for the Ukrainian people, we will do so with our work back  home, with getting more people engaged and involved in America to help  on the humanitarian side. We will continue to promote the fact that the  U.S. national security interest is served by helping freedom and  democracy.   I want to note something President Zelenskyy said recently in an  address to the people of Ukraine. He said:         Strategically, Russia has no chance of winning this war.       And it is necessary to hold on, so that even at the tactical       levels, the terror state feels its defeat. No matter what       happens and no matter what the occupiers' plans are, we must       do our job, protect our state and take care of each other.    Let's help Ukraine finish this mission, protect their state, their  democracy, and take care of each other. Let's give Ukraine the tools it  needs to be able to do that. After these months of fighting and giving  aid, the West must not falter during Ukraine's dire time of need. We  must be there through victory for the Ukrainian people--victory for  self-determination, victory for freedom.   I yield to my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, my  partner in this effort.    Madam President, I yield back my time.
