 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support fully funding the  CHIP Act, but to oppose to the Republican bill.   Because of the reduction in the grace period, we are forcing  Americans to go into their own pocket. Although this bill will  reauthorize CHIP, it fails to show compassion for the low-income  families and children who do not have access to critical healthcare,  and it is a matter of life and death.   CHIP's impact is overwhelmingly felt in communities of color.  Together, CHIP and Medicaid help cover 52 percent of Hispanic and 54  percent of all Black children nationwide.   As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect our Nation's  children. We need to support the millions of families who rely on this  vital program. This is not the right way. We need to work together in a  bipartisan manner to pass an important piece of legislation like CHIP  and not take away from our children but support them.
