 Mr. Speaker, so many people in this world are focused  on: What's in it for me?   Not Officer Sean Gannon. Sean was a giver. His life was defined by  his focus on serving and helping others.   Sean was taken from us last Thursday in an act of violence that  shocked our sensibilities and broke all of our hearts.   In his early years, he gave to his community in New Bedford, his  classmates at All Saints School, and then his classmates at Bishop  Stang High School in North Dartmouth. He gave to his college mates as  he prepared for his lifetime goal of becoming a police officer at  Westfield State and Mass Maritime Academy.   He gave to the communities in preparation of this at Westfield and  Nantucket working there as a police officer and began his real career  at Stonehill College, working to support and help students there,  keeping them safe, and working with one of his mentors and friends,  former Police Chief Peter Carnes.   He gave as a Big Brother to a young boy through the Big Brothers Big  Sisters Program of Cape Cod and the Islands, and that young boy now  wants to grow up and be a police officer just like Sean.    He gave to the children he visited in the schools as a police officer  accompanied most often by his partner and canine friend, Nero.   He gave to his friends and his second family at the Yarmouth Police  Department where he is loved and missed dearly.   Sean gave the greatest love to his parents, Patrick and Denise; his  brother and sister; his family; and particularly to his wife, Dara, who  shared in the spirit of giving as she conducted her work in the Cape  Cod Foundation with helping over 250 charities. Sean and Dara were a  fixture at every charitable event on Cape Cod.   Ultimately, he gave his life--the ultimate sacrifice--to protect us  and protect others from a dangerous and violent individual whom the  Yarmouth Police Chief Frank Frederickson said would have clearly taken  another life had Sean not intervened.   Sean is a hero. He is one of us. He is much more than that. He is  someone we aspire to be, a giver, whose love for others will continue  to inspire us.   There was a vigil last Saturday in the town of Yarmouth,  Massachusetts, where 1,000 people showed up to pay tribute to Sean.  Tomorrow he will be laid to rest joined by several thousand who will  gather together to pay tribute and share love with him.   God bless Officer Sean Gannon. May he rest in peace. May his soul and  spirit continue to live among us and inspire us.                            ____________________
