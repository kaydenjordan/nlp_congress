 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  support of the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan.   In Arizona and across the Southwest, communities have struggled  through a 19-year-long drought. During my time in the State  legislature, I spent years working with Republicans and Democrats alike  to create Arizona's first conservation, drought, and statewide water  management plans. It cannot be understated how hard Arizona has worked  to implement a drought program that ensures our State continues to have  access to the Colorado River and other instate water sources.   I am pleased to see the resulting plan was passed earlier this year.  Now it is our turn. This legislation will complete the process by  directing the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements with  each of the seven Colorado River Basin States and it will ensure that  water conservation efforts can begin quickly.   The sooner we get these agreements signed, the sooner we can address  the water issues across the region.   I applaud the great work being done here in Washington and in the  seven States impacted by this drought contingency plan to put forward  innovative solutions to protect our precious water assets.   It is important to remember that we are not done. We must continue  these conversations and work together to manage our rivers in ways that  allow cities to grow, ensure farmers and ranchers are successful, and  keep our obligations to Native American Tribes and Nations.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this important legislation.
