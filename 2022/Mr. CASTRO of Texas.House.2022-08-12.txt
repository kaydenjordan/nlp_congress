 Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of great things in  this legislation. I want to focus on one thing that is important for  San Antonio.   In 2019, my county, Bexar County, had the second-highest death toll  from diabetes. My grandmother died from diabetes. My mom is diabetic. I  remember going with my grandmother, and she would inject insulin into  herself. Sometimes she had trouble paying for it and spent days,  sometimes several days, at the hospital.   There are so many people--senior citizens--in this country who will  benefit from the fact that we are capping insulin costs at $35 a month  and prescription drug costs, humble, hardworking people who don't ask a  lot from us or their government but will benefit incredibly from this  legislation.   I say thank you to everybody who supported it and who is getting it  across the finish line. It is going to be great for the country.
