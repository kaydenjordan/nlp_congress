 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair DeLauro for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is with mixed feelings that I rise in support of  today's short-term continuing resolution.   Once again, we need the means to keep the Federal Government's lights  on, make certain Social Security offices function, and ensure national  parks remain open to all.   The American people deserve better performance from their elected  leaders. We are in the middle of a global pandemic, and too many people  are unsure of whether they can keep their own lights on.   One bright spot in this bill is the inclusion of critical funding to  respond to Hurricane Ida and other devastations wrought by climate  change.   This legislation will provide $6 billion for the Army Corps of  Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the  [[Page H4590]]  Department of Energy to respond to these human and environmental  disasters.   The energy and water portion also contains commonsense, necessary  extensions to keep essential programs operating for the next several  weeks, and I support key provisions to responsibly lift the debt  ceiling.   Our Nation is still reeling from the GOP tax scam that blew up the  deficit while giving away billions of dollars to the top 1 percent. The  lack of action from our Senate Republican colleagues for the third year  in a row is deeply concerning. Nine bills still await committee  consideration, but Senate Republicans would rather block efforts to  help America build back better than do their jobs.   I commend Chairwoman DeLauro's leadership and Speaker Pelosi and  Majority Leader Hoyer for their prioritization and passage in the House  of 9 of our 12 appropriations spending bills, with all bills passed  through committee.   Gosh, Senate, come on. Catch up.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this continuing resolution.
