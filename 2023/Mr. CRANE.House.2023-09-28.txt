 Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 8 as the designee  of Mr. Biggs of Arizona.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in support of this  amendment that eliminates nearly $39 million in funding for the United  States Institute of Peace.   This institute funds programs located in several adversarial nations,  including China, Pakistan, and Russia.   Their mission is to combat violence and promote peace through  education. However, the institute covers issue areas such as gender  equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and climate policy--hardly topics related to  peace between nations.   The United States Institute of Peace claims to prioritize U.S.  national security while using U.S. funds to counsel and mitigate feuds  with known enemies of the United States.   The expenses of this institute, whose mission would be better  accomplished by nonprofits, charities, and religious groups, is an  undue burden on the American taxpayer.   Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of this amendment to prevent this  unnecessary funding, and work toward getting our fiscal house in order.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 10 as the  designee of Mr. Biggs of Arizona.    Mr. Chair, I rise this morning in support of this  amendment, which eliminates nearly $3 million in funding for the  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, salaries and  expenses.   This funding goes towards functions such as gender equality, and  there has even been a Gender Action Plan, a Gender Unit in the  Secretariat appointed a special representative to the Chairperson-in- Office on gender issues.                                time  1015    The work of this Commission would probably be better done by an  independent think tank than by a congressionally funded Commission.  With the current debt of the U.S. being $33 trillion, we must look for  ways to cut unnecessary spending. The work of this Commission is not  unique to it and similar consolation, if necessary, could be found in  third-party sources that do not affect the already distressed national  debt.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of my amendment to prevent this unnecessary  funding and work toward getting our fiscal house in order. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise this morning to offer my amendment to  the State and Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriation Act  which would reduce funding for USAID by 50 percent.   USAID was established over 60 years ago with the noble intention of  fostering the advancement of the developing world, a goal that could  benefit the United States by creating new trade partners and stable  neighbors. Unfortunately, current budget allocations at USAID indicate  a shift toward a social and cultural agenda that caters to the radical  priorities of woke global elites.   USAID has become a front for unelected bureaucrats to impose woke  nonsense and harmful agendas across the globe, all on the U.S.  taxpayers' dime. We shouldn't continue to fund this organization that  aims to undercut American values and objectives.   Cutting USAID's funding by 50 percent would dramatically conserve  taxpayer resources otherwise wasted abroad on programs that do little  to nothing to advance American interests. In fact, our core interests  are instead undermined by these programs that include climate change  alarmism and wasting money on ridiculous studies and programs that  promote distorted gender ideology.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to  prevent American tax dollars from being wasted on an Agency bent on  sabotaging our best efforts around the globe. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
