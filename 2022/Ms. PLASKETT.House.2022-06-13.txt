 Madam Speaker, in recognition of Caribbean American  Heritage Month, I honor influential Haitian leader Henri Christophe.   Born on the island of Grenada to immigrant parents, Christophe played  a significant role in the American Revolution, serving as a sergeant in  the French unit in Savannah, Georgia in 1780.   Christophe was among the 545 Haitian free slaves known as the  Fontages Legion, fighting for the freedom of men and women who desired  to be freed from the shackles of oppression.   After the French forces were defeated and Haiti was declared an  independent republic in 1803, Christophe was elected president of the  northern State of Haiti in 1807. He was responsible for the  construction of Citadelle Henry in Haiti, introduced a monetary system  based on gourds, declared Catholicism as a state religion, and  established schools and hospitals, including a basic school of  medicine.
