 Mr. Speaker, I just put this placard up to emphasize  what our Democratic Caucus is attempting to do. We have a program  called ``For the People,'' and we are trying to deal with the issues of  healthcare across this Nation.   We know, as do basically all the American public, that healthcare is,  in many cases, not affordable. So how can we deal with this?   Well, one way is to deal with the cost of prescription medicines. We  have a program. We have actually voted it off the floor. It is over in  the Senate where it will linger as the Grim Reaper, Senator McConnell,  kills legislation that would be for the people. So this is one example  of many that we Democrats are trying to address.   Back in 2010, we addressed this issue, at least in part, with the  Affordable Care Act, which was promptly called ObamaCare by our  Republican colleagues at that time. They campaigned against it and,  ultimately, succeeded in winning the House in the 2010 election, and  then spent 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 in an effort to  repeal the Affordable Care Act. Fortunately, they did not succeed.   When the new President, Mr. Trump, came to office, they tried, once  again, to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. They failed, largely  because a Senator from Arizona, who was then suffering from cancer,  voted no in the Senate. So I thank Senator McCain for having the  courage and the understanding of what it meant to have a preexisting  condition.                                time  1945    So here we are today with all kinds of charts that I am not going to  put up. I am just going to speak directly to this issue.   As was said just a moment ago by my colleague from Ohio, the  appellate court in New Orleans is taking up an issue that Republicans,  including the President, have put before the court. Unable to gain a  repeal in the Congress of the United States, they are now pursuing in  the courts of the land a repeal put forward by, I think, 16 attorneys  general--all Republicans--to use the courts to repeal the Affordable  Care Act.   I want us to understand what this means. The fight of the last 8  years, unsuccessfully, in the court of the people, the Congress and the  Senate of the United States, being unsuccessful, they are now  attempting in the courts of this land to do what they could not do  through the representatives of the people of the United States.   The cynical effort to do this actually began with the December 2017  tax cuts that the Republicans rammed through Congress without one  hearing: not a hearing in the Ways and Means Committee, not a hearing  in the Senate Committee on Finance, not a hearing at all.   Attached to that legislation was a repeal of the mandate that was in  the Affordable Care Act that every American must either purchase  insurance or have insurance through their employer. That repeal then  opened the door to the current attempt now in the appellate court in  New Orleans that could give rise to a decision that might ultimately be  made by the U.S. Supreme Court that would totally repeal all aspects of  the Affordable Care Act.   So what does this mean? Mr. Speaker, what does this mean for you and  me?   I hope you do not have a preexisting condition. I do, because I am  over 65, and 130 million Americans have a preexisting condition. The  repeal of the Affordable Care Act would remove the protections that  those Americans have that would guarantee them coverage without  discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, I was the insurance commissioner in California in the  early 1990s and again in 2002 to 2005. I know what it means when the  insurance companies discriminate based upon preexisting conditions. I  have seen the documents that they would require men and women to fill  out before they would issue a health insurance program.   Every conceivable issue that a human being would have, from high  blood pressure to, indeed, being a female, was on that list, and the  insurance companies had unilateral, total discretion to charge more or  not provide insurance at all.   So the President of the United States, at this moment, together with  those attorneys general and, apparently, the support of our Republican  colleagues are, at this moment, attempting to reestablish a burden on  130 million Americans who do have a preexisting condition, who are  protected but, if they have their way in court, would lose that  protection and face, once again, the onerous and, in many cases, deadly  burden of having a preexisting condition and not being able to get  healthcare insurance or having to pay several times more because of  their preexisting condition.   Who among us does not have that? Well, perhaps the other 40 percent-- actually, 50 percent of Americans who stand at risk of developing high  blood pressure, diabetes, or some other illness.   That is not all. In my district in the Sacramento Valley of  California, the Affordable Care Act has allowed the creation of what we  call Federally Qualified Health Centers, which now are the principal  providers of initial healthcare in my district.   It is not just for poor people, not just for transients who have  moved from one job to another, but for people who have been insured for  years but, because of a lack of medical services, could not get  insurance.   These Federally Qualified Health Centers are totally dependent upon  the Affordable Care Act. Repeal the Affordable Care Act and those  clinics are gone, and the services that they provide will not be in  communities, both urban and rural, across America.   How bad is it that those attorneys general are so stuck on repealing  ObamaCare that they are ignoring the reality that millions upon  millions of Americans have come to depend upon these clinics? If the  Affordable Care Act is found to be contrary to law and the Constitution  by the courts and by the cynical, diabolical repeal of one section of  the Affordable Care Act, those people will not be able to get primary  care services.   And that is not all. The Affordable Care Act expanded the Medicaid  program across this Nation, and some 15 million Americans have been  able to gain healthcare access through the Medicaid programs. In  California, we call it Medi-Cal. The Medi-Cal program in California  provides, perhaps, 3 million Californians with access to healthcare  services. That, too, the expansion will be gone, and the support for  States across this Nation will be eliminated if the Affordable Care Act  is found to no longer exist because of court action.   How cynical, how sad, how harmful, but that is what they are  pursuing. And that is not all. There is a problem that existed before  the Affordable Care Act.   Young men and women found coverage in some universities, in some jobs  through either the university and the fees or through an employer; but  most, when they became 18 years of age, lost their family insurance.  The Affordable Care Act said that is not good. They would be able to  stay on their family's insurance until the age of 26, where,  presumably, they would be better able to buy insurance themselves or be  able to have a job in which insurance would be provided.   Insurance is expensive, so the exchanges were set up across the  Nation, insurance exchanges where people could shop for insurance.  Those exchanges provided not only access to insurance markets, but they  also provided, through the Affordable Care Act, tax credits that would  make the insurance affordable to them.   Nope, it is going to be gone. It is going to disappear if the court  in New Orleans rules against the Affordable Care Act.  [[Page H5293]]    And so how will they afford insurance? Well, they won't. And in many  States where there are Federal exchanges--California not included,  because California set up its own State exchange. But in those States  that have a Federal exchange, it won't exist. The ability to shop for  insurance will be diminished or eliminated and, along with it, the  subsidies. So those people, some 9 million who now enjoy those  subsidies, will not receive them.    It goes on and on.   Are you a senior? Are you on Medicaid? If so, you are in the last  year in which the doughnut hole will no longer exist, beginning 4 years  ago. The doughnut hole, the prescription drugs doughnut hole in which  prior to the Affordable Care Act there was a subsidy, part D, for  prescription drugs, that ended at about $1,500 of prescription costs.   Then there was a doughnut hole in which the individual on Medicare  would have to pay for insurance, and that was somewhere around $4,000.  And then above that, Medicare would once again pick up the cost or most  of the cost.   In the Affordable Care Act, we specifically set up a system so that  over a 4-year period, the doughnut hole would disappear. It would  shrink each and every year. It would rise from $1,500 to $2,000,  $3,000, and so forth. And next year, it would be gone.   I am sorry for the seniors. The Affordable Care Act, if found by the  court to no longer be constitutional, would reemerge immediately upon  an action by either the appellate court or, I suppose, ultimately, the  Supreme Court. So, welcome the doughnut hole back.   If someone happens to be a senior, they better start pocketing  money--which I am sure they don't have, to begin with--to prepare for  the day when the cynical action of these attorneys general-- Republicans, every single one of them--and the President would once  again reestablish the awesome, terrible prescription drugs doughnut  hole.   How small-minded can you be? Apparently, there is no end to it. So  here we are. Our effort on this Democratic side of the aisle is for the  people, not for some ideological mumbo jumbo, but for the people. We  want a healthcare program that provides solid benefits for Americans.   The Affordable Care Act takes us a long, long way toward that goal.  It doesn't achieve it totally, and we have more to do. Many of us talk  about Medicare for All, and we hope to get there some day. But in the  meantime, we have the Affordable Care Act, and our Republican  colleagues are doing everything they can since its institution in 2010  to do away with it, and they have never, ever provided a substitute.   Do you remember that repeal and replacement mantra? There has never  been a replacement program that made any sense whatsoever.   So, we are for the people. We want to deal with the cost of  prescription drugs, not to increase them for seniors, as our Republican  colleagues are attempting to do; not to put Americans out of the  insurance market, as they are attempting to do, by eliminating the  guaranteed coverage regardless of your healthcare status; not to put  people out of insurance if they are 18 to 26 years of age, as our  Republican colleagues are attempting to do; not to eliminate the  clinics that millions upon millions of Americans now depend on for  their primary care, as our Republican colleagues are attempting to do.                                time  2000    We want it for the people. We want healthcare coverage for every  American. We want it to be affordable, and we want it to be available.   So here we are on a day in which the appellate court in New Orleans  is hearing from the President's lawyers in the Department of Justice  that 13 million Americans should lose their health coverage and that  130 million Americans should be, once again, facing insurance  discrimination because of an existing healthcare issue. We are hearing  from the President's lawyers that it is good to eliminate the clinics,  that it is good to eliminate the subsidies that some 9 million  Americans are able to get to so that they can afford insurance, and  that the exchanges that provide a marketplace for people to sort out  what kind of an insurance policy they want should be eliminated.   The President's lawyers are out there purposely harming Americans all  because the President has said we must repeal the ObamaCare program.   I am sorry. I disagree. I want Americans to have healthcare coverage.  I was an insurance commissioner for years, and I fought the insurance  companies every single day. Then I came here in 2009 and was able to  vote, providing on this floor the vote that allowed the Affordable Care  Act to move out of this House to the Senate and eventually become law-- the 218th vote. I am proud of that vote because I know from my personal  experience that the Affordable Care Act dealt with real problems that  Americans had and gave Americans a real opportunity to get healthcare  and to get healthcare services.   Here we are with the President of the United States actively this day  doing everything he could not achieve in the Congress but rather now in  the courts doing everything he can to harm Americans--how cynical, how  terrible, and how harmful. But that is where we are.   We will see what the court does. Hopefully, they will be sympathetic  to 130 million Americans, to 9 million Americans, to 15 million  Americans, to children, and to young adults 18 to 25. Maybe they will  be sympathetic. We will see what happens.   But if the Affordable Care Act is somehow through the courts repealed  and there is no replacement, then I want the American people to  understand who is responsible for the harm that will immediately be  inflicted upon Americans. It is our President and it is his colleagues  who have aided and abetted and who today in-State attorneys general are  arguing for the harm that will come to Americans.   We haven't given up the fight, and we will never give up the fight so  that every American has affordable health insurance, whatever that may  be.   We have come a long way with the Affordable Care Act, and we will  fight all along the way. Should we lose this battle, we are never, ever  going to give up our goal of providing quality, affordable healthcare  to every American.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
