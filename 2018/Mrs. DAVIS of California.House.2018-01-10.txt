 Mr. Speaker, college students everywhere  are enjoying the last days of vacation before heading back to school.  But for thousands of people, this break was spent trying to figure out  how to stay in the only home they have ever known.   There have been multiple stories of young DREAMers being detained  over this holiday break. These are stellar students who attend elite  schools, like UC San Diego and UC Berkeley. They are now sitting in  detention facilities, unable to go back to school and continue their  education.   Is this the America that our forefathers fought for, one where bright  students sit in detention facilities instead of classrooms, questioning  if they can ever make the contribution to our United States of America  that they dream of?   Mr. Speaker, I once again plead with you, with all due respect, to  please bring the Dream Act to the floor. The American people  overwhelmingly support it.                            ____________________
