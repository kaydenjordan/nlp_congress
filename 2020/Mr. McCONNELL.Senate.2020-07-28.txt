 Yesterday, Senate Republicans put forward the HEALS  Act, our framework for another round of historic relief for American  workers and families.   Our Nation stands at a challenging crossroads. We have one foot in  this pandemic and one foot in the recovery. We can't go back to April,  and until we have a vaccine, we can't go back to normal either. What  the American people need is smart, safe, and sustainable middle ground,  and they need Congress's help to construct it. That is exactly what our  major proposal would do.   Everyone knows that another rescue package will need to be bipartisan  to pass the Senate. So the question before the country is now really  quite simple: Are we going to see the versions of House and Senate  Democrats that helped us unanimously pass the CARES Act back in March,  or are we, instead, going to see the same Democrats who decided to  block police reform in June and lash out at Senator Tim Scott's  proposal instead of working with him to make law? In other words, do  the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader believe that  struggling Americans deserve an outcome, or do they want to stay on the  sidelines and recite talking points?   Well, yesterday, even before the Democrats had seen our legislation,  [[Page S4516]]  they began attacking it. All the tired, old partisan tropes were  trotted out. Before releasing a proposal that wants to give schools  even more reopening money than the House Democrats' bill and which  would continue additional unemployment benefits at eight times the  dollar amount Democrats established during the last crisis, we were  informed here on the floor that ``those Republican hard-right money  people . . . don't want the Federal Government to help anybody.''   This is beyond parody.   Republicans put forward a trillion-dollar proposal for kids, jobs,  and healthcare, including direct cash to households, and even more cash  to unemployed people. And the Democrats say it proves we don't want to  help people. They say it proves we don't want to help people. These are  not serious statements. It is politics as usual, with talking points  that went stale 20 years ago.   But the week is young and the HEALS Act is full of provisions I  would, frankly, dare my Democratic colleagues to actually say they  oppose.   Republicans want to extend supplemental unemployment insurance at  hundreds of dollars per week. If Democrats block legislation, it will  stop all together.   Republicans want to send thousands of dollars more to American  families through direct payments. If Democrats will not come to the  table, they will get nothing.   Republicans want to use tax incentives to encourage the rehiring of  laid-off workers and the creation of safer workplaces through things  like testing, remodeling, and PPE. If Democrats block action, workers  will be on their own.   Republicans want to specifically protect Medicare seniors from a  spike in premiums because of COVID. If Democrats treat the HEALS Act  the way they treated police reform, seniors will be on their own as  well.   Republicans want to pour money into K-12 schools and give greater  flexibility to childcare providers so America's kids can have a safe  but more normal school year. If Democrats block action, school  districts will get none of us.   Republicans want to create a second targeted round of PPE to keep  small businesses above water. If Democrats will not negotiate, the  ``now open'' signs will come down and the ``going out of business''  signs will replace them.   Republicans want to proactively expand our domestic manufacturing  capability for masks and PPE and medical countermeasures. If Democrats  refuse to negotiate, we will be just as dependent on adversaries as  competitors in the next crisis.   Republicans want to protect doctors, nurses, school districts, and  universities from a second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits. If Democrats  don't come to the table, our Nation's reopening will be at the mercy of  trial lawyers.   Republicans want to go even further to backstop hospitals and  healthcare providers and fuel the sprint for vaccines. If Democrats  will not let us, Americans will just have to cross our fingers and hope  the medical system remains stable.   To be clear, Republicans are not proposing to ``cut'' any relief.  Under current law, expanded UI expires and is replaced with nothing.  Under current law, there are no more direct payments and no second PPP.  Every single thing we put forward is a way to get more relief into  people's hands.   Our Democratic colleagues want to pretend it is controversial,  somehow, that taxpayers should not pay people more not to work than  people who do go back to work. They want to pretend it is controversial  that taxpayers should not pay people more not to work than people who  do go back to work? The American people don't call it a controversy.  They call it common sense. They call it basic fairness.   This is absolutely a time to be generous and provide additional  Federal relief to people who have been laid off, but we should not be  redistributing money away from the essential workers who have remained  at their posts.   We should not be taxing somebody who has been stocking shelves for  months so the government can pay their neighbor more than she makes to  sit at home. That is what we are talking about--taxing essential  workers to pay their neighbors a bonus to stay home.   One study by university economists just found these benefits can  exceed people's previous incomes two-thirds of the time. They found a  medium recipient earns 134 percent of their prior salary. That means  half are making even more than that. That is just not fair. It is not  compatible with a reopening economy and more than 6 in 10 Americans  feel this creates a disincentive to work.   Even the Democratic House majority leader said just this morning that  our perspective ``has some validity to it and we have to deal with that  . . . it's not $600 or bust.'' That was the majority leader in the  House. The Democratic majority leader in the House said: ``It's not  $600 or bust.'' So let's get past these partisan cheap shots and have  an adult conversation.   Look at it this way. Think about one street, one block in one  neighborhood, anywhere in America. Think how they would benefit if this  bill were signed into law. Right now, several families on that block  probably have no idea whether their kids will be heading back to school  in a few weeks. Our bill would provide the money and legal certainty  for school districts to reopen safely.   Let's talk about the families' pocketbooks. Likely, every mailbox on  that street or each checking account would get another $1,200 per adult  and $500 per dependent. For a family of four, we are talking about  $3,400 in cash. Maybe some of these homeowners are among the millions  of Americans who have been thrown into joblessness. As we discussed,  they would get hundreds of dollars more every week in added  unemployment.   But because we are doing it smarter, if anyone on the street owns a  coffee shop or a contracting business, they will not hear from workers  that they are earning more by staying at home. Those unemployed workers  will get back on the job faster when our bill supercharges incentives  for rehiring and helps pay for health and safety in the workplace.   Maybe some other people on the street have held onto their jobs  because of the historic Paycheck Protection Program. Their employer is  considering closing down with that relief nearly exhausted. Our  targeted second round of PPP could keep their paycheck coming instead  of a pink slip. Maybe a retired couple lives on this block. If our  proposal for Medicare Part B premiums becomes law, this couple will be  protected from a spike in costs due to this pandemic, and needless to  say, every single person on that street would benefit from even  stronger Federal investments in the diagnostics, treatments, and  vaccines that will ultimately win this healthcare battle for all of us.    So, look, it is very simple. Partisan histrionics will not get any  American family any of the relief I just described. Calling names will  not get school districts one dime. Washington finger-pointing will not  add 1 cent to anyone's unemployment check.   The Democrats face a simple choice. They can come to the table, work  with the Republicans, and engage seriously to make law for the American  people or they can stay on the sidelines, point fingers, and let  another rescue package go the same way as the police reform bill they  killed back in June. The Republicans are ready to govern. We just need  the Democrats to decide whether they are serious about actually making  law.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
