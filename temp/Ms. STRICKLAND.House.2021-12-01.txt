 Madam Speaker, today, the Supreme Court is hearing  one of the most important abortion rights cases in generations. The  case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, marks the first  time in 50 years the Court agreed to hear a case on the  constitutionality of a previability abortion ban. In other words, the  State of Mississippi has asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v.  Wade.   Let me be clear. Reproductive health access is a fundamental right.  This is about supporting body autonomy and well-being. It is also about  economic justice and social freedom. The people hurt most by abortion  restrictions and bans are those who already face barriers to getting  access to healthcare: women, people of color, those working to make  ends meet, members of the LGBTQI community, immigrants, young people,  those in rural communities, people with disabilities, and others.   We can look to the State of Texas as a real-life example. Texas has  banned almost all abortions in the State, forcing people to travel  across State lines to receive care.   Now is the time for the Supreme Court to show that it decides cases  based on precedent and the rule of law, not politics, not ideology.  Every person should be free to make their best healthcare decisions  regardless of where they live.                            ____________________
