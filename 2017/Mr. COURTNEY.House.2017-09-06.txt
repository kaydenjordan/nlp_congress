 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1240, line 4, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which I introduced with  my colleague Congressman John Larson also of Connecticut, will address  a serious escalating problem in north central and eastern Connecticut.  Thousands of homes there are currently at risk of collapse due to  crumbling concrete foundations. A mineral identified as pyrrhotite was  present in stone aggregate mined in a quarry in Willington,  Connecticut, and used in  [[Page H7053]]  concrete to pour home foundations in at least 36 towns in the region  from the 1980s through the early 2000s.   Exposure to moisture causes the pyrrhotite to rust in the foundation  over time, causing the foundation walls to bow and crack, eventually  deteriorating to the point where homeowners can literally see through  the cracks and even remove chunks of the foundation by hand.   This is a complex issue, and our amendment is a critical step to  bring assistance to the region. It directs HUD to develop applications  of Community Development Block Grants to pyrrhotite-related residential  damage under its antiblight programs and procedures.   It is our belief that HUD, State, local, and private sector  stakeholders can develop a collaborative basket of solutions to ease  the burden of homeowners and prevent damage to the broader real estate  market and economy of the region.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's concern,  and I look forward to working with him and also with HUD to address  this issue, and I want to thank him for bringing this up.   Mr. Chair, I accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman for his  remarks, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Larson), my colleague.
