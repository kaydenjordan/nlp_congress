 Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in support of my amendment, which encourages partnerships between the  DOD, DOE, and the private sector, to facilitate the licensure,  transfer, and commercialization of innovative technologies.   We cannot let groundbreaking research and new technologies in our  Nation's Federal laboratories sit idle when they have the potential to  reenergize domestic manufacturing, create high-paying jobs, and  transform our economy.   It is not government or private sector, it is government and private  sector working together to create opportunities that have led to the  development of many products in the marketplace today, including  batteries powering electric vehicles, internet servers, and GPS.   Both the DOD and DOE have separate programs that support technology  transfer to the private sector, but they don't work very well together.  My amendment would fix that and ensure that these departments are  actively collaborating to support the commercialization of cutting-edge  technologies and make them more widely available to American businesses  and consumers.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues' support.                                time  1915
