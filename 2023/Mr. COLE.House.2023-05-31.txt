 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 456 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 456         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3746) to       provide for a responsible increase to the debt ceiling. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways       and Means or their respective designees; and (2) one motion       to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my very good friend, the ranking member of the Rules  Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.   During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on House Resolution 456.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported  out a rule, House Resolution 456, providing for consideration of H.R.  3746, the Fiscal Responsibility Act, under a closed rule. It provides 1  hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and it provides for  one motion to recommit.   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, today's legislation has been a long time coming. An  agreement like the one we are considering today could and should have  been in place much earlier. Instead, President Biden dithered and  refused to negotiate with House Republicans, pushing us right up to the  very brink of a catastrophic default.   From day one, Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans tried to get  President Biden and congressional Democrats to come to the negotiating  table, but for months they refused. Over and over again, President  Biden refused to meet with Speaker McCarthy to discuss the debt limit  and the budget. He insisted, over and over again, that it was his way  or the highway, and he told us over and over again that the only thing  he would accept was a clean debt ceiling increase. It was that or  nothing.   Of course, it is easy to understand why President Biden wouldn't want  to talk about cutting spending. Just look at the spending record he has  amassed. Since he took office, President Biden and congressional  Democrats have increased the 10-year spending trajectory by $10  trillion. They did this by passing a partisan reconciliation bill that  spent $1.9 trillion, and then by passing another partisan  reconciliation bill that added up to another $600 billion in new  spending. President Biden himself issued executive orders that added  $1.5 trillion in spending, including his reckless and unconstitutional  $400 billion plan to cancel student loan debt.   When you lay it out like that, it is easy to see how we have reached  the statutory debt ceiling so quickly, and it is easy to see why  President Biden and congressional Democrats wouldn't want any barriers  to spending more and more money. They want the gravy train to keep  flowing and the spending to keep increasing, which will ultimately lead  the Nation further and further into debt.   However, House Republicans disagreed, and last month we acted. We  passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act, a bill that responsibly lifts the  debt ceiling and changes the trajectory of future spending downward. We  agreed that the United States cannot, should not, and will not default  on our national debt, but we also put forward clear, commonsense, and  responsible savings that will bring reckless spending under control.   What did Democrats do? Nothing; not a thing. Not a single Democrat in  the House voted to lift the debt ceiling. Not a single House Democrat  voted to save trillions of dollars over the next 10 years. Our friends  in the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats, refused to take up  the Limit, Save, Grow Act; and to this day, the Senate has refused to  pass any bill lifting the debt limit. Not one.   However, House Republicans have. For all the posturing on the other  side of the aisle, I would remind everyone that House Republicans are  the only ones who have taken concrete action to avoid default.  President Biden's refusal to negotiate for so long was what brought us  so close to the brink of a catastrophic default in the first place.   Having said all that, today we are bringing a bill to the floor that  will resolve this crisis. This bill is the result  [[Page H2672]]  of negotiations between President Biden and House Republicans. It is  not a perfect bill, but it does represent a compromise between the  administration and Congress that is necessary in a divided government.  Nobody got everything they wanted, but the end result is a truly  historic bill.   Consider what the bill does, Mr. Speaker. It responsibly lifts the  debt ceiling through January 1, 2025. In exchange, it also puts in  place a series of fiscal reforms that will save taxpayers money. For  the first time in history, we are pairing a debt ceiling increase with  a year-over-year decrease in spending. We will be spending less in  fiscal year 2024 than we are in fiscal year 2023, something that has  never happened before in conjunction with a debt ceiling increase. We  accomplish that goal while preserving funding for our national defense  and ensuring our veterans get the care they need and deserve.   We have also clawed back $28 billion in unspent COVID pandemic relief  dollars that are no longer needed, the largest rescission in history.  We have cut $1.4 billion that President Biden and congressional  Democrats want to give to the IRS for new agents. We will cap future  spending at just 1 percent growth per year for the next 6 years. We  accomplish all of this without including any new taxes or new  government programs, rejecting President Biden's demands to charge  hardworking Americans another $5 trillion in taxes.   However, that is not all this bill does. It includes real policy  victories, Mr. Speaker, that will improve the lives of everyday  Americans. The bill includes the first major reforms to work  requirements for SNAP and TANF, ensuring that we can help lift people  on these programs out of poverty and into the workforce. The bill also  includes major permitting reform provisions, reducing approval time for  essential infrastructure and energy projects.    None of this would have happened but for President Biden's decision  to come to the table and negotiate. Additionally, none of this would  have happened but for House Republicans doing the responsible thing and  insisting on fiscal reforms. Together, we are doing something good for  the Nation. We are avoiding a devastating default on the national debt,  and we are enacting needed fiscal reform to put us on a more  sustainable spending path.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would quickly respond to my friend's statement about the origins of  the national debt.   Let me remind him that much of this debt was accumulated in just the  last 2 years as a consequence of President Biden and congressional  Democrats' reckless spending spree.   Consider this: In the spring of 2021, congressional Democrats,  without a single Republican vote, pushed through a $1.9 trillion  partisan spending bill.   Last year, they enacted another partisan spending bill, without a  single Republican vote, with $600 billion in new spending, partly  offset by budget gimmicks and higher taxes.   President Biden himself put forward the unconstitutional and illegal  student debt cancellation, which, if allowed to stand, would add  another $400 billion to the national debt. This is on top of all  regular Federal spending and emergency spending for the COVID-19  pandemic.   As for the military budget, my friends call it bloated. Frankly, I  think we should be spending more, but I will remind him we are giving  the President what he asked for. If this budget is bloated for the  Pentagon, they can ask the White House about it because it is the  budget that they proposed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy),  my very good friend and a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of a response.   I remind my friend from California that we actually filed a veterans'  bill that increased veteran spending, so that canard is just simply not  the case. We, from the very beginning, were going to take care of  veterans, and we filed legislation to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), my very good friend, my classmate, and the distinguished vice  chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), my very good friend, a distinguished  member of both the Appropriations and the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Molinaro), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for his remarks. I actually  voted for that bill in 2008 twice, and I am glad that he is here today.  The reality is the bill we are dealing with--it is hard to tell by  listening to the debate--is a compromise between House Republicans and  the President of the United States.   In that compromise, nobody got everything they wanted. We certainly  didn't get everything we wanted, but I think we are acting together, as  my friend from Texas suggested, to try and make sure that we don't  default; that we don't have a day like we had in 2008. That, at least,  is something we can agree on together and celebrate together, and we  will continue to try to work together.   However, the preeminent problem we have is my friends on the other  side think we can spend forever. President Obama never introduced a  budget that balanced--ever--not in 10 years, 20, or 100.   Frankly, President Biden has never introduced a budget that comes  into balance at any point. You can't sustain that indefinitely. This  effort is to both, one, to responsibly raise our debt ceiling, but to  begin to address the underlying spending problem.   I wish we could have done more in that regard, but I am glad we got  done what we did, and we will continue to work at this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just to quickly make a point to my friend, the  Democratic Congress didn't produce a budget in 4 years--4 years while  they were in the majority, not out of Budget Committee, let alone  across the floor of the House. So Democrats left things in quite a mess  and it is going to take a while to fix it, but we are working on a  budget. I hope we get one.   The reality is, though, the country has allowed itself, primarily  under Democratic leadership, to get so deeply in debt, it is pretty  tough to write a budget that gets us out of debt in any reasonable  time.   This bill is, at least, a step in the right direction. We would have  liked to have taken a bigger step. We weren't able to do that given the  fact that we have a Democratic Senate and a Democratic President, both  of whom seem to think they can spend endlessly, recklessly, and without  end indefinitely.   That is not going to happen. Sooner or later that reckoning will  come. This is an effort to forestall that and buy some time. I am glad  we worked together. I am glad the President came to the negotiating  table, despite wasting months saying he wasn't going to. I am glad we  made the minimal progress that we did.   Let's not kid ourselves. This is the first step in the right  direction, and it is not as big a step as anybody on my side of the  aisle would have liked to take.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   To my good friend from Florida, what unbalanced the budget was COVID.  We all know that. We worked, actually, together on that. That is what  spent billions of dollars in a relatively short period of time.   Quite frankly, in terms of where we are today, my friends have never  submitted a budget that comes into balance. President Obama didn't. The  last President to do that who was a Democrat was President Clinton. We  disagreed over how to get to balance, but he actually submitted budgets  that came to balance in 10 years. President Obama didn't do that.  President Biden hasn't done that.   Until you return to the Clinton era, where we actually did believe in  balanced budgets but disagreed on how to get there, I think we are  going to have a hard time getting on top of our fiscal problem.  [[Page H2679]]    On this bill, we do agree that we don't like every part of it. We  would have liked to have done more. My friends would have liked to have  spent more. The reality is it does move us in the right direction.   I am happy for the bipartisanship, but I do note it took us a long  time.   I also note, for my Democratic friends, remember, so far, to this  point, the only people who voted to raise the debt ceiling are on this  side of the aisle. My friends have not yet provided a single vote to  raise the debt ceiling. The body they control, the United States  Senate, has not presented a bill, let alone moved one across the floor.  We did.   My friends didn't like that bill. We sat down and negotiated and came  to something different, but at least we voted to raise the debt  ceiling. My friends who are concerned about it have neither presented a  plan to deal with it nor have voted to act upon the problem.   I am hopeful today that many of them will actually join us in that  effort because the President of the United States has come to the  negotiating table, and we will move forward together.   Rest assured, we are not moving forward as fast as we should; we are  not going as far as we should; and we have had to bring you to this  point kicking and screaming every step of the way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   My friend ticked through the impressive list of accomplishments in  the last Congress. He forgot to mention Democrats also added $10  trillion to the projected debt the United States will have to deal with  over the next 10 years.   Mr. Speaker, $10 trillion is a lot of money, but worse than the money  was the inflation that they unleashed by their reckless spending. If  you care about Americans, you don't push up the price of gasoline, home  heating, and interest rates on any purchase they make and what they pay  at the grocery store.   My friends managed to unleash the worst bout of inflation in 40  years. I look around this Chamber, and I am probably the only guy on  the floor, Mr. Speaker, who can actually remember that. This was an  unprecedented disaster that they unleashed on the country.   Everything in the bill that we fought for, the things that are there  and the things that aren't there, were to lower the excess spending and  to try to tame inflation. My friends act as if it doesn't exist.   I guarantee you, just go to the grocery store and ask any American  who hasn't gotten a 15 or 20 percent raise what their life has been  like in the last 2 years.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge all my colleagues to support this  resolution. With today's bill, we are putting forward commonsense  reforms that will save taxpayers money while also preventing an  economic crisis.   The reforms included in this bill are historic: the first year-over- year cut in spending in a debt ceiling bill; the large rescission of  appropriated but unspent funds in history; the first real reforms to  requirements for SNAP and TANF, which will help lift people out of  poverty; and real reforms to the permitting process, which will  streamline major infrastructure and energy projects and cut the red  tape that is holding them back.   Those are reforms, by the way, that my friends did not support. Those  were things that were put in the bill by Republicans and negotiated  for. Sadly, they weren't willing to work with us on those, and it was  only the threat of the debt ceiling that actually brought them to the  table.   It is the responsible thing to do to pass this legislation. In the  end, the American people will be better off for it.   I do want to be clear on something, Mr. Speaker. This is not the end  of House Republicans' fight for necessary fiscal reforms. We have more  than $31 trillion in debt. Programs like Medicare and Social Security,  which are the bedrock of our safety net, are growing in an  unsustainable manner.   For too long, this Congress has seen fit to just allow mandatory  programs to eat up more and more of our budget. Indeed, the President  himself refused to talk about those programs. Mandatory programs are  now more than two-thirds of what we spend in any given year. Without  real reforms to those programs, we will have no chance to right the  fiscal imbalance the country finds itself in.   Republicans are committed to preserving America's status as the  greatest Nation in the world. To do that, we must get serious about the  national debt. At the end of the day, the journey  [[Page H2680]]  of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This bill, Mr. Speaker,  is that first step.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
