 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis at the border. There has been a crisis  at the border for weeks. And instead of addressing the crisis, instead  of having a hearing in the committee, Democrats have passed bills that  defund the police, restrict Americans' Second Amendment liberties, and  federalize election law. And not one of those bills--by the way, not  one of those bills went through committee.   In fact, the Judiciary Committee--74 days of this Congress, the full  Judiciary Committee has yet to have a hearing on anything. We have  asked to have a hearing on the border crisis, the real crisis. We asked  to have a hearing on cancel culture, the attack on peoples' First  Amendment liberties. We asked to have a hearing on conservatorships. No  full committee hearing this entire Congress, but they can pass bills to  defund the police, restrict Americans' Second Amendment liberties,  Federalize election law. And now, while there is a crisis on the  border, they bring a bill to the floor that gives amnesty to 3 million  illegal aliens.   Seventy-four days of the 117th Congress, the Democrats have taken  away the Republicans' right to offer a motion to recommit; they have  kicked Marjorie Taylor Greene off a committee; two Democrats wrote a  letter trying to cancel ``Fox News,'' ``Newsmax,'' and ``One America  News.'' The Democratic chair of the House Administration Committee  compiled a dossier on 140 Republican Members, and they are preparing to  steal an election from Republican Congresswoman Miller-Meeks.   And today, they are going to pass a bill--try to pass a bill which,  as I said before, gives amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants. We  have got gang members crossing the border. We have got people whose  name is on the terrorist watch list crossing the border. We have got  COVID positive illegals crossing the border.   We have had 100,000 encounters with foreigners on the border in  February alone. Housing illegal immigrants in the Dallas Convention  Center; the administration sending FEMA in to help. Even though they  refuse to call the crisis a crisis, they are sending in the disaster  agency to help with the situation. If that is not a crisis, frankly, I  don't know what one is.   A crisis that President Trump, 2 months ago, told us was coming. I  want to read what President Trump said in January. Two months ago, this  is what President Trump said: ``If our border security measures are  reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration, a wave  like you've never seen before.'' Boy was that accurate.    If our border security measures are reversed. What has the Biden  administration done? They placed a moratorium on deportation, they  ended the Remain in Mexico program, and they have stopped building the  wall. I think that is a reversal. I think that is a reversal of the  measures that were put in place. What did it trigger? A tidal wave of  illegal immigration, a wave like you have never seen before. It sure  did. The tidal wave is here, and the Democrats' answer is amnesty. Wow.  Such a deal for the American people. Such a deal for the American  taxpayer.   Democrats answer: Defund the police, attack Second Amendment  liberties of Americans, federalize election law, try to cancel ``Fox  News,'' ``Newsmax,'' ``One America News,'' compile a dossier on  Republicans, kick one congresswoman off of her committees, and try to  take an election from another, all while they are creating a crisis on  the border, and then respond to it all with, what? A bill that gives  amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants. That is what this legislation  does today.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we vote ``no.'' I hope we can stop this  legislation. This is not what the American people bargained for. This  is not common sense, and I hope we defeat this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), who is the ranking member on the  Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that the majority  leader is not accurate in what he said. Republicans, 2 years ago, had  bills that were much more comprehensive than what the Democrats are  bringing to the floor this week. We had a bill that dealt with merit- based immigration, E-Verify, added workers to enforcement border  security. It is just not accurate to say our plan was not  comprehensive. We had two bills, as the Republican leader mentioned.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the Republican leader.    Mr. Speaker, I will just point out, I was at the border 2  years ago, the Rio Grande; Mr. Roy was at the border last week; Mr.  McCarthy was at the border this week. The previous speaker, Mr.  Speaker, said that Republicans didn't come when she invited. We have  all been down there and seen what goes on. Just this week, we have been  down there to see the current crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of time  remaining for each side.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I will tell you what this bill does. Page  51, section 310: ``Grant program to assist eligible applicants. The  Secretary shall establish, within U.S. Citizen and Immigration  Services, a program to award grants.''   So while there is a disaster on the border, so much so that we have  to send FEMA there, this bill not only gives amnesty to illegals, it  uses American tax dollars to help the illegals apply for amnesty.   Such a deal for the American taxpayer. That is what this legislation  does. That is what this bill is about.   At a time when we have chaos on the border, this bill gives amnesty  to 3 million illegals and uses American tax dollars to help those same  illegals apply for the amnesty. I mean, the disrespect that the  Democrats have for the American taxpayer is astounding to me. It is  truly astounding.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).  [[Page H1523]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain).    Madam Speaker, if we adopt the motion to recommit, we  will instruct the Committee on the Judiciary to consider the amendment  to H.R. 6 to ensure that gang members do not receive any benefits under  the underlying bill and are swiftly removed from the country.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), the ranking member of the Immigration and  Citizenship Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) to control the remainder of  the time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
