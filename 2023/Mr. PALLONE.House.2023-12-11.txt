 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian  Uranium Imports Act.   Our imports of Russian nuclear fuel date back to the megatons for  megawatts disarmament program at the end of the Cold War. That program  has been over for a decade now, and we have developed a dependence on  Russian uranium.  [[Page H6762]]    Our Nation's nuclear reactors currently depend on Russia for nearly  15 percent of their enriched uranium.   This is troubling because over the last 2 years we have seen how  Russia tries to wield its energy resources as a weapon. It is simply  unsustainable.   I support ending our dangerous reliance on Russia for enriched  uranium, but if we are serious about energy security, we cannot simply  switch one foreign dependence for another. That is why we must invest  in our own uranium fuel cycle here at home.    Right now, we have limited fuel facilities to provide the nuclear  fuel our existing fleet needs, much less the advanced fuels that future  reactors will need. Any move we make to end our reliance on Russian  uranium must be partnered with a build-out of our domestic uranium  supply chain. Otherwise, any action would just increase cost to  consumers and impact reliability.   That is why in committee, Democrats attempted to partner this bill  with authorizations to the Department of Energy to invest in U.S.  domestic enrichment and conversion capacity. Unfortunately, those  efforts were initially rejected by our Republican majority, therefore,  I opposed this bill at that time.   Fortunately, the committee has now advanced legislation that  authorizes those investments in our domestic fuel cycle, and that  language will be included in the final defense authorization bill.   With that legislation set to become law, I am now much more  comfortable moving this bill. After passage of the defense  authorization bill, we must ensure these important programs are funded  at the levels authorized so we can finally end our dangerous reliance  on Russian uranium.   The combination of banning imports of Russian uranium and investing  in domestic capacity will provide private industry with both the  certainty and the incentives it needs to invest in the nuclear fuel  supply chain. This will help us become a world leader again, not just  in fuel production for our current reactors, but in fuel production for  the next generation of reactors, as well.   I urge support for this bill, Mr. Speaker. I ask that we support this  bill on a bipartisan basis. It is a good bill at this point, and we  want to get it to the Senate as quickly as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5378, the Lower Costs,  More Transparency Act. This bipartisan bill does exactly what it says  it does: It delivers lower healthcare costs for the American people and  brings much-needed transparency to our Nation's healthcare system.   Access to affordable healthcare remains a major challenge for many  American families. More than 40 percent of adults say they have either  delayed or forgone medical care because of high costs. Prices for  healthcare services also vary widely. Consumers often have difficulty  obtaining price information to begin with. Another problem is that the  information can be misleading or inaccurate, making it difficult for  consumers to compare prices across healthcare providers before  receiving care. Too many patients are forced to wait until after they  receive care and receive their medical bill to see what they actually  owe.   H.R. 5378 brings some much-needed transparency to the healthcare  system by codifying and strengthening important price transparency  protections. It is a victory for everyone who has ever struggled to  navigate and understand the cost of a healthcare procedure or a  prescription drug at the pharmacy counter. These measures will empower  consumers and employers with data on the prices hospitals charge and  the rates insurers pay so that they can compare prices and save money.   It also increases transparency of how pharmacy benefit managers, or  PBMs, affect drug prices at the pharmacy counter. This will also help  increase competition and lower healthcare costs for Americans. We have  added new language in the bill to enhance the privacy protections for  consumers' health information and to ensure that the full protection of  the HIPAA privacy rule is applicable.   I also want to mention, Mr. Speaker, the bill reduces costs for  patients by ensuring Medicare beneficiaries are not paying more for the  exact same drug because it was administered in a hospital outpatient  department instead of a physician's office. It will also build on  Democrats' work to rein in the soaring cost of prescription drugs by  requiring the FDA to provide more information to generic drug  manufacturers during the development process. This will help speed up  the path to market and increase competition sooner to lower drug prices  faster. All of these provisions in this bill will help make healthcare  and prescription drugs more affordable for the American people.   I also want to mention, Mr. Speaker, that H.R. 5378 will also make  healthcare more accessible to American families thanks to critical  investments in our Nation's public health programs that serve low- income and uninsured patients. The bill includes increased funding for  community health centers at $4.4 billion per year, an unprecedented 10  percent increase over current funding levels.    Community health centers are a critical source of primary healthcare  for more than 30 million patients, 1 in every 11 Americans. These  centers deliver high-quality, affordable healthcare to some of our most  vulnerable communities, and this increased funding will allow these  centers to continue providing this critical care.   The bill increases funding for the National Health Service Corps,  which places doctors in high-need communities. It also includes an  unprecedented 7 years of funding, more than double the funding under  current law, for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education  program to support the training of primary care physicians in  community-based settings. This program helps address doctor shortages  in underserved areas as graduates of the program are likely to practice  close to their training sites and to care for underserved patients.  This long-term funding will help bring more certainty to the program to  ensure that teaching health centers can plan and recruit for their  residency programs.   Finally, the bill also reauthorizes and increases funding for both  the Special Diabetes Program and Special Diabetes Program for Indians.  These programs provide critical investments in diabetes research and  care.   I will also mention that H.R. 5378 eliminates looming cuts to  Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospitals to support these high-need  hospitals that provide care for large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured  patients.   The increased funding for each of these public health and workforce  programs is essential to ensuring access to care for our constituents  across the country. All of this funding is fully offset with policies  that will further strengthen our healthcare system and help reduce  costs for American families.   Mr. Speaker, when a version of this bill came before the Committee on  Energy and Commerce, it passed unanimously with bipartisan support.  Chair Rodgers and I have been working on this bill all year, and I  commend her for her ongoing commitment to get it across the finish  line. It is an important bill that delivers meaningful results.   I will also take an opportunity to thank some of the staff who have  worked on this. From my committee staff, I thank Tiffany Guarascio,  Waverly Gordon, Una Lee, Saha Khaterzai, Rick Van Buren, Stephen  Holland, and Lydia Abma. From the Republican staff, I thank Nate  Hodson, Sarah Burke, Grace Graham, and Corey Ensslin.   Floor action today simply would not have been possible without months  of long-term commitment by the staff on both sides of the aisle to get  this done. I think you can tell that I really think this is probably  one of the most important bills that will come out of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce this session. It is truly bipartisan, which is  another thing I think is very important right now.   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill to  lower healthcare costs for the American people and to make healthcare  more accessible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me say that I concur with my colleagues  and partners in crafting this important bipartisan piece of legislation  that is intended to codify and improve upon the robust requirements  that exist in the regulations that have been implemented by both the  Trump and Biden administrations. With this bill, we seek to bring true  health price transparency to lower costs for patients, employers, and  unions purchasing health coverage.   This bill is a floor, not a ceiling, and I intend that the  implementing agencies will use the discretion left to them to ensure  that health plans and insurers disclose the detailed price information  and necessary data on reimbursement rates for healthcare items and  services. We intend to follow this colloquy with a bipartisan letter to  the agencies reiterating our expectations in greater detail.   In addition, in further colloquy with Chair Rodgers, I address a  technical change that needs to be made to the bill in negotiations with  the Senate. In the new version of the bill, we have limited the drug  price data flowing to small employers in order to strengthen health  privacy protections for their employees. However, I want to make clear  that we did not intend to exclude multiemployer, public sector, or  retiree-only and union health plans under this new provision, and we  are committed to fixing this issue before the bill becomes law. Ranking  Member  Bobby Scott also agrees with this perspective.   I ask Chair Rodgers if she would concur with me that we make sure  this issue is addressed in our negotiation with the Senate and before  the bill becomes law.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Doggett, for his hard  work on the important issues that he raised and that have been raised  today. I should mention that he is the ranking member of the Ways and  Means Health Subcommittee, so he is very familiar with these issues.   I know he thinks that certain things should have been added to this  bill, but I want to stress that I think we have to support this bill  based on the important policies that we have in the bill. It is not  always easy to get consensus between Democrats and Republicans. This is  one of those rare examples, unfortunately, where we have come to a  consensus, which our committee often does. That is why I do stress the  important policies that are in it.   I think the legislation is a victory for the American people. It  addresses a lot of obvious failings in our health system. The bill  brings some much-needed price transparency to the healthcare system and  will help lower healthcare costs for patients.   Americans have been struggling for years to obtain accurate price  information before going in for a healthcare procedure. It is difficult  for patients to know how much a hospital or their insurance company  will charge them for the care that they receive.  [[Page H6788]]    All this information should be readily available to the public. This  bill requires hospitals and insurance companies to list prices in an  easy to understand format for patients.    The bill also prevents hospital outpatient facilities from unfairly  overcharging seniors. This policy will save Medicare beneficiaries $1.4  billion in lower premiums.   The bill helps further rein in the cost of prescription drugs by  cracking down on price gouging by pharmacy benefit managers and  requires the PBMs to be transparent about their price information.   This is going to help lower healthcare costs for both employers and  patients and bring needed oversight to the PBM industry.   In addition to these patient protection provisions, the legislation  includes a historic $15 billion in investments in safety net and  workforce programs and programs to address physician shortages around  the country.   The legislation essentially lowers healthcare costs for the American  people and makes healthcare more accessible to American families. I  think this delivers meaningful results to the American people on a  bipartisan basis.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. If the chair  needs time for people who will support the bill, I will yield to them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot emphasize the importance of this bill. I think  that in terms of the overall effort to increase affordability, to  increase access to healthcare, and to make sure that there is  competition, if you will, within the hospital industry and within the  insurance industry, this bill does all of those things.   It is really amazing, in my opinion, that we are able to do this on a  bipartisan basis. It came out of committee, I believe, unanimously. I  think it will go far towards increasing affordability, accessibility,  and competition, which also lowers prices.   For all those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 4531, the Support for  Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act. This bill addresses the  ongoing public health emergency posed by the opioid and overdose  crisis.   The opioid epidemic is still a tragic reality for millions of  Americans and their families every day. Last year, nearly 110,000  Americans died from a drug overdose.   Five years ago, Congress worked to enact the SUPPORT Act, bipartisan  legislation to address the opioid epidemic, and that legislation  expanded access to treatment, invested in public health, and  strengthened prevention efforts.   Today, the nature of the opioid epidemic has changed. Where it was  once illicit prescription drugs, now it is illicit fentanyl, its  analogues, and xylazine that are claiming the lives of too many people  every single day.   H.R. 4531 builds on the success of existing law. It extends the  programs that have worked, makes commonsense changes to the programs  that need to be updated, and includes new policies designed to combat  the new reality of the opioid epidemic.   The bill before us today provides critical training to first  responders, supports recovery centers, and helps individuals in  recovery lead normal lives. It makes important investments in Medicaid  to support the treatment of opioid use disorder.   It requires all State Medicaid programs to cover medication-assisted  treatment, expands access to coverage to pregnant women in pretrial  detention, and makes it easier for incarcerated individuals to regain  their coverage after being released.    I must say, I am disappointed that we were not able to include  several bipartisan policies that would ensure greater access to  Medicaid for justice-involved populations, and I will continue to work  to find a path forward on those provisions.   Nevertheless, that said, the bill before us will make meaningful  changes to Federal law that will strengthen our ability to respond to  the ongoing opioid epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Rodgers, Subcommittee Chairman  Guthrie, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Eshoo for their hard work to  advance this important bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko), ranking member of our Environment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Crockett).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time. I may have one more speaker, but they are not here at this time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is very important in the ongoing efforts of our committee to  continue the battle against opiates and other related illicit drugs  that are very dangerous. The number of overdoses, unfortunately,  continues to be way out of proportion to what it should be. We need to  support this bill and other measures that deal with this crisis that  continues to plague the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2787, the 5G Spectrum Authority  Licensing Enforcement Act, or the 5G SALE Act.   Spectrum is one of our country's most important natural resources.  These radio waves are a critical component in building next-generation  wireless networks and delivering connectivity to Americans across the  country. Without spectrum, our wireless networks would not be able to  help millions of Americans study for school, meet with their health  provider, connect with family and friends, and place a call to 911  during a time of need. In order to have this kind of connectivity that  we have all come to expect, we must ensure that consumers have access  to the spectrum that has been made available for commercial wireless  use.   S. 2787 achieves these objectives. This legislation gives the FCC the  authority for 90 days to process spectrum license applications that are  currently pending at the agency from its auction last year of the 2.2  gigahertz band. While I hoped Congress would have extended the SEC  spectrum auction authority by now, this legislation is an important  step forward in allowing commercial spectrum to be used by consumers,  especially those in unserved areas and rural communities.   It is important that we pass this bill today, but even with this  action, our work will still not be done. We must find a way forward on  a bipartisan, bicameral spectrum agreement that can be sent to the  President's desk for his signature. As Chair Rodgers and I have said  for months, it is critical that we reauthorize the FCC spectrum auction  authority as soon as possible. I am concerned that this lapse will  hinder us on the international stage, especially with the World  Radiocommunication Conference taking place right now in Dubai.   I commend Representatives Kuster and Joyce for their bipartisan work  on the House companion to this bill, H.R. 5677. This important bill  helps advance America's wireless leadership by ensuring that 5G  spectrum is deployed quickly so that we can further improve consumers'  wireless service all around the Nation, especially in rural  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in a  bipartisan manner so it can be sent shortly to the President's desk,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is important legislation. Obviously,  we would like to see spectrum authority in general be authorized, but  this is important on its own.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the bill on a bipartisan basis, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3226, the PREEMIE  Reauthorization Act of 2023. This bipartisan legislation sponsored by  Representative Eshoo, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health,  plays a crucial role in improving the care and outcomes for premature  babies and their families.   According to the March of Dimes, about 383,000 premature babies were  born in the United States last year. These babies oftentimes have more  health problems or need to stay in the hospital longer than full-term  babies. Some premature babies also face long-term health effects like  problems that affect the brain, lungs, hearing, or vision.   Reauthorization of the PREEMIE program will help us to better  understand the cause of preterm birth and what more can be done to  prevent preterm births.   In 2006, Congress passed the PREEMIE Act, which marked a significant  milestone by pioneering a comprehensive public-private national agenda  aimed at spurring innovative research initiatives.   In 2013 and then again in 2018, we reauthorized 5-year extensions to  the program to continue our country's commitment to address preterm  birth through Federal research, promoting known interventions and  successful community outreach programs.   With this legislation today, we will reauthorize key programs at the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and  Services Administration. These programs support research and programs  on preterm birth, improved tracking of national data, and activities  aimed at promoting healthy pregnancies and preventing preterm birth.  [[Page H6800]]    H.R. 3226 also provides for the study of the costs, impact of social  factors, and gaps in public health programs that lead to prematurity,  providing us with more vital information. It also calls for the  Department of Health and Human Services to make recommendations to  Congress to prevent preterm birth.   Importantly, the legislation establishes an interagency working group  at HHS to coordinate all Federal activities and programs related to  preterm birth, infant mortality, and other adverse birth outcomes.   Again, I thank Representative Eshoo for her leadership on this  legislation. I know that she always takes leadership, particularly on  issues that affect the healthcare of children.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  legislation to make a significant impact in the fight against preterm  birth complications in all of our districts and communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), the ranking member of our Subcommittee on  Health.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the bill on a  bipartisan basis. Obviously, reauthorizing and expanding this program  for preemies is very important for children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
