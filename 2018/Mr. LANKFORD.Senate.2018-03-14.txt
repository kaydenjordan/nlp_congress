 Madam President, when I was in college, I remember  watching a State of the Union speech by President Reagan in which he  took a 43-pound stack of papers and set them on the podium. As he was  giving his State of the Union Address, he said: This is the budget bill  that has been given to me--43 pounds of it, all stacked up. It was a  famous moment when the President said: Do not send this to me again.   Republicans and Democrats alike stood and cheered. They said: That is  a terrible way to do government.   For 5 of the next 6 years there were no more Omnibus appropriations  bills, but that did not last. Since 1986, there have been 22 Omnibus  appropriations bills. People may ask, what is that?   By law, Congress is to do 12 appropriations bills. Each part of that  has a section of the budget, and each one of those is passed as a  stand-alone. First, they go through subcommittee, then committee, then  to the full floor, and then they pass. But 17 times since 1998 and 22  times since 1986, all of those bills were just looped together to make  one giant document--the 43-pound document that President Reagan dropped  in 1988.   What is going wrong? We have another one of those omnibus bills next  week, in which all of the appropriations bills have been looped  together to try to simplify the process, but this actually provides  even less transparency.  [[Page S1705]]  What do we do with this? How did we get here?   The short story is that the Budget Control Act of 1974 was created  right after Watergate in a fight between Congress and President Nixon  over the fact that President Nixon was told that Congress wanted to be  able to spend certain amounts of money in certain areas, and President  Nixon basically didn't want to spend it. So Congress pushed back and  put additional requirements on him to actually do what Congress was  compelling him to do in that 1974 Budget Act, to try to create more  transparency and provide greater leadership for Congress. Out of that  was born this Budget Act, but also the House and Senate committees and  the Congressional Budget Office were born.   All of those things were to create more input and create a system in  which, each year, the President would create a budget and would submit  that budget to Congress. Then that budget would lead to authorizing  bills from the different committees. And then, from the authorizing, it  would lead to appropriations bills and final passage.   Well, how is that working for us? It is not. It created a process so  complicated and so slow that, although it makes sense on paper and in  legislative language, it doesn't actually work year to year, and it  pushes us into what is called continuing resolutions--or, as is  commonly thrown around here, CRs. Every year since 1995, Congress has  had at least one CR--one continuing resolution; that is, taking last  year's appropriations bill, just changing the date on it, and moving it  over. There is no strategic planning, nothing. That is a problem for  us.   The budget process itself has broken down and has fallen into omnibus  spending bills, with 12 bills, all combined. Some years, we fail to get  budget bills done at all.   The authorizing process that is supposed to go between the budget and  the appropriations process has completely collapsed for us. In fact, in  the 2017 appropriations, it happens that there were 256 expired  authorizations in the final appropriations bills. About $310 billion of  what was appropriated was not authorized even last year. Some of those  things hadn't been authorized for more than a decade. Finally, we have  passed all appropriations bills only four times in the last 44 years.    We have a major problem with the way we do budgeting. Year after  year, people visit me or people bring this to me in townhall meetings  or at the grocery store or at Taco Bell; people catch me and say: What  is going on with the budget process?   I can tell you that if it sounds as if you say that every year, it is  because you have said that every year now for a couple of decades.   How do we get out of this? There is a bipartisan, bicameral committee  that has been put together and met for the first time last week. There  are 16 total--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans, 8 from the Senate and 8  from the House. Our mission is to revise the way we do budgeting. A lot  of Americans probably will not watch this process, but it will be  extremely important that we actually fix it.   I am convinced that we are not going to get a better budget product  until we get a better budget process. This committee itself is designed  in such a way that it takes out the partisanship, not just with equal  numbers on both sides, but the agreement from the very beginning is  that if we don't have a majority of Democrats and a majority of  Republicans signing off on the final proposal, we will not bring it to  the floor. If we do, we hope to fix the budget process itself.   The budget process is set up to create gimmicks in the budgeting  rather than to fix them. We have a 10-year budget window, and there are  all these gimmicks that have been created to try to move spending  outside the 10-year budget window to make things look as though they  are actually going to balance when they actually don't balance. I would  like for us to consider some things like biennial budgeting. Twenty  States budget every 2 years. It gives budget certainty for 24 months.  We should get that. That helps our economy. That helps our businesses.  That helps our agencies. That helps in contracting. That helps us avoid  these continuing resolutions--if we can actually do budgeting in 2-year  cycles.   I would like to get out of the perpetual focus on government  shutdowns and the countdown clocks that happen. I proposed a bill 5  years ago called the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. It is designed  to get us to a spot where we actually put the pressure on Congress to  get the job done but hold agencies and hold the American people  harmless while we work through the process.   Quite frankly, I think the President's budget is a meaningless  document. It has never been passed by any President of any party. I  don't mind the Presidents releasing their budget priorities--ways we  can save money, duplication that they see, key aspects. That is  entirely appropriate. But the President's budget every year just  becomes a big fight, and when it is late, it throws the process off  even more and gives Congress one more reason to say that they are not  getting their job done because someone else was late in doing theirs.  We should reform that.   We should reform the way we do debt limits. We are the only country  in the world that does this. We have had some kind of debt limit since  the 1920s, actually. But originally, when it went to the form that it  is in now in the late 1930s, it was established as a way to protect us  from adding more debt, and it did work for decades.   It has not worked for decades. It has been another fiscal cliff out  there that has not resolved anything. We have to fix that so it does  what it is supposed to do or take it away, but we can't destabilize  international economies because we can't get our job done here.   We have to have some sort of focus on both revenue and spending. We  should deal with real consequences when we don't get things done on  time. We have to build internal processes that actually get things  done. We have to pay attention to $20 trillion, and growing, in  national debt.   These are things we can get done, but they will not get done if we  don't actually fix the process. There is no moment to actually get the  big things and hard things done.   My hope and my commitment, with this body and with this group of 16  of us who have grouped together from the House and the Senate-- Republicans and Democrats--is this: Bring a proposal to us that is a  fair, nonpartisan proposal that is not focused on what party is in  power at that moment but looks at the fiscal health of the Nation, how  we can plan for the future, and how we can actually get off this  endless cycle of nonaction and get back to a process of predictable  budgeting and appropriations. We will bring some of those solutions in  the days ahead.   Right now we are meeting and talking. I invite any Member of this  body who wants to contribute to catch any one of us in this group. We  are not saying that the 16 of us are exclusive to solving the problems.   I also say the same thing to the American people: Anyone in my State  or anyone around the country who wants to contribute good ideas, bring  them. Let's add these good ideas together. Let's fix the process. Let's  get back to actually talking about how we solve the budget issues  rather than how we solve our internal processes in the House and the  Senate. That is the last thing we should be arguing about and the first  thing we should fix.   With that, I yield back.
