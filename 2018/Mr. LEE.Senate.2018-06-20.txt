 Madam President, I first want to respond to something that  was said a moment ago. It is not he and he alone who can solve it.  Congress is, in fact, the policymaking body within the Federal  Government. We are the lawmaking body within the Federal Government. We  can make changes to the law, and we can't lose sight of that fact.                            ____________________     Madam President, pursuant to title X of the Congressional  Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I have a discharge petition  at the desk and move to discharge from the Senate Committees on  Appropriations and Budget H.R. 3, to rescind certain budget authority  proposed to be rescinded in special messages transmitted to the  Congress by the President on May 8, 2018.    Madam President, over the next 10 years, our national debt  is set to balloon from $21.16 trillion today to more than $33.9  trillion in 2028.   With interest rates set to increase, the payments on the debt will  also likely double over the next 10 years as a percentage of total  economic output. Consider for a moment the fact we are paying a little  more than $300 billion a year to service our debt. It is not that much  more than we were paying a couple of decades ago when our national debt  was roughly one-fifth, one-sixth of its current size. The only reason  our debt service payments are as low as they are today is that our  interest rates are at all-time historic lows. Our Treasury yield rates  are artificially, historically, aberrationally, severely low. The  situation gets a lot worse if our artificially, historically low  interest rates increase or start to return to their historical averages  at a pace quicker than has been projected, as is easily possible. For  example, if interest  [[Page S4258]]  rates were to return just to historical norms--I am not talking about a  rebound above the historical average, just a rebound to historical  norms--taxpayers would soon be drowning in trillion-dollar annual  interest payments just for the interest on our debt, which means just  the difference between what we are paying in our debt service payment  now and what we would be paying then, possibly a few short years from  now. It is more than we spend on the Department of Defense. This is  really frightening, and this is why it is such welcome news that there  is some movement on this front.   That is why it is such welcome news that on May 8 President Trump  sent to Congress a request to rescind $15.4 billion worth of extraneous  spending. This is something Congress used to do all the time. This is  something that in decades past would occur dozens, even scores of  times, during a single Presidential administration, and it was a  bipartisan matter, of course. Returning unused taxpayer money isn't  just good government; in a republic, it should be expected, and it  should be the norm. In 1981, President Reagan and a divided Congress  rescinded more than $15 billion in Federal spending and another $16  billion in 1985 and 1986. President Clinton made three rescission  requests in 2000, totaling $128 million.   Now we have the chance to take up the mantle again. President Trump's  specific proposals draw back unused funds from expired programs,  obsolete programs, and accounts that the Congressional Budget Office  says are wildly, needlessly overfunded. In fact, according to CBO, none  of the funds in the requested rescissions would alter current Federal  programs in any way. For instance, CBO has certified that the $7  billion CHIP rescission would not affect either outlays or the number  of Americans with health insurance. And I should note that Congress has  rescinded CHIP funding in every enacted Labor-HHS appropriations bill  since 2011, more than $50 billion in total during that time period.   The spending targeted for rescission is either expired or rendered  unattainable by current eligibility requirements. The $15 billion is  just sitting, unused, in agency accounts. So how does it help to cut  spending if this money is just sitting there? This is the real sticking  point, for Congress has this cute little habit of paying for new  spending by raiding these unused funds. It is a budgetary trick, a  gimmick, if you will. The money may not be used this year, but it can  be recycled into budget gimmicks in future years. Rescinding it now  takes the $15 billion out of circulation for those kinds of shenanigans  in the not-too-distant future, and, of course, that is the real reason  why it will not pass unanimously.    Now, to its credit, the House of Representatives has stepped up. On  June 7, the House of Representatives passed its own $14.8 billion  rescissions package. Now it is our chance. Now we have the opportunity  to do the same. This is the Senate's chance to show the American people  that we retain some modicum of attention and of seriousness when it  comes to the spending habits of the Federal Government and when it  comes to fiscal restraint in Washington, DC.   Cutting spending that isn't actually going to be spent may not be a  profile in courage, but it is at least a sign of a pulse, and in  Washington that is something. That is something important that we can  and we should show today. It is a step toward fiscal responsibility and  away from the cynicism and the waste that has turned this city into  what is known as ``the swamp.''   In Congress we face a lot of difficult decisions--gut-wrenching,  heart-wrenching decisions--but this is not one of them. President  Trump's request is as reasonable as can be imagined. Now, $15 billion  may be a drop in the bucket compared to $15 trillion or $21 trillion,  but that is a reason to support this legislation, not to oppose it.  Congress needs to retrain its atrophied muscles in preparation for the  far larger tasks that lie ahead.   If we do not find the will--if we can't somehow muster the willpower  necessary to reduce Federal spending ourselves now, long before the  laws of mathematics and economics force us to do so--we will regret it.  If we wait until those laws catch up with us, it will be a whole lot  more painful later than it will be if we start making more modest  adjustments now.   Every day that passes without action represents more of our national  debt being thrown onto our children's backs--another line item on the  fiscal indictment that we are writing, however unwittingly or  unknowingly, against ourselves.   We have to change course. This bill provides us with a good chance to  take one small step toward sanity.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to discharge.                          Discharge Petition--H.R. 3         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with title 10       of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974,       hereby direct that the Senate Committees on Appropriations       and Budget be discharged from further consideration of H.R.       3, a bill to rescind certain budget authority proposed to be       rescinded in special messages transmitted to the Congress by       the President on May 8, 2018, in accordance with title X of       the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act 1974.          Mike Lee, Patick J. Toomey, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, David             Perdue, Jeff Flake, Joni Ernst, Ron Johnson, John             Kennedy, Marco Rubio, Thom Tillis, Steve Daines, Mike             Rounds, John Cornyn, Ben Sasse, James Lankford, Tom             Cotton, John Barrasso, Mike Crapo, James Risch.     Madam President, our national debt stands at about $21  trillion. The interest costs on this alone are more than $300 billion  every single year. That is money that can't go toward shoring up our  national defense or shoring up Social Security or Medicare or some  other Federal program. That is money that goes to our creditors. Now,  it has to, but the scary part is that that is just a drop in the bucket  compared to what it could be just a few years from now. The only reason  it is even this low is that our Treasury yield rates--the rates at  which we pay interest on our national debt--are at an alltime, historic  low. As soon as they return to their historic averages, we will see  that interest payment increase manyfold. If we wait until that moment  arrives, this will be a very difficult process not just for the Federal  Government, not just for Congress, but for the entire country.   It is time for us to start taking gradual steps in the right  direction now. This opportunity--this rescissions package that has been  proposed by the President--provides us with a meaningful step in that  direction. I applaud President Trump for proposing these rescissions.  It is time for Congress to get back in the practice of taking these  things up, of considering them, and of passing them.   I respectfully urge all of my colleagues to vote for this measure.
