 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Monsignor Kevin  Sullivan as a guest chaplain here today.   Monsignor Sullivan is the Executive Director of Catholic Charities  for the Archdiocese of New York.   Monsignor Sullivan also represents Catholic Charities agencies in  public policy discussions about immigration, welfare reform, job  development, and foster care. He joins us on a day when we welcome more  than 500 Dominican Americans from around the country to celebrate  Dominican heritage and discuss civic engagement and issues affecting  the Dominican community across the country.   A native of the Bronx, the Monsignor served as a parish priest at St.  Elizabeth's Church, my church, in Washington Heights, which is home to  a historic and thriving Dominican American community.   We owe a debt of gratitude to Monsignor Sullivan for his service to  our community and to all New Yorkers and I am proud to see him give the  invocation in the House of Representatives today.                            ____________________
