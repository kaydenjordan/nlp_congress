 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, during August, I continued my annual  tradition of holding at least one Q&A in every one of Iowa's 99  counties. I go to Iowans where they work and live to hear what is on  their minds so that I can better represent them in the Senate. No  matter the setting, my citizens of Iowa set the agenda.   On August 27, with a town meeting in Spencer, IA, I completed the  39th consecutive year of my annual 99 county meetings. I look forward  to continuing my dialogue with Iowans throughout the rest of this year,  just to emphasize that I hold a lot more than just 99 meetings with my  constituents every year.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
