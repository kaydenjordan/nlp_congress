 Mr. President, I congratulate Karen Roetter, who is  retiring as my regional director in my Coeur d'Alene office. Karen's  humor, optimism, and dedication are hallmarks of who she is and will be  greatly missed.   Karen graduated from the University of Idaho in 1979, with a teaching  degree, and began teaching at Canfield Middle School in Coeur d'Alene,  where she taught social studies and physical education and coached  girls volleyball. Karen is a deeply devoted wife, mother, and  grandmother to her beautiful family. After 5 years of teaching, she  left teaching to stay home with her and her husband Matt's three  daughters: Katie, Andrea, and Tara. Katie and her husband James have a  son, Jackson. Andrea is married to Blake, and they have two children,  Layne and Hudson. Tara is married to Shea and has three children,  Ensley, Ebbet and Ellers.  [[Page S6773]]    In 1997, Karen took a part-time job with then-U.S. Representative  Helen Chenoweth, before she, thankfully, came to work for me in 2000,  doing casework part-time. In 2007, she began working for me full-time  and was promoted to regional director for the Coeur d'Alene office.   In the nearly 23 years Karen has served the people of Idaho as a  valued member of my staff, one of the many projects she has worked on  has been our annual academy nominations. Her passion for this effort  shows in the time and attention she devotes to educating about these  opportunities and identifying and promoting the Idaho students ready  and willing to attend our country's military academies. The commitment  shown by the students and the fact they also have a desire to serve  their country makes them her kindred spirits. Additionally, north  Idaho, with the decades of cleanup at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site  and the history of mining and milling in the Silver Valley, has had no  shortage of land use and natural resources challenges. Karen has faced  them with warmth, curiosity and a willingness to listen and help the  rightly concerned people of the affected communities.   Karen, thank you for your hard work on behalf of Idahoans, and  congratulations on your retirement. I have greatly enjoyed our  conversations and valued your dedication to addressing the needs of  north Idaho. You have also been a wonderful example of grace to all of  us while facing life's most difficult challenges. On a lighter side,  many members of the staff have you to thank for introducing them to  huckleberry milkshakes. May retirement provide you ample time with the  family you love so dearly, including shuttling your grandchildren to  activities and the gardening you enjoy. I wish you all the best.                            ____________________
