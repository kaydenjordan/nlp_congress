 Mr. President, this week our Nation will honor the  memory of a brave Kentuckian. President Trump will posthumously award  1LT Garlin Murl Conner with our Nation's highest military distinction,  the Medal of Honor.   In 1941 Garlin left his farm town in Clinton County, KY. This quiet  21-year-old enlisted in the Army. When he returned, after World War II  service that spanned eight major campaigns and earned a battlefield  commission, four Silver Stars, three Purple Hearts, and the  Distinguished Service Cross, he was a hero.   Lieutenant Conner wasn't supposed to be in a snow-covered forest that  January morning in 1945. He was meant to be recovering in a hospital.  But with his unit in need, he snuck away and returned to the front in  France. When he rejoined his comrades, they were in urgent danger,  pinned down by six German tanks. Lieutenant Conner stepped forward. He  took a telephone, a radio, and a wire reel and ran toward the enemy  alone--totally alone.   Past the American line, in a ditch barely large enough to cover him,  Lieutenant Conner began directing artillery against the approaching  enemy. He held his ground through wave after wave of German advances.  When the enemy surged, even coming within feet of him, he called in  artillery strikes on his own position.   Amazingly, when the dust settled, Lieutenant Conner was still alive,  and Allied artillery had destroyed the German tanks and stopped the  advance. On that frigid morning, in complete disregard for his own  safety, Lieutenant Conner saved the lives of his comrades.   This afternoon I will have the privilege to welcome Ms. Pauline  Conner, Garlin's wife of more than 50 years, and other family members  to the Capitol. Without Pauline's patience and steadfast resolve, there  would be no recognition tomorrow.   After the war, Lieutenant Conner demurred any sort of personal glory.  With the humility that is typical among the Greatest Generation, he  returned to his farm and planned to leave the war behind him. Later in  life, he took it upon himself to meet privately with his fellow  veterans and their families, offering comfort and advice.   One day late in Lieutenant Conner's life, a former Army Green Beret  named Richard Chilton came to their home to ask about his late uncle,  who had served with him in Europe. He saw all of Garlin's decorations  and medals and urged Pauline to apply for the Medal of Honor. That was  the first step. The path wasn't easy--filing paperwork, finding  eyewitness accounts, gathering support from the Kentucky Department of  Veterans Affairs, generals, and even Members of Congress. It was my  privilege to join Pauline's team when they contacted my office over a  decade ago. There were setbacks, even a Federal court ruling, but  Pauline and her team pushed forward. Her long journey will finally end  in victory when the Commander in Chief entrusts her with Garlin's Medal  of Honor tomorrow. I am grateful to President Trump, Secretary Mattis,  and Secretary Esper for recognizing this deserving Kentuckian.   I am proud to congratulate Pauline and her family today, and I would  like  [[Page S4354]]  to thank her for giving our Nation the opportunity to salute 1LT Garlin  Murl Conner. He embodied the highest values of our Commonwealth and of  our Nation, but this humble man never called himself a hero. So it is  incumbent upon us to do just that.   Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter, this afternoon  our colleagues will vote to pass the first 3 of 12 appropriations bills  for fiscal year 2019. When they do, the Senate will be putting more  common sense back into the appropriations process. This hasn't come  easily. But thanks to the leadership of Chairman Shelby and Ranking  Member Leahy, the process thus far has been governed by level-headed  bipartisanship.   I am optimistic the same will be true for the nine remaining  appropriations measures. Great progress has already been made at the  committee level, and I look forward to considering more legislation on  the floor soon.   It is particularly fitting that after the passage of the John S.  McCain National Defense Authorization Act for 2019 and historic  veterans legislation earlier this year, the first group of  appropriations bills includes much needed resources for the VA and for  military construction projects. This minibus also includes funding  under the Energy and Water title for critical maintenance of America's  ports and waterways infrastructure, for groundbreaking research on  energy development and efficiency, and for improvements to the safety,  security, and readiness of our nuclear arsenal.   Our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, in particular these  subcommittee chairmen--Senators Alexander, Boozman, and Daines--have  earned our support. This is worthy legislation. I look forward to  passing it today.                                  Farm Bill    Then, we will turn to another major priority--the farm bill. Under  Chairman Roberts' leadership, along with Ranking Member Stabenow, the  Agriculture Committee has continued its tradition of addressing the  needs of America's farmers and ranchers with the serious bipartisanship  they deserve.   Today the needs are great. In the face of declines in farm income,  growers and producers need certainty and stability, and that is what  this bill would help to provide. The committee reported the farm bill  to the full Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan margin. This week we  will have a chance to pass the bill in the same fashion.   On behalf of the farmers in my home State of Kentucky and around the  country, I hope each Senator will take advantage of this opportunity.                                  Tax Reform    Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, week after week the evidence  continues to mount that tax reform and the rest of the Republicans'  pro-growth, pro-family agenda is helping to reinvigorate our economy  and to set the stage for long-term job and wage growth. Just today,  CNBC is reporting that the percentage of Americans who say the economy  is good or excellent is the highest they have ever recorded in the  survey's 10-year history.   But amidst all of the headlines of long-term investments, business  expansions, and this favorable economic climate, it is important to  remember also all of the immediate ways the tax cuts themselves have  already meant direct relief for middle-class American families. Our  historic tax reform, which every single Democratic Senator opposed,  lowered income tax rates, doubled the standard deduction, and increased  the child tax credit. It has given employers the flexibility to  immediately pass savings along to their employees in the form of tax  reform bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits. It has allowed major  utility companies to forego planned rate hikes and, in cases, actually  cut the energy prices customers pay.   Every one of these provisions equals real money that will remain in  the hands of middle-class families, instead of being shipped off to the  IRS. Every one of these and all the other components of tax reform are  major improvements that every single Democrat in the House and in the  Senate voted against.   Now, if Democratic leaders are serious about wanting to repeal tax  reform, the tax cuts that are making it all possible would be right  back on the chopping block. Tax cuts used to be a bipartisan affair,  but not these days. Republicans will continue to stand up for the  American people and help them keep more of their hard-earned money.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 726; that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for the  consideration of the following nomination: Executive Calendar No. 601.  I ask consent that there then be 5 hours of debate, equally divided,  and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on  the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table;  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that  no further motions be in order; and that any statements related to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  June 26; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to H.R. 2. Further, I ask that the Senate recess from 12:30  p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.  Finally, I ask that all time during recess, adjournment, morning  business, and leader remarks count postcloture on the motion to proceed  to H.R. 2.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Brown.
