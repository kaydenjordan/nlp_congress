B. Hines, who  recently celebrated her 91st birthday.   Ms. Hines was raised in the gem of northeast Florida in the town of  Palatka, on the beautiful St. Johns River. She attended and graduated  from Central Academy in May of 1946. She went on to become a prolific  educator, dedicating 40 years of her life to the teaching profession.   Over the past few decades, Ms. Hines has made the historic  preservation of Central Academy her primary focus. Originally  established in 1892, Central Academy became the first accredited  African American high school in the State of Florida in 1924. Due to  its historic significance, Central Academy was added to the National  Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service in 1998.   Ms. Hines' mission is to turn this site into a museum and community  center. Her effort is supported by many in the Putnam County community,  and I stand here today to tell Ms. Hines that I will do all that is in  my power to ensure her dream becomes a reality.   Ms. Hines, God bless you and the important work that you do.    University of Florida Wins the George W. Bush Institute of Innovation                                   Award
