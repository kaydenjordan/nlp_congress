 Madam Speaker, auto insurance discrimination continues to  keep our residents in the cycle of poverty in Michigan.  [[Page H5480]]    The Prohibit Auto Insurance Discrimination Act, or PAID Act, would  prohibit auto insurance companies from using education level, marital  status, credit scores, ZIP Codes, Census tracts, or homeownership  status in insurance rating or underwriting decisions.   Madam Speaker, these factors don't determine your driving ability,  yet our neighbors, especially in my district, regularly face higher  auto insurance rates.   Currently many people are charged hundreds or even thousands of  dollars more based on these factors, even though they aren't related to  driving.   Madam Speaker, I don't know what the heck marital status or education  level have to do with whether or not you are a good driver.   This summer Michigan residents saw a 42 percent fee increase adding  on to higher fees that are still unaffordable for many families.   I am really grateful to be working with Congresswoman Bonnie Watson  Coleman on the PAID Act.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to please fight against this  discriminatory practice.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am the only Palestinian American serving in  Congress. My perspective is needed here now more than ever.   I will not be silenced, and I will not let you distort my words.  Folks forget I am from the city of Detroit, the most beautiful,  Blackest city in the country, where I learned to speak truth to power,  even if my voice shakes. Trying to bully or censure me won't work  because this movement for a cease-fire is much bigger than one person.  It is growing every single day.   There are millions of people across our country who oppose  Netanyahu's extremism and are done watching our government support  collective punishment and the use of white phosphorus bombs that melt  flesh to the bone.   They are done watching our government, Mr. Speaker, supporting  cutting off food, water, electricity, and medical care to millions of  people with nowhere to go.   Like me, Mr. Speaker, they don't believe the answer to war crimes is  more war crimes.   The refusal of Congress and the administration to acknowledge  Palestinian lives is chipping away at my soul. Over 10,000 Palestinians  have been killed. The majority were children.   Let me be clear: My criticism has always been of the Israeli  Government and Netanyahu's actions.   It is important to separate people and governments, Mr. Speaker. No  government is beyond criticism. The idea that criticizing the  Government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous precedent,  and it is being used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human  rights across our Nation.   Do you realize what it is like, Mr. Speaker, for the people outside  of the Chamber right now listening in agony to their own government  dehumanizing them, to hear the President of the United States we helped  elect dispute death tolls as we see video after video of parents and  dead children under rubble?   Mr. Speaker, do you know what it is like to feel rising hate crimes,  to know how Islamophobia and anti-Semitism make us all less safe, and  to worry that your own child might suffer the horrors that 6-year-old  Wadea did in Illinois?   I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not  disposable. We are human beings just like anyone else. My sity, my  grandmother, like all Palestinians, just wants to live her life with  the freedom and human dignity we all deserve.   Speaking up to save lives, Mr. Speaker, no matter faith, no matter  ethnicity, should not be controversial in this Chamber. The cries of  Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. What I do  not understand is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you- all.    We cannot lose our shared humanity, Mr. Speaker. I hear the voices of  advocates in Israel, in Palestine, across America, and around the world  for peace. I am inspired by the courageous survivors in Israel who have  lost loved ones yet are calling for a cease-fire and the end to  violence. I am grateful to the people in the streets for the peace  movement, with countless Jewish Americans across the country standing  up and lovingly saying: ``Not in our name.''   We will continue to call for a cease-fire, Mr. Speaker, for the  immediate delivery of critical humanitarian aid to Gaza, for the  release of all hostages and those arbitrarily detained, and for every  American to come home. We will continue to work for real, lasting peace  that upholds human rights and the dignity of all people and centers  peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, censures no  one, and ensures that no person, no child, has to suffer or live in  fear of violence.   Seventy-one percent of Michigan Democrats support a cease-fire. You  can try to censure me, but you can't silence their voices.   I urge my colleagues to join with the majority of Americans and  support a cease-fire now to save as many lives as possible. President  Biden must listen to and represent all of us, not just some of us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the President to have the courage to call for a  cease-fire and the end of killings.
