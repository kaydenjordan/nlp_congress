 Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks here, I want to  wish my eldest daughter, Karlyn Tiffany, a happy birthday.   Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a great American and resident of my  district in Wisconsin. Jim Staberg of Hudson served in the Army from  March of 1943 to June of 1946, and again September 1950 to July 1952.   During his first tour of duty, Mr. Staberg was originally assigned to  the Army band, but as America was drawn into World War II, he found  himself reassigned and serving as a gunner during vehicle patrols  throughout Europe.   Mr. Staberg was involved in a heroic defensive stand by the Allies  against Hitler's last charge at the Battle of the Bulge. He also served  at the historic Nuremburg trials following the war, but this was not  the end of Mr. Staberg's service.   Jim was shipped off to Korea for a second tour of duty, where he  would, once again, defend freedom in the face of communist aggression.  After his time in service, Jim married and had three children in  Hudson, Wisconsin, which he still calls home today.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful State and Nation, I thank Jim  Staberg for his service.                            ____________________
