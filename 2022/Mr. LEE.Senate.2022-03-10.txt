 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4989 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, a few short months ago, President Biden  issued a series of Executive orders. These Executive orders issued by  the Biden administration proposed some pretty sweeping mandates on the  American people, mandates insisting that covered persons, including for  our purposes today military employees, Federal workers, employees of  businesses with government contracts with the Federal Government, and  medical professionals who contract with CMS--basically anyone involved  with the provision of services through Medicare or Medicaid must get  the COVID-19 vaccine on condition of termination.   The way these mandates work is particularly nasty, especially if they  work for one of the private companies, as is the case with CMS and  independent contractor mandates. If they don't fire all their workers  who don't get vaccinated, then they basically are rendered out of  business.   Yes, the Federal Government was going to just impose these crippling  costs that no corporation could afford to carry. They knew that this  was creating a big issue and that this would force people into getting  vaccinated.   Here is the problem with that. Now, I want to be clear. I have been  vaccinated. My family has been vaccinated. I believe that vaccines have  made things safer and healthier for hundreds of millions of people. I  also believe that, like any medical procedure, it is not without risk,  particularly to some people who might have extreme sensitivities, who  might have an idiosyncratic response to the vaccine. So it is not right  to force this on everyone and to render those who refuse to get it not  only unemployed but unemployable.   I have received communications from countless people--for example,  military professionals, military officers, and enlisted personnel who  have worked for the U.S. military for nearly two decades, who are  actually coming up on retirement, who are saying that, for one reason  or another, they don't want to get the vaccine. Sometimes, it is  religious; other times, it is based on a history of poor reactions to  other vaccines or a prior medical condition that they believe would  cause them to respond poorly or based on natural immunity.   They don't want to get the vaccine, and they are being told that, in  the case of military personnel, if they don't get it, then they will  not receive  [[Page S1107]]  an honorable discharge. This could render them not only unemployed but  unemployable, and that is the case for many, many others subject to  these overreaching mandates.   Look, if we decided as a country that this was good policy, good  policy, like all good policy, should be embodied in law. In my copy of  the Constitution, the very first clause of the very first section of  the very first article says that ``all legislative Powers herein  granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall  consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'' Article I, section  7 makes the point even clearer. It says that in order to pass a law  within the Federal system and have it be a Federal law, it has to be  proposed in one body or the other, but it has to be the same  legislation passed by both Houses prior to its presentment to the  President for signature, veto, or acquiescence.   In this case, we have had none of those things. No, instead, you have  unilateral Executive action taken by the President and those working  within his administration. In the process, they have bypassed that this  set of mandates is largely unnecessary, dramatically overreaching, not  within the executive power granted to the executive branch of  government by the U.S. Congress, and is fundamentally immoral, in  addition to being wildly and increasingly unpopular.   You see, the little secret is, people don't like the government doing  things that are immoral. And all of us understand that you don't render  someone unemployed, unable to put bread on the table for their  children, simply because they won't bow to Presidential medical  orthodoxy. That is not right, it is not American, and it is not  constitutional, but more than anything, it is not moral.   We all know deep down that this is not right. This is not something  any of us would want to do. Not one of us would want to show up and  tell our own employees: You know, if you don't do what I say with  regard to a medical procedure you may not want and as to which you  might have legitimate, sincere religious objections or that might be  unnecessary because you have natural immunity, which, by the way-- recent studies have confirmed natural immunity is at least as good as  and, according to many studies released by many countries and studies  in possession of our own government, is indicated to be at least as  powerful as and in many cases more powerful than the immunity achieved  through the vaccine. None of us would do that to a friend, a neighbor,  or our own employee because we know it would be wrong; it would be  mean; it would be unkind.   You can't atone for the unkindness and the immorality in that by  claiming it is OK because it is through the government, especially not  when the President of the United States is flouting circumventing the  Constitution of the United States.   We have a chance to make this right. Yes, over time, sadly, Senates  and Houses of Representatives and White Houses of every conceivable  partisan combination have contributed to this because, yes, we have  given Executives too much power. I complained about it during the  previous administration in response to specific actions taken by the  previous President--who was a Member of my own party--sometimes at  great personal expense because I believe Congress has given the  Executive too much power. It is bad. It is harmful. It is dangerous. We  have to stop it somewhere.   We have a chance right now. We have a shot with something that is  wildly unpopular and inherently immoral, and that shot exists with not  funding it. We don't have to fund that part of government that goes to  fund these dangerous, immoral, unconstitutional vaccine mandates. We  shouldn't do it. I encourage all of my colleagues, all within the sound  of my voice, please end this madness now.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given a  minute to describe my amendment and a minute be given to the Senator  from Washington.    Mr. President, it is unkind for us to tell Americans--just  moms and dads, ordinary people who are trying to live their lives and  put food on the table--that they can't put food on the table and that  they are going to be rendered unemployed and unemployable unless they  defer to Presidential medical orthodoxy. It is not who we are as  Americans. It is especially not who we are as is the case with these  mandates. There are not adequate provisions made for those with  preexisting medical conditions, for those with religious objections,  and for those with natural immunity. That is what we are dealing with  here. It is illegal; it is immoral; it is unkind; and we should not  fund its enforcement.   I plead with my colleagues to support my amendment to defund the  enforcement of these mandates.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 seconds to  respond.    Mr. President, it is not helpful to American families to  threaten the breadwinner--the mom or the dad or, maybe, both of them in  some cases--with being rendered unemployed and unemployable and unable  to put bread on the table.   This is not about being anti-vaccine. I am not that, and neither are  any of the Senators who are supporting this effort. This is about  supporting American families. It is not supporting them to order them  fired.                          Vote on Amendment No. 4989     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
