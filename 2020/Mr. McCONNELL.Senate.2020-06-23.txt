 Madam President, 2 weeks ago, I argued that civil  discourse in America faces a crossroads.   A major newspaper had buckled under pressure from the social media  mob. They apologized profusely for publishing a policy argument from a  U.S. Senator and made personnel changes to prove their penitence. I  said that we could either recommit to our tradition of seasoned debate  or let an angry mob run our culture.   Recent days have reminded us that it is not just our present-day  debates that far-left radicals want to overwhelm. They also want to  rewrite the past.   Back in 2017, when people wondered whether our important  conversations over Confederate monuments would give the far left a  broader taste for pulling down statues, major newspapers and media  figures literally mocked that concern. They said there were obvious  differences between rebel generals and our Nation's Founders. They said  nobody would come gunning for Washington or Jefferson. Well, the far  left missed the memo.   A few days ago, in Portland, OR, a mob graffitied a statue of our  first President, pulled it down, and burned an American flag over his  head. This is George Washington.   Another Washington statue was defaced in Baltimore. A statue of  Thomas Jefferson was ripped down in Portland also. This is the general  and first President who built our Nation and the author of the  Declaration of Independence--genius statesmen who helped begin this  grand experiment that has  [[Page S3132]]  brought freedom to hundreds of millions and saved the world a few times  for good measure.   Yet, a crazy fringe is treating their monuments like vanity statues  of tinhorn tyrants. Our Founding Fathers are being roped to the ground  like they were Saddam Hussein.   The list goes on: Saint Junipero Serra, the missionary settler whom  Pope Francis celebrated here in Washington a few years ago to  bipartisan applause, sided with native people over soldiers; Ulysses S.  Grant, the general who crushed the Confederacy, the President who used  Federal force to fight the Klan. They, too, have been placed on the  historical hit list for this new Red Guard that nobody elected. There  are more monuments toppled up and down the west coast.   There could be no clearer sign that these far-left radicals have  severed any connection to the righteous cause of racial justice. They  have literally tried to succeed where Robert E. Lee failed and bring  General Grant to the ground.   Like any cultural revolution, this far-left anger is sparing some  heroes of their own. I understand that in Seattle, a large statue of  Vladimir Lenin stands quite untouched. Apparently, people claim with a  straight face that this Communist statue has survived because it is  located--wait for it--on private property. So the Founding Father of  the mass-murdering Soviet Union watches over Seattle streets, but our  own Founding Fathers are dragged in the dirt.   A small slice of our national elite has spent years cooking up  highfalutin theories to justify the cheapest, basest forms of anti- Americanism. The absurd claim that America's deepest founding principle  is bigotry has escaped the ivory tower and begun seeping into society.   The United States of America can and should have nuanced  conversations about our complex past. We can and should have  discussions about our future. We can and should have peaceful protests.  But this lawlessness serves none of that. It is just an alliance of  convenience between angry criminals who think it is fun to wreak havoc  and a slice of elite society that profits off saying that our country  is evil and deserves the abuse. Enough. Enough.   The vast majority of Americans know full well that imperfect heroes  are still heroes, that our imperfect Union is still the greatest Nation  in world history. Americans know that our imperfect Framers built our  Nation on moral truths that fueled improvement beyond anything their  generation could have built themselves. The American people know this.  They also know that we cannot let angry mobs carrying ropes act outside  the rule of law.   It was central to the 14th Amendment and the civil rights movement  that law enforcement and local authorities may not do their jobs  selectively. If ``equal protection of the laws'' means anything, it  means mayors and Governors cannot selectively stand down because they  would rather not pay the political price for confronting a particular  mob. But that is precisely what we are seeing in Democratic-governed  cities all across our country.   In Seattle, for weeks now, a mayor has let bands of people ban police  from several square blocks. People have been shot. A teenager has died.  But, apparently, stopping this insanity has been deemed less  politically correct than letting it continue. Night after night,  Governors and mayors have stood down and watched criminals spray paint  churches and topple statues. Public order is now totally optional and  depends on the lawbreaker's politics.   Here in Washington, last night, local police protected one monument  from a memorial-hunting mob over near the White House. It is past time  for that courage to be replicated in every city, every night, until  Americans have the peace and the rule of law that all of our citizens  deserve.   It is no surprise that people who want to say our country is  intrinsically evil are so frantic to erase history that they will break  the law to do it. Erasing history is the only way their claims could  carry any water.   Americans know that an imperfect nation built by imperfect heroes is  still the most perfect Union the world has ever seen. We are proud to  build statues of the geniuses who fought to found this country. We are  proud to build statues to the leaders who have preserved it. We are  proud to build statues of prophetic civil rights leaders who made the  country confront gross injustice. We thank God that all kinds of  imperfect people have made us a more perfect Union.   When the dust settles, it is never--never--the mobs or bullies whom  we honor. It is the brave leaders who confront them                            ____________________     Madam President, on a totally different matter, last  week, Senator Scott of South Carolina and a group of our colleagues  rolled out the JUSTICE Act--a serious set of proposals to move the ball  for police reform across the country.   This legislation identifies a number of smart levers that Congress  can pull to advance and encourage smart reforms of law enforcement  without steamrolling States' and localities' constitutional powers.   It would step up transparency in reporting and recordkeeping. It  would expand accountability and disciplinary measures needed to  establish and restore community trust. It would directly address  issues, such as choke holds and no-knock warrants, which have been in  the news lately for reasons that nobody believes are acceptable.   These are the subjects that the country needs us to address.  Accordingly, these are the subjects Senator Scott's proposal does  address.   The American people expect us to do our jobs, discuss, debate, and  legislate on this subject that has captured the Nation's attention-- discussion, debate, and votes on amendments.   Tomorrow, we will find out whether even these modest steps are a  bridge too far for our colleagues on the Democratic side.   Earlier this month, Senate Democrats were telling everyone who would  listen that we would be derelict in our duty if we did not have police  reform legislation on the floor of the Senate this month. But then, as  soon as the junior Senator from South Carolina actually published  something concrete, their tune changed rather sharply.   Now, suddenly, our Democratic colleagues are reportedly agonizing and  debating whether to let the Senate have this discussion at all or  whether to kill any chance of reform legislation before it can even  taxi onto the runway.   The American people deserve better than a partisan stalemate. The  American people deserve for the Senate to take up this issue at this  time.   Senate Republicans want to have this discussion. We are ready to make  a law, not just make a point.   Tomorrow, we will find out whether our Democratic colleagues share  our ambition or whether they choose to duck the issue and leave the  country in the lurch.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 621.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, June 24; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Wilson nomination and that the time until 11:30  a.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees;  that further notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent that  the postcloture time on the Wilson nomination expire at 11:30 a.m.  tomorrow; finally, that if confirmed, I ask that with respect to the  Wilson nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:38 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, June 24, 2020, at 10 a.m.
