 Mr. Speaker, getting Congress to enact widespread  campaign finance reform feels as likely as getting snow in Orange  County this Christmas. However, it shouldn't take a once-in-a-century  holiday miracle to get Washington to stop political fundraising scams.   Con artists are exploiting loopholes in our election laws by  fraudulently misrepresenting themselves as collecting donations meant  for causes and candidates. These scam PACs actually use the money to  line their own pockets. Worse, they target older Americans and  veterans.   As a consumer protection attorney, I will always work to hold  fraudsters accountable. With a Republican colleague, I have introduced  legislation to help the Federal Election Commission punish these bad  actors.   Americans of all political ideologies who participate in our  democracy by donating shouldn't have to fear being cheated. I urge  passage of my bipartisan bill to stop scam PACs.                            ____________________
