 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Today marks the Committee on Natural Resources' Subcommittee on  Water, Power and Oceans' first step in advancing an infrastructure  agenda that aims to improve our Nation's infrastructure and expedite  the development of new infrastructure.   As vice chairman of the subcommittee, chaired by the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), I have already seen a number of bills advance  through the committee that, like the bill in front of us today, employ  simple, pragmatic solutions to improve our Nation's infrastructure and  advance an all-of-the-above energy and water strategy.   The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, a bipartisan  bill offered by my colleagues, Mr. LaMalfa and Mr. Schrader, is about  avoiding electricity blackouts, preventing forest fires, and promoting  healthy habitat for wildlife on Federal lands.   This bill represents a simple, pragmatic solution to an issue that is  born out of a lack of communication and consistency within a Federal  agency.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Conaway for agreeing to help expedite  consideration of this bill today.   I commend my colleagues, Mr. LaMalfa from California and Mr. Schrader  from Oregon, for bringing up this bipartisan, commonsense piece of  legislation.   I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                       Washington, DC, May 19, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1873, the       Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. It is my       understanding that, on April 27, 2017, the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered the bill reported with amendments.        This legislation contains provisions within the Committee       on Agriculture's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of your       having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite       this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on       Agriculture will forego action on the bill. This is being       done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so       will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Agriculture with respect to the appointment of       conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and would request that you include a copy       of this letter and your response in the Committee Report and       in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of       this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                       Washington, DC, May 22, 2017.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 27, 2017, the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered reported as amended H.R. 1873, the       Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, by a       bipartisan roll call vote of 24 to 14. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an       additional referral to the Committee on Agriculture.        I ask that you allow the Committee on Agriculture to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Agriculture represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural       Resources to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I have no more speakers and I  am prepared to close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I commend the bill's  sponsors for bringing up this bipartisan, commonsense piece of  legislation. I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the goal of H.R. 1873 is to  provide certainty to utilities, their line workers, and their  consumers, not forcing unnecessary, one-size-fits-all regulations.   Each plan can be tailored by an individual utility based on the  service territory, region, and other characteristics. Some utilities  may not choose to submit plans because they are satisfied with their  local Forest Service office. Others, especially those who have rights- of-ways that predate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, may  not want to trigger Federal paperwork costs that are ultimately passed  on to their consumers.   This amendment, if adopted, would significantly burden Federal Land  Management agencies by inundating them with all kinds of submittals.  Additionally, if you want to increase the cost of this bill, then this  amendment will do just that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I would  inject additional bureaucracy into the bill that is unintended to do  exactly the opposite of what this bill intended to do.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to this amendment, but I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment prohibits any  loss of funds for wildfire suppression activities. The bill also  provides electric utilities with the certainty that they need to ensure  that downed trees do not fall on power lines, which would prevent many  of these wildfires from starting in the first place.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5031]]
