 Mr. President, less than 2 months ago, President Biden  emphasized a theme of unity at his inauguration.   ``Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this,'' he said.  ``Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our  nation.''   Admirable words, but so far they haven't been met with much action.  On the first big legislative test of his Presidency, coronavirus  legislation, President Biden and Democrats in Congress have pursued a  resolutely partisan course.   They have not only failed to invite Republican input in any  meaningful way, they deliberately excluded it by passing their  coronavirus package using budget reconciliation.   This allows them to pass the bill in the Senate by a simple majority  vote, instead of requiring the concurrence of 60 Senators to move to a  vote on the bill, which is typically how legislation is passed here in  the Senate, including the five coronavirus bills that we passed last  year, when the Republicans had the majority here in the Senate.   Now, Democrats' decision to use reconciliation might be  understandable if Republicans had declared our opposition to any  further coronavirus legislation, but, of course, that is not the case.   Republicans made it clear that we were willing to work with Democrats  on additional coronavirus legislation. In fact, 10 Republican Senators  put together a plan and met with President Biden for 2 hours to discuss  a bipartisan agreement. But while the President listened to them  graciously, Democrats and the President quickly made it clear that they  intended to move forward without Republican input.   Two days after Republicans met with President Biden, the House passed  its partisan budget resolution to pave the way for reconciliation here  in the Senate. Two days later, the Senate followed suit.   Clearly, there were no plans to let negotiations with Republicans  slow down the partisan juggernaut. In fact, Democrats have been pretty  determined to make sure Republicans don't have a voice in this  legislation at all.   During markups of the COVID relief package in House committees,  Republicans offered a number of amendments: 245 amendments, to be  exact. Out of those 245 amendments, Democrats accepted exactly one for  the final bill--one.   Among the amendments House Democrats rejected were commonsense  proposals to tie school funding to the reopening of schools. There was  an amendment to unfreeze funding for the Coronavirus Food Assistance  Program for farmers and ranchers. There were amendments to target  funding to overlooked rural communities and an amendment to protect  healthcare providers from frivolous lawsuits.   The one thing that can be said for the House is at least it gave  Members in the House a chance to review the bill in committee. Here in  the Senate, Democrats' COVID package will come to the floor without any  committee consideration. Senators are just supposed to accept whatever  the House sent over or whatever changes the Senate Democratic leader  makes, minus those items that are excluded from a reconciliation  package by Senate budget rules.   Democrats' partisan course on COVID legislation is particularly  disappointing because up until now, COVID relief has been a bipartisan  process.   That is right. To date, Congress has passed five COVID relief bills,  and every single one of those bills was overwhelmingly bipartisan.   The Republican-led Senate took up and passed COVID relief legislation  by margins of 96 to 1, 90 to 8, 96 to 0, 92 to 6, and one even went by  voice vote here in the Senate.   Back then, of course, Democrats thought that the minority party  should have a voice in the process. In fact, the Democratic leader  filibustered the original CARES Act, our largest COVID bill to date,  multiple times until he got a version that he was satisfied with.   Now that the Democrats are in the majority, however, they have  decided minority representation can be dispensed with. It is Democrats'  way or the highway on COVID legislation. Republicans and the Americans  that they represent will not be allowed to contribute.   I guess it is not surprising. After all, if the Democrats had pursued  a bipartisan process, they would probably have had to eliminate some of  the non-COVID-related provisions in this legislation, like the $86  billion bailout of multiemployer pension plans, hardly a coronavirus  emergency.   They might have been forced to trim their slush fund for States and  ensure that the distribution formula wasn't weighted heavily in favor  of blue States.   The Senator from Illinois was just down here talking about the  importance of helping out the States. Well, under the formula that they  have designed for this relief package, the dollars skew heavily,  surprisingly, to States like New York, where the Democratic leader is  from, or California, where the House Speaker is from, or Illinois,  where the Senate Democratic whip is from.   It seems like a lot of States around the country sort of got left out  when it came to how to distribute what is going to be a huge amount of  money that is going to go out to State and local governments if the  Democrats have their way with this bill. They might have had to reject  the measure to give labor unions and Planned Parenthood access to loans  designed to help small businesses--again, hardly something that we  ought to be doing in a coronavirus relief bill that is designed to make  sure that small businesses stay viable, but it does satisfy a lot of  Democrat special interest groups.    They might have had to tie funding for schools to school reopening-- seems like a fair consideration. There was an amendment offered during  the budget resolution when it was being considered on the floor of the  Senate that would have required schools where every teacher had the  vaccination to reopen in order to qualify for Federal assistance under  this legislation, but there is nothing about that in this bill. There  is nothing that, of all the money, the $128 billion that will go out to  schools--by the way, we put $68 billion out there already, much of  which hasn't been spent. But with all this money that would go out to  schools, there is no stipulation anywhere in this legislation that  would attempt to tie funding for schools to their reopening so that we  can get our kids back to school and learning again in that environment.   In fact, it would be arguable, I think, that the schools, if the  teachers can get vaccinated--and that was the very language of the  amendment that was offered in the budget resolution by Republicans. It  was defeated here in the Senate on a 50-50 vote. All Republicans voted  for it, all Democrats against it. But again, all it simply said was  that if you are going to get Federal funding under this bill and all of  the teachers in your school are vaccinated against the coronavirus,  then you have to reopen. If you don't reopen after all the teachers  have been vaccinated, then you don't get funding under this bill. That  seems like a fairly straightforward request, given the fact that so  many schools across this country and so many of our kids continue to  have to learn virtually at a time when we need to have them in the  classroom. This is obviously something that wasn't included in this  legislation.   I would argue that all the changes that I have just mentioned would  have made the bill better, but they might not have made the Democrat  allies as happy. This whole process could have been different. We could  be here today with another bipartisan COVID bill that would speed up  vaccination and help our country through the rest of the pandemic. In  fact, as I said, there were lots of Republicans who were interested in  negotiating, sitting down with Democrats to do just that.   The Democrat whip, the Senator from Illinois, was down here saying:  Wouldn't it be great if this could be bipartisan like the other bills  we have  [[Page S1005]]  done earlier that were bipartisan? I would simply point out the  obvious, and that is that all of the bills that were done last year  when Republicans had the majority here in the Senate were bipartisan  because we did them under regular order. We did them under the 60-vote  threshold that is required to move legislation through the Senate.   What the Democrat leadership has opted to do is to use a rarely used  legislative vehicle here--budget reconciliation--to do a bunch of  things that they could do simply with 51 votes, and it was pretty clear  to me that they had no intention ever of including Republican ideas or  involving Republicans in developing this legislation or, ultimately,  having Republican support for at the end. In fact, that was probably  made most clear by a statement made by the Chief of Staff to President  Biden in the White House when he described this as ``the most  progressive domestic legislation in a generation,'' suggesting, of  course, that this is filled with all kinds of liberal priorities, most  of which have very little to do with the coronavirus.   In fact, if you look at where the funding goes in this, the $1.9  trillion, less than 10 percent--less than 10 percent--deals with  funding for public healthcare; in other words, funding for vaccines,  either for production or distribution; funding for providers; funding  more mental health; funding for anything related to healthcare. If you  look at the $1.9 trillion, it is less than 10 percent. Less than 10  percent of it is actually directed at addressing the actual healthcare  crisis that we are facing as a nation.   I would simply say that it is pretty clear to me that if Democrats  had wanted to, they could have had--easily could have had--a bipartisan  bill. There are 10 Republicans I know of today who would have voted for  a bill that would include funding for vaccines, that would include  funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, that would include funding  for unemployment checks, that actually would have included funding for  direct checks to go out, which I know is a very popular thing. But that  consultation never occurred. That desire to get input never happened-- that offer to allow the committees of jurisdiction to even have a voice  or any input into this.   Frankly, if I am a Democrat here in the Senate, I would be outraged  that my committees were bypassed completely. There was no consideration  at any committee--any committee--here in the Senate about what the  contents of this legislation should be or what the substance of it  should look like in the end. It was literally ramrodded, coming from  the House of Representatives, taken up by the Democratic leadership  with no input from the committees--Republicans, for sure, but also  Democrats, of all people, who you think would want to be heard. I mean,  they got these chairmanships of these committees for a reason. They  finally got the majority, and they have committee gavels and all that,  and here we are, talking about $1.9 trillion in spending, and the  committee chairs, the committees themselves had no action when it comes  to shaping or in any way producing this legislation.    So to suggest, as the Democrat whip, Senator Durbin, did earlier,  that he really hopes that this will be bipartisan, I just--it is hard  to take that even seriously, given how this is proceeding and how the  Democrats opted to do this relative to how the other five coronavirus  relief bills were passed last year under the Republican majority.   We are looking instead at a partisan bill that directs billions of  taxpayer dollars to projects and policies that have nothing to do with  overcoming COVID. And just as one observation--again, I made this point  on the floor yesterday. But one thing that we need to remember here is  that we are talking about real money here, and we are talking about it  all being borrowed money. This is all money that goes on the debt.  Every dollar that we are going to provide of the $1.9 trillion that is  proposed in this Democrat bill is a borrowed dollar. These are all  dollars that go on the debt, the debt which has grown dramatically in  this last year, in some cases because we had to move aggressively, as  we did last year at this time in March with a bill that would get  immediate assistance out there to people who desperately needed it. We  were fighting at that time a major emergency, a major crisis. Well,  here we are, a year later. We have a very different perspective on the  world today than we did 12 months ago. But that $1.9 trillion, when  added to the other coronavirus relief bills, ends up being about $6  trillion--$6 trillion. That amount of money is absolutely hard to  comprehend and hard to fathom. And we are talking about compounding the  $4 trillion or so already out there with another $2 trillion with this  bill, and as I pointed out yesterday, at some point--at some point--the  chickens come home to roost. You cannot continue down this path without  consequence on the economy.   Now, the argument in support of this legislation made by Democrats is  that we need to do more; we have got to get this out there; we have got  to stimulate the economy. My fear in a lot of respects right now is  that the economy could be overstimulated. The Congressional Budget  Office said just recently that without any additional assistance, the  economy is going to grow in 2021 at 3.7 percent, and we are flooding  the zone with so much money that the money supply numbers have been  exploding.   The 2020 money supply was up--the M2 as they measure it--was up 26  percent. Year over year, from 2000 to 2019, it averaged about 6  percent. This year it is going to be up another 12 percent. There is a  lot of money out there in the economy. What does that mean long-term  for our economy and for the individual workers in our economy? Well,  first off, it means that as there are more and more dollars chasing  fewer goods, you are going to get inflation. That is inevitable. When  you get inflation, typically what happens is interest rates follow  because those who are buying that debt, if it is being lost to  inflation, want to make sure that they are getting a return on their  investments, so interest rates start to go up.   When interest rates go up, the amount of money we borrow becomes even  more expensive because we have to pay interest. We have to finance that  debt. So the amount of interest--the amount of Federal tax dollars that  we will be using to pay for interest on the debt will explode and will  swamp--it will swamp, literally--the amount of tax revenue coming into  this country. We know that because the debt is so large already, and we  know that because interest rates have been low for a long time, which  has lulled everybody into a sense of complacency that this is not going  to have any impact, that there is no downside. We can just keep  borrowing because interest rates are low.   Well, if you keep putting as much money out there as we are--another  $2 trillion out into the economy--I would argue that you are not only  going to unleash inflation, which has a dramatic consequence for our  fiscal situation as a country, but it also has a dramatic consequence  for the personal financial situation of the American family because  when inflation takes off, everything that people have to buy, from food  to gasoline to clothing--all those things go up. Inflation pushes the  prices of things higher, which means they are more expensiv to the  average family in this country.    Then the other effect, long-term, is when inflation starts to go up,  as I said, interest rates start to follow. We are already starting to  see some evidence of that. When interest rates go up, not only does the  Federal Government fiscal picture get much, much worse because the  amount of tax dollars that we have to spend to finance our debt grows  dramatically, but the American consumer is also faced with higher  interest rates. So mortgage payments go up if somebody is trying to  finance a home. Interest rates on cars, automobiles, will go up.  Interest rates on student loans go up. That also has a direct impact on  the pocketbooks of people in this country.   Mr. President, I am going to conclude, but I think it is really  important to point out--and I know that my State is not indicative of  every State around the country. There are States that have legitimate,  different financial situations. But in South Dakota right now, we have  3-percent unemployment. We have a growing economy. We have a State that  has already benefited significantly from earlier coronavirus relief  legislation to the point where there are dollars that they  [[Page S1006]]  are still trying to figure out how to use from the previous  installations of Federal spending that we have put out there. It just  seems to me that we ought to, given the potential adverse consequence  of higher interest rates, higher inflation, higher debt and spending,  think about that what we are doing here should be very targeted. It  should be very specific.   We know now--we have a lot more insight into where the needs are in  the economy than we did at this point last year, in March, when we did  the first CARES package. We are at a time now when it is very clear  where those needs are, and we could come up with a much more targeted  bill. Those 10 Republicans that I have mentioned have come up with a  bill that is in the $600 billion to $700 billion range, which addresses  the healthcare issues, addresses the unemployment insurance issues,  addresses the PPP program. It deals with direct checks, as I mentioned.  It has got funding for education. I think some funding is in there for  State and local governments, which, frankly, as I said, I am not for. I  would rather see us take those dollars, if we are going to put them  somewhere, put them toward something that is more targeted, at least a  formula that makes more sense.   But let me just say that in my view it is really important right now  that we be circumspect. We are talking about borrowed money. This is  now--this is the house of dollars. This is not--this isn't just magic  money that appears out of nowhere. Every single dollar that we are  using is borrowed, will be added to the debt, will be a liability for  somebody to have to pay back--for our kids and our grandkids. And if  the potential economic impacts that I mentioned actually occur and  interest rates start to tick up, it is going to be a lot more expensive  money to finance in the future, and I think that is a very real  consideration. It is something we ought to be thinking long and hard  about, not just because of the fiscal situation that the country faces  right now but because of the financial situation every American family,  as they sit around the kitchen table and talk about these pocketbook  issues, will be looking at. If we see higher inflation, if we see  higher interest rates, it is going to affect their jobs; it is going to  affect their cost of living; and it is going to make it that much  harder for them to make ends meet.   Less than 2 months after the President committed himself to unity at  his inauguration, the first major bill of his Presidency will be a  resolutely partisan piece of legislation. I hope--I hope--that this is  not a sign of things to come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
