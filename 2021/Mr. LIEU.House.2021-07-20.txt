 Madam Speaker, 5 days ago, millions of American families  with children received Child Tax Credit refunds deposited directly into  their bank account. This is hundreds of dollars that they could use for  childcare expenses, to put gas in their cars to go to work, and to help  fuel our economy.   This is going to happen again next month, and again in the middle of  September. And these payments go out again the middle of October, and  again the middle of November, and again the middle of December. This is  critical lifesaving money. These are tax cuts directly to the American  people.   And how did this happen? It happened because every Democrat voted for  the Child Tax Credit. Every Republican voted ``no.'' We want to give  Republicans another chance at this. We are going to try to make this  Child Tax Credit permanent. We want this tax cut to the American people  permanent, and the contrast could not be clearer. When Democrats are in  control, we give tax cuts to the middle class.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would ask to engage Representative Neguse in  a colloquy to ask a question.    Mr. Speaker, that wonderful tax cut for American families  with children, did any Republican congressman vote for it?    That's right. It was Democrats in the House, Democrats in  the Senate that got the American Rescue Plan signed into law, and  President Biden enacted it.   Some of you may wonder, well, what else is in this American Rescue  Plan.   So we have this amazing tax cut for millions and millions of American  families with children, but in addition, the American Rescue Plan was  designed to do four things: To get shots into arms, children into  schools, people back on their jobs, and cash in their pockets. And it  is doing all four of those.   We know that since January 20, there has been over 3 million jobs  created under the Biden-Harris administration. We know that jobless  claims have been cut in half. The American Rescue Plan had stimulus  checks go out to millions of Americans who needed cash in their  pockets. It also provided billions of dollars to schools across our  country so they could reopen safely, and it also had money for  restaurants and small businesses. It had additional economic injury  disaster grants. It also had shuttered venue grants to help those  shuttered venues. It was so full of programs to help the American  people that we now have projections that our GDP is now going to  skyrocket.   We see people coming back into jobs, and we see America back on  track, and not a single Republican voted for that American Rescue Plan.   You know what else was in that plan? Funding for local government. I  served in local government. I was on the Torrance City Council; I loved  that job. It is very clear to me that one of the big aspects of local  government funding is funding for public safety, funding for our  firefighters, funding for police officers. Not a single Republican  voted for that local funding for public safety. This American Rescue  Plan was a transformative law and it is still continuing to provide  benefits to the American people.   Just a few days ago, as Representative Neguse mentioned, on July 15,  most American families got a tax refund--hundreds of dollars. This is  going to happen again the middle of next month; they are going to get  hundreds of dollars again. And then it is going to happen again on the  15th of September, and again on the 15th of October, and again on the  15th of November, and again on December 15.   This is transforming the lives of Americans. It is allowing  hardworking parents to have cash to provide childcare, cash to get gas  for their car, to go to work, to get back into our economy, get back  into the labor market; and again, not a single Republican in the House  or in the Senate voted for the American Rescue Plan. And this was just  the first 6 months of Democrats in control.   What did the Republicans do when they were in control? Well, they  also did give tax cuts, except it went to the top 1 percent. It went to  billionaires. And all of you know that, because you didn't get a tax  cut. You would have remembered if you did, but you didn't. The American  people actually did not get this, because it went mostly to  billionaires.   Democrats and Republicans, very starkly different. The first 6 months  in office, we chose to give a tax cut to the middle class, to families  with children, and we are not done. Now we are working on the American  Jobs Plan that is going to have an infrastructure component. It is  going to have money for elder care. It is going to have workforce  retraining. It is going to help restore the millions of jobs that were  lost during this pandemic. We are working on the American Families  Plan, because this amazing tax cut for families with children, we want  to make it permanent. We want to give Republicans another chance to  vote for it, because we want to make this tax cut for families with  children permanent. Hopefully, we are going to get bipartisan support  for that.   What else is going to be in the American Jobs Plan and the American  Families Plan? It is going to have funding also for education. Studies  show that in terms of education, the most impact it can have on a human  being's life is under the age of five. So we are going to have funding  to have universal preschool for three- and four-year-olds. This is when  their brains are developing. This is when you can have tremendous  impact that is going to affect them for the rest of their lives.   We are going to extend higher education funding to provide free  community college for anyone who wants it. We are in the 21st century  now. We simply have to expand our education. People have to learn more  skills so they can prepare for the economy of the 21st century.   Hopefully, Republicans will join us. Hopefully, we will get  bipartisan support, and we will continue to make America as great as we  want it to be and to move forward on a bipartisan basis. We ask  Republicans to join us, but for now, we do know not a single one of  them voted for the American Rescue Plan.     That is correct. Even though a number of them took credit  for that program, they actually didn't vote for it. So I don't want the  American people to be confused. If your Republican Member of Congress  claims credit for the American Rescue Plan, they did not vote for it.  But hey, if they want to talk good things about it, we are happy to  accept it, but your Republican Member of Congress did not vote for the  American Rescue Plan.
