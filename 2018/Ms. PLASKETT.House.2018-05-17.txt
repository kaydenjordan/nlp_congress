 Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose the Roskam  amendment to the Agriculture and Nutrition Act.   This amendment is deeply unfair to territories in the United States  and contrary to the original intent of the Animal Welfare Act of 1976.  That intent was to aid State and local law enforcement in jurisdictions  where gamefowl events were prohibited from transport from jurisdictions  which allow it.   Mr. Speaker, cockfighting, like horse racing, is a longstanding  recreational activity in the U.S. Virgin Islands with historical and  cultural significance. It is regulated in the Virgin Islands along with  Puerto Rico.   I understand the concerns of those opposed to this sport and believe  regulatory processes and educational outreach are the best means within  those jurisdictions to address them.   Outlawing cockfighting in the U.S. territories will only create  underground industries, which will prove problematic and create  criminality, particularly for men of color.   Mr. Speaker, to pass an amendment that solely affects the territories  that none of the Delegates from the territories support is pejorative,  paternalistic, yes, colonialist, and downright wrong. The territories  have always been treated unfairly under numerous important Federal laws  and programs, and this amendment, sadly, is yet another example.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time.   I would posit to my colleague across the aisle who said that we are  trying to pit farm producers against food recipients, I believe that it  is this bill that has done that.   We have worked in a bipartisan manner for, I understand, years before  this bill was put through without being discussed, without the hearings  on both sides of the aisle.   I try to think about what it would have meant to impose the massive  system of new SNAP requirements under the bill during the time  immediately after the islands were hit by two Category 5 hurricanes.  How would families submit their monthly paperwork? How would they go to  jobs at businesses that were shut down? How would job slots be provided  when localities must focus on providing receipts?   There is no accommodation for disaster-impacted areas in this bill.  And if the majority did not think to exempt out these communities, what  else was overlooked in terms of reasonable standards?   Unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to work with the  majority to get answers to such key questions before this bill was  unveiled and rushed to the floor.   This doesn't add any help to farmers facing record-low income and  commodity prices or hardships due to trade retaliation, as my colleague  from Illinois discussed earlier. It does not support farmer mental  health, appropriate funding for broadband, or tackling the opioid  epidemic.   This bill cuts hundreds of millions out of rural development and  energy initiatives and falls short on assisting beginning, underserved,  and veteran farmers. Why? Because it is not a bipartisan bill.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
