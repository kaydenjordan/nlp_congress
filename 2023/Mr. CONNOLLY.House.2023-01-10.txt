 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that this Select Committee on the  Strategic Competition Between the United States and China will be a  sober and comprehensive engagement of the very important challenge  China poses to American security and prosperity and that of our allies,  and not a cynical descent into the worst impulses of Republican  oversight efforts.   This select committee offers an opportunity for this body to assess  and act on how the United States can compete with the CCP on advanced  manufacturing, trade, and emerging technologies; lead the world in  competition between democracy versus autocracy; and to bring to light  the autocratic practices and human rights violations in Hong Kong, the  Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and Tibet.   As president of NATO's legislative arm, I was proud to partner with  my colleagues in this body on both sides of the aisle and on both sides  of the Atlantic to put China on the NATO agenda for the very first time  in its 70-year history.    I am hopeful this select committee can also follow the lead of the  Congressional Taiwan Caucus, which I co-chair and have co-chaired for  10 years, to use this committee as a venue to express bipartisan  support for Taiwan's democracy, independence, and territorial  sovereignty instead of driving wedges that can only advance the  interests of those we seek to expose.   Using this committee to drive partisan wedges would be a missed  opportunity, and I am hopeful we will not do that.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to tackle the geopolitical question of our generation and to make  this a bipartisan inquiry and effort.
