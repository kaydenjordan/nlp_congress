 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Chairman Engel's  amendment, inspired by a bipartisan New START bill, which is  cosponsored by Mr. McCaul, the ranking member, and of which I am a  proud cosponsor. It is a bill that urges extension of the New START  Treaty.   Russia's broad range of destabilizing influence is well known. We  need to do everything we can to constrain Russia's arsenal to the best  of our ability, and we have an effective tool in place.   We have heard from so many leaders about why this is important,  people who support this amendment, like General John Hyten, Commander  of the United States Strategic Command.
