 Mr. President, the Senate has a solemn duty to exercise  and fulfill U.S. Federal trust responsibility. This duty is the guiding  principle for all our work on behalf of American Indians, Alaska  Natives, and Native Hawaiians. So as the chairman of the Senate  Committee on Indian Affairs, it is my job to prioritize and push Tribal  and Native communities' legislative priorities toward the finish line  and ultimately to actually enact legislation.   The Indian Affairs Committee has a strong tradition of bipartisanship  going back decades. Committee Members on both sides of the aisle  routinely work together to achieve their own Native communities' goals.  When there are disagreements, we do everything we can to work them out  internally and to find common ground so that Members aren't forced to  air their disagreements when bills get to the floor.   In fact, just last night, the Senate passed eight Indian Affairs  bills unanimously. Those bills would, among other things, promote  economic development, protect Native children, honor Tribal self- determination--goals that we all agreed take important steps toward  fulfilling our shared Federal trust responsibilities. Time and again,  we have shown that the Indian Affairs bills can rise above partisan  logjams. That compromise can be found. But here we are.   H.R. 478, which passed the House on May 12, 2021, under suspension of  the rules, would help to rebuild Tribal homelands; and S. 789, which  passed the Senate unanimously in late November 2019, would repeal 11  obsolete, racist, unenforced laws that are inconsistent with the  current government-to-government relationship enjoyed by the United  States and Indian Tribes.   Both bills would likely be laws by now if the COVID-19 pandemic had  not disrupted our legislative work last year. These bills are good  policy. That is why both Republican and Democratic administrations  support them.   And the Senate should have passed these bills last night, but because  there was an objection to their inclusion in the 10-bill package, we  find ourselves here again. The Indian Affairs Committee, as is  tradition, has negotiated in good faith to clear up any concerns there  may be, but those efforts were not successful, which leads me to this  moment.   When it comes to fulfilling the U.S. trust responsibility, there is  no room for partisanship.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of the following bills en bloc: Calendar No. 59, H.R.  478, the Blackwater Trading Post Land Transfer Act; and Calendar No.  53, S. 789, the RESPECT Act; further, that the bills be considered read  a third time and passed en bloc and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening  action or debate.    Mr. President, a couple of points. On taking 55.3 acres  into trust, this is not like the Federal Government is going to have  new land management responsibilities. This is a matter of principle for  the Senator from Utah, and I recognize that; that he thinks, basically,  no additional land should be taken into trust, even though this  government-to-government relationship--this authority over these  government relationships are enshrined in the Constitution of the  United States and this government-to-government relationship has  already been established by statutory law and the process for putting  land into trust is already a well-established pathway. But what the  Senator from Utah is saying is no more or we are going to have to do a  one-for-one swap or even sometimes a two-for-one swap. You cannot have  a net increase in the acreage, even if it is 53 acres, even if there is  an established process.   And so, I do find that difficult to work with. I know that the  Senators from Arizona are in discussions with the Senator from Utah.   We will find our way forward. This is 53 acres. It is important,  obviously. We are going to enact this legislation.   I like the Senator from Utah. We will find a way on this one.   But if he would entertain an amendment to the request, then I would  be pleased to pass the RESPECT Act by voice vote, if that is something  that the Senator from Utah would be amenable to.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 53, S. 789.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
