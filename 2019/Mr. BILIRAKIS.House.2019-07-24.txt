 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member.   Robocalls and spoofing have been a burden to Americans for years. It  is very simple; it goes without saying: We must end these bad  robocalls. Our constituents are fed up.   At a hearing 3 years ago, I was able to highlight a constituent who  received hundreds of calls daily to his home phone. His quality of life  became so poor, Madam Speaker, he had to replace his phone hardware and  phone number to get the peace he deserved in his own home. The Stopping  Bad Robocalls Act will help ensure that situations like this become  less frequent and, eventually, nonexistent.   This bill will provide much-needed authority for the FCC to develop  rules for blocking robocall violators and enhance the ability to pursue  these bad actors and bring them to justice for taking advantage of the  American people, especially our seniors.   I am also pleased this package includes the Ending One-Ring Scams  Act, which Representative Clarke and I introduced this year. This  provision will direct the FCC to target one of the newest forms of  caller scams and show that we are serious in combating all forms of  illegal phone fraud, no matter the tactics used.   I strongly support the Stop Bad Robocalls Act, and I urge the Senate  to pass this much-needed legislation, as well.
