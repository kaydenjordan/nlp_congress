 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the CR, in part,  because we need to extend CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance  Program, for the 104,000 children in Indiana who currently rely on the  program.   We must provide longer term stability to CHIP, and we have the  opportunity to do so here today. CHIP is crucial for families who would  otherwise slip through the cracks. Their income disqualifies them from  traditional Medicaid, but it is not high enough to afford family health  insurance. CHIP provides children with comprehensive health and dental  services, and it has helped decrease the rate of uninsured children in  Indiana to an all-time low of 5 percent.   The families of these 104,000 children in Indiana rely on CHIP and,  this 6-year reauthorization will grant States the much-needed certainty  in administering CHIP for American children across the country and  stability for the Hoosier families who depend on the program.   Furthermore, today's CR includes a 2-year relief from the medical  device tax. America tops the world in medical innovation, and relief  from this tax will further reinforce this leadership. The previous 2- year suspension of this damaging tax has allowed device companies, many  of which call Indiana home, to invest in research and development and  invest in high-quality, high-paying jobs and medical innovation, all to  the benefit of patients who need them the most.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the CR. Not only does it  provide long-term stability for CHIP and relief from the medical device  tax, but it also provides government funding through February 16 to  prevent a shutdown. Like Chairman Frelinghuysen, I hope this will  provide the time we need to complete the fiscal year 2018  appropriations bills.   Voting ``yes'' today is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on final passage.
