 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when  it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Police  Week across the country, I rise on the House floor this afternoon to  honor the memory of the five fallen police officers who we lost last  year in eastern Kentucky.   Three police officers in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, paid the ultimate  sacrifice when they were tragically shot in the line of duty on June  30, 2022:   Ralph Harlow Frasure, a 39-year law enforcement veteran who served as  captain of the Prestonsburg City Police Department for nearly four  decades and a beloved school resource officer at Prestonsburg High  School.   William Edward Petrey, a 31-year law enforcement veteran who served  the Kentucky State Police, the Prestonsburg Police Department, and,  finally, the Floyd County Sheriff's Office.   Jacob Russell Chaffins, a young 28-year-old law enforcement officer  who courageously served the Kentucky Army National Guard, the  Prestonsburg Police Department, and the Prestonsburg Fire Department  and became a U.S. marshal.   Their heroic deaths were the greatest display of love described in  John 15:13: ``Greater love has no man than this: to lay down his life  for his friends.''   It was with great courage of conviction that those three officers  lived to protect the people of the United States, the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, and especially those in Floyd County.   Two hours west in my district, the London Police Department also  grieves the loss of two of their brave officers last year:   Logan Medlock, a young 26-year-old officer with the London City  Police Department, a volunteer firefighter for the Keavy Fire  Department, and a former correctional officer, was struck and killed by  a drunk driver on October 30, 2022. Officer Medlock worked in lockstep  with his father, Randy Medlock, on the police force. Together, they  strived to make the city of London a safer place to live.   Finally, Travis Hurley, a beloved 21-year veteran of the London  Police Department lost a long battle with COVID-19 early last year.   The names of these five brave men will be engraved on the National  Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C., along with  the names of two other officers from my district:   Oliver Little, a Floyd County sheriff's deputy who died from  complications after contracting COVID-19 in the line of duty in 2021.   Dixon Allen Sasser, a veteran of the Harlan Police Department who was  shot and killed in the line of duty back in 1918.   President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a former commissioner of the  New York City Police Department, once said, ``No man is worth his salt  who is not ready at all times to risk his body, to risk his well-being,  to risk his life, in a great cause.''   In a nation where police officers have been vilified in recent years  by the actions of a few bad actors, may the lives of these fallen  officers be a reminder of the outstanding integrity and sacrifice that  the thin blue line represents.   We must continue to support our law enforcement officers across the  country, ensuring they are fully equipped, adequately prepared, and  never at the mercy of evildoers.   This Nation owes a great debt of gratitude for the valiant service of  our fallen heroes. May their loved ones find peace and confidence in  God's promise in Matthew 5:9: ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they  will be called children of God.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
