 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exemplary  citizen, Ms. Crystal Skidmore of West Virginia.   Between 2000 and 2001, around 127,000 children were adopted in the  United States, one of whom was Crystal's son whom she gave up for a  better life. That same year, only 44 percent of the 3.1 million  unintended pregnancies ended in birth.   Instead of giving up hope and having an abortion, Crystal looked to  Jesus and chose life for her child. To this day, she protects her son's  name when she shares her story. But by the grace of God, she still has  a close relationship with him and his adoptive family.   Isaiah 40:31 reads: ``. . . but those who hope in the Lord will renew  their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and  not grow weary; they will walk and not grow faint.''   She has described the miracle of her son in a poem she wrote, titled,  ``Precious Little Son.'' It goes like this:       Today's the day that you were made      A new life has been begun      Within the womb inside of me      My precious little son.      From this first day you changed me      Now through your eyes I see      Do I want your eyes to look at      The same things that I see?      I look around at this world of mine      In a way I have never done      I think . . . Is it safe here      For my precious little son?      Sadly I know      The answer is no      So I drop down to my knees      I cry as I ask Jesus      Please help you and me.      Where are the smiling faces      For your new eyes to see?      They are not here in my world      If I die, they may never be.      I can only protect you for a while      While you are safe inside of me      So I search for smiling happy faces      For your brand-new eyes to see.      Again I ask Jesus      To help me find someone      To love this life inside of me      My precious little son.      I know someone is waiting.      God has chosen them      To give you all the love you need      And make you part of them.      How I know you need them      How they have prayed for you to come      So they can share a part of their world with      Their precious little son.      I found the happy smiling faces      That I want you to see      And they can't wait to meet their son      Who lives inside of me.      Their world is so much brighter      So I share my love for you      With lots of happy smiling faces      And they will let me love you too.      I will always love you      I want you to know      You are in my heart forever      You are everywhere I go.      Now we wait on your arrival      We can't wait for you to see      How good it feels to share a love      That only through God can be.      Our happy smiling faces      Stand together now as one      To love this life inside of me      Our precious little son.    May God be with you.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Budd, and I appreciate  this bill.   I rise in strong support of the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary  Cities Act. It is high time the United States Congress address the  dangers of sanctuary city policies.   I think it comes at a very important time, as we are suffering or  could suffer from a pandemic that we are facing. To have open borders  and let anybody in doesn't make sense now, nor does it make sense in  the future. I commend my colleagues, Representatives Ted Budd and  Bradley Byrne, for their leadership in holding sanctuary cities  accountable to the law.   Make no mistake, sanctuary cities kill by offering safe havens to  some of the most violent and reckless criminals residing in this  country. Sanctuary cities put American lives at risk every single day.   Only a few months ago, an illegal alien, Nemias Perez-Severiano  killed a 67-year-old Vietnam war veteran, U.S. Marine, Samuel W.  Jackson, inside a sanctuary county in Pennsylvania.   Jackson risked his life to defend a country that now refuses to  protect his life. Counties like Montgomery in Pennsylvania are an  insult to patriots like Jackson.   My district has no sanctuary cities, but that does not guarantee our  safety. In Lancaster, South Carolina, just a few miles from where I  live, Charlie Byrdic, an innocent and law-abiding citizen, was killed  by an illegal immigrant who had hidden from authorities for years.  Without the cooperation of sanctuary cities with law enforcement  agencies, more families will lose their loved ones because criminals  are allowed to roam our Nation without consequences. That is why we  need this legislation.   This bill will offer a measure of justice to the victims of those  violent crimes by allowing victims and their families to sue the cities  that house these assailants.   Enough is enough. No American should lose his or her life, liberty,  or property, because the government refuses to act against known  criminals, immigrants or not.   The choice is ours; do we want to be the kind of country that  protects the victims of crime or the perpetrators of crime? I know  where I stand. It is time to fight against this thing that is plaguing  our country of opening up our borders to anyone.
