 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2379, the  State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act.   This legislation provides critical resources to State and local  governments combating the opioid crisis that has crippled communities  across the United States, including Utah.   This legislation will give State and local governments flexibility in  addressing this tragic epidemic in their communities.   For example, in Utah there are significant socioeconomic differences  between Price and Orem, two communities I represent that are both  fighting addiction.   We have to allow experts on the ground to address these challenges  accordingly, which is why I strongly support this legislation.   Equally as important is ensuring we have the workforce to treat  individuals suffering with addiction.   That is why I recently introduced the Helping Enable Access to  Lifesaving Services Act, or the HEALS Act.   The HEALS Act would complement the State opioid response grants with  targeted Federal dollars to help train future behavioral healthcare  workers in areas of high need.   Taken together, these are the necessary steps to fight addiction in  communities across our country, which has taken the lives of nearly  100,000 Americans in this past year alone.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2379 and my legislation, the  HEALS Act.
