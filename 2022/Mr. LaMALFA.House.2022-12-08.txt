 Mr. Speaker, in 2019, Hunter Biden foolishly abandoned a  laptop at a computer repair store, a laptop that revealed Joe Biden was  fully aware of his son's foreign corrupt business dealings. Not only  that, but Hunter's business also profited President Biden financially  and influenced foreign policy.   But the American people weren't allowed to know this before electing  Joe Biden to the Presidency. Why? Because Twitter, one of the most  influential distributors of content in the world, deliberately and  arbitrarily suppressed news coverage to suit the political persuasions  of its employees.   We have undeniable proof that Big Tech censored bad press for the  Biden administration right before the 2020 election and may have even  profited from doing so. This despicable collusion between liberal  politics and social media, put on full display in the Twitter files,  must end.   Informed voters, not biased Twitter truth manipulators, must decide  the outcomes of elections.   We will never know how many voters would have changed their mind if  they knew of the corruption of the Biden family and their activities.  Suppression of information is the real threat to our republic, not  asking questions.   Now that Republicans are back in the majority in the House, we will  investigate this interference and hold Big Tech, the FBI, and the Biden  family accountable.                            ____________________
