 Mr. President, the 2019 National Defense Authorization  Act on the floor today is a bipartisan bill that is focused on ensuring  our warfighters are prepared to operate across the full spectrum of  conflict and to support the objectives laid out in the 2018 national  defense strategy.   I am disappointed that we were not able to come together and work  through a robust, bipartisan amendment process this year on the floor.  We had a great markup, and I am thankful that my colleagues across the  aisle were so willing to work together in a bipartisan manner on this  piece of legislation.   As the chair of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I  worked hard with my ranking member, Senator Heinrich of New Mexico, to  ensure the NDAA invests additional funding in innovative technologies  so that we can maintain U.S. technological superiority over near-peer  adversaries, particularly in the areas of hypersonics, unmanned  systems, directed energy, and artificial intelligence.   The NDAA provides much needed funding to our Special Operations  forces, which are playing a key role in combating terrorist networks  and countering growing aggression by adversaries like Russia, China,  and Iran. It also fully funds SOCOM's request for the Preservation of  the Force and Families Initiative and expands key authorities to  provide enhanced support to the families of our special operators.   By supporting a total of $716 billion for our Nation's defense, the  NDAA provides the flexibility that is needed for our military to make  targeted investments for the future. It also addresses issues that  deeply impact our servicemembers.   I especially thank Senator Warren, of Massachusetts, for her work  with me in addressing research and treatment options for traumatic  brain injuries. This is an issue that is especially important to me as  a veteran, for I have known and worked with individuals who have  experienced blasts and rollovers in military vehicles, and we know the  implications that come from those who suffer from traumatic brain  injury.   I urge my colleagues to support the NDAA. This bill is absolutely  vital to restoring the health of our military and supporting our  national security objectives. Again, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill. It is vital we complete our NDAA.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, June 14; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 5515,  with the time until the cloture vote equally divided between the two  managers or their designees.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senators Merkley and  Sasse.
