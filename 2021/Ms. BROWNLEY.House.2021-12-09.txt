 Madam Speaker, as the pandemic put pressure on the  pockets of Americans, House Democrats worked to not only bolster our  economy but to get people back to work.   The November jobs report shows that our economy is on the right track  to doing just that. In fact, 6 million jobs have been created in the  first 10 months of the Biden administration. No other administration  has created more jobs in its first year. But during the Trump  administration's mismanagement of the pandemic, we lost over 9 million  jobs. So we still have work to do.   The recently House-passed Build Back Better Act will include specific  and urgent measures to uplift working families, lower everyday costs,  fight inflation, and generate millions of good-paying jobs.   House Democrats remain committed to creating a strong economy and an  economy that works for all Americans.                            ____________________
