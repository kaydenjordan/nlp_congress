 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 991, which extends the  Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act through 2030. This legislation  enjoys wide bipartisan support, and I want to thank Congresswoman Terri  Sewell for partnering with me to get this done.   Madam Speaker, I also thank Ranking Member Brady and Chairman Neal  for their cooperation and support of this legislation as well.   As a Member of the House Ways and Means Committee, I am proud to  support our Nation's trade preference programs, which bolster further  economic expansion in truly developing nations and support jobs here in  America. It is a true win-win scenario.   In particular, the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, or CBTPA,  accomplishes that goal in the Caribbean, providing trade benefits to  eight Caribbean nations, most notably, Haiti.   Furthermore, the program also benefits American businesses and  workers, a number of whom have created strong, reliable partnerships  with suppliers in the Caribbean. This partnership helps to add value  for customers and supports American jobs.   Also of note, the program requires the use of U.S. yarn, which boosts  jobs in our cotton and textile industry.   In my district, Cintas Corporation, which is headquartered in  Cincinnati, utilizes a strong partnership with Haitian suppliers as  part of their North American supply chain.   Finally, as we step back and look at the bigger picture: The CBTPA  helps American stewardship of the Western Hemisphere, where we want to  support budding democracies on our doorstep and create mutually  beneficial economic stability with our neighbors. Our overall trade  agenda is well served by agreements like the recently passed USMCA, as  well as these important trade preference programs like the CBTPA.   Again, I want to thank Congresswoman Sewell for her partnership on  this issue, as well as Ranking Member Brady and Chairman Neal for their  support.   Madam Speaker, this is good, sound policy which stands to benefit  both Americans and our friendly neighbors in the Caribbean. I urge my  colleagues to support its passage, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I just want to make one final comment. It has been a  pleasure with this particular issue to work in a bipartisan fashion,  not only with my friend Congresswoman Sewell, but really with the  entire committee. I think that we really came together and saw the  benefits to America and to developing nations as we move forward.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of this  legislation from the textile, apparel, and footwear industry as well as  the broader business community.                                                September 22, 2020.        Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: On       behalf of the undersigned organizations--representing the       full spectrum of the textile, apparel, and footwear industry,       as well as the broader business community--we urge you to       vote YES on H.R. 991--Extension of the Caribbean Basin       Economic Recovery Act.        By extending the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to       September 30, 2030, the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act       (CBTPA) will also be extended. Since its inception in 2000,       CBTPA has become an important element of the effort to       develop and facilitate trade within the Caribbean Basin       region, most notably with Haiti. Overall, CBTPA is structured       in a fashion that reasonably balances the interests of U.S.       textile manufacturers with those of textile and apparel       manufacturers in the region. The CBTPA requires the use of       U.S. or CBTPA-regional yarns and fabrics, which means Haiti,       as the main country still participating in the CBTPA, has       become an important export market for U.S. textiles.        Along with the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through       Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, and the Haiti Economic       Lift Program (HELP) Act, the CBTPA now increases U.S. exports       to strategic allies in the Caribbean Basin. Not only have       these programs supported numerous U.S. textile, apparel, and       footwear jobs, but they have also supported economic       development in the region, advancing key U.S. foreign,       security, and immigration policy goals.        Specifically, the CBTPA continues to play a direct and       critical role in advancing the industry partnership that       currently exists between the United States and Haiti. In       2019, 100 percent (by volume) of apparel that was imported       into the United States under the CBTPA was imported from       Haiti. And U.S. apparel imports from Haiti continue to grow.       In fact, total U.S. garment imports from Haiti grew 13.4% in       2019. Because the rules of origin for these programs       generally require the use of U.S. fabrics and yarns, these       U.S. garment imports incorporate prior U.S. textile exports.        Those benefits are now threatened because of questions       surrounding the renewal of the CBTPA. These concerns come on       top of the considerable pain, costs, and uncertainty the       industry is already trying to manage as a result of COVID-19       and the accompanying economic crisis. Orders have already       been placed for goods that will arrive well after September       30. Companies must increasingly assume that these orders will       be fully dutiable--even if using U.S. inputs--putting our       Haitian customers and partners, and our U.S. textile       manufacturers and exporters at a disadvantage.        The CBTPA offers a great opportunity for companies looking       to diversify their supply chains close to home, but it is set       to expire on September 30, 2020. We urge you to vote YES on       H.R. 991--Extension of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery       Act and extend it another ten years.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,        Accessories Council; American Apparel & Footwear       Association (AAFA); Council of  [[Page H4657]]       Fashion Designers of America (CFDA); Footwear Distributors &       Retailers of America (FDRA); INDA, Association of the       Nonwoven Fabrics Industry; National Retail Federation (NRF);       North American Association of Uniform Manufacturers and       Distributors; Outdoor Industry Association (OIA); Retail       Industry Leaders Association (RILA); Sports & Fitness       Industry Association (SFIA); Travel Goods Association (TGA);       United States Fashion Industry Association (USFIA); U.S.       Chamber of Commerce.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
