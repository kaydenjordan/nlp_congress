 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  and recognition on this important issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation.   I am so proud of Representative Jackie Speier, with whom I have the  privilege of corepresenting San Francisco. Jackie Speier has been our  champion on San Francisco Bay, and this San Francisco Bay Restoration  Act is a vital step to restoring our cherished bay.   It is an honor to be joined in this legislation with other bay area  colleagues, Jared Huffman,   John Garamendi,   Mike Thompson, Jerry  McNerney, Mark DeSaulnier, Barbara Lee, Ro Khanna, Anna Eshoo, and Zoe  Lofgren. I also thank Senators Dianne  [[Page H2758]]  Feinstein and Alex Padilla, who have introduced a Senate companion  bill.   Madam Speaker, Members may not know, but the San Francisco Bay is an  icon of California and a national treasure: inspiring us with its  beauty and its might, enriching our lives with world-class recreation,  tourism, and jobs.   The bay area delta, of which it is a part, is also the economic  lifeblood of our coast, contributing over $370 billion to our economy  each year and supporting more than four million jobs.   As part of the bay-delta estuary, it is a vital part of public  health, providing drinking water for millions of Californians, a key  force in combating the climate crisis.   But, for centuries, this magnificent estuary has been overexploited  and underprotected. Today, 90 percent of the bay area's wetlands have  been destroyed, undermining the strength of our coastal economies and  communities.   The San Francisco Bay Restoration Act--sponsored and championed by  Congresswoman Jackie Speier over many years--would make a long overdue  $125 million investment in restoration efforts. It improves  coordination from San Francisco to Washington, as it revives our  wetlands to protect our coastal communities, improves our water  quality, strengthens our climate resilience, including by combating sea  level rise.   In 2018, the GAO concluded that a centralized initiative providing  improved coordination and communication across efforts, along with  dedicated Federal funding, would be the best chance for long-term  restoration and protection of this vital geographic area on the West  Coast. And this bill introduced by Congresswoman Jackie Speier provides  exactly that.   Californians have fought to increase appropriations for the bay area  for years, and we are grateful for the support of then-chair Nita Lowey  of the Appropriations Committee and the chair of the Subcommittee on  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, Betty McCollum. We secured  an increase of $3 million in funding for the bay.   Last year, with the support of Transportation and Infrastructure  chair Peter DeFazio and, hence, the committee of Congresswoman Eleanor  Holmes Norton, and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee chair  Grace Napolitano, the House passed this Bay Restoration Act by a voice  vote, and then again as part of our infrastructure bill, H.R. 2, the  Moving Forward Act. Now we want to make it the law of the land.   Our communities and our lives are heavily enriched by the bay-delta  estuary. This investment is an economic, health, environmental, and  moral imperative.   I urge Members to support it with strong bipartisan support, and I  hope that it will be bipartisan on the part of our colleagues on the  West Coast, who know the value of the quality of life that the bay  estuary project brings to us. I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  for leading the effort on the floor today to pass this important  legislation. I commend her and the ranking member, Mr. McHenry, for his  good words about this legislation and his reference to the bravery of  our Capitol Police.   Madam Speaker, over 5 months have passed since the January 6  insurrection was waged against our Capitol and our democracy.   For most of us, the horror of January 6 has not faded. The memory of  Members, staff, and workers fleeing for their lives, the sound of  screams and shots fired, the agony of over 140 law enforcement officers  physically harmed and those killed all remain very raw.   January 6 was unquestionably one of the darkest days in the history  of our democracy, but because of the courage of the Capitol Police and  other law enforcement officers, it will also be etched in history as a  day of heroism. That day the Capitol Police Force put themselves  between the violence and us. They risked their safety and their lives  for others with the utmost selflessness. Some died, becoming martyrs  for our democracy.   They did so because they were patriots, the type of Americans who  heard the call to serve and answered it, putting country above self.  They enabled us to return to the Capitol, to that podium that night to  show the world that our democracy had prevailed and that it had  succeeded because of them.                                time  1600    In March, as you recall, we came together and we passed legislation  to award these patriots the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest  award, as has been mentioned, that this body can offer.   Doing so was a high honor and privilege for each of us, and it was  also our responsibility to ensure that we always remember those heroes  and their sacrifice.   As I said on the floor then: ``May the courage of these heroes always  remain an inspiration to us. And may we always remember the valor of  the fallen.''   This gold medal will be proudly displayed, as the distinguished  gentleman referenced, for years to come, ensuring that their valor and  the sacrifice of the fallen are always remembered.   But 2 weeks after we passed that gold medal legislation, as you know,  Madam Speaker, under your leadership, Congress honored one of the  fallen, Officer Brian Sicknick, with a lying-in-state ceremony to  convey the grief and gratitude felt for all Americans by his sacrifice.   That respect was reflected in the presence of distinguished leaders,  military leaders, and leaders of institutions of government who came to  pay their respects, including President Biden.   Sadly, just weeks later, we returned to the Capitol rotunda for a  lying-in-honor ceremony for Officer Billy Evans, as the distinguished  ranking member mentioned, killed in the line of duty in April on Good  Friday.   Officer Evans was a distinguished member of the first responders unit  and an 18-year veteran of the United States Capitol Police.   Everyone who knew him knew he was a hero. We hope that it was a  comfort to his children Logan and Abigail that so many learned that day  what a hero their father was. We hope by adding Billy's name to the  pantheon of patriots honored with this gold medal, the memory of his  sacrifice will always endure.   So here we are once again on the floor of the House honoring our  heroes. As we pass this legislation, we, as Members of Congress, have a  responsibility to do more than simply laud these officers as heroes.   We must respect them and we must support them with resources and  funding. We must keep them safe. And we must ensure that a January 6th  attack can never happen again.   This is about our respect for their service and our responsibility to  honor their sacrifice. Any chance we get, we want to praise our Capitol  Police. Sadly, we are doing this in a time when we are honoring some  who have lost their lives and some were severely injured, but every day  we know that they are making a sacrifice, and that is what we respect.   I urge a strong bipartisan vote for this legislation. I am pleased to  hear both our distinguished chair, Maxine Waters, and the distinguished  ranking member both support the legislation. I urge all members to join  us in honoring our law enforcement heroes with real action with a gold  medal.
