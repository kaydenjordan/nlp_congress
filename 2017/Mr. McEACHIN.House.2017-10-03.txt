 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to share Denise's story.  Already a mother of two young children, Denise was expecting her third  child. Until her 20-week scan, all her tests had come back perfectly.  Her entire family was eagerly awaiting a baby boy.   The scan revealed that her son's brain had several severe  deformities. He was also showing signs of other complications. It was  the most painful and devastating day of Denise's life.  [[Page H7719]]    She spoke to numerous doctors and specialists. She spoke to her  family and sought the guidance of counselors and professionals.   Ultimately, she and her husband decided to end the pregnancy. But  finding a provider and arranging for the procedure was very difficult.  There was not a single doctor in Virginia she could go to.   Denise, as a grieving mother in the middle of an absolutely emotional  crisis, found herself desperately calling doctors and hospitals all  over the country to access the medical care she needed. Thanks to a  family friend, she was ultimately able to find a provider in a major  city within driving distance. H.R. 36 would have denied her that  chance.   On behalf of Denise and others like her, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on H.R. 36. We must stop the bans.
