 Mr. President, I rise to support Mark Jeremy  Bennett's nomination to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Ninth Circuit.   Mr. Bennett's nomination is how judicial nominations should work. His  name was not on a rightwing wish list created by outside groups.  Instead, the White House worked closely with both of Hawaii's  Democratic Senators to find a consensus nominee that would get broad  bipartisan support.   Senators are constitutionally directed to provide the executive  branch with advice and consent. I encourage the White House to continue  to consult with Members of both parties on all future nominees.
