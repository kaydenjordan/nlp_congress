 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1.   From day one, this administration has demonized American energy  producers, forcing prices to skyrocket and compromising our national  security.   My Missouri constituents care about three things, Mr. Speaker: food,  fuel, and fertilizer. This President has done nothing but raise prices  on all three.   Our constituents don't want to be forced to drive a Prius. They want  affordable prices at the pump. The F-150 is the model of a truck made  in Missouri. It shouldn't be what it costs to fill it up, but that is  exactly how much it cost this past summer. It has to end.   Since taking office, President Biden has canceled construction of the  Keystone XL pipeline, which could have supplied us with more than  800,000 barrels of oil a day. He has depleted our strategic reserves to  their lowest levels since 1983. The cherry on the top, Mr. Speaker, is  that he has prevented any new permits on Federal lands and completely  undermined the permitting process.   This President has kneecapped American energy producers.   America should not have to choose between driving to work and putting  food on the table, but that is exactly what is happening in America  today. This administration is making them make those tough choices, and  that is exactly why we need H.R. 1.   We promised the American people that we would make sure they could  fill up their trucks. We promised that we would fight to make it  affordable to heat their homes. We promised to fight the woke Green New  Deal policies that are killing our energy sector.   This legislation does just that. It will increase domestic energy  production. It will reform the permitting process for all industries.  It will reverse the anti-energy policies being perpetrated by the Biden  administration.   Mr. Speaker, it is not complicated. We know that American energy  producers make the cleanest energy in the world. Let's not only make  America energy independent; let's make America energy dominant.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rules  package on this critical piece of legislation and ``yes'' on H.R. 1.   Let's put a tiger back in the tank and not a kitty cat in the  glorified golf cart.                                time  1300
