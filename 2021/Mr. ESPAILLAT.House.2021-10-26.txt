 Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R.  2119--the Family Violence Prevention and Service Improvement Act.   This bill heavily invests in resources and programs to protect and  support women like Gladys Ricart, a 39-year-old-woman and former  constituent of mine who was killed by her ex-boyfriend on her wedding  day.   After years of physical and mental abuse, she left him to move on  with her life, even as he continued to threaten and stalk her.   As she moved on, she met her soulmate, and was happy and eager to  marry the man of her dreams.   What should have been one of the happiest days of her life, was  instead her last. Her ex-abuser fatally shot Gladys on her wedding day.  But her legacy lives on and in 2001, the Brides March was created to  remember Gladys Ricart and to bring awareness to domestic violence.   Heartbreakingly, Gladys' story is not isolated or unique.   By passing the Family Violence Prevention and Service Improvement  Act, we also have an opportunity to honor her memory--her and the  hundreds of thousands of women who have stories just like Gladys'.   This crucial legislation would put millions of dollars towards  expanding support for culturally specific domestic violence programs,  investing in community-based prevention initiatives, and creating an  underserved population grant program.   These resources would help to connect people to advocates and help  them safely navigate life during and after leaving an abusive  relationship.   And as I think of all the resources this legislation will make  available, I think of Gladys and the hundreds of women who march on her  behalf.   I think about the one in three woman, particularly black and trans  women, who will experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime.    I think of the irreputable, lasting harm domestic violence causes  families and children.   I think about all these lives that will be catastrophically changed  or lost and I know that they deserved more.   As we prepare to vote, I implore everyone to think of all the good  the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act will do for  all survivors.    Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of every single TPS  holder, DACA recipient, essential worker, and farmworker in this  country who have pleaded for this Congress to act; not just today,  Madam Speaker, but for the last 35 years.   During the pandemic, our Nation's undocumented immigrants rose to the  occasion. They kept our grocery shelves stocked, packing warehouses  running, and cleaning and sanitizing businesses, caring for our  families--particularly our seniors, Madam Speaker--and delivering food  right to our doorsteps while this country came to a standstill--to a  halt.   Our praise and lip service are simply not enough. How can we build  back better without delivering for those who delivered for us-- literally delivered for us--during this pandemic? Building back better  means providing real reform for our undocumented neighbors.   There are about 5 million undocumented immigrants who risked their  lives during the worst pandemic in our history. They risked their lives  each and every day, and the countless more that kept this country  afloat, like our more than 30,000 DACA recipients who stepped up for us  and worked on the front lines as physicians, residents, nurses, and  paramedics.   Madam Speaker, let's stand up for immigrants.                            ____________________
