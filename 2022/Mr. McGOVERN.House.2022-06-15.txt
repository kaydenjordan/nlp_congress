 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Minnesota,  Congresswoman Omar, for leading this Special Order hour, at such a  critical time for our Nation's children.   Congresswoman Omar has been a champion for expanding access to  universal school meals and ending childhood hunger, and indeed, all  hunger in this country and around the globe, and I recognize her for  her leadership.   Madam Speaker, my two sisters are schoolteachers in the Worcester  public school system in Massachusetts. They remind me all the time that  school meals are as important to a child's ability to learn as a  textbook or a laptop. They wonder all the time why Congress, State  governments, and the Federal Government don't get that.   They see children show up to school on Mondays hungry because they  haven't eaten all weekend. It takes a while to get them the nutrition  that they need so they can focus again. If you are hungry, you can't  focus. If you can't focus, you can't learn. If you can't learn, you  fall behind. It is that simple.   They also tell me that Fridays are a tough day because those same  children come to them and ask if there is any food that they can take  home, not just for them but for their families. I have heard  heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story of children who are food  insecure, who are hungry in this country.   If you ever meet a child or see a child who is hungry, it breaks your  heart. It, quite frankly, angers me because we live in the richest  country in the history of the world. Even before the pandemic, close to  40 million Americans didn't know where their next meal was going to  come from.   I tell people all the time that hunger is a political condition. It  is not a partisan condition. It shouldn't be a partisan condition. It  is a political condition. By that I mean we have the food, we have the  resources, we have the infrastructure, we have the knowledge of what we  need to do. We have everything but the political will.   As has been pointed out here today, we are about to reach a hunger  cliff at the end of June. Waivers are going to run out. Money is going  to run out. If we don't do something, millions and millions of children  will lose their school meals and will lose their summer meals as well.   During the pandemic, thankfully, schools received flexibility and  funding to make sure their students got a healthy breakfast and lunch  at school. This has been a lifeline for families and school districts  facing rising costs and supply chain shortages.   We are coming to an end. All those safety measures that were put in  place during the pandemic will expire. I think what we are coming to  appreciate is that those safety measures should have been in place even  if there wasn't a pandemic. We can't go back to the days when close to  13 million kids went to bed hungry every night in the country.    With the group of leaders who are here on the floor, members of the  Progressive Caucus, as well as working with Speaker Pelosi, Chairman   Bobby Scott, Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, and working with Chairwoman  Stabenow over in the Senate, we have been trying to figure out ways to  extend the flexibility and funding needed to get healthy food to  America's students.   I believe that we will get there. The amazing leadership of Speaker  Pelosi will get us all together and we will find a way forward. We will  avoid this hunger cliff.  [[Page H5596]]    Madam Speaker, I am a liberal Democrat. I serve in this Congress,  both in the House and Senate, with many conservative Republicans, and I  understand that not everybody agrees on everything here. For example, I  want free universal school meals for every kid to be part of our  educational policy, and I want it there forever. I commend States like  California, Vermont, and Maine for taking a lead in their States. Their  legislatures have passed universal meals for their students. I want  Massachusetts to follow. I want every State to follow.   I get it. Not everybody shares my view. I also get that in order to  get anything to the President's desk we are going to have to navigate  through the Senate, which is always a challenge because in the Senate  you need 60 votes to have a cup of coffee, never mind pass a piece of  legislation.   We are going to have to figure out what it is we can get done in the  next couple of weeks. There are some who don't want as big a package as  others. There are some who are insisting on offsets. There are some who  are insisting on other things. We have to figure it out. We are going  to have figure it out because our kids are important. They are 100  percent of our future, and we ought to treat them as such.   Finally, one last point. America used to think big about solving  problems like hunger. In 1969, we held the first and only White House  Conference on Hunger. It was the same year we landed on the moon. That  conference led to a major expansion of the school lunch program and the  creation of the Women, Infants, and Children program, among other  things.   As a proud member of the Progressive Caucus, I have long thought that  it is time for America to think big once again to solve problems like  hunger. To think big the way we used to, not to manage problems, but to  solve them. We have the food to end child hunger in America.   Again, it is a matter of building the political will. I personally  believe that food ought to be a fundamental human right here in this  country and around the world. I say this because I am thrilled that  President Biden recently announced that he will host a White House  Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health to bring together experts  from across the country, and all agencies within the Federal Government  to create a plan, not to manage hunger in America, to end hunger in  America.   It will be an opportunity for people with lived experiences to have  their voices heard because sometimes we make decisions here and we  don't talk to the people who are most affected by what we are trying to  do.   We have the opportunity to prevent child hunger and to make universal  free school meals a reality. This is our moment to make it happen. In  the lead-up to this conference, Members of Congress have the  opportunity to host listening sessions to hear directly from local  educators and families who benefit from free school meals.   I encourage my colleagues to host these sessions and to transmit  their findings to the White House so that the recommendations that come  out of this conference reflect the power of school meals to change  lives and improve nutrition among children.   Madam Speaker, I encourage not just progressive Members, I encourage  moderate Members, and conservative Members to do listening sessions in  their districts to hear about not only the extent of this problem,  which is a costly problem, but hear about potential solutions so we can  end hunger. If you are interested, you can reach out to my office, and  we can point you in the right direction.   Madam Speaker, I, again, thank Congresswoman Omar for bringing us  together at such a critical moment. There are some problems that we are  faced with that I don't know what the solution is, but hunger is not  one of them. This is a solvable problem that we can solve in a matter  of a few years if we put our minds to it and if we work together.   Let's do something big, something bold, something that will reflect  the goodness of the people of this country and make a real difference.  It may be an example for the rest of the world.                                time  1645
