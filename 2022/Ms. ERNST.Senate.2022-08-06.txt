 Mr. President, this one should be simple.   My amendment eliminates subsidies for slave and child labor. The  price of buying a car has reached a record high, and what is the  Democrats' answer? A tax break for wealthy coastal elites to buy  electric vehicles produced with slave and child labor.   Currently, this bill already prevents vehicles containing any part  sourced or assembled in foreign entities of concern, like China or  Russia, from being eligible for the tax credit. My amendment doesn't  change that. My amendment simply ensures that our tax dollars don't  subsidize EVs from any countries using child or slave labor.   We all know the critical minerals that comprise EV batteries are  largely mined in sub-Saharan Africa by companies abusing children,  which are then assembled in Chinese-owned factories, many of which use  slave labor. Subsidizing, to the tune of $7,500 per person, the  purchase of a luxury vehicle for wealthy coastal elites that utilizes  slave or child labor is a direct contradiction of our American values.   We shouldn't be sacrificing a clean conscience in exchange for a so- called cleaner car.   I urge the adoption of the amendment.
