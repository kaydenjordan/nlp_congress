 Mr. President, one of my top priorities has been to  reauthorize and modernize the Violence Against Women Act. A survivor  myself, I recognize that VAWA provides the right resources to tackle  head-on domestic violence and sexual abuse in our communities in Iowa  and throughout the United States.   My good friend and colleague Dianne Feinstein, ranking member on the  Judiciary Committee, agreed to work with me on this important topic.  For months, Senator Feinstein and I and our staffs have worked closely  and in good faith with one another with this shared goal in mind. We  have met numerous times, held discussions, and negotiated in a way that  has produced real progress.   But just this week, after months of work and mountains of effort  toward a bipartisan bill, it all came to a screeching halt. Once again,  the Democrats are putting politics ahead of people and have decided to  move forward on the House-passed VAWA bill. The House bill is a  nonstarter and is chock-full of partisan political talking points that  take us further away from rather than closer to a bill we can get over  the finish line.   I am all too aware of how this town works. Election-year politics are  in full swing, and the grim reality is Democrats cannot afford to be  seen giving Republicans a win. The far-left agenda of the House has  hijacked the process. It sounds petty and it sounds unbelievable, but,  folks, that is the reality.   You would think that supporting survivors and preventing abuse would  be placed ahead of petty politics.   I want to be clear. I remain hopeful that we can continue to work in  a bipartisan way to get this law reauthorized.   Soon, I plan to respond with a good-faith proposal of my own. This  bill will support survivors and hold abusers accountable. It is also a  bill that I believe can pass the Senate and get the President's  signature.   I invite my colleagues across the aisle to join me in this very, very  important effort.   I yield the floor.
