 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, we are going to be talking tonight about  nursing homes in the context of the COVID-19 disease.   I will start with the numbers, which I think most Americans,  unfortunately, know by now. Every day we see the number of cases and  the number of deaths. I don't know exactly the number today, but it was  somewhere around 127,000 deaths.   Yet a number they may not know are the numbers when it comes to  nursing homes. More than 54,000 residents of nursing homes or workers  have died--more than 54,000. They account for more than 40 percent of  all the deaths in the USA.   To say this is unacceptable in no way begins to describe the gravity  of this, the tragedy, and the failure by the administration to deal  with it and to have a strategy to get that number down.   I hope the administration and I hope Members of Congress would commit  themselves today to say that when we come back here 3 months from now,  4  [[Page S4018]]  months from now, 5 months from now, that we are not again saying 54,000  more people died in nursing homes. I hope there will be an effort made  by the majority in the Senate to make sure we are working together with  the administration to get that number down.   I don't sense that the administration has any kind of a strategy here  at all because if there were a strategy, that number would never be as  high as it is.   I will have more to say later, but there is something we can do in  the Senate and that is to pass legislation to do a couple of things.  No. 1 is to focus dollars on the problem.   In this case, we have nursing homes across the country that never  implemented the kind of practices that would help them to reduce the  number of deaths in nursing homes. We know there are best practices  that work. We know that when a nursing home is given the resources to  separate those with COVID-19 from those who don't have it, so-called  cohorting--it is a phrase we should become familiar with,  ``cohorting''--if that happens in a long-term care setting, the death  number will go down for sure, and the case number will go down, but not  enough places are doing that.   We should help them do that. I have legislation to do just that. We  also know there are best practices with regard to investing in  strategies that will surge medical support for nursing homes to get  more professionals to be brought to bear on a problem in a nursing  home. There is a lot we can do. I will have more to say about it in a  moment, but I know we want to get to a unanimous consent request.   This is not going to be good enough for us to just curse the darkness  and say how bad this is and how unacceptable it is. We have to act.  That means the Senate has to pass legislation which includes dollars-- funding--so we can have better practices in our nursing homes. I hope  those who will say that is not what we should do have a good plan, a  good strategy.   Let me start with a unanimous consent because I know we have to get  that done here.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee be discharged from further consideration  and the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3768, the  Nursing Home COVID-19 Protection and Prevention Act of 2020. I ask  unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I don't  have a problem--nor do, I am sure, a number of Senators--with Senator  Johnson's bill. I am objecting on behalf of the Democratic Senators so  we can start a conversation about helping all of the air traffic  controllers in this country receive 12 weeks of paid parental leave,  starting on September 30, 2020.   We did a great thing here in the Senate for other Federal employees  last year in the National Defense Authorization Act that the President  signed, but these air traffic controllers were accidentally left out. I  think--and I am sure this is true of many who agree with me--that if  the chairman would take a look at Senator Schatz's bill to fix that,  these hard-working moms and dads would be very appreciative.   Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, I think the reference was to Senator  Schatz's bill, and I am just asking, on behalf of the Democratic  Senator, if the chairman would take a look at that bill.    Mr. President, as we conclude the hour in the next 10 or  15 minutes, let me start my remarks by thanking my colleagues who  joined us tonight. I thank Senator Whitehouse, who has worked with us  on this legislation from the very beginning, on introduction, and so  many who are cosponsors on the legislation--Senator Hassan from New  Hampshire and Senator Shaheen, the senior Senator from New Hampshire. I  thank her for being here and for her comments about this legislation. I  also thank Senator Blumenthal.   I wanted to start just for a few minutes before we conclude with this  chart. This is a chart depicting a map of the United States that is  dated June 27 from the New York Times. The summary reads: ``In at least  24 states, a majority of deaths are linked to nursing homes.''   Of course, I mentioned at the outset the deaths, as of a few hours  ago, of more than 54,000 people, when you add up the residents and the  workers, comprising 40 percent of the deaths nationwide.   You can see when you break it down by State, my home State of  Pennsylvania is at 68 percent--a majority of the deaths--linked to  nursing homes. States just to the south, where there is Virginia at 61,  Maryland at 61, Ohio at 57, but even further south, North Carolina is  at 57. Then you go out into the middle of the country, and in North  Dakota, 64 percent of the deaths were linked to nursing homes;  Minnesota, 77 percent. There are not many that are below 30 percent-- only a few. Those are the numbers, but of course the numbers don't tell  the story.   We need a plan for this. This is not the America we should accept.  This isn't America, where we just throw up our hands and say this virus  is so terrible, so aggressive, and the COVID-19 disease is so  destructive--the results from the virus--that we are going to accept  another 54,000-plus deaths in the United States of America and not have  an action plan   There is no action plan right now. The Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services and other parts of the Federal Government have only  recently started to speak to this issue, but there is no plan. Unless  we have legislation that the majority not too long ago in this hour  just objected to--a big part of the solution is to invest in proven  strategies, best practices like cohorting, where you separate COVID-19  residents in nursing homes from residents who do not have the disease-- that works; we know that works because it has worked in real time in  lots of places in the country--as well as the other investments we can  make in surge capacity to add professional help in the form of more  doctors, more nurses, and more certified nursing assistants when a  nursing home is being overrun.   No one here is saying that the Federal Government is the only entity  responsible for this. Nursing homes have to do more, and governments at  all levels have to do more. But the Federal Government is the payer and  the level of government that comes up with rules and regulations and  law that governs what happens in a long-term care setting.   So this bill, S. 3768, which has now been objected to by the  majority--and I am still waiting all these weeks and months now for the  majority to come up with their nursing home strategy to get the death  and case numbers down. We are still waiting for that.   This bill, S. 3768, would provide $20 billion in emergency funding.  When you consider all that has been invested in so many other  priorities, the least we can do is to invest in proven strategies for  our nursing homes. It would provide support for personal protective  equipment for nursing home workers who are doing that heroic work every  [[Page S4022]]  day. Some of the funding would go for testing, as I mentioned,  cohorting, surge teams, and so much else.   The bill is supported by the AARP, the Alzheimer's Association, and  25 other organizations representing seniors, people with disabilities,  nursing homes, and other providers.   This is what we need to pass now to have a strategy in place because  we cannot wait for the administration because they seem to have no  sense of urgency with regard to this problem. This is an American  problem that was created here in response to a virus. No one would  argue that the American people cannot come up with a strategy to get  the death numbers and case numbers down.   Who are we talking about here? We are talking about two groups of  Americans, right? The residents and the workers. The residents--we are  talking about those residents in nursing homes. These are Americans who  fought our wars. These are Americans who worked in our factories and  Americans who raised families year after year, decade after decade.  These are Americans who built the great American middle class. These  are the Americans who built this country, and they gave each of us life  and love and a strong foundation personally but also in terms of the  strength of our country. The least we can do--the very least this  Senate can do is to make sure we at least have a strategy.   Are we just going to throw up our hands and just say there is nothing  the most powerful institutions in the world can do to reduce the number  of nursing home deaths? As I said before, we don't want to be standing  here 3 months from now, 6 months from now, talking about another 54,000  or 55,000 nursing home deaths. Is that really America?   We are still waiting for the administration. We are told that by one  estimate, 12 to 18 nursing home residents have died per hour, every  hour over the last several months--12 to 18 nursing home residents  dying every hour. So we can't and should never allow another hour to  pass without action.   The majority has allocated a lot of time for nominations the last 2  months or more, a lot of time for other issues, but not time for COVID- 19 strategies to reduce long-term care deaths in nursing homes. So the  time now is not for debating nominations for agencies; the time is long  overdue for us to take action to deal with this American tragedy of  deaths of residents in nursing homes and deaths of workers.   While we are talking about those workers, they do heroic work every  day. They go in to do this work, expose themselves to the virus, expose  their families to the virus, and they do back-breaking work, often for  pay that isn't commensurate with the nature and sacrifice and the  dignity of their work. So they are heroic.   If there were ever a group of front-of-the-frontline workers--these  are not just frontline workers; they are at the very front of the line.  We should make sure they have protections in the nursing homes to do  their work but also pandemic premium pay, as we call it, and so much  else.   I ask a parliamentary inquiry: How much time is remaining?    Mr. President, I have just a few more minutes, and I will  be done.   I won't go through the details of this report, but I want to note for  the Senate two things. No. 1, we will be introducing--I will, and  Senator Peters, the ranking member of the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee, and Senator Wyden, the ranking member  of the Finance Committee--the three of us and our offices will be  releasing a report about nursing homes. The report is entitled ``COVID- 19 and Nursing Homes: How the Trump Administration Failed Residents and  Workers.'' This is a chronicle of deadly delay and a chronicle of a  lack of real urgency on behalf of the administration.   I hope the administration is reaching that point of urgency and is  going to deliver to the American people a plan to get the death numbers  down, to get the case numbers down in nursing homes. We haven't seen  that sense of urgency. This report includes nine findings and nine  recommendations, so no one can ever accuse us of just cursing the  darkness of this tragedy without bringing the light of solutions to  this issue.    There is more that I could say, but just for the record, as I  conclude, I ask unanimous consent that the written comments that my  office received from two constituents with concern about their loved  ones in nursing homes be entered into the Record.   Just for the record, I will read the names of the family members:  Thomas and Barbara Taylor of Coatsville, PA.   The Presiding Officer is a native of Redding and knows what I am  talking about when I mention these names.   Joette Peters of Manheim, PA, is also a part of this, as well as Amy  Lowenthal, who had a relative. Her dad, David, was a geriatrician in  Philadelphia. Her comments are about that.   I ask unanimous consent that these written comments from constituents  be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            Thomas and Barbara Taylor--Coatesville, Pennsylvania         I'd like to share information from Thomas and Barbara       Taylor, a couple from Coatesville, Pennsylvania.        My office first heard from Mr. Taylor in early April.        Mr. Taylor is a hospice nurse who now serves as the Chief       Operating Officer of a company.        He understands the challenges of caring for a vulnerable       population.        And, he knows how important it is to treat people at the       end of their life with dignity.        Mr. Taylor reached out to my office after he learned that       his sister-in-law, Juanita, age 72, passed away from COVID in       her nursing home in Lancaster County.        His mother is also a resident of this facility and       recovered from COVID at age 85.        When Thomas and Barbara spoke to my team, they were       dismayed that more is not being done at the federal level to       ensure transparency with residents and their family.        Mrs. Taylor followed up with my office in writing.        She explained that her sister, Juanita, began showing signs       of COVID at the end of March.        Juanita had a cough, a slight fever, did not have an       appetite and required oxygen to help with breathing.        At this time, it became painfully clear that the Trump       Administration had failed to stockpile the supplies needed to       test Americans.        And, still, the President refused to use the Defense       Production Act to procure the supplies necessary.        Even after multiple requests that her sister be tested, in       Barbara's words ``begging'' doctors, Barbara was told that       her sister did ``not have the symptoms'' or ``meet the       criteria'' required to be tested.        For the next few days, Barbara and Thomas were kept in the       dark.        Then, any family's worst nightmare occurred.        Barbara called the nursing home and spoke to a nurse on the       floor.        When Barbara asked about her sister, the nurse said, ``Your       sister is not here.''        Barbara pressed for more information.        The nurse told Barbara, ``Juanita died about an hour ago.       Didn't anybody call you?''        This was the first Barbara had heard this news. The Taylors       were ``horrified by the unexpected news.''        The lack of transparency and human decency is inexcusable       and immoral.        Nursing homes must do better. Residents, families and       workers deserve better.        As the report that we will be releasing tomorrow states,       the Trump Administration provided no leadership.        Nursing homes did not have the supplies necessary to       protect residents and workers.        There was a testing shortage across the country. And there       continues to be no testing strategy.        Many facilities experienced staffing shortages, which may       be the reason why no one bothered to call the Taylors.        We must do more to protect Mr. Taylor's mother who is still       at that same nursing home, but also all other nursing home       residents across the country.        We need more funding for surge teams to deal with COVID       right now, and more funding to implement best practices, like       cohorting, separating residents who have COVID from those who       do not.        We cannot stop working. We cannot stop legislating. We       cannot stop appropriating dollars to help our seniors and       people with disabilities.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        As Barbara wrote, ``My sister Juanita had dementia and       could not speak for herself. I was her voice and eyes. I       couldn't see her at the time. Please allow me to speak for       her and others who have no voice.        We have a sacred responsibility to heed this call to action       from the Taylors and so many others.                    Joette Peters--Manheim, Pennsylvania         My team also spoke with Mrs. Joette Peters from Manheim,       Pennsylvania.  [[Page S4023]]         Mrs. Peters' parents, Harold and Helen, have been married       for 67 years.        For the past 11 years, Harold and Helen have been residents       of a nearby retirement community.        As they grew older, they required differing levels of care.       They decided to reside in rooms across the hall from each       other.        However, like the greatest love affairs, even that       separation could not keep them apart.        According to Mrs. Peters, before COVID, ``[t]hey spent the       majority of their waking hours together.''        Their love knew no bounds.        Now, COVID is keeping them apart from each other, their       daughter and their extended family.        Mrs. Peters explained that in the middle of lunch, her       parents were told the facility would be going into ``lock       down'' and Helen would need to leave immediately.        Since then, Helen and Harold have only been able to see       each other and their daughter through a sliding glass door.        They have tried to visit with each other virtually, but       that has its own challenges.        We know from experts that social isolation for seniors can       have the same health impact as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.        This very topic was the focus of a recent hearing in the       Aging Committee.        Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities need       resources in order to safely reopen.        They need dollars for PPE. They need dollars for testing.       And they need dollars for their workforce.        My bill would provide nursing homes with those resources.        It would give Harold and Helen the chance to be together.       And, it would give their daughter and family peace of mind.       Amy Lowenthal--Late Father: David Lowenthal, Geriatrician in                                Philadelphia         My office also heard from Amy Lowenthal.        Amy's father, Dr. David Lowenthal, was a nephrologist and       professor who was trained as a doctor at Temple University       and practiced medicine in Philadelphia.        Amy was told that he was the first resident in his nursing       home to test positive for COVID-19.        In explaining the care and treatment that her father       received after the diagnosis, she told my office about the       incredible kindness of the nursing home's workers.        Call after call, looking in on her father, Amy and her       sisters said that nurses and doctors ``took the time to talk       to her and answer her questions.''        ``The COVID ward staff were patient, empathic, and acted       like my father was the only patient on the ward.''        In the last hours of his life, Amy heard from a hospice       nurse asking if she would like to FaceTime with her father       one last time.        She ``thanked the nurse profusely for reaching out.'' And       when they connected, the nurse was holding her father's hand       and playing classical music for him.        According to Amy, the nurse said, ``This breaks my heart.       If it were my dad, I would hope someone would do the same for       me.''        As Amy described, she never knew the name of the nurse. She       never saw her face through the PPE, but Amy said that she       will remember that nurse for the rest of her life. ``She gave       me the gift of one more moment with my Dad. And, it would be       my last.''        Amy concluded her correspondence with this ``I often wonder       what my Dad, a lifelong physician and teacher, would have       thought of this last chapter of his life. But I do know for       sure that he would have been so grateful to those frontline       workers who provided warmth and comfort to his family during       his last days.''        We are all eternally grateful to the frontline workers who       are caring for our loved ones.        They deserve more than our praise.        They deserve protection. They deserve testing. They deserve       premium pay.        The bill that I am hoping the Senate will pass will provide       resources for all of that.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.
