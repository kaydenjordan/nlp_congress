 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the bipartisan  reauthorization today of the Violence Against Women Act.   In 2013, this legislation was one of the first votes I took as a new  Member of Congress. This year, I was proud to be an original cosponsor  of the bill to ensure survivors have access to essential services and  justice.   It is a sad fact that VAWA remains critically important. Despite some  progress, the rate of domestic violence remains far too high.   I recently acquired a painting created by a survivor of domestic  violence. It is a beautiful scene of a woman standing in a field of  sunflowers with a blue sky. But upon a closer look, you see the broken  chains at her feet, chains representing her former prison of domestic  abuse.   While the woman in the painting was fortunately able to break free,  so many others cannot. Today's legislation helps both groups.   I am particularly glad that this year's bill makes improvements to  help the victims of dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and  increases resources available to vulnerable populations, including  Native American women and the LGBTQ community.   In our communities, there are many local organizations doing amazing  work to help women escape situations of domestic violence and rebuild  their lives, including A Safe Place in my district. I commend their  work and the work of all groups like this across the Nation, and I hope  this legislation will provide additional support and resources for  their important mission.                            ____________________
