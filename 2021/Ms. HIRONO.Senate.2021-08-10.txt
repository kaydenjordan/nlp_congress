 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Korean War  Divided Families Reunification Act'' with my colleague Senator  Sullivan. This bipartisan piece of legislation would open opportunities  for Korean Americans to be included in reunions with their relatives  who remain in North Korea. Many first generation Korean Americans, now  in their 80's and 90's, are waiting to be reunited with their parents,  spouses, children, siblings, and cousins. They should not have to wait  any longer.   One of the tragic legacies of the Korean War is the permanent  separation of Korean families. Sixty-eight years ago, the United  States, People's Republic of China, North Korea, and South Korea agreed  to an armistice which drew a new border between North Korea from South  Korea. Since then, there has been little contact between South Koreans  and their family members who remained in North Korea, and almost no  contact between Korean Americans and their loved ones in North Korea.   North and South Korea first agreed to hold reunions of divided  families in 1985. There have been 21 face-to face reunions and multiple  video-link reunions, which have given approximately 24,500 Koreans the  opportunity to briefly reunite with loved ones. There is no official  channel, however, for Korean Americans to participate in these  reunions.   Many Korean Americans long for an opportunity to meet their North  Korean relatives. My constituent, Carol Li from Honolulu, wants to  reconnect with her family's past and learn more about where her  grandparents were from. Carol's maternal grandparents fled from North  Korea to the South during the Korean War, leaving behind their  siblings. Unfortunately, her grandparents passed away before they were  able to reconnect with their siblings who remained in North Korea.  While she was teaching English in South Korea, she grew more curious  about her North Korean relatives and the war that divided them. With  passage of this legislation, Carol hopes she can participate in future  reunions to meet her North Korean relatives. She deserves the  opportunity to do so.   The legislation I am introducing would open official channels between  Korean Americans and their families in North Korea by directing the  U.S. Secretary of State to consult with his counterpart in South Korea  to identify opportunities for Korean Americans to participate in future  family reunions. It also directs the State Department's Special Envoy  on North Korean Human Rights Issues to consult the Korean American  community on efforts to reunite families, including opportunities for  video reunions.   Time is of the essence for those who have been seeking the  opportunity to reconnect with their loved ones for nearly seven  decades. Thanks to the leadership of Rep. Grace Meng of New York, the  House of Representatives passed this legislation on July 19, 2021 by a  vote of 415 to 0. It is time for the Senate to act. I call on my Senate  colleagues to swiftly pass this bill. Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mrs. Capito):   S. 2691. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to  ensure adequate access to vaccines under the Medicaid program and the  Vaccines for Children program, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Finance.
