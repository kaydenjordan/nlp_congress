 Mr. Speaker, with Easter around the corner, I rise to heap  praise on an icon in Katy, Texas, in Fort Bend County. Her name is  Deysi Crespo. She is the CEO of Katy Christian Ministries, otherwise  known as KCM.   KCM has one holy mission: transforming life through God's grace and  generosity of the community.   KCM has 52 member churches, partners. Deysi started there as a  volunteer in the resale shop in 2007.   Deysi is a living, breathing example that the American Dream comes  through faith. At 7 years old, she left rampant poverty in Central  America for Katy, Texas. After a few months, she no longer hungered for  food.   Deysi had a building hunger inside of her body to end poverty for  others and intervene in crisis with God's love. The rest is history.  Under Deysi's leadership, KCM earned a four-star rating from Charity  Navigator and the Hurricane Harvey Response Award from the Houston Food  Bank.   If you are in Katy this March, say hola, or hello, to Deysi. She will  be at the Katy Charity Bubble Run. That is set on March 28 in Katy,  Texas, and Deysi guarantees the love of Christ will be waiting for all  who come to the Bubble Run.                            ____________________
