 Mr. President, I wish to recognize the service of Dr.  Kathleen Hogan, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy  Efficiency at the U.S. Department of Energy.   Dr. Hogan's distinguished career is a testament to the power of one  public servant to deliver progress for the entire country.   Over her years of Federal service, Dr. Hogan dedicated her  considerable talent to helping our country use energy more efficiently.  Dr. Hogan appreciated the promise of energy efficiency, not only to  address the climate threat, but also to reduce waste and save money for  households and businesses  [[Page S7922]]  nationwide. She also appreciated the necessity of bringing government  and the private sector together on solutions.   At the Department of Energy, Dr. Hogan oversaw the Better Buildings  Program, an initiative to encourage buildings to become 20 percent more  efficient by the end of the decade. The program was formally codified  through legislation I introduced with Senator Kelly Ayotte in 2013. Its  success, however, is entirely the result of Dr. Hogan's tenacity,  persistence, and rare ability to forge partnerships beyond government.  While at the Department, Dr. Hogan also forged robust appliance  standards that save consumers more than $60 billion on their  electricity bills annually.   At the Environmental Protection Agency, Dr. Hogan spearheaded Energy  Star, a voluntary program to promote efficiency in housing, industry,  and a range of consumer products. Today, Energy Star is one of the most  widely recognized consumer labels in America. Since 1992, the program  has saved families and businesses over $450 billion and 3.5 trillion  kilowatt-hours of electricity.   The legacy of Dr. Hogan's public service is all around us: in the  kitchens of millions of American households, on the factory floor of  industrial plants, in the cleaner air our children breathe each day,  and in the dozens of new partnerships between the Federal Government  and businesses from nearly every sector of the economy.   We are deeply appreciative of Dr. Hogan's contributions, and we wish  her all the best in her next chapter. Above all, we thank her for a  distinguished career of service to our country.                            ____________________
