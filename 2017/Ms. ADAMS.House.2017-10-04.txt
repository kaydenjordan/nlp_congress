 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the phenomenal Dr.  Virginia K. Newell, a mathematician, author, civil rights activist,  teacher, elected official, mentor, and my Alpha Kappa Alpha soror.   Dr. Newell is an asset to North Carolina. We celebrate her 100th  birthday today and honor her legacy as a voice for the voiceless.   A native of the triad, Dr. Newell graduated from Atkins High School  in Winston-Salem before attending Talladega College in Alabama. She  earned her master's degree from NYU and her doctorate of education from  the University of Sarasota.   As an educator, she touched the lives of countless students at  Washington and Ligon High Schools in Raleigh, Yale Summer High School,  Shaw University, and Winston-Salem State University. As chairwoman of  the mathematics department at WSSU for 20 years and later as professor  emeritus, Dr. Newell is credited with bringing computers to that  campus.   In Winston-Salem, Dr. Newell sought to make the greatest difference  she could. She was elected as city alderwoman, serving for 16 years and  always placing her constituents' needs first. She led numerous voter  registration drives and co-chaired the Shirley Chisholm for President  campaign in North Carolina. Even after retirement, Dr. Newell served as  mentor and tutor to hundreds of students who continue to thank her for  her firm approach and for expecting nothing but the best from them.   Dr. Newell's hard work and dedication to her students, constituents,  and North Carolina is admirable and noteworthy. Indeed, she is a  phenomenal woman, and I wish her a very happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
