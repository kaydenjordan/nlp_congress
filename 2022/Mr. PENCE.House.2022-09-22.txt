 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  8542.   Plain and simple, this legislation would only amplify the violent  crime wave we are currently seeing under Democratic leadership. Turn on  the TV, watch the news. Night after night, we have to hear about the  innocent lives taken from us because of the violence we are seeing in  our streets. Just like other communities across the country,  communities in Indiana aren't immune. Our hardworking law enforcement  heroes alone are already struggling to keep up with this spike in  crime.   This legislation does absolutely nothing to help. In fact, it will  make the situation worse, making good on Democrats' promise to  dismantle and defund the police.   These aren't policing bills. This is a way for the Democrats to just  check a box in this election year. It is disrespectful to our law  enforcement community and an insult to those struggling with mental  health and substance abuse issues.   I have heard from countless county sheriffs and police chiefs back in  my district who want to be a partner with mental health providers, not  be replaced by them.   I implore my Democratic colleagues to end their war on law  enforcement and come together to work with Republicans who want to make  our communities safer.
