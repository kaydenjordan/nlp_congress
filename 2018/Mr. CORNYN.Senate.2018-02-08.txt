 The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude to my  friend from Vermont for his service on the Appropriations Committee and  working with us specifically on this particular legislation as it  relates to the disaster relief aspect of it.   Obviously, my State was devastated by Hurricane Harvey, but I must  tell my friend, I have new empathy and understanding for how bound we  are together as to what happens in one part of the country should be of  concern to those of us in other parts of the country because  eventually, sooner or later, disasters are going to visit all of us.   It is good news that the majority leader was able to announce  yesterday that we reached a compromise on government funding through  not just the end of this fiscal year but next year as well. This  agreement ensures that our Armed Forces will finally have the resources  they need.   My colleague and fellow Texan Mac Thornberry, the chairman of the  House Armed Services Committee, along with the senior Senator from  Arizona, Mr. McCain, said it best. They said:         This budget agreement is indispensable for our national       security. Without it, our military would not be able to       defend our Nation.    Hard stop. Let me repeat that.         This budget agreement is indispensable for our national       security. Without it, our military would not be able to       defend our Nation.    I think, of all the demands made on the taxpayer dollars that are  sent to Washington, DC--and many of them have a lot of merit, some more  than others--but I have to say, if you were going to ask me to  prioritize how do we appropriate money here in Washington, DC, national  security would be job No. 1.   In addition, the funding bill will provide support for our veterans,  those who have worn the uniform but have now left the military service,  as well as their families, and it will clear the way for new investment  in our Nation's infrastructure.   I am grateful to the majority leader for his hard work during this  series of long and delicate negotiations. We all know it could not have  been easy. Even more than that, I am glad, as I indicated at the  outset, that the funding package finally sends disaster relief to  [[Page S808]]  Texas--disaster relief that had been long promised but had been delayed  time and time again.   Today, the Senate will be considering supplemental appropriations for  disaster aid that affects the victims of Hurricane Maria, Hurricane  Harvey, as well as the wildfires and mudslides out West. Last August,  Hurricane Harvey made its landfall near Houston, along the gulf coast.  When that storm hit, communities like Port Arthur, Beaumont, Rockport,  and Victoria were crippled, not to mention Houston, where most of the  major media covered, one of the largest cities in the United States.   The National Hurricane Center's official report released last month  confirmed what those who lived through the storm already guessed: It  was the most significant rainfall event in the United States. During a  period of about 5 days, the skies opened up and dropped 50 inches of  rain--50 inches of rain. The report called Harvey ``unprecedented'' and  ``truly overwhelming.''   As someone who witnessed the devastation firsthand, I can say, with  certainty, that those are not exaggerations. It was an event that  happens perhaps once every 1,000 years. At least 88 people lost their  lives. Many more crashed their vehicles, were electrocuted, were unable  to receive medical services, and could not attend school or missed  work. They spent last fall tearing the sheetrock out of their homes or  their businesses.   Since the time of the storm, Congress has appropriated roughly $35  billion in Federal aid through two separate emergency bills. Working  closely with the majority leader, my Texas colleagues and I were able  to increase the first disaster relief bill last fall by adding money  for community development block grants. This ensured a larger  downpayment for Texas to rebuild and repair.   Thank goodness we were able to get that money then--because of the  delays we have seen up until today in additional disaster relief for  Hurricane Harvey. Once that money was appropriated, we worked with Dr.  Carson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to accelerate  the allocation of these funds, which he graciously did. Congress  followed up by passing a tax relief bill for individuals and small  businesses that sustained financial hardships as a result of the  hurricane.   Finally, we worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to identify  and prioritize key projects for coastal protection to mitigate the  impact of future storms. This is not the last hurricane that will hit  the coast of Texas or Florida. We need to prepare for the future as  well.   In spite of that work, tremendous challenges remain. That is why we  kept fighting month after month, and today marks the culmination of our  efforts. The supplemental appropriations bill we will consider today  includes $89 billion in disaster relief--$8 billion more than the House  passed last December. It ensures that Texas will have increased access  to the pool of community development block grant dollars, and it  provides funding and flexibility to ensure that the Army Corps of  Engineers are able to carry out necessary projects in the State.   It includes funding to help Texas address lingering transportation  issues resulting from Hurricane Harvey and allows us to move forward on  flood mitigation projects like the Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay.   Finally, it includes a provision--this is important to the  agriculture community in my State--to make cotton an eligible commodity  under the farm bill safety net. That is really good news for the folks  in West Texas, the largest cotton-growing area in the largest cotton- growing State in the Nation, and they have been waiting a long time.  Some of them lost bales of cotton or even entire gins because of all  the water they sustained as a result of the storms.   I applaud the Texas congressional delegation for taking the first  step and passing a disaster supplemental appropriation last year, and I  appreciate Governor Abbott and the Senate Appropriations Committee,  including Senator Leahy, for working with us to strengthen the bill in  the Senate over the last month or so. Helping Texans recover and  rebuild has been my top priority. I am now urging my colleagues, on  both sides of the aisle in both Houses, to pass this critical relief  bill as soon as possible.   I thank Chairman Cochran, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, for his leadership steering the Appropriations Committee,  which has its work cut out for it and has certainly done yeoman's work  to date.   I thank the junior Senator from Florida and my other colleagues-- particularly Senator Cruz, my colleague in the Senate--who have fought  with us side by side for relief from the numerous disasters that have  affected Florida, Texas, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and of course  the wildfires and mudslides out West.               Remembering Lieutenant General Daniel James III    Mr. President, on a separate and unrelated note, I wish to recognize  the passing of retired Lt. Gen. Daniel James III. He served as the  first African-American Adjutant General for my home State, as well as  the first African-American Director of the Air National Guard. He was  the son of Daniel ``Chappie'' James, Jr., a fighter pilot who was the  first African-American Air Force general to pin on four stars.   A highly decorated command pilot, with approximately 4,000 flying  hours, many of those in combat, General James completed two Active-Duty  tours in Southeast Asia. He was also inducted into the Texas Military  Forces Hall of Honor. Since his burial is taking place today in  Arlington National Cemetery, I wish to let all those in attendance know  I am thinking of them. I know Lieutenant General James was a mentor to  my friend General Nichols, the current Adjutant General, but he was a  role model for us all.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 10:30 p.m. this evening, the Senate vote  on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House  amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892 with a further  amendment; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be  yielded back and the Senate vote on the motion to concur.    Mr. President, regular order.    Regular order.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 11 p.m. this evening, the Senate vote on  the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House  amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892 with a further  amendment; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be  yielded back and the Senate vote on the motion to concur.    Mr. President, I ask for regular order.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 11:30 p.m. this evening, the Senate vote  on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House  amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892 with a further  amendment; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be  yielded back and the Senate vote on the motion to concur.  [[Page S834]]     Regular order.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 12 a.m., the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1892 with a further amendment; further, that  if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back and the  Senate vote on the motion to concur.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 1 a.m., the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1892 with a further amendment; further, that  if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back and the  Senate vote on the motion to concur.    Regular order.    Mr. President, I have asked unanimous consent that the  Senate be allowed to vote on the pending matter, and there have been  multiple objections, of course, by the Senator from Kentucky.   I don't know why we are basically burning time here while the Senator  from Kentucky and others are sitting in the cloakroom wasting  everybody's time and inconveniencing the staff. We could easily move  this matter forward and have a vote. The outcome will be exactly the  same, and it is not inconsequential that the current continuing  resolution, I believe, expires at midnight tonight.   So the Senator from Kentucky, by objecting to the unanimous consent  requests, will effectively shut down the Federal Government for no real  reason. I know he wants to make a point. He has that right. I agree  with many of his concerns about deficits and debt, but we are in an  emergency situation.   We have our military that is not ready to fight and win our Nation's  wars the way it should be. We have military members who have died in  accidents as a result of the lack of training and being stretched too  thin because of budget cuts, and we need to fix that. General Mattis  has pointed out that more American military members have died in  training accidents and in regular operations than they have in combat.  That is a tragedy that I would hope all of us would want to address.   Then, of course, there is the disaster relief that helps people who  were victimized by Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Maria, the wildfires out  West, and Hurricane Irma. That is an emergency matter, as well.   So I don't understand why the Senator from Kentucky wants to insist  on shutting down the Federal Government when, after the time expires  under the regular order, the outcome will be exactly the same.   I recognize that he has that right, and he has objected to all of my  unanimous consent requests to move the vote up earlier, but it makes no  sense to me. It will not accomplish anything. I just ask him to  reconsider what he is doing in shutting down the entire Federal  Government when the outcome of this vote will not be any different  after the regular time expires than it would be if we had that vote  starting at 10:30 tonight.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ramona McGee,  a Department of Homeland Security fellow in my office, be granted  privileges of the floor during the consideration of border security and  immigration legislation.   I also ask unanimous consent that my military fellow Patrick Heiny be  granted privileges of the floor for the remainder of this year.
