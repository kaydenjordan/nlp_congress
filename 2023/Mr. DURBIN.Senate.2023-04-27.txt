I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, the decision last year by the Supreme  Court's conservative majority overruling Roe v. Wade and the right to  abortion marks the first time in our Nation's history that the Supreme  Court has ever repealed a constitutional right.   One of the most striking features of the Dobbs decision was the  almost complete absence of any serious discussion about the impact the  ruling might have on the lives and health of women. In a 79-page  ruling, women receive only a few paragraphs. Justice Alito, the author  of the majority opinion, defended this disregard for women's lives and  health by arguing that it is ``hard for anyone--and in particular, for  a court--to assess . . . the effect of the abortion right on society  and in particular on the lives of women.''   Perhaps the Court's conservative majority should have paid closer  attention to amicus briefs filed by the American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association,  who warned that overruling Roe would unleash an immediate healthcare  crisis across America. Ten months later, it is clear for anyone to see  that the consequences of the Dobbs ruling are devastating. Instead of  settling old controversies, the Dobbs decision has unleashed chaos for  women and doctors. We are seeing a torrent of new State laws that aim  to reduce abortion access by threatening to punish or criminalize those  who provide abortions and, in some cases, those who help someone to  obtain an abortion.   Nearly half of all States now impose severe restrictions on  abortion--and at least a dozen States have enacted near-total bans. The  laws surrounding abortion--and miscarriage management--seem to be  changing by the week. A few weeks ago, a Federal judge in Texas issued  a ruling that would ban the sale of mifepristone, one of the safest  forms of reproductive care, nationwide--even in States where abortion  remains legal.   Mifepristone was approved more than 20 years ago by the Food and Drug  Administration as safe and effective. It is used in more than half of  all abortions in the country. And it is used to help women suffering  from a miscarriage. It has a better safety profile than penicillin,  Tylenol, or Viagra. Thankfully, the Supreme Court issued a temporary  reprieve by staying the decision. So, for the moment, mifepristone  remains on the market while the case works its way through the legal  system.   But the initial ruling by the Federal judge in Texas marked the first  time that a judge has ever overruled the FDA to ban a medication deemed  safe and effective by medical and scientific experts. And it is  troubling confirmation that instead of ending the debate on abortion,  Dobbs was actually the beginning of a different debate: How far will  the war on women's healthcare go before we say enough is enough?   The number of horror stories that have emerged over the past year is  staggering: stories of rape victims--as young as 10 years old--being  denied healthcare because of laws outlawing abortion; an 11-year-old  victim of sex trafficking--also denied a medically necessary abortion;  stories of women being forced to flee their home States to access  basic, reproductive care services; stories of pregnant women suffering  miscarriages being turned away by doctors, until their lives are at  risk, because healthcare providers are understandably afraid of facing  criminal penalties and other serious punishments if their patient is  not sick enough to receive abortion care.   Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, held a  hearing in which we heard more about the horrific consequences of the  Dobbs decision on pregnant women and the doctors who care for them. Let  me tell you about one of our witnesses. Her name is Amanda Zurawski.  She was one of the most profound and heartbreaking witnesses I have  heard during my time in Congress.   Amanda lives in Texas, one of the first States in which a near-total  ban on abortion took effect after Dobbs. Amanda endured 18 months of  fertility treatments to get pregnant. When she finally did, she and her  husband were over the moon. They named their soon-to-be little girl  Willow.   Last August, in the second trimester of her pregnancy, Amanda felt  something unusual. She called her doctor, who told her to come in as  quickly as possible. After an examination, Amanda and her husband  received a heartbreaking diagnosis: Her cervix had dilated prematurely.  The loss of her baby was inevitable. Amanda asked what could be done to  assure what she called ``the respectful passing'' of her baby and to  protect Amanda from a possibly deadly infection.   To her shock, her doctors told her there was nothing they could do  because of Texas's new anti-abortion laws--laws that threaten doctors  with fines of up to $100,000, up to 99 years in prison, and loss of  their medical license. Amanda's doctors tried to find another hospital  nearby that could possibly help her--but those hospitals all had the  same response: Because of Texas's new laws, they couldn't do anything.   Amanda told our committee: ``People have asked why we didn't get on a  plane or in our car to go to a state where the laws aren't so  restrictive. But we live in the middle of Texas, and the nearest  `sanctuary' state is at least an eight-hour drive. Developing sepsis-- which can kill quickly--in a car in the middle of the West Texas  desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence, and it's  not a choice we should have had to even consider. So all we could do  was wait.''   After 3 agonizing days, Amanda developed a raging fever and  dangerously low blood pressure. Sepsis had set in. Her husband rushed  her to the hospital. Several hours later, her daughter arrived,  stillborn. Amanda spent the next 3 days in the I.C.U. fighting for her  own life. She has spent the last 8 months battling trauma and  depression, as well as the medical fallout from her delayed treatment,  including complications that may make it difficult to ever have  children.   We also heard from an OB/GYN, Dr. Nisha Verma, who has chosen to stay  and practice in Georgia despite knowing that, in her words, ``Georgia's  law threatened to make [her] a criminal for providing life-saving care  to [her] patients.''   Dr. Verma told our committee : ``Imagine looking someone in the eye  and saying: `I have all the skills and the tools to care for you, but  our state's politicians have told me I can't.'''   She reminded us that the U.S. already has the highest maternal  mortality rate of any wealthy nation. Restrictive abortion laws, she  said, are making pregnancy even more dangerous for women. Regrettably,  some of our Republican colleagues on the committee tried to make the  hearing about what they called late-term abortions and other abortion  foes call ``partial birth'' abortions--both medically inaccurate terms.   They neglected to note that abortions after 21 weeks account for less  than 1 percent of abortions in this country, according to the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention. They also failed to acknowledge  that in the very rare instances when an abortion happens later in a  pregnancy, it is generally because the woman's life is in danger; a  fatal fetal anomaly has been discovered, as in Amanda's case; or  because a woman wasn't able to get an abortion earlier due to  restrictive laws.   For nearly 50 years, abortion opponents said their only goal was to  return the right to decide abortion laws to the State. It is now clear  that was a trojan horse. Dismantling Roe was the first step. The real  goal is to systemically strip away access to abortion nationwide. And  that is exactly what they are doing. Last year, dozens of congressional  Republicans proposed a bill that would ban abortion nationwide at 15  weeks--even in States that have chosen to protect access to abortion  later in pregnancy. And one member of our committee noted yesterday:  ``We're not going to back off.''   In addition, nearly 150 congressional Republicans joined an amicus  brief to the Supreme Court in the mifepristone case, arguing for the  Court to keep in place the Fifth Circuit's stay that limited  mifepristone access nationwide--even in States where abortion remains  legal.  [[Page S1411]]    Congress needs to stop this chaos and needless, avoidable suffering  by passing the Women's Health Protection Act to restore abortion access  across the country.                            ____________________     Madam President, earlier this year, Chicago--and the  entire legal world--lost a giant. John Devitt Cooney, Sr., a titan of  trial law, passed away at the age of 68. He was a skilled litigator who  used his brilliant legal mind, charm, quick wit, and sense of humor to  help everyday ``Davids'' in the never-ending battle against corporate  ``Goliaths.'' John may have been born for the role.   His father, Robert Cooney, Sr., served in World War II, returned  home--GI benefits in hand--and attended Loyola University School of Law  in Chicago. When he graduated from law school, Robert worked in the  Cook County State's Attorney's Office before setting up a successful  personal injury firm. John followed suit.   Born and raised in Oak Park, IL, John graduated from Fenwick High  School and went on to attend Georgetown University for his  undergraduate studies. During his years at Georgetown, he briefly  worked on Capitol Hill. It was the 1970s: an era of disco, tie-dye, and  Watergate. While John may not have been all that interested in politics  at the time, his experience on Capitol Hill enhanced his interest in  the law.   John finished his studies at Georgetown and moved back to Illinois to  attend Loyola University School of Law in Chicago. His first job out of  law school was as a Cook County Assistant State's Attorney, just like  his father, where he worked within the Felony Trial Division. It was a  formative experience for John. As a young lawyer, he developed a deep  empathy for how wrongful acts hurt victims and their families. It was  there where he honed his craft, spending invaluable time in the  courtroom, selecting juries, developing trial strategies, and  presenting cases to juries.   After 5 years, in 1985, John joined his father, his brother Robert,  Jr., and his future partner Kevin Conway, at the Chicago personal  injury firm, Cooney & Stenn. John made partner in just five years at  the firm that would become Cooney & Conway, one of the leading personal  injury and wrongful death firms in the United States. John excelled in  cases related to construction accidents and product liability, and he  had a strong commitment to helping individuals in asbestos exposure  cases.   Some may have only heard of ``asbestos'' or ``mesothelioma'' through  late-night television commercials or radio ads. If that is the case,  they are fortunate. Asbestos is a strong, heat resistant fiber that can  be found in many building materials, such as insulation, roofing  shingles, and pipe coverings. Inhaling these fibers can have  devastating health consequences. As early as the 1930s, public health  professionals were sounding the alarm about the dangers of exposure to  asbestos. Yet, for decades, some companies ignored the risks, putting  profits above the health and well-being of employees and consumers.   Between 1940 and 1979, nearly 30 million workers were exposed to  asbestos, and around one-third of those workers were veterans. To this  day, exposure to asbestos is the only known cause of mesothelioma, an  aggressive and incurable form of cancer in which a tumor develops in  the protective lining of lungs, and slowly compresses until the victim  suffocates. It can take years to discover mesothelioma, and by the time  it is discovered, the victim often only has several months to live.   John and his team at Cooney & Conway focused on holding the companies  that put profits over people accountable and doing right by victims and  their families. And they were successful, obtaining more than $20  billion for victims and their families, including a $200 million  asbestos exposure settlement that was the largest personal injury  settlement in the history of Illinois. While compensation does little  to ease the pain or the loss of a loved one to this devastating  disease, John's efforts protected victims' rights to justice and gave  them a voice against powerful corporations.   John's legacy goes well beyond the courtroom. In 2014, John became  president of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association, an organization of  more than 2,000 members that has served the interests of plaintiffs'  attorneys and consumers since 1952. He also was the founding chairman  of the mass torts litigation committee for the American Bar  Association, and he served as an elected governor of the American  Association for Justice, the leading voice for trial lawyers at the  national level.   John and his firm also gave back. Cooney & Conway provided more than  $1 million to support the work of Dr. Hedy Lee Kindler, one of the  Nation's leading mesothelioma researchers at the University of Chicago  Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center, a leading mesothelioma research  and treatment center. John also served on the boards of the University  of Chicago Medical Center and Lurie Children's Hospital.   Holding large manufacturers and the wealthiest corporations  accountable was not just a professional endeavor. For John, it was  personal. Everyday folks--pipefitters, laborers, construction workers,  members of ``The Greatest Generation''--those are the people for whom  John gladly went to bat. He knew these were people whose only error was  venturing into a hazardous workplace, putting in a hard day's work, and  daring to breathe, to try to make a good life for themselves and their  families.   Earlier this year, Loretta and I gathered with John's family and  friends at Old St. Pat's Church in Chicago, to say farewell to John and  celebrate the light that he brought into this world. John's many  friends filled every pew.   Loretta and I extend our sincerest condolences to Barbara, his loving  wife of 35 years; his daughter Elizabeth (Matt); his sons Devitt  (Bess); and Bobby (Hutton); his brother Robert, Jr., (Loretta); his  entire family; and his many friends and colleagues. John's legacy and  contributions to the law, to Chicago, and to our Nation will not be  forgotten.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
