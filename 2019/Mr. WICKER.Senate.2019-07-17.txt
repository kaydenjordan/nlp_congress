 Mr. President, if the Senator from North Dakota was here  to speak about Apollo 11 and got here a moment or two before me, I am  happy to yield.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota, and I  thank all of the people who have arranged for this special recognition.    I am delighted to yield to my friend from Oklahoma.    Mr. President, it is really hard to believe that the  first Moon landing was 50 years ago, but, in fact, 50 years ago today,  three Americans were on their way to the Moon--Neil Armstrong, Buzz  Aldrin, and Michael Collins.   I had the honor of actually meeting with Buzz Aldrin just the other  day, shaking his hand, and being able to listen to his perspectives  about what has happened in the last 50 years. What a great American.   At this moment, I would also honor the names of Neil Armstrong and  Michael Collins. While Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got to step foot  on the Moon, Michael Collins' assignment was to stay in the vehicle and  orbit solo above. It was not at all guaranteed that his two colleagues  would get back. We certainly thought we had the technology; we thought  we could do it, and indeed we did, but it was not a given.   Michael Collins wrote during that lonely flight while his two  colleagues were walking on the face of the Moon:         I am . . . absolutely isolated from any known life. I am       it. If a count were taken, the score would be three billion       plus two over on the other side of the Moon, and one plus God       knows what on this side.   [[Page S4890]]     Those are the words of American hero Michael Collins.   These three men were separated from the rest of humanity, but they  certainly were not alone. Hundreds of millions of people watched and  prayed and gave them their best wishes.   It is hard to believe--and I still have to pinch myself--that I was a  freshman in college for this Moon walk, and that was 50 years ago. How  could 50 years have passed by so quickly?   Men and women have always looked up at the night sky and seen their  heroes in the constellations. Now we still look up at the sky, and we  see our heroes, but among them are astronauts who go to the stars and  return and will go to the Moon and to Mars and return.   I want to salute the people who have done it before and the people  who are making plans to put a man and woman on the face of the Moon  within 5 years.   I was so honored to chair a hearing just this morning featuring NASA  Administrator Bridenstine, who has put forward a bold proposal from the  Trump administration, which has moved the deadline up from 10 years to  5 years. Indeed, I can tell you, it is the goal of NASA and it is the  goal of this Member of the U.S. Senate and the committee that I chair  to facilitate making this go and actually putting a man and a woman  back on the face of the Moon in 5 years and then, beyond that, on Mars.   These are ambitious goals, which match and rival the ambition of  President Kennedy, who announced this plan in 1961. Credit goes to  President Johnson, who took up the cause after the assassination of  President Kennedy, and President Nixon, a Republican succeeding two  Democrats, who saw it to fruition in 1969.   I am proud to salute all of the people--some nameless, faceless  people who are not famous--for their role in this magnificent  accomplishment.   I am proud to say that Mississippians were among the first to answer  President Kennedy's call. After all, the Saturn V rocket used for the  Apollo Program was tested at Stennis Space Center in Hancock County in  Mississippi, where we still do almost all of the rocket testing in the  United States of America.   As Wernher von Braun, one of the leaders of U.S. early space efforts  once said, ``I don't know yet what method we will use to get to the  Moon, but I do know that we [will] have to go through Mississippi to  get there.'' That was true back in the sixties, and it is true today as  we approach the one-fifth mark of the 21st century.   We owe so much to the pioneers. Humankind owes so much to the people  who answered President Kennedy's charge not only to win the space  race--our country against those cosmonauts of the Soviet Union--but  also for all of the peaceful results that have come from this.   Technologies behind CT scans came from the space program. Intensive  care monitoring equipment, which saves lives every day around the  globe, came from the scientific discoveries that were accomplished  during our race to the Moon. GPS and smart phones all have their  origins in Apollo.   The commercial space sector is now valued at more than $400 billion,  and it is reminding us all of the power of free enterprise to open up  new frontiers. Clearly, that $400 billion will grow over the next  decade, perhaps to trillions and trillions of dollars.   Certainly the writers of Newsweek were correct when they called the  Moonshot ``the best return on investment since Leonardo da Vinci bought  himself a sketch pad.'' They were exactly right, and this next shot  should give us an opportunity also to get our money's worth.   We will go back to the Moon; we will go on to Mars. So as we  celebrate the 50th anniversary, we look toward the future to all the  missions that will come and go, and we remind ourselves of this  country's common purpose and potential. The Moon landing was not the  end of an age of discovery; it was only the beginning.   I yield the floor.
