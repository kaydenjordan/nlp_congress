 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California (Mr. Valadao) for handling this Special Order tonight and  bringing our colleagues here to talk about the reality of this State of  the Union Address that we experienced here less than 24 hours ago.   I appreciate what you said, and I thought it was appropriate that you  brought as your guest a constituent who is in the energy industry  because you explained how domestic energy production has been decimated  by this President and his administration and how it is having an untold  cost on the American people.   But I wanted to begin with a quote, and I want to encourage my  colleagues to listen carefully to these words of warning. This is  really important.   ``The tsunami of debt created by the policies of this administration  has to go somewhere. . . .   ``But as the rest of the world copes with the waves of U.S. debt, we  are now all in the same leaky boat. There is just so much of our debt  other nations want to hold. The more of it they accumulate, the closer  we are to the day when they will not want any more.   ``When that happens, slowly or rapidly, our interest rates will go  up, the value of their U.S. bonds will drop, and we will all have big  problems. We need both more awareness and more understanding of this  fundamental threat to our economic well-being and the global economy.   ``But the roots of that threat lie in the disastrous policies of this  administration.   ``Because this massive accumulation of debt was predicted, because it  was foreseeable, because it was unnecessary, because it was the result  of willful and reckless disregard for the warnings that were given and  for the fundamentals of economic management, I am voting against the  debt limit increase.''   Now, do you want to guess who said that? It was not Speaker McCarthy.  It was not Leader McConnell. In fact, it wasn't any Republican.    That quote that I just read to you is from Joe Biden himself when he  was a Senator in 2006. If he was honest, he would have used that same  language right up here last night, but he didn't. Of course, he wasn't  honest.   By the way, in addition to his vocal opposition when he was a Senator  in 2003 and 2006, Senator Joe Biden joined Senate Democrats in opposing  clean debt limit increases.   In 2004, he missed the vote, but he said publicly he would have  opposed it there, as well. So three times as a Senator he opposed the  debt limit increase.   Well, he is singing a completely different tune now. Everybody heard  it.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden's address to the Nation last night was a  missed opportunity. Our country is mired in crisis after crisis of the  President's own making: at home, at our border, abroad.   Simply put, the President's rhetoric last night didn't match the  reality that most Americans have been experiencing since he took office  2 years ago.   John Adams said, ``Facts are stubborn things,'' and the actual state  of our Union is more accurately summed up by one word: decline.   Let's talk about just a couple of those facts very quickly. Just a  snapshot. When President Joe Biden took office, we had peace through  strength.   We had American energy independence--actually, dominance. We had  lower consumer prices, and we had inflation at about 1.4 percent.   But since he took over 2 years ago, now we have war through weakness,  we have foreign energy dependence, we have sky-high consumer prices,  and the inflation rate in December was 6.5 percent.   Now, you tell me. Are you better off today than you were 2 years ago?   No. And that is what the polls indicate.   Most Americans say and respond to the polls that they are doing worse  off financially, and in many other respects, since this President took  over.   Right now, prices are still rising, crime is rising, drug overdoses  are rising, illegal immigration is rising, and our country's leadership  looks embarrassed and weak on the world stage.   Republicans urged President Biden to take advantage of the state of  the Union to chart a new direction, to get us out of this mess, to  reverse the policies that have gotten us into this, to accept  responsibility for the declining state of our country, and pledge to do  better.  [[Page H771]]    But you know what? He didn't do that.   He wouldn't have been the first American President to seek a reset.  Presidential resets are common. They are often necessary, but he  wouldn't acknowledge that last night. He did the opposite.   The reality is that families right now across this country, in my  district and in all of our districts--everybody knows this--are still  paying more for just about everything, including food and gasoline and  electricity and rent, in every category.   According to all the polls, they can feel it, regardless of what this  President wants to say from this podium in this Chamber.   Here is what we need to do. We need to curb the wasteful government  spending that is raising the price of groceries and gas and cars and  housing and growing our national debt, and we need to increase take- home pay.   We need to create good-paying jobs and bring stability to the economy  through pro-growth policies that will enliven our economy and broaden  the pathway out of poverty for more people, but that is not what this  President is suggesting.   You know what their solution was last night and every day here?   More government growth and more spending.   Does anybody really think that our national debt continuing to climb  unchecked is an acceptable outcome in this year's debt ceiling talks?   Joe Biden himself didn't think that. At least he didn't when he was a  Senator. If no one thinks that, then let's start doing something about  it.   President Biden could have started last night, but he didn't. It was  a missed opportunity. I think it was shameful, and I think the American  people know better.   I am grateful to my friend from California for yielding the time, and  I will turn it back over to him.                                time  1815    One of the things that the President said last night was that he  wants to source materials from the U.S.; and as we have talked a little  bit about energy, we have seen pictures of parts of the Amazon  rainforest demolished so they can continue to drill wells over there.   So we are importing, we are damaging environments, and we are not  doing it here in the U.S., creating American jobs doing it in the best  way we possibly can in the world, delivering clean energy for our  American people. It is totally frustrating, so I appreciate the  comments from Mr. Johnson.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).
