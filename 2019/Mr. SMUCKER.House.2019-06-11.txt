 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose the rule and spending  package being debated before us. Not only does this massive spending  package blow our budget caps by nearly $200 billion, but this flawed  legislation severely undermines critical protections for the lives of  the unborn.   I am very proud of the work that the Trump administration has been  doing to finally make Title X about family planning and not a way of  using taxpayer money to fund abortions. The administration's new Title  X provisions draw a bright line between abortion and family planning,  while ensuring taxpayer dollars are put towards comprehensive,  preventive, and primary care for women.   These new regulations will also make it easier for faith-based  clinics to provide care through the Title X program, which will expand  access to care for families. Yet, under this partisan piece of  legislation, these protections are stripped and taxpayer funding for  abortion clinics is increased. This is unacceptable.   The fight to give a voice to the unborn will not be swayed by  partisan poison pills. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the  underlying bill.
