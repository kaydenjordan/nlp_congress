 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this pernicious  antilabor amendment that would do nothing but make it easier for U.S.- owned but foreign-flagged cruise ship operators to exploit and abuse  the seafarers they employ.   The right for seafarers to seek maintenance and cure for injuries,  illness, and damages at sea has been a part of U.S. maritime law for as  long as U.S. ships have flown the flag on the high seas.   The effect of this amendment is clear: it would restrict foreign  seafarers employed on foreign-flagged cruise ships from filing claims  for damages or expenses related to personal injury, illness, or even  death, in a U.S. court.   This provision is completely contrary to a general maritime law  principle that has been around since at least the 12th century, a  principle that has remained applicable because of the international  nature of shipping and the plain fact that, even today, ship operators  maintain considerable leverage over individual seafarers.   This provision also violates an international convention that the  U.S. has ratified. Under the Shipowners' Liability Convention, national  laws or regulations have to be interpreted and enforced to ensure  equality of treatment to all seafarers, irrespective of nationality,  domicile, or race. This amendment would shred that international  obligation.   It is also contrary to the principles and terms defining seafarers'  rights under the International Maritime Labor Convention.   It is also worth mentioning that the amendment before us may be  unnecessary because, in many cases, seafarer contracts contain binding  arbitration clauses.   In any event, it makes no sense to deny access to U.S. courts for  foreign  [[Page H5839]]  seafarers seeking compassion for maintenance and cure claims. The  cruise lines can easily avoid frivolous lawsuits. All they need do is  honor their longstanding customary responsibility to pay for the care  and recovery of the seafarers they employ when they are ill or injured.   In closing, no one has provided any evidence--much less, compelling  evidence--to justify the reversal of longstanding seafarer protections.  In the absence of evidence, the House should reject this unwarranted  amendment.   This vote is purely to injure seafarers, purely to disobey maritime  conventions to which we are a party, purely to disobey laws of the sea  from the 12th century that we have obeyed since we obtained our  independence from England, for no purpose other than to help often  American-owned--not always--but foreign-flagged cruise ship lines.   There is no purpose for this amendment. The House should reject this  amendment as it has in the past.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it sounds nice to say they can go home to their country  from which they came, where presumably the foreign-flagged ship  operates, but that is not the case. These are often American-owned  ships or European-owned ships, and they are flagged in a country of  convenience--Liberia, Panama, or wherever--where the worker may have no  connection whatsoever, where the ship, for that matter, has no real  connection other than flying the flag of convenience, and where there  may not be a very decent court system.   That is why the practice has been, since before our independence--it  has worked well the entire history of our country--that a foreign  citizen working on a ship that calls in the United States, if denied  the maintenance and cure that the ship is supposed to take care of  someone on the high seas, then they can sue in an American court. We  have always done this. There has been no showing of hardship  whatsoever.   Yes, some rich cruise line operators would like, perhaps, to get rid  of this obligation, but that is no excuse. This is an antilabor, an  antihuman amendment. It ought to be defeated.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its defeat, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 43 Offered by Mr. McGovern    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 43  printed in House Report 115-217.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle F of title V, add the following:       SEC. 564. ATOMIC VETERANS SERVICE MEDAL.         (a) Service Medal Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall       design and produce a military service medal, to be known as       the ``Atomic Veterans Service Medal'', to honor retired and       former members of the Armed Forces who are radiation-exposed       veterans (as such term is defined in section 1112(c)(3) of       title 38, United States Code).        (b) Distribution of Medal.--        (1) Issuance to retired and former members.--At the request       of a radiation-exposed veteran, the Secretary of Defense       shall issue the Atomic Veterans Service Medal to the veteran.        (2) Issuance to next-of-kin.--In the case of a radiation-      exposed veteran who is deceased, the Secretary may provide       for issuance of the Atomic Veterans Service Medal to the       next-of-kin of the person.        (3) Application.--The Secretary shall prepare and       disseminate as appropriate an application by which radiation-      exposed veterans and their next-of-kin may apply to receive       the Atomic Veterans Service Medal.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the McGovern-  [[Page H5840]]  Emmer amendment, which would simply create a service medal to be  awarded to atomic veterans or their surviving family members in honor  of their service and sacrifice to our Nation.   Between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our Armed Forces  participated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. Now known as atomic  veterans, these GIs were placed in extremely dangerous areas and were  constantly exposed to potentially dangerous levels of radiation in the  performance of their duties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even  talk to their doctors about their past exposure to radiation.   Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush recognized  the atomic veterans' value and service and acted to provide specialized  care and compensation for their harrowing duty.   In 2007, our allies, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia,  enacted their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to  honor their atomic veterans who served with the United States.   Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of  our atomic veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service  of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. Mr.  Chairman, this is a pitiful excuse.   Tragically, more than 75 percent of atomic veterans have already  passed away, never having received this recognition. They served  honorably and kept a code of silence. Because of that, it most  certainly led to many of these veterans passing away prematurely.   Past administrations and Congresses have dealt with the thornier  issues of legality in compensation. What remains is recognizing these  veterans' duty, honor, and faithful service to our Nation. Time is  running out. That is what this amendment seeks to do.   I call upon my House colleagues to support this amendment that I,  along with my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), have introduced. We  owe it to our veterans to recognize their selfless service to our  Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Emmer).
