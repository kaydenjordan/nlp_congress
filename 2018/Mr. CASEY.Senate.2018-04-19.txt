 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I was on the floor today to first and  foremost congratulate Senator Duckworth on the new addition to her  family. We were anticipating seeing a new baby, and now we will be able  to meet that child right here on the Senate floor.   We do want to commend and salute Senator Duckworth, of course--long  before today--on her life of service and remarkable courage and  sacrifice, and our Nation owes her a debt of gratitude, not just for  this recent news about her resolution but also for her great service to  the country.   This resolution is an important step forward for the U.S. Senate in  terms of the people who are permitted to be on the floor, and we are  glad that we have such consensus to make it possible for the youngest  among us to get to the floor.   It is also one way to demonstrate our Nation's commitment to families  and policies that allow children to get off to a strong and smart start  to their lives. So many of us have worked on those policies for many  years, whether it is making childcare more affordable, paid family  leave, flexible work arrangements, or so many other priorities. I hope  we can use this opportunity to continue to work together to benefit our  Nation's children, and we are grateful to be part of that effort.   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise to talk about Syria and all of the  horrors we have been seeing over not just months but years.   Many people around this Nation, as well as people in the  international community--whether they are in refugee camps in Turkey,  Jordan, and Lebanon, or in bombed-out neighborhoods in Damascus,  Aleppo, and Homs--so many people across the country and across the  world are wondering, what will President Trump do next in Syria? Are we  any closer to a resolution of this terrible conflict that will allow  the Syrian people to rebuild their lives?   More than 7 years have passed since the Syrian people first began  protesting the Assad regime's brutal rule, and that may be a terrible  understatement. The ongoing conflict continues to have an impact on  U.S. national security interests. In these 7 years, almost 500,000  Syrians have been killed--half a million Syrians killed--and more than  12 million have been displaced from their homes. Sometimes that means  they leave their homes and go to another community or another place  within Syria, but of course many--maybe even most--have gone to another  country. It is hard to comprehend that because that is a little more  than half of the population of Syria. Imagine if half of more than 300  million Americans were forced to leave their homes because of a war,  because of bombings, because of the brutality of a regime. That is what  has happened in Syria. Half the population has been displaced, and half  a million have been killed.   This is a conflict that began rather modestly but courageously. A  group of young people scrawled graffiti on the walls of local buildings  in protest of their own government's repressive policies. This was in  the context of a movement of young people across the region--meaning  the Middle East--standing up against autocratic governance. The Syrian  regime cracked down brutally, and of course we all know that the  conflict escalated from there.   I remind my colleagues of the genesis of this conflict because so  much has happened over the last 7 years, and the  [[Page S2302]]  path toward a resolution remains unclear. I have said before and will  say again today that I believe, as most analysts do, that there is no  purely military solution to the conflict in Syria.   Although the Russian and Iranian influence has always been present in  Damascus, it has grown exponentially as the United States has ceded its  leadership role on this issue. Beginning with the Obama administration,  I have urged the executive branch to articulate a clear policy toward  Syria, to empower our diplomatic and defense officials to demonstrate  U.S. leadership on this issue, and to resist ceding our regional  influence to adversaries like Russia and Iran.   We cannot afford to ignore the carnage in Syria at the hands of the  Assad regime and their backers--namely, of course, the Iranians and the  Russians. U.S. vision and leadership are needed.   Following the illegal, immoral, and appalling gas attack that killed  more than 80 civilians in April 2017, the U.S. military executed  standoff airstrikes against Syrian regime military targets. That was a  proportional response to a heinous attack on civilians, but I also  encouraged the administration at the time to develop a comprehensive  plan to address the Syria conflict. Then nothing happened--well, I  guess not nothing. In the year since then, the President has  disempowered and now replaced Secretary of State Tillerson, failed to  take decisive action in implementing sanctions on Russian entities  enacted by overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate, and he has  continued to confuse our allies with his policymaking-by-tweet.   This week, I attended a briefing on this issue conducted by a number  of administration officials, principally by Secretary Mattis. I was  impressed with his goal of developing a cohesive Syria strategy;  however, I remain concerned that no clear strategy has yet emerged to  promote U.S. national security interests in the region, to advance the  national security of our allies, such as Israel, or to protect the  innocent Syrians being targeted by their own government. This lack of a  consistent and considered strategy has given Bashar al-Assad the  political space to continue to commit war crimes--and that is what they  are, war crimes.   Just one day after President Trump announced--again on Twitter--that  the United States would soon be withdrawing from Syria, Assad's forces  committed another heinous chemical weapons attack on a town that had  already been suffering under siege by the Russian-backed Syrian Army.  At least 56 civilians were killed in 24 hours.   Now, of course, we all know that last week, the United States, the  United Kingdom, and France responded with missile strikes against three  Syrian chemical weapons development and storage facilities. But we have  not heard what the administration plans to do next to work with our  allies and partners on the humanitarian and political aspects of this  conflict.    Over the last several years, Russian, Iranian, and Turkish leaders  have met to discuss the future of Syria. We all saw that picture of Mr.  Ruhani, Mr. Erdogan, and Mr. Putin--three of our government's  adversaries. Sometimes we work with them, but on most days, at least  two of the three--the Russian and Iranian leaders--are adversaries.  Certainly Mr. Erdogan has been back and forth between being an  adversary and having an alliance with us on some issues. That picture  was very disturbing. Are we going to allow those three to dictate  policy not just in Syria but in the Middle East? Those three? I don't  think so. I don't think that is what American policy should be.   By failing to engage in these negotiations, the United States has  ceded control of the outcomes to states with national interests often  in direct conflict with our own. The Russian Government has made clear  that they believe that all Syrian territory must return to the Assad  regime's control before political reforms can be considered. The  Iranian regime has made clear that their objective is to remain in  control of territory--either directly or through proxies--from Tehran  to Beirut.   This is unacceptable. Assad's continued presence in Damascus is and  will remain a recruiting tool for terrorists in the region. His regime  allowed organizations like ISIS to grow and metastasize while Iranian  forces have supplied tens of millions of arms to Hezbollah fighters who  pose a clear threat to Israel.   At different points during the last 15 months, we have heard many  conflicting reports of this administration's Syria policy. At one  point, the administration said it would endorse a transition plan that  would leave Bashar al-Assad in power for at least another 4 years. At  another point, Secretary Tillerson said the United States would retain  a long-term military presence in Syria for combat operations, surge  ``stabilization'' assistance to opposition-controlled areas, and  ``rally the Syrian people and individuals within the regime to compel  Assad to step down.'' We have also seen the President say that we are  withdrawing from Syria and, most recently, conflicting reports on  whether the United States will levy new sanctions on the Russian  entities that enable and support the murderous Assad regime. So there  have been a lot of mixed signals by different officials over the course  of these 15 months since the administration started.   Meanwhile, our Russian and Iranian adversaries have been clear and  consistent in their policies: Protect their Syrian puppet, Bashar al- Assad, as long as it is politically expedient. The Russians and  Iranians don't give a damn about the Syrian people or regional  stability. In fact, instability serves their interest. They fuel and  feed the regime. They advise and equip Assad's army and security forces  and, in the case of Russia, block the United Nations from holding the  regime accountable.   The continued political turmoil in Damascus coupled with continued  besiegement of the Syrian people will lead to long-term instability in  Syria. The U.S. military should be commended for its leadership in the  international coalition fight against ISIS and for supporting local and  regional forces in retaking Iraqi and Syrian territory from terrorist  control.   CENTCOM commander General Votel testified in March of 2017, and these  are important words that he spoke:         We will defeat ISIS militarily; however, a lasting defeat       of this enemy will not be achieved unless similar progress is       made on the political front. Instability all but guarantees a       resurgence of ISIS or the emergence of other terrorist groups       seeking to exploit conditions to advance their own aims.    So said the CENTCOM commander, and we should listen to his words and  take action in accordance with those words.   The administration must continue to lead the international community  in humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and accelerate support  for programs that promote good governance, rule of law, and basic  service provision in communities liberated from ISIS control. While we  believe partners in the region should also contribute more generously,  we should lead by example by robustly funding relevant accounts in the  fiscal 2019 budget.   I am also thankful for the brave Americans who have volunteered their  skills and their time to help the people of Syria survive--literally  survive. I thank, in particular, the Syrian American Medical Society,  doctors and aid workers who deliver assistance to displaced Syrians and  to those who have remained within their borders. These courageous  volunteers have stepped in to fill the gaps left by the international  community and--I have to say--risking their own lives virtually every  minute they are on the ground.   More than 7 years since the conflict began, the situation in Syria  remains critical and U.S. leadership is needed more than ever. Although  I, too, expressed concern with President Obama's Syrian strategy, a  year and a half into the Trump Presidency, it is no longer sufficient  to blame the previous administration. I urge President Trump to present  a strategy for Syria that protects American national security interests  in the region, pushes back against Iranian and Russian influence and  aggression, and, finally, empowers the Syrian people in their pursuit  of a stable, secure, and prosperous future for their country.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I wish to extend my support for the State  of Israel in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of its founding.   Since its independence in 1948, Israel's promotion of democratic  values has helped forge a thriving society and represents freedom in a  region where that value is all too scarce. From its outset, Israel has  faced a myriad of challenges, which it has navigated successfully and  against all odds. Israel continues to remain America's strongest ally  in the Middle East, as well as a central pillar of our strategy to  achieve peace and stability in the region.   Once again, I want to extend my warmest congratulations to the State  of Israel on its 70th anniversary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Edward J.  Cernic, Sr., a beloved father, grandfather, husband, politician, and  member of his community in Johnstown, Cambria County, PA.  Affectionately known as ``Pap,'' Ed dedicated his life to his family  and community. Ed passed away on March 21, 2018, at the age of 85.   Ed believed in the importance of civic duty and touched countless  lives in his hometown of Tanneryville, near Johnstown. He cared deeply  about his community and was a powerful advocate for his region,  especially in times of turmoil. In the aftermath of the 1977 Johnstown  Flood, a disaster which took 84 lives in Cambria County, Ed headed the  Tanneryville Flood Recovery Association and raised more than $100,000  in recovery funds. He was a leader in an effort that took 17 busloads  of people to Washington, DC to advocate for Federal flood relief  funding. He even maneuvered a meeting with President Jimmy Carter after  slipping a note to first lady Rosalyn Carter during a campaign stop in  Johnstown. Their brief sit-down resulted in Federal support for the  entire city. That was the kind of leader that Ed was: an honorable man  with a big heart, who always put his community first.   Ed was a natural and successful businessman, founding several  businesses that made Cernic a brand name throughout the region. He was  proud to be able to create jobs in his community.   He was a major force in local and State politics and a dedicated  champion for transportation and infrastructure projects in Cambria  County. In a region that has faced many challenges, he was a man of  action who courageously fought to push the community forward. Though  well-known for his friendships with Democratic public officials and  political candidates, Ed never hesitated to reach across the aisle to  help the community and was highly respected by members of both parties.  Ed served as chairman of the Greater Johnstown Water Authority and  commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Transportation Commission. He  participated in many other local nonprofit and charitable  organizations.   Ed's impact on his community is most evident at his famous, annual  summer picnic at Cernic's Picnic Grove. Ed had a unique ability to  gather people from far and wide--elected officials, political  candidates, business leaders, and community leaders--to celebrate and  show their support for the people of Cambria County. This yearly  gathering exemplifies Ed's contributions to the State and local  community, as well as what he valued most: family, friends, and his  beloved hometown.   Ed's legacy will endure in the jobs he created, the communities he  supported, and the people he served. Johnstown and Cambria County had  no stronger champion. As a Pennsylvanian and as a friend of Ed and his  family, I will miss his generous spirit and his passion for helping the  people of his home county. We extend our condolences to Ed Cernic, Jr.,  and the Cernic family.                            ____________________
