 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, later this afternoon the Senate will  vote on the President's nomination of Alexander Acosta to serve as the  U.S. Secretary of Labor. Mr. Acosta has excellent credentials and is  well qualified for the position. He understands that a good-paying job  is critical to helping workers realize the American dream for  themselves and for their families.   After immigrating to the United States from Cuba, Mr. Acosta's  parents worked hard to create more opportunities for their son.  Alexander Acosta became the first person in his family to go to  college, and from there he has had quite an impressive career.   He has already been confirmed by the U.S. Senate three different  times: He served as a Republican member of the National Labor Relations  Board, he  [[Page S2587]]  served as Assistant Attorney General for the U.S. Justice Department's  Civil Rights Division, and he served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern  District of Florida.   Mr. Acosta's most recent role was serving as dean of Florida  International University's law school. The school's president told the  Miami Herald recently, ``Alex has a destiny in public service. . . .  He's a person of integrity, conscientious, thoughtful, he doesn't  overreach.''   On March 22, Mr. Acosta had a hearing in the Senate Labor Committee  that lasted two and a half hours. Following his hearing, he answered  380 follow-up questions for the record--604 questions if you count the  sub-questions. Then, on March 30, our committee approved Mr. Acosta's  nomination, readying the nomination for consideration by the full  Senate.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a list of 140 groups, which includes business groups and labor unions,  which support Mr. Acosta's nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               140 groups that support Mr. Acosta's nomination         Aeronautical Repair Station Association; Air Conditioning       Contractors of America; Alaska Chamber; Alliance of Wyoming       Manufacturers; American Apparel & Footwear Association;       American Bakers Association; American Beverage Association;       American Coatings Association; American Coke and Coal       Chemicals Institute; American Concrete Pressure Pipe       Association; American Fiber Manufacturers Association;       American Fire Sprinkler Association; American Foundry       Society; American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers;       American Home Furnishings Alliance; American Hotel & Lodging       Association; American Iron and Steel Institute; American       Moving & Storage Association; American Staffing Association;       American Supply Association; American Trucking Associations;       AmericanHort; Americans for Tax Reform; Argentum.

Mr. President, the supporters include the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, the National Federation of  Independent Business, the National Association of Manufacturers, the  International Franchise Association, the Associated Builders and  Contractors, and the American Beverage Association.   Here are some examples of what these groups had to say about Mr.  Acosta. The International Franchise Association said, ``Franchise  owners around the country are facing a great deal of regulatory  uncertainty as a result of the wreckage created by the previous  administration's out-of-control Department of Labor. Mr. Acosta's  exemplary record handling labor issues as a member of the NLRB has  shown the appropriate balance needed to protect the interests of  employees and employers.''   The National Federation of Independent Business said, ``Alexander  Acosta is an experienced public servant with a distinguished record.  His knowledge of labor issues and his service as U.S. Attorney make him  an especially strong candidate to take on the entrenched bureaucracy,  which has imposed unbelievably severe and costly regulations on small  business in the recent years.''   The National Retail Federation said, ``Mr. Acosta's diverse  experiences in both public service and the private sector position him  well to be an effective and pragmatic leader at the Department of  Labor.''   Why is this nomination so important? In his new book, New York Times  columnist Thomas Friedman uses the term ``Great Acceleration'' for all  of the technological, social, environmental, and market changes  simultaneously sweeping across the globe and argues that we are now  ``living through one of the greatest inflection points in history'' as  a result. Add Ball State University's finding that automation is  responsible for the loss of 88 percent of our manufacturing jobs. Add  globalization. Add social, cultural, climate changes, and terrorism,  and you get a big mismatch between the change of pace and the ability  of the average American worker to keep up and fit in the accelerating  forces shaping the workplace.   Earlier this year, after a group of senators listened to a group of  scientists talk about the advances in artificial intelligence, one  Senator asked, ``Where are we all going to work?''   Tom Friedman says that probably the most important governance  challenge is a great need ``to develop the learning systems, training  systems, management systems, social safety nets, and government  regulations that would enable citizens to get the most out of these  accelerations and cushion their worst impacts.''   One of the federal government's chief actors in this drama should be  the U.S. Secretary of Labor. In fact, as many have suggested and the  House of Representatives has done, the title of the job for which  Alexander Acosta has been nominated should be changed to the Secretary  of Workforce, not Secretary of Labor.   Labor union membership in the private sector today is down to less  than  [[Page S2588]]  7 percent. The issue for workers today is not whether they belong to a  union. It is whether they have the skills to adapt to the changing  workplace and to find and keep a job. To be accurate, to create and  keep a job. My generation found jobs. This generation is more likely to  have to create their own jobs.   In his inaugural address, President Trump said he heard ``forgotten  men and women'' who are struggling to keep up and fit into today's  changing world: ``[F]or too many of our citizens, a different reality  exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities;  rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of  our nation . . . `' That is what President Trump said in his inaugural  address.   Ten days earlier, in his farewell address, President Obama said he,  too, heard those same voices: ``[T]oo many families, in inner cities  and in rural counties, have been left behind . . . if we don't create  opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has  stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come. . . . `'   That was President Obama.   What can we do about this? The most important thing is to work with  employers and community colleges and technical institutes and find ways  to increase the number of Americans earning post-secondary certificates  and two-year degrees or more.   Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce says  that by 2020--3 years from now--65 percent of the jobs in this country  will require some college or more. And at the rate we are going,  Georgetown predicts the United States will lack 5 million workers with  an adequate post-secondary education by 2020.   Unfortunately, too many of the federal government's actions over the  last few years have made it harder for American workers to keep up, to  adjust to the changing world, and to create, find, or keep a job.   President Obama's Department of Labor issued 130 percent more final  rules than the previous administration's labor department. Overall, the  Obama Administration issued an average of 85 major rules. These are  rules that may have an impact of $100 million or more a year on the  economy. Eighty-five major rules a year. President Bush, on the other  hand, averaged about 62 a year. That is a 37-percent increase under  President Obama.   Take the overtime rule. In my state, its costs would add hundreds of  dollars per student in college tuition and it would force small  businesses across the country to reduce the jobs that provide the  stability that families need. This rule has been delayed by the courts  until at least June 30th of this year.   Take the so-called joint employer policy. This is a policy that  affects franchising and makes it more likely that a parent company will  own and operate its stores instead of allowing franchisees to own and  operate those stores. A Republican majority at the National Labor  Relations Board can start undoing the damage caused by this harmful  decision.   Then, there is the fiduciary rule, which is going to make it too  expensive for the average worker to obtain investment advice about  retirement benefits--again making it harder, not easier, to adjust to  the changing world of work. The Department of Labor under the Trump  administration has delayed this rule for 60 days, until June 9, 2017.  Some parts of the rule are delayed until January 1, 2018.   One rule after another from the Obama administration has stacked a  big wet blanket of costs and time-consuming mandates on job creators,  causing them to create fewer jobs.   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's EEO-1 form will require  employers to provide to the government 20 times as much information as  they do today about how they pay workers. Earlier this month, the  Senator from Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts, and I asked the Office of  Management and Budget to rescind this time-wasting mandate.   There is the ridiculously complex 108-question FAFSA, the federal aid  application form that 20 million families fill out every year as  students go to college. It turns away from college many of the very  students who most need to adjust to this changing world.   The Affordable Care Act defined full-time work as only 30 hours,  forcing employers to cut their workers' hours or reduce hiring  altogether in order to escape the law's mandate and its unaffordable  penalties.   Many of these rules, like the persuader rule, which chills the  ability of employers to retain legal advice during union organizing  activities, seemed designed for the purpose of strengthening the  membership and the power of labor unions.   We are fortunate to have a nominee in Mr. Acosta who can use his good  judgment to reevaluate labor policies that make it much harder to  create jobs and to find jobs.   We know that Mr. Acosta has support from members of both political  parties, and that raises a question for me: Why did the Senate  yesterday have to vote to invoke cloture on Mr. Acosta's nomination?  The vote was bipartisan, with 61 senators voting to end debate so Mr.  Acosta could have had an up or down vote. He could have been approved  by majority vote yesterday. That has been the tradition in the U.S.  Senate for 230 years. There never has been a Cabinet member denied his  or her position by requiring them to get more than 51 votes. There have  been some cloture votes for delay or to take some extra time, but no  one has ever been denied the position by requiring more than 51 votes.   During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White  House and the Senate seventy percent of the time, the minority never  filibustered to death a single presidential nominee. The practice in  the Senate since the Senate's beginning has been that the President  nominates and the Senate decides by majority vote whether to approve  the nomination. Why are we having these cloture votes? We are getting  into more and more of a difficult situation with these votes. It is a  bad habit and both sides, Republicans and Democrats, have caused the  problem.   During the Obama administration, over the 8 years, there were 173  cloture votes on nominations, and I voted to invoke cloture 41 of those  times. For 10 of those nominees, I voted to end debate so that their  nomination could have an up or down vote even though I opposed their  confirmation.   No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who  was in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to  delay and examine, sometimes causing nominations to be withdrawn or  even defeating nominees by a majority vote.   What I would like to suggest today is that if we continue the trend  of requiring cloture votes on presidential nominees--cabinet members  and others--that may work fine as long as we have a president and a  Senate of the same political party, but if we have a president and a  Senate of different political parties and everybody has become  accustomed to voting no on cloture, to requiring a cloture vote and  voting no, the Senate may never be able to confirm any cabinet members  or any sub-cabinet members when the Senate and the president are of  different political parties.   I would suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle that the  Senate is a body of precedent, and I think it would be wise for us to  stop and think, as we proceed, about whether it is wise to require  cloture votes for presidential nominees. Why don't we simply go ahead  and approve them or not approve them by majority vote?   We have an excellent nominee in Mr. Acosta. We are fortunate that  someone of his intelligence and experience is willing to serve as our  U.S. Secretary of Labor. I look forward to voting for and to the Senate  approving his confirmation later today.   I yield the floor.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Alexander  Acosta to be Secretary of the Department of Labor.   Our Nation's Labor Secretary has a responsibility to protect the  safety and legal rights of the American workforce. From prosecuting  civil rights violations to monitoring workplace safety, the Department  of Labor ensures fair treatment. The Labor Secretary must also evaluate  our economy and advocate for fair and equal pay and benefits for  American workers. The Department provides the data and expertise for  policymakers, employers, and workers to make economic decisions.  [[Page S2589]]    Unfortunately, Mr. Acosta's testimony on these points at his  confirmation hearing was disappointing. He would not commit to support  updating overtime rules to make sure that employees get fair pay for  the hours they work. He would not commit to prioritize closing the  gender pay gap. He would not commit to keeping workplace safety  inspectors on the job.   Moreover, when Mr. Acosta led the Civil Rights Division of the  Department of Justice during the George W. Bush Administration, the GAO  reported that there was a ``significant drop in the enforcement of  several major antidiscrimination and voting rights laws.'' The  Secretary of Labor must be a vigilant defender of the rights of  workers.   In a Cabinet where too many department heads are looking out for  millionaires and billionaires, we need a Secretary of Labor who will  look out for the American worker. I am not convinced that Mr. Acosta  will do that job.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.
