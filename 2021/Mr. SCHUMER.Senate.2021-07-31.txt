 Mr. President, yesterday, a substantial bipartisan  majority of Senators agreed to move forward with a debate on the  bipartisan infrastructure bill.   Senators from the bipartisan group continue to finalize the text of  the agreement. Once the bipartisan group completes the legislative  text, I will offer it as a substitute amendment, making it the base of  the bill on the floor. And then we can proceed to the consideration of  additional amendments.   Look, I understand that writing the text of a bill of this size is a  difficult project. I have been part of many such efforts in the past.  But I urge the bipartisan group to finish their work so we can begin  the amendment process here on the floor.   I have said for weeks that the Senate is going to move forward on  both tracks of infrastructure before the beginning of the August  recess. The longer it takes to finish, the longer we will be here. But  we are going to get the job done.   I will update the Senate on the timing of the next vote as we move  forward.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I just want to give a quick update.   As everyone knows, we are waiting for the bipartisan group of  Senators to finalize the text of their agreement. I have been informed  the group is working hard to bring this negotiation to a conclusion,  but they believe they need a little bit more time. I am prepared to  give it to them because--because, as I have always said from the  beginning, I am fully committed to passing a bipartisan infrastructure  bill, and so the Senate will remain in session today so that they can  bring this to a conclusion.   Again, this is an important bill. I know all the parties want to get  this right. As soon as their legislative text is finalized, we will  review it, and then I will offer it as the substitute amendment. After  that, we can begin voting for amendments.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:18 p.m., recessed subject  to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 9:51 p.m. when called to  order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Bennet).                            ____________________     Mr. President, the bipartisan group of Senators has  still not finalized the legislative text of their substitute amendment.  The staffs are still working and say they will have the final  legislative text ready tomorrow. Therefore, the Senate will reconvene  tomorrow at 12 noon.   As I have said, when the legislative text is ready, I will offer it  as the substitute amendment, and, after that, we can begin voting on  amendments.   As a reminder, upon completion of the bipartisan infrastructure bill,  the Senate will turn to the budget resolution with reconciliation  instructions.   I want to thank the Capitol Police, the clerks, and the Senate staff  for working these past 2 late nights.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Sunday,  August 1; that following the prayer and pledge, the Executive Journal  be approved to date and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:53 p.m., adjourned until  Sunday, August 1, 2021, at 12 noon.
