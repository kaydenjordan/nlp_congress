 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McGovern for yielding  the time.   Mr. Speaker, our neighbors back home send us here to Washington to  stand up for them and to stand up to the powerful special interests  that have all too much influence here in the halls of Washington. They  expect us to work to lower costs and for good-paying jobs and safe and  healthy communities.   That is why this Republican polluters over people act is so  dangerous. It does the opposite of what we should be doing here. This  bill would reward the price gouging of the big oil and gas companies.  This bill would roll back our bedrock environmental protections for  clean air, clean water, and lower-cost clean energy.   Mr. McGovern, I think it is important that you know that in the  Energy and Commerce Committee last week, at the very last minute, with  no hearing and very little debate, they included a provision that would  roll back an important piece of the Inflation Reduction Act that puts  money back into people's pockets back home for energy efficiency  rebates and discounts to help lower energy bills. They do this at a  time when Exxon made record profits last year, $56 billion, and Chevron  $36 billion.   Fossil fuels were the main driver of inflation, yet you want to give  another massive giveaway to oil and gas companies and take away simple  energy rebates for homeowners?   They are doing it at a time when it looks as if this bill would  increase the deficit by half a billion dollars. This is an  irresponsible giveaway to polluters at the expense of our neighbors  back home. It deserves a big ``no'' vote. Let's think about the people  we represent for a change.
