 Mr. Speaker, Jesus said: ``Greater love hath no man than  this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''   These words guided the life of the late Sam Johnson who served the  great State of Texas 27 years in this House, 6 years in the Texas  House, and nearly 7 years as a POW in the infamous Alcatraz annex of  the Hanoi Hilton.   Mr. Speaker, if you had the honor to shake Sam's broken hand, then  you felt the permanent damage that he endured for our Nation. Sam  Johnson laid down his life for his friends throughout his life. It is  an honor to serve in the House seat where he honorably served.   Those words of Jesus guided me through my military career and through  my introduction to the 118th Congress that first week, and they will  continue to guide me just as they did my friend Sam Johnson.   Our Nation is facing tremendous uncertainty. Misguided policies are  causing inflation, incentivizing criminals, promoting out-of-control  spending, and projecting America as weak on the world stage.   Now is the time for Congress to restore fiscal restraint, embrace  family values, offer certainty to our citizens, and stand firm against  tyranny that encroaches on freedom around the world.   There is a model for our Nation's leaders to follow. The Texas model  provides a roadmap to guide this House in its effort to restore  America's future.   The Texas economy ranked ninth of all nations by GDP, ahead of  countries like Canada, Australia, and Russia. The Texas delegation in  Congress has the most Republican Members because people are flocking to  Texas for economic prosperity, improved quality of life, and greater  opportunity. That description is the American Dream. But that dream  should not be limited by geography.   Everything that is right about America can be found in Texas: from  the feedlots in the panhandle where I grew up to ports along the Gulf  Coast, from farms in the Rio Grande Valley to the piney woods of east  Texas, and from the oil patch to military bases scattered across the  State. Texas has agriculture, manufacturing, finance, defense, and  tourism. Big cities and small towns--Texas has it all.   Unfortunately, we also feel the pain of what is wrong with America: a  flood of illegal immigrants crossing our border along with drugs like  fentanyl and victims of human trafficking. Texas families are hurting  just like other families across this great land. Crime is rising,  inflation is still out of control, and children are being exploited  right before our eyes.    The day after the November election, pundits called the GOP weak. Two  months later, they called us crazy for working to restore the House to  the way it operated for over 200 years. We worked until we achieved the  rules that govern a Congress that now operates efficiently. I believe  that, standing shoulder to shoulder with Speaker McCarthy, this  Congress with these rules will help lead America back to its place as a  beacon to the free world.   The GOP has not yet gained the trust of many Americans. My belief is  that if we hold the line on spending, commit to defending our borders,  and resolve to embrace the values of our forefathers, then we will earn  America's broad support.   We--all of us right here in this Chamber--wrestled over the rules a  few weeks ago. We wrestled hard--just as Jim Jordan wrestled back in  his day--and I am proud to say that this Congress is off to a pretty  good start with bold leaders who are making a difference.   The days ahead are days of promise. They will be long days with hard  decisions and tough votes, but if we endeavor to embrace the  encouraging words of Jesus to sacrifice for our friends, then I believe  that we will continue to be that shining example to the world.   Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that the struggle over ideals in this  Chamber is appropriate, and it makes us stronger.   The question is: Will we hold the line, especially when attacked by  those who oppose liberty?   The preamble of our Constitution speaks of securing the ``Blessings  of Liberty.'' Let's commit to holding the line and to standing together  to those opposing American exceptionalism. Let our example to the  American people and the world be our commitment to preserving liberty.   Will we sacrifice?   Will we lay down our lives for liberty?   I pray we will.                            ____________________
