 Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is quite similar to the prior  one, but it wouldn't just strip the cash out of the bill; it would not  require further security assistance to Ukraine.  [[Page H3513]]    I offer this amendment because the Biden administration is  sleepwalking our great country into a world war. The American people  did not sign up for this, and I believe Congress needs to have the  solemnity to be able to stop this madness.   I miss the days when Democrats used to be anti-war. I listened with  great interest as the ranking member, who I have great respect for,  said the goal of this entire Ukraine-U.S. enterprise is to ensure that  we are not going to war with Russia. That is a bit odd to hear, after  several Democrats have taken to this floor and media outlets to suggest  we are at war with Russia.   It was, in fact, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) who came to  this floor and said we are at war with Russia. It was the gentleman  from Massachusetts who just spoke on the prior amendment, who said,  functionally, the same thing.   I do not want to go to war with Russia, and I don't think the  American people do either. That does not make anyone pro-Putin.   I would similarly observe that part of the funding assistance that we  are providing to Ukraine has nothing to do the with the military. In  this country we have cops, we have firemen, we have teachers who wonder  whether or not their pension fund is going to be sufficient to cover  their life for the service that they have given.   While that is a question in our country, it is no question in Ukraine  because the American taxpayer is underwriting all of the pensions for  every single government official in Ukraine, and we don't do that for  the people who put out our fires and protect our streets.   Similarly, how can we continue to just send all this money when there  is a lack of accountability?   The Pentagon has to fess up that they have multibillion-dollar  accounting errors in this space.   When we had the inspector general before our House Armed Services  Committee, he could not testify that our country had followed our own  requirements and our own laws regarding the end-use monitoring of  equipment that we are sending into a combat zone.   We have unfunded needs in our own military, and I support the NDAA. I  am grateful that we have done a lot of work but, even with this NDAA,  in America there will be hangars that are rusting out. In America there  will be platforms that need upgrades, and they will go wanting while  Ukraine seems to have an unlimited amount of support in this Congress  that is unwarranted.   Forty percent of our training aircraft can't even fly in this country  because we don't have sufficient parts to be able to get it to them.   This war will end any time those folks in Europe want it to. But they  keep buying the Russian gas, and they keep expecting all of us in  America to subsidize Europe's defense while they provide some massive  social welfare state. I am not for it, and that is why I would  encourage my colleagues to vote for my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am at a loss when my colleague asks  without any response from the United States. It has already been $115  billion that we have authorized. One hell of a response, I would say.   But there has to be some point in time where we put our country ahead  of Ukraine, and that is what this amendment does.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Chair, they accuse this amendment of being born of  weakness. Guess what, Mr. Chair? It does not make America stronger to  borrow money from China to give to Ukraine.   Do you know who we are appeasing? China. As we engage in this  endeavor, China is doing a leveraged buyout of Russia. We see that in  Eastern Russia. We see that in the Russian assets in China.   We are actually helping China weaken ourselves all to figure out  which guy in a sweat suit gets to run Crimea, and  [[Page H3514]]  that doesn't seem like America's interest to me.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, the funds sent to Ukraine represent a major  investment in war, not national defense or building infrastructure to  deter conflict. This is the active engagement in the killing of sons,  daughters, husbands, and wives abroad. We shouldn't be funding these  actions until the defense of our country can be reflected with some  sort of tangible connection.   The money to Ukraine does not fulfill this objective.   There must be a threshold for funding a proxy war. How much will it  take to win? What is the return? When will it end?   The Biden administration does not have answers to these questions,  and until they do, we should stop sending money to these misadventures.    The United States of America is not the world's police force, and we  are not the world's piggy bank, but they would have us become the block  captains of Kyiv.   My amendment is going to lose overwhelmingly when it is put up for a  vote, but the American people will see who wants to represent them and  who wants to represent Crimea.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, it is worth acknowledging the great bipartisan  work on this issue with my colleague, Ms. Jacobs, and my colleague, Mr.  McGovern, who have been speaking on these issues with clarity for some  time.   The opponents of the amendment made the principal argument that we  have to do anything for Ukraine to win the war. Why not just send the  nukes? If the standard is we will do anything for Ukraine to win, then  send them tactical nuclear weapons.   Of course, we are not going to do that, which means there has to be a  line somewhere. I would hope that we could draw that line somewhere on  the humane side of the cluster bomb question.   These bombs are indiscriminate. For goodness' sake, we are still  cleaning up cluster bombs in Laos because civilians are being killed.   When my colleagues say, well, civilians won't be killed, tell that to  the people in the places where cluster munitions have been deployed,  and people are still being killed because that is, in fact, the case.   It is also an argument that has been made that Ukrainians are only  going to use this in their own country. How depraved to use these bombs  in your own country? That is not a reason to vote against the  amendment. It is the reason to vote for it.  [[Page H3546]]         Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, there is a time in every debate where  everything has been said but not yet by everyone and that may be where  we are in the DEI debate. But what I bring to the House now is the most  fulsome amendment to completely remove DEI from the DOD.   Even if my amendment doesn't pass, I want my colleagues to know that  this NDAA, in the base bill, takes a meat cleaver to DEI. The  amendments that we have adopted in the last round of voting have  certainly ensured that DEI, regardless of the passage or not of my  amendment, will not be a principal feature of our military service if  this bill becomes law, and that would be a great thing for our  military.   That said, it is important to note that in the name of DEI our  military has done some pretty strange things. Secretary Austin, in his  first act, ordered a 24-hour stand-down so that everyone could reflect  on their extremism.   The reality is even majority-minority units in the military found  this divisive. They complained to my office and certainly it did not  create a more lethal force.   Also, in the name of DEI, we have hired some rather strange people in  the government. There is one DEI officer named Kelisa Wing and she  actually, if you can believe this, worked in the DEI's Department at  DoDEA, the education system within DOD. She put out the following  inclusive tweet:   ``I'm so exhausted at these white folx in these PD [professional  development] sessions this lady actually had the CAUdaacity to say that  black people can be racist too . . . I had to stop the session and give  Karen the BUSINESS . . . ''   This was the person that we had hired to create a more inclusive  environment, and I think it is indicative of the inherently divisive  culture that has permeated radical racial ideology. My amendment gives  us the opportunity to pull it up by the root, and I hope my colleagues  support it.   I would add this final point before yielding back. We have standards  in the military that allow the military to expel racists and white  supremacists completely in the absence of DEI programs. We have had  those standards in the military for quite some time.   So even if my amendment were to become law, I don't want anyone in  the body to think that we would be stuck with people in the military  that didn't meet longstanding preexisting standards of personal  conduct.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, excuse me. I demand a ruling on my point of  order.    Excuse me. Point of order, Mr. Chairman.    No, Mr. Chairman, I made a point of order. You have to  rule on the point of order.    The gentleman has an obligation to address the Chair, not  other Members. He did not do that. He was out of order, violating the  decorum of the House.    Parliamentary inquiry then. I seek recognition to make a  parliamentary inquiry.    What is the parliamentary mechanism that requires an  individual to address the Chair because if it is not that, we can  address each other, let's do that for the rest of the debate.    I want to be recognized for a parliamentary inquiry.    I am not recognized for a parliamentary inquiry? I am not  recognized for a parliamentary inquiry?    I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Parliamentary inquiry.    Will the Chair--will the Chair encourage Members to  address the Chair and rather than one another?    Very well. I seek recognition.    Mr. Chairman, the childish antics that we just observed  indicate that we have got a lot of work to do both in this House and  the military, not to have radical, racial ideology governing our  discourse and governing the policy choices that we make in these bills.   The policy choice that my amendment seeks to make ensures that we do  not have the cancer of DEI harming our military.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Luna).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve and I thank the Chair for that  acknowledgement.    Mr. Chair, I can answer the gentlewoman's question. If her  question is, when will we stop debating DEI, the answer is when we get  rid of DEI in the military. We will be here fighting this fight each  and every day because what fashions itself as an inclusive ideology is,  in fact, inherently divisive and harmful.   I acknowledge that we have many minorities that serve in our  military, and we are so grateful for their patriotism, but it is the  very minority groups, it is the very minority servicemembers in my  district, who come and complain about these initiatives.   This isn't an affront to our servicemembers. It is something we are  doing for our servicemembers.   Do you know what they really complain about? A lot of this DEI  training takes away from their jumps, their live fire time, their time  in the cockpit.   We need to spend more time ensuring that we can protect the homeland  and less time on pronoun training and the rest of this nonsense.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
