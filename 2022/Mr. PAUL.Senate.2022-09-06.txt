 Mr. President, when police officers raise their hands and  take an oath to serve and protect, they understand the risks that come  with that promise. Floyd County Sheriff's Deputy William Petry,  Prestonsburg Police Department Captain Ralph Frasure, Prestonsburg  Police Patrolman Jacob Chaffins, and Floyd County Canine Unit Drago  gave the ultimate sacrifice for their communities and the Commonwealth  of Kentucky. Floyd County Sheriff's Deputy Darrin Lawson, Constable  Gary Wolfe, and Floyd County Emergency Management Director Joe Reynolds  were also wounded during the incident.   Floyd County law enforcement officials were serving an emergency  protective order to Lance Storz, of Allen, KY, when they were attacked.  The standoff began as officers approached Mr. Storz's home using a one  lane road. Mr. Storz then opened fire on the officers from an elevated  position. Despite their vulnerable position, the officers valiantly  engaged Mr. Storz for well over 3 hours. Finally, at 10 p.m., Mr. Storz  surrendered to officers and was taken into custody.   We honor these officers, who sacrificed to keep our communities safe.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of our three fallen  officers, the families of the wounded officers, and the Allen,  Prestonsburg, and Floyd County residents affected by this tragedy.   I salute Deputy Petry, Captain Frasure, Patrolman Chaffins, Drago,  and the great law enforcement men and women of the Commonwealth of  Kentucky.                            ____________________
