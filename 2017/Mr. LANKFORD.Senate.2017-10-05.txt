 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I want to be able to give a quick  update to this body on a conversation that started yesterday and has  been ongoing for months about Russia and their interference in our  elections and how they are trying to engage with us in a way that much  of Europe has seen for decades but that we just haven't seen in the  United States.   Yesterday, Senator Burr and Senator Warner stood up and gave an  update of where we are in the status of the investigation of the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence. They walked through some of the  statistics. We have done over 100 interviews. We have 4,000 pages of  transcript from those interviews. We have 100,000 documents that we  have gone through so far, and there is more to go. We have completed  some areas where we have interviewed everyone who we could possibly  interview in that area. In other areas, as we do one interview, they  quote a couple of other people, and we chase down those individuals,  and it continues. So parts of the investigation are not done at this  point, but some of it is.   Several aspects are clear from the investigation, though, again, it  is not complete, and we will have a final document at the end. Some of  the areas that are clear are that Russia was trying to use active  measures to engage us in our last election. That part is very, very  clear.   The question comes for many people: Why would they do that? Quite  frankly, this is the way Russia has worked for a very long time--this  asymmetric warfare they do where they try to constantly interfere in  other people's thoughts and conflicts. They have done it across Europe  for a long time. They are now doing it here.   Some of this is a product of Russia's having a very weak economy and  trying to find some way to bolster themselves up. In the last 2 years,  the Russian ruble has dropped 40 percent in value. As they struggle  with low oil prices and struggle in the way they function with their  government with the oligarchs and have a select group of people who can  succeed and other folks who continue to struggle around the country and  as they struggle under that system where they have fake elections and  such, they try to reach out to other countries and try to interfere in  our elections to make us look like them.   We have a free press that they try to engage in. We have free speech  that they don't have in Russia. We have freedom of religion, which they  don't have in Russia. We have the ability to be able to have disputes  on political issues. They clearly don't have that in Russia. If you  disagree with leadership in Russia, you will end up in prison. If you  disagree with leadership in the United States, you will end up on TV.  It is very different to be in an open society like ours. But they reach  into what we consider a strength and try to make it our weakness.   We are going to try to get the facts out on this over the next  several months as we work through this process. We are going to expose  what Russia is really trying to do. Do they use some overt propaganda  networks like Sputnik Radio and RT? Is their Russian propaganda on  multiple cable and satellite channels throughout the United States?  Their version of the facts are designed to create discord in our  Nation. That is what they do.   They also have ways that are not quite as overt. They reach in on  social media platforms. They have their trolls in Russia who have  thousands of fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter and other social  media apps. They use those thousands of apps to search around any news  in America and find a place where there is conflict in America and then  try to amp up the volume.   To be clear, the Russians are not creating conflict in America. We  have plenty of it. We disagree on issues. Again, it is our free  society. When we disagree on something, we disagree on  [[Page S6336]]  it publically and sometimes loud. That is who we are as Americans. We  try to work things out, sometimes at a high volume. But just like two  kids who are fighting on the playground in the fifth grade--remember  those two kids that started a fight and their friends were watching  them? Then, eventually, someone on the other side of the playground  started yelling ``fight,'' and the crowd started forming. The Russians  aren't starting the fight. They aren't even in the fight. They are the  kids on the far side of the playground, trying to get more people to  run to the fight. They are not starting the Twitter wars and the  battles, but they look at where America is divided, issues like race.  Their troll farms will try to find areas where we disagree, such as  areas of race, and reach in and try to amplify the volume on that by  repeating accusations and by trying to be even more hostile online.  They are trying to stoke disunity in our Nation.   It is important that we know that every time you see something with a  high number of hashtag counts that goes up, it is not always Americans  who are pushing that up. Occasionally, it is an outside body trying to  raise the volume and make a conflict look even bigger than it already  is in America because they are into sowing discord. That is what they  love to do. That is what the rest of the nations have seen them do. We  should be very clear that the Russians are trying to continue to sow  chaos into us.   They have reached into our election systems. In the previous couple  of weeks, the FBI notified 21 different States that during the last  election season, the Russians tried to interfere in their election  process as a State. Now, that doesn't mean they did interfere. That  means they reached in and tested systems. That means they tried to go  into voter databases to see if they could access a voter database to  see who was registered to vote. They tried to get into a secretary of  State's office in a local State to see if they could figure out how  they do their elections. That means they reached into systems in States  to see what voting machines they used and if they tried to connect them  in. They were trying to find out how they do elections, learn as much  as they could about their process, and see how far they could get.   Through all of our work, we have yet to find a single vote that was  changed. The Russians didn't get into voting machines. They didn't  alter the election in any way, but they were constantly probing through  multiple States to see what they could get access to.   Now, it is my belief that they are preparing for something else. They  are trying to see what they could get access to in the last election to  see if they could get back into it and do even more in the next  election. We should be aware of that. We should be aware not only of  their propaganda, but we should be aware that they are going after our  elections to see if they can find a way, at the end of the election, to  make us doubt the outcomes.   What can we do about that? I will give you several ideas. One of  them, I would say, is that we need to protect the primacy of States  running the elections. There is absolutely no need for the Federal  Government to go to States and take over their election process. It is  a constitutional protection that those States have to be able to run  their elections, but every State is also responsible to do it. Of the  21 States that I noted here that the Russians tried to engage in, they  couldn't get to a single voting machine. The States are already doing a  good job, but they need help.   There is no reason the State of Oklahoma should have to work alone to  be able to protect itself from the Russians trying to invade it in the  cyber attack. They are going to need some allies to come along with  them, but the States should still be able to run the system. There  should be more sharing between the State and the Federal Government.  There should be an opportunity for the Federal Government to be able to  say to a State, earlier than 10 months after the election: Hey, you are  being hacked. For the FBI to notify States a couple of weeks ago that  they were hacked in the 2016 elections is a little late. When it is  occurring, we need to have that engagement between State IT folks and  Federal IT folks. We need to be able to have that conversation as it is  ongoing so the State can take protective measures as it is occurring.  We need to have that cooperation between States and the Federal  Government. We need to be able to help States come up with ways they  can audit their system after the election is over.   When every election occurs, you should be able to audit it and make  sure the machines that were running the election actually were not  hacked. You can verify that. In Oklahoma, we have optical scanners. You  fill out a paper ballot. You run it through an optical scanner at the  end of the election time, and they can count everything from the  optical scanner. If there is any question, they can go back to the  paper and actually do a hand count. We can literally audit our  elections and their process. It is a safe system that we have set up in  our State. Every State does it differently, but I would encourage every  State to set up a system where they can audit their system.   We know this year that the Russians were trying to engage in our  election. It could be someone else who could do it. Any number of  groups could try to interfere in our process. It is basic common sense  to say we should have a system of elections we can actually audit.  Perhaps Russia, in the days ahead, hopes that our Nation will be more  like theirs. We will not be.   We are the longest constitutional Republic in the world. We still  need the world. We still put out our values about free speech, free  press, freedom of religion, and opportunities for individuals to  actually engage and to have conflict with their own government and to  be able to disagree publically on things. We still can disagree with  each other. We need to be aware that they want to turn us into them. I  would hope for the sake of the Russian people, in the days ahead, that  they could be more like us.   Ronald Reagan told a story about a friend of his who had a  conversation with a Cuban refugee fleeing from communism and oppression  in Cuba in 1964. He said that his friend, this Cuban refugee, said:         If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to.       This is the last stand on Earth.    We are still a role model for the rest of the world. As much conflict  as we have with each other, we are still a role model. I have no issue  disagreeing at times with people on this floor. We can have our  disagreements, but I don't want the Russians to interfere in our  disagreements. They can keep their business over there. In the days  ahead, we will continue to expose the things they are doing. So they  can back off and go bug someone else because we are akin to what they  are doing.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
