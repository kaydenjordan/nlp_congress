 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to join so many of my women  Members of Congress to recognize and celebrate International Women's  Day. In my lifetime, women have made so much progress, but our journey  toward full equality still has so far to go.   More than five decades ago, a half a century, we began the work to  achieve equality in the workplace when President John F. Kennedy signed  the Equal Pay Act. We took another important step forward when  President Obama signed his first bill into law, the Lilly Ledbetter  Fair Pay Act. Even with those laws, women in my congressional district  still only make 72 cents on a man's dollar. For women of color, the  wage gap is even worse, 63 cents for African-American women and 54  cents for Latinas.   When you consider that women make up almost half of the workforce,  and women are either the sole or primary breadwinner in 40 percent of  the homes, this isn't just a women's issue; it is a family issue. This  is why we must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to give every woman  additional tools to fight for equal pay they earn on each and every  payday.   In a country as great as ours, we must guarantee that our daughters  have the same opportunity to earn a fair and equal wage.                            ____________________
