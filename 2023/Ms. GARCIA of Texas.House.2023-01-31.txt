 Madam Speaker, extreme MAGA Republicans have an  economic plan that will hurt working families. House Republicans are  set to advance a new 30 percent national sales tax.   Let me repeat that: 30 percent national sales tax.   This will increase the average family's cost for groceries and  everyday essentials by about $100 every single month.   On top of that, they want to cut Social Security, cut Medicare.  Working families will lose their hard-earned benefits.   They are putting their special interests over the working class. They  are putting special interests over people.   Rest assured, Madam Speaker, no matter what extreme MAGA Republicans  do, House Democrats will continue to fight for working families. It is  the middle class that makes our country strong. We will be there to put  them over politics. We will be there to put people first.                            ____________________
