 Mr. President, this week, of course, we remember and honor  our colleague and an American hero John McCain. He embodied our most  cherished values of service and sacrifice, and he understood the  principles that make our country great.   One of those principles, as we know, is our First Amendment  protections for a free and independent press. Something I always  admired about Senator McCain, even before I got to know him well many  years ago, was his openness with the journalists, the workaday  reporters who were doing their jobs every day and who covered him on  behalf of the American people. He didn't hide from the people he  served, and he was always willing to stand up for freedom of the press.   When those freedoms came under attack, he stood up and said to  journalists: ``The fact is we need you.'' He wrote an op-ed in the  Washington Post in January that I would like to quote from. This op-ed  was partly in response to the President's declaring several times,  repeatedly, that the media are enemies of the people. John McCain put  that to rest with these comments:         Ultimately, freedom of information is critical for a       democracy to succeed. . . . Journalists play a major role in       the promotion and protection of democracy and our unalienable       rights, and they must be able to do their jobs freely. Only       truth and transparency can guarantee freedom.    Senator McCain was right. We will miss his moral leadership on this  issue and his moral leadership on so many others. It is up to all of us  to continue to stand up for the freedom of the press to serve and  inform our communities. That is why I want to highlight, like I do  every week, yet another story in an Ohio paper informing the public,  reported by a journalist serving her community.   Last week, the Dayton Daily News ran a story by staff writer Emily  Kronenberger on the opening of the city of Trotwood's new, renovated  community and cultural arts center. The facility was in need of major  repairs and had been shuttered for a decade. After this major  remodeling, the center is reopening and will provide the community with  art exhibits, concerts, and classes.   Ms. Kronenberger talked to the Trotwood city manager, who said the  new center ``will make impacts on the community and region for decades  to come.''   The paper also informed Miami Valley readers about a new partnership  with Central State University. The school will have a satellite office  in the reopened community center that will offer 4-H youth development  programs on everything from agriculture to engineering to scholarship  opportunities.   This kind of reporting is what journalists do every single day in  Ohio, in Oklahoma, and across this country. They do their jobs: They  serve their readers, they serve their viewers, and they serve their  communities.   As we pay our respects to Senator McCain this week, let us also  recommit ourselves to the values he fought for his entire life. That  includes a free and independent press.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Americans are getting pretty tired of how  much power special interests have in this town. That is why we created  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to look out for the millions  of ordinary Americans who don't have armies of lobbyists. The Bureau  was supposed to be an independent watchdog--a place free from Wall  Street influence, which is pervasive around here pretty much all of the  time.    Remember what happened last year when powerful corporations demanded  that Congress overturn a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that  guaranteed customers who were harmed by their bank would have their day  in court? You might think protecting Americans' right to their day in  court is something we would all agree on. Wall Street is so powerful,  the Vice President of the United States had to come to this Chamber in  the dead of night so that he could break a tie on behalf of Wall Street  to vote to repeal.   We have seen in this town a collective amnesia about what happened a  decade ago. People forget that a decade ago people lost billions of  dollars in wealth. People lost billions of dollars in their businesses.  People lost jobs. People lost their homes. Over and over, we have heard  those stories about what happened a decade ago. We saw it in our  communities. I see it where my wife and I live in Cleveland. Yet the  Banking Committee in this Congress, this Senate, seems to have  forgotten about what happened 10 years ago. They are already going back  to weakening the rules to help Wall Street, as if Wall Street doesn't  have enough.   Imagine if the same people who voted to repeal the rule we talked  about a moment ago were in charge of deciding whether the Consumer  Bureau could start an investigation into one of the big banks or payday  lenders or credit bureaus like Equifax. That is what would happen if we  put Congress in charge of the Consumer Bureau's budget.   Do we think this current crowd in charge wouldn't do Wall Street's  bidding, wouldn't punish the Bureau every time it tries to hold the big  banks accountable? That is why it is independent. We don't want  Congress to be able to cut its budget every time it goes after the bad  guys.   If the Consumer Bureau decides it wants to go after a payday lender  that has preyed on veterans and servicemembers outside of Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, if the Consumer Bureau decides that it wants  to clamp down on discrimination in auto lending, we don't want Congress  at the behest of Wall Street, at the behest of the auto industry--auto  dealers in this case--to be able to cut their budget. That is clearly  what they do.   This year, under Mick Mulvaney, we have already seen what having a  Consumer Bureau that is accountable to Wall Street rather than regular  Americans looks like. Mulvaney has canceled enforcement actions against  payday lenders. He has gutted the office responsible for going after  discriminatory lenders. He encourages big banks to throw even more  money at Members of Congress. I believe he went in front of the  American Bankers Association--one of the big trade associations. He  went in front of them and said: If you want to get your way with  Congress, you have to put more money in, you have to give more campaign  contributions.   This was the President's appointed head of the Consumer Bureau.  Perhaps most despicably, earlier this month, he announced he would no  longer--get this--protect servicemembers and their families from shady  lenders that tried to cheat them by ending the CFPB's  [[Page S5950]]  monitoring for violations of the Military Lending Act.   Just today, the head student lending watchdog at the Consumer Bureau  resigned. He said in his letter of resignation that ``it has become  clear that consumers no longer have a strong, independent Consumer  Bureau on their side.''   Because of Mulvaney, because of the White House looking like a  retreat for Wall Street executives, this leader in the Consumer Bureau,  who is fighting to protect students who have been defrauded by  financial institutions, said that it is ``clear that consumers no  longer have a strong, independent Consumer Bureau on their side.''   We created that Bureau 8 years ago. I pushed to include that office,  the Student Loan Ombudsman, because I know hard-working families  struggle with enormous education loans but rarely get any help from big  banks or services or even their own government. The office was meant to  be an independent check on the Education Department, which is even more  important now that it is run by a Secretary, a billionaire, who doesn't  seem to understand or care about the struggles that so many working  families face.   Right now, we have surpassed $1.5 trillion--that is $1,500 billion-- in student loan debt in this country. That debt has ripple effects for  families for our entire economy. More than 1 million Americans are  forced to default on their student loan debt every year. That is 3,000  new defaults every single day. A disproportionate number of those are  students who had borrowed to attend a for-profit school--schools that  we know often trick and mislead Americans into taking out huge  predatory loans; schools that spend way more time recruiting,  marketing, advertising, and helping students get loans than they do  coaching and mentoring and ultimately helping in the job search for  these students when they finish. That is why we need a truly  independent watchdog looking out for those students. That was the job  of the outgoing Student Loan Ombudsman, but he has not been able to do  his job, protecting students, because of Director Mulvaney.   In his resignation, he confirmed what we all suspected--that Mulvaney  is not independent. He is working for the same special interests as the  rest of this administration. Rather than letting the career staff at  CFPB do their jobs enforcing the law, Mulvaney has put a bunch of  political lackeys in charge of the Consumer Bureau while independent  experts are forced out of the agency.   When the CFPB had an independent Director, it recovered $12 billion  in relief for 29 million Americans. They had been harmed by Wells Fargo  or a payday lender or a credit bureau like Equifax. Think of that: 29  million Americans had recovered $12 billion from these companies and  these banks that had cheated them. The student loan office was able to  return $750 million specifically to students who had been preyed upon  by for-profit schools or predatory collectors.   Under Mulvaney, the CFPB doesn't do its job. That is why it is so  important for the Senate to demand an independent leader to be in  charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--not Mick Mulvaney,  not his protege, Kathy Kraninger. We need someone fighting back against  these corporations that take advantage of hard-working families, not  taking orders from Wall Street.   I yield the floor.
