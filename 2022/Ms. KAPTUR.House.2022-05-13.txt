 Mr. Speaker, as spring moves into full bloom, new life is  bursting forth along the southern-most shore of the Great Lakes along  Lake Erie. Over 100,000 nature tourists are flocking to the Ottawa and  Cedar Point Federal Wildlife Refuges adjacent to Magee Marsh and Maumee  Bay State Park. Nearby freshwaters hum with new life: pickerel, perch,  and even salmon.   This week our region is celebrating the 30th anniversary of what has  grown into the biggest week in American birding. Over 100,000 visitors  head to our northern Ohio heartland region for fishing, boating,  hiking, and, yes, bird watching to fully welcome and celebrate the vast  array of two-winged creatures that fly and thrive along our freshwater  coast and wetlands: bald eagles, egrets, trumpeter swans, blue herons,  indeed, every species one might imagine.   This splendid, colorful display by nature occurs at the crossroads of  the Mississippi and Atlantic flyways. Nearby the Great Lakes Black  Swamp Bird Observatory is raising funds to build a new welcome and  education center to  [[Page H4960]]  introduce youth from across our world to Mother Nature's power and the  beauty and value of our environment.   Nature tourism is not only healthy, it gives an over $40 million  economic boost to our region just during May. Northern Ohio welcomes  guests from around the world as we celebrate the gifts that we have  been given to shepherd to generations to come. Congratulations to all  who responsibly steward our region forward and our precious corner of  Mother Earth.                            ____________________
