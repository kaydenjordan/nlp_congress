 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's yielding of time.   As we take this week to somberly remember those who lost their lives  on September 11, 2001, it is equally important that we remember the  first responders who bravely ran towards the tragedy of 16 years ago,  who woke up the next day, on September 12, 2001, still beaten, tired,  and bruised but, again, walked towards those tragedies. Still, today,  these first responders heroically risk life and limb to run toward  tragedies.   As Americans, we owe our first responders a great debt. For this  reason, I ask my colleagues to support Mr. Collins' bill, H.R. 931, the  Firefighter Cancer Registry Act, which makes important first steps in  lifesaving cancer research and future medical advancements for  firefighters, who have disproportionately higher cancer risks.   I would like to thank all of our first responders and urge passage of  this important legislation, and I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of  this legislation as well.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have no more speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
