 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Alcohol Awareness Month.   This Nation is in the midst of a war for the protection and longevity  of our children. We have found ourselves battling epidemics at an  unprecedented magnitude, many of which are plaguing our youth:  violence, suicide, mental health, and, most notably, substance abuse.  [[Page H1899]]    Alcohol use among youth is more prevalent than tobacco or illicit  drugs. The dangers of underage drinking are significant, as they can  drastically increase the likelihood of alcohol dependency later in  life, cause a decline in academic performance, and increase engagement  in harmful behaviors such as the use of other drugs and impaired  driving.   In addition to the adverse mental health effects, it puts children  and young adults in jeopardy of developing health risks that negatively  affect the brain, liver, and endocrine system.   We have already lost too many young lives by not taking necessary  protective measures. Research shows that a lifetime of conversations  between parents and their children can prevent underage drinking. Let's  all do our part to protect our children.                            ____________________
