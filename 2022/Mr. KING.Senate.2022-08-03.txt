 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the  following article printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               A Unified Senate, and a Unified NATO--Opinion                     (By Senator Angus King (I-Maine))         Six months ago, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian       troops to invade Ukraine with no provocation, breaking a       European peace that has lasted since the Allies turned back       Adolph Hitler's attacks during World War II. Today, this new       dictator with delusions of grandeur is threatening global       peace, and history shows that we cannot stand by and hope for       the best. The free world must defend our shared values; that       begins with presenting a united front.        This week, the U.S. Senate took a historic step to meet       that responsibility by voting to approve Sweden and Finland's       applications to join the NATO Alliance. The vote was       overwhelming, and bipartisan--in total, the applications were       approved by a vote of 95 to 1. The result shows that Putin's       egregious and brutal power-grab has unified the U.S. Senate--      just as it has unified the broader global community.        Since the war in Ukraine began, thousands of innocent       Ukrainians have been killed, millions have been forced from       their homes, and billions around the globe have been forced       to shoulder increased costs on fuel and food. The damage       wrought by Putin's forces is nothing short of horrific--but       if Putin expected the rest of the world to roll over and       accept his invasion, he miscalculated. Badly.        If you want evidence of this miscalculation, you need look       no further than the state of North Atlantic Treaty       Organization, which has been reinvigorated in light of       Putin's aggression and is only getting stronger. A wide range       of countries have come together to provide military and       humanitarian aid to help Ukrainians stand strong. Beyond       supporting Ukraine during the current crisis. NATO members       have also reaffirmed their commitment to one another in the       event of further Russian aggression.        The crisis also prompted Sweden and Finland--two proud and       strong nations that have long remained neutral--to seek       accession into NATO. The addition of the two Nordic nations       will make NATO stronger and more unified in the face of       Putin's misguided and murderous ambitions to rebuild the       Soviet Union.        I saw the potential benefits of these new additions earlier       this year, when I traveled to Finland as part of a bipartisan       congressional delegation (called a CODEL) shortly after they       formally requested NATO membership. My colleagues and I met       with the nation's president and his top defense officials to       discuss the nation's position in the current state of play.       Finland has a long history of dealing with Russia--a       necessity, given the two nations' shared 800-mile border.       They also have a very capable military, as does Sweden.        Combined, the two nations will strengthen the defensive       capabilities of NATO--and I must stress the importance of       NATO's defensive nature. NATO's charter does not require       member nations to enter into proactive military activities;       rather, military action is only invoked in collective       defense. This is why Russian accusations of new threats posed       by a larger NATO are flat-out false; the only way these new       additions could create conflict between Russia and NATO is if       Russia intends to launch yet another violent invasion of a       peaceful neighbor.        On the heels of the Senate's overwhelming vote, I am       hopeful that Finland and Sweden's applications will move       forward swiftly. The lone NATO member that has expressed       hesitancy to admit the new members, Turkey, has also       demonstrated a willingness to waive its concerns if certain       conditions are met. Our bipartisan CODEL also traveled to       Turkey shortly after we left Finland, seeking to talk through       their concerns and address their needs through tangible       actions. My Senate colleagues and I left our meetings       optimistic that the differences between Turkey and the Nordic       nations can be resolved--and it now appears this is the case.        This week's vote and our trip to Eastern Europe has made       one thing abundantly clear: the free world stands united       against Vladimir Putin's would-be empire building, and is       ready to respond against his illegal and immoral military       attacks. NATO, the United States, and the U.S. Senate will       not allow him to destroy freedom-loving nations; we will       stand with our allies, as we have in the past, united against       deposition.   (At the request of Mr. Sullivan, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
