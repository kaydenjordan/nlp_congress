 Mr. Speaker, environmental protection of species  revolves around the use of indicator species. But what has been lost in  recent years is the impact also on humans and their needs.   The indicator, for example, for farmers in California is very grave  in the great Central Valley and up at the Klamath Basin.   Up on the Klamath, you have one environmental management plan that  says more water is needed for salmon, for example, under a biological  opinion, and another management plan that says more water is needed to  be stored in the lake for suckerfish. You can't do both at the same  time, and the result is the salmon are not more plentiful and the  suckerfish are not recovering as a species.   But the rural areas in Klamath and Siskiyou Counties are being cut  off from their main economic driver. The farms up there are suffering  badly because of water that has been taken by the Federal Government  that does not belong to the Federal Government.   The stored water in that lake was created for agriculture solely, and  yet it is being used as more or less a slush fund for Federal agencies  that want to take this water and somehow try and make a difference in  the river. This has got to come to a stop, because we need agriculture  in California.                            ____________________
