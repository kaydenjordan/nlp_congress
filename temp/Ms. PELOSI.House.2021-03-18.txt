 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  once again, I salute him for his leadership.   This is the third bill in 2 days that he has brought to the floor,  yesterday for the ERA and Violence Against Women Act, and today, here  we are with this legislation for the Dreamers.   Madam Speaker, this issue is near and dear to my heart but, more  importantly, to my head. This is so important for our country.  [[Page H1521]]    Three years ago, I came to the floor and spoke about our Dreamers for  8 hours and 6 minutes. Have no fear, I will not use my Speaker's minute  to that extent today. But I wish I could because I have so much to say  about what Dreamers mean to America.   I rise with tremendous pride, joy, and hope this day as the House  prepares to take this momentous step forward for our democracy by  passing H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act.   I want to salute some of our leaders in Congress. As I acknowledged  Mr. Nadler, the distinguished chair of the committee, let us also  acknowledge Lucille Roybal-Allard, the godmother of this legislation,  who carries forth a commitment to the newcomers to our country in her  DNA, the same commitment of her father, the late Chairman Ed Roybal, as  he championed newcomers to our Nation.   She has been with this legislation for 20 years that I know of, and  it was she and Howard Berman who introduced it initially a generation  ago. Ten years ago, she authored this legislation, and we were  successful on the floor. We were successful in passing it in the House  because of the leadership of Congresswoman Roybal-Allard but also  Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez, who at the time was the chair of the  Hispanic Caucus. The Hispanic Caucus really led the way and taught the  Congress about what Dreamers mean to America, in case that had not been  within the experience of our Members.   In this legislation today, Nydia Velazquez has the ``promise.'' This  is Dreamers and promise. She has the promise, TPS and DED--again, very  important to our country.   Yvette Clarke, from the Congressional Black Caucus, who is very much  a part of all of this today, has the TPS piece of this.   I was so pleased to hear this morning CAPAC, the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus, have Congresswoman Strickland, of African- American and Korean descent, speak in terms of what this means to the  Asian Pacific American community, something that Chair Judy Chu reminds  us of every day.    This has now gone beyond the Hispanic Caucus, the Black Caucus, the  Asian Pacific Caucus, and to all of us in the Congress. This  legislation is protecting Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients and  honors the truth that immigrants are the constant reinvigoration of our  country. When they come here with their hopes and dreams and  aspirations, these parents bringing their children, their hopes and  dreams and aspirations for a better future for their children, that  courage, that determination, those aspirations are American traits.  They all make America more American with all of that.   Indeed, they are true and legitimate heirs, these Dreamers are, of  our Founders. E pluribus unum, from many, one, we talk about that all  the time. Many in this Chamber have been part of the fight to protect  our patriotic Dreamers for years.   As I said, when I stood here for 8 hours and 6 minutes, the longest  speech on record in the House in history, I was reading letters that  Members were handing me about the story of the Dreamers. As Mr. Stanton  mentioned, they are teachers, professionals, CEOs, entrepreneurs. They  contribute to our community in every way. I was so pleased to hear him  talk about that because one of the first meetings I ever went to about  Dreamers was under the leadership of one of the predecessors of our  Members from Arizona, Congressman Ed Pastor. Chairman Pastor, Mr.  Grijalva, and Harry Mitchell, all three, had a meeting at Arizona State  University about helping these young people. That was in 2007.   So, this has been going on for a while. Next month, as I mentioned,  marks the 20th year since the Dream Act was introduced by Congresswoman  Roybal-Allard, and it was on a bipartisan basis. When we passed it 10  years ago, it was on a bipartisan basis. Sadly, we couldn't prevail  with 60 votes in the Senate. But since then, millions of Americans have  come together to organize and mobilize for Dreamers: labor leaders, the  business community, faith organizations, national security officials,  law enforcement, and more.   We often talk about Dreamers having the support of the three Bs:  badges, in terms of law enforcement; Bible, in terms of faith-based;  and the business community.   The true VIPs of the moment are the Dreamers and immigrants who have  spoken out with great dignity and eloquence, refusing to be forced back  into the shadows.   This determination has made a difference. It is their courage that is  sending this legislation to the Senate and then to the President's  desk.   Before I close, I want to acknowledge the work of Congresswoman Zoe  Lofgren, the chair of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary  Committee. Zoe Lofgren is also the chair of House Administration, so I  call her Madam Chair-Madam Chair. She has taught immigration law. She  has been an immigration lawyer, and she chairs the Immigration  Subcommittee. We could not be better served than by her intricate  knowledge of immigration law, both on this legislation and legislation  we will take up later, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. I thank  Zoe Lofgren for that.   Again, Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients are American in every way.  They have lived and worked in our country for decades, if not their  entire lives. They are an integral thread in the fabric of our Nation.  For the Dreamers, it is less time, for others more.   Dreamers power our businesses, our economy, and are CEOs and  taxpayers, all of them. They advance innovation and America's  technological edge as entrepreneurs and researchers. They protect our  national security, military might, and servicemembers and civilian  experts.   That is why I am so grateful to Chair Roybal-Allard, Chair Velazquez,  Chair Judy Chu, and Congresswoman Strickland for advancing this  legislation to help Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients.                                time  1345    So many on the front lines of the pandemic are frontline healthcare  workers and first responders; transportation, sanitation, and food  workers; and teachers. They give so much to our country.   These immigrant communities strengthen, enrich, and ennoble our  Nation, and they must be allowed to stay. There is nothing partisan  about protecting Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients.   The Dream Act has long had bipartisan support in both Chambers.  Support for TPS and DED recipients is also bipartisan in the country.  Nearly three-quarters of the public support a path to citizenship.   I always love to quote President Reagan. In his last speech as  President of the United States, this was his last message as President  to the American people. He said: ``Thanks to each wave of new arrivals  to this land of opportunity, we are a nation forever young, forever  bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge,  always leading the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to  our future as a nation. If we ever closed the door to new Americans,  our leadership in the world would soon be lost.''   I urge a bipartisan vote.    Madam Speaker, I salute the gentleman for the excellent  work of his committee, bringing this important legislation, H.R. 1603,  the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, to the floor. I thank the  chairman for this critical victory for farmworkers and growers, who  have come together in support of this legislation, this legislation  which ensures that America can continue to feed the world.   Thank you to Chair Zoe Lofgren, chair of the Subcommittee on  Immigration and Citizenship, for her years of relentless leadership on  behalf of farmworkers, without which this bill would not be possible. I  sang her praises earlier as a former teacher of immigration,  immigration lawyer, and chair of the Subcommittee on Immigration and  Citizenship. She knows of what she legislates.   I think that it is clear to see there are a number of Californians  involved in this. I want to salute Mr. Costa and Mr. Carbajal, who are  an important part of this. They represent farmland in California. They  know the needs of the workers. They respect the involvement of the  growers.   This, again, is a wonderful bill. We salute many Members,  representing every corner of the country, whose vision and values have  strengthened this bill that has truly been a caucus- and Congress-wide  effort.   Thank you to the United Farm Workers for their outstanding organizing  which made this possible. In addition to our work internally, their  outside mobilization is so important.   We are also inspired by the immortal words of our beloved Dolores  Huerta: ``Yes, we can,'' ``Si, se puede.'' Yes, we can; yes, we will;  and, yes, we are doing it. It was an honor last year at this time to  celebrate her 90th birthday in the Rayburn Room, the last event we had  before COVID took over. So here we are a year later. This is probably a  better celebration.   Passing the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and doing so on a  bipartisan basis was a source of pride in the last Congress, and it is  now. With a Democratic majority in the Senate and President Biden in  the White House, when we pass it again, it is with better assurance  that it will become law.   The bill honors the millions of farmworkers who are the backbone of  our economy, quietly persevering through harsh working conditions and  low wages as they power the farm economy and put food on our tables.   As the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has written:         Recognizing the dignity of work of farmworkers and their       families is a central concern.        Farmworkers produce the food that we eat and contribute to       the care of our community.    This legislation, while long overdue, is urgently needed now, in  light of the coronavirus crisis, which is forcing our essential  farmworkers to live and work under a cloud of fear and uncertainty  about their health and their jobs.   At the same time, the pandemic has accelerated a labor crisis in the  farm economy that endangers farmers and producers and requires action.  This action today is an agreement between the growers and the  farmworkers.   This legislation supports workers and the farm economy with strong,  smart reforms.   This bill provides a path to legalization for more than one million  currently undocumented farmworkers. No one who works to feed our  country should be condemned to permanent second-class status.   This bill establishes the agricultural workforce of the future by  modernizing the H-2A initiative to ensure that farms have stable,  secure workforces.   Critically, it demands fair, humane treatment for farmworkers by  securing fairness in pay, improving access to quality housing, and  ensuring robust safety and heat illness protections.   Any of us who have visited farmworkers in the fields--and some of our  Members have been farmworkers themselves or children of farmworkers-- know the environment, the heat, the chemicals, and the rest, are a  challenge.   This legislation is a critical step forward for our workers, for our  growers, and the farm economy, but our work is not done.   Congress will continue to stabilize the farm economy, protect workers  and families, and maintain America's agricultural preeminence in the  world.   Under the leadership of President Biden, we will continue our work to  fundamentally, fully fix our broken immigration system so that we can  honor  [[Page H1555]]  America's proud immigrant heritage and advance a better future for all.   Earlier, I quoted President Reagan. I want to do so again more fully.  Earlier, when I spoke on the floor about Dreamers, I did so for 8 hours  and 6 minutes. I promised earlier today to be shorter, and so I didn't  give as much of President Reagan's speech.   This is what he said: ``And since this is the last speech that I will  give as President, I think it's fitting to leave one final thought, an  observation about a country which I love.''   He went on to talk about the Statue of Liberty, Madam Speaker. He  said: ``The torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes our freedom and represents  our heritage, the compact with our parents, our grandparents, and our  ancestors. It is that lady who gives us our great and special place in  the world. For it's the great life force of each generation of new  Americans that guarantees that America's triumph shall continue  unsurpassed into the next century and beyond. Other countries may seek  to compete with us; but in one vital area, as a beacon of freedom and  opportunity that draws the people of the world, no country on Earth  comes close.''   As I said earlier, he said: ``This, I believe, is one of the most  important sources of America's greatness. We lead the world because,  unique among nations, we draw our people--our strength--from every  country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously  renew and enrich our Nation. While other countries cling to the stale  past, here in America we breathe life into dreams. We create the  future, and the world follows us into tomorrow. Thanks to each wave''-- President Reagan said--``Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this  land of opportunity, we're a Nation forever young, forever bursting  with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always  leading the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our  future as a Nation. If we ever closed the door to new Americans, our  leadership in the world would soon be lost.''    This being the last speech that I will give as President, President  Reagan said, ``I think it's fitting to leave one final thought, an  observation about a country which I love.''   As we remember the words of President Reagan, I also recall the words  of the late Cesar Chavez, whose birthday we celebrate later this month.  He said: ``To make a great dream come true, the first requirement is a  great capacity to dream; the second is persistence.''   Thanks to all of our bipartisan Members for their persistence on this  legislation for which I urge a strong bipartisan ``aye'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to  recognize the outstanding service of an esteemed member of my staff  known and respected by all here: our deputy floor director, Latrice  Powell.   In her 13 years on Capitol Hill, Latrice's name has become synonymous  with cool-headed leadership and institutional expertise. We all know  her as a maestro of the floor, masterfully directing legislative  procedures and voting schedules, all while anticipating and managing  the diverse needs of our Caucus.   Indeed, her skills as a coalition-builder and communicator help our  Democratic Caucus honor this proud truth: Our diversity is our  strength, but our unity is our power.   Members are particularly grateful for Latrice's calm and trusted  presence this past year as she helped our Caucus and the Congress  navigate this time of pandemic, and she has done so with equanimity and  excellence.   Throughout her tenure on our floor team, Latrice has helped guide the  passage and then the enactment of hundreds of bills for the people.  While she has helped advance this great progress, she has made history  as the first African-American assistant manager of the Democratic  Cloakroom and then again at the start of the 116th Congress when it was  my honor to appoint her to be the first African-American deputy floor  director.   A Jackson, Mississippi, native, Latrice first came to the Hill to  work under the leadership of our chairman--that is you, Mr. Speaker-- Bennie Thompson. She then joined the staff of the Congressional Black  Caucus under Chairs Emanuel Cleaver and Marcia Fudge before serving as  assistant Cloakroom manager. In each of these positions, she acquired a  sterling reputation for her ability, and I know that each of these  Members take great pride in her success.   While Latrice's trusted presence on this House floor will be missed,  we are grateful for her service and for her work to forge a path for  others to follow.   On behalf of the House of Representatives, I thank Latrice Powell and  wish her the best in the next stages of her journey.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman  for his wonderful remarks, and I want to join him in acknowledging the  leadership of Shuwanza when she served here for all that time, and now  we are very proud of the fact that she is in the administration. But  every chance we get, we should acknowledge the great service that she  provided here as we acknowledge and say thank you to Latrice Powell and  wish her well as she goes forward. She made us all so very, very proud  and continues to do so.   Thank you so much, Latrice.                            ____________________
