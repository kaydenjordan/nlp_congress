 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Emmer, my colleague and friend from the  neighboring State of Minnesota, for offering such a commonsense piece  of legislation.   I frequently hear horror stories of fraud and abuse. All of us stand  against fraud and abuse. I have a news flash for everybody: This law  doesn't change that fraud is illegal. It was illegal before this bill  and it will be illegal after this bill. Fraud is illegal.   All we are doing is saying we are going to keep the promise that all  of us say that we have to small entrepreneurs and startups to make sure  that they get seed capital and make sure they can thrive and grow and  create jobs in our community.   All we are trying to do is give clarity to what constitutes a  nonpublic offering. What is wrong with clarity? What is wrong with  bright lines that they know that they can operate in between without  violating the rule?   This is simple. It is straightforward, it is common sense, and it  supports everything we say we support, which is small businesses, and I  think this is a great piece of legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I would ask all of my colleagues to stand together. Let's  not play partisanship with the smallest businesses in our communities,  the ones that we both agree create jobs. This is a time for unity.  Let's work together, especially when it is common sense.   I love the passion from the ranking member, but on this one, it is  passion without a cause. It makes sense. It gives bright lines.   Let's stand up for small businesses that create jobs in our  community. Mr. Emmer's bill does that. I ask us all to stand up and  support small businesses and this bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   For my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle who are bemoaning  the fact that small businesses don't have access to capital, they have  these relationships with all of these big banks.   Why don't they get to the big banks and tell them they ought to be  making loans to small businesses?                                time  1015    I don't hear them, as a part of, you know, their rhetoric, talking  about how many of the big banks are not being responsible. And so my  colleague on the opposite side of the aisle and my friend talk about  what is common sense. I tell you what is common sense. Common sense is  not to place vulnerable people in a position where they are going to  get ripped off.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2201 is a harmful bill that would simply serve as  an invitation for investment scams. The bill fails to take into account  the numerous other exemptions we have for small-dollar offerings,  including under regulation D, regulation A, and crowdfunding rules.  These exemptions already permit small businesses to raise capital while  also protecting against fraud.   In light of these exemptions, there seems to be no reasonable  explanation for the amount of legislative effort that has been wasted  on this bill. Instead of H.R. 2201, which is unwarranted and may  actually harm investors and the integrity of our markets, the House  should be focused on passing legislation that can actually improve the  lives of the Americans whom we serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2201. Don't  be a part of enacting one more scheme that is going to rip off our  constituents, and then, you know, a few years later, come back here and  talk about what a terrible thing it is that people are being ripped off  by these investors, some of them who are criminals, but nobody knows  it. The disclosure does not have to take place. They don't know that  they have people who have already been involved in crimes who are  coming to them talking about: let me help you earn some profits on this  investment.  [[Page H8677]]    We know better. Common sense tells us better. If, in fact, we are  committed to the proposition that we have a responsibility to protect  our constituents from rip-offs, from fraud, from being taken advantage  of, we will not support this bill. And I would hope that my friends on  the opposite side of the aisle, despite how far they have gone in  trying to represent that this bill is something that it is not, would  at least change their minds today and support their constituents and  vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
