 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of the Senate  amendment to H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   First, the House considered the budget resolution setting the budget  reconciliation instructions for this massive coronavirus relief bill.  Then, the House considered and passed, on a partisan basis, the budget  resolution authorizing a deficit increase of nearly $2 trillion. After  an all-night vote-a-rama in the Senate, the House will consider this  package for the third time.   Three times the House will have debated and passed a partisan  package, and only 9 percent is dedicated to actually crushing the  coronavirus. This isn't just disappointing; it is irresponsible, and it  is unrepresentative of the American people.   Currently, Democrats only hold the majority by five Representatives.  That means that the 211 Republicans, representing nearly 150 million  Americans, have been shut out of this process; 150 million Americans  are not represented in the package before us today.   Madam Speaker, we all want to provide the resources to successfully  emerge on the other side of the pandemic. This bill does include  funding for testing and vaccine deployment, as well as some economic  support and aid to those who are unemployed or experiencing food  shortages, but this support is not targeted toward those identified as  most vulnerable.    This bill includes $1,400 in economic stimulus payments to anyone  making $75,000 a year or less, including those who may not have lost  their jobs or experienced reduced employment. In addition, there is no  mechanism to ensure that these payments go only to American citizens.   Republicans were pleased that the infrastructure projects in  California and New York, projects that had nothing to do with  coronavirus relief, have been removed. We are glad of that.   My Democratic colleagues may argue that these projects would have  created jobs, but why then are Democrats also providing $125 billion to  schools even if they remain closed? Teachers want to teach. Teachers  want to be safely in their classrooms teaching. The Centers for Disease  Control has confirmed that with appropriate safety precautions, the  risk of coronavirus transmission in schools is minimal. In fact, many  States are prioritizing teachers for vaccines. Madam Speaker, our State  of Texas is doing so. Why are we paying schools to keep them home?   This bill also provides $362 billion for State and local governments.  The CARES Act, passed on March 27, already provided a $150 billion  Coronavirus Relief Fund to help local entities with lost revenue during  the shutdowns. However, many local authorities have chosen to keep  their economies shut down, despite a drop in coronavirus cases and the  effectiveness of safety measures like social distancing and mask- wearing.  [[Page H1165]]    Congress should not bail out State and local governments for  mismanagement that occurred prior to the pandemic. The total revenue  loss of State and local governments during the pandemic is $7.6  billion. This bill provides over $219 billion, and it is available  until expended.   Let me say that again: It is available until expended. That is $200  billion more than the lost revenue due to the pandemic, the crisis  which this bill is meant to target.                                time  1515    This bill also provides $400 million for an emergency food and  shelter program, with $110 million set aside specifically for  humanitarian relief to families and individuals encountered by  Department of Homeland Security officials.   Since his first day in office, President Biden has worked to overturn  the advances achieved by the Trump administration to limit border  crossings by those undocumented, which is particularly concerning given  that limited coronavirus testing is occurring along our Southern  border. Just recently, over 100 individuals crossing without  documentation tested positive for the coronavirus, but were  subsequently released into the interior of the United States.   We cannot allow the desires of foreign nationals to come before the  needs of American citizens. We should provide testing and personal  protective equipment to all encountered along our Southern border so  that we can protect our frontline officials and protect American  communities.   These are only a few of the concerning provisions included in this  so-called relief package, but the most concerning piece is that  Republicans' participation in this process was extremely limited by  Democrats. Bipartisanship is not unprecedented. We came together to  pass prior coronavirus relief bills. Literally, 1 year ago, March of  last year, we passed three bipartisan coronavirus relief packages  through the House and the Senate. And we can do so again.   Why now are the Democrats deciding Republicans are not worthy, we are  not worthy partners, and limiting the voices of our constituents?   Why should only half of the Congress be allowed to participate in the  making of a law that will affect the entire country?   Is only half of the American population worth saving?   Those are the questions being asked today. With that, I urge  opposition to the rule.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  amend the rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools  Act, introduced by Mrs. Hinson from Iowa, to ensure that the $54.3  billion that Congress appropriated in December in order to help schools  reopen is, in fact, prioritized to meet the expenses of actually being  open for in-person learning.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Tenney), who is here to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, here are the facts: This bill is not going to reopen  our economy. It is not going to reopen our schools or provide targeted  relief to those who need it most. This is the most expensive bill in  the history of the United States House of Representatives, and it does  not even prioritize the immediate needs of the American people. Rather  than work for the American people, Democrats are fine working for their  own future 2 years from now. That is really not the way it is supposed  to be. We are supposed to be focused on the next generation, not the  next election. I find this unacceptable.   This is a $1.9 trillion partisan wish list that could ultimately  increase the deficit $3 trillion without addressing the immediate needs  of Americans who are trying to survive this pandemic. With $1 trillion  of unspent funding--cash already in the till from previous bills--why  is it so urgent to pass another $2 trillion now without the  representation of literally one-half of the country?   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, ``no''  on the rule, ``no'' on the underlying measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
