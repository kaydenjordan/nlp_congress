 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Water  Resources Development Act to improve our ports and harbors, inland  waterway navigation, flood and storm protection, and other pieces of  water resources infrastructure, all with a focus on locally driven  projects rather than a nationwide partisan wish list.   This bill is an example of supporting real infrastructure, and it  goes to prove that if we focus on real infrastructure, Congress can  come together in a bipartisan manner.   This legislation has a lot of wins for South Florida. In it, we get  provisions to expedite projects to protect Miami-Dade County and Monroe  County from future storm damage. The flooding this past weekend in  Miami underscored the importance of these projects for our region,  particularly as we begin hurricane season.   We also doubled funding levels for the Florida Keys Water Quality  Improvement Project to expand sanitary sewer systems in the Keys.   Overall, this legislation will be greatly beneficial to South  Florida. It is incredible what we can accomplish when we put political  hackery to the side and focus on the real needs of the American people.  I urge my colleagues to support this year's WRDA.                                time  1800
