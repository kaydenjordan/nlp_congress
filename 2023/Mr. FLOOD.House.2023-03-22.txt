 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute our farmers and  ranchers as we celebrate National Ag Week.   In Nebraska, we grow the food, fuel, and fiber we need to feed the  world.   We are known as the ``Cornhusker State'' and the ``Beef State.'' We  are number one for cattle on feed, number two for ethanol production,  and number three for corn exports.   We are home to the four largest center-pivot irrigation manufacturers  who help farmers efficiently apply water resources around the globe.   These are just a few of the things that make Nebraska the number one  ag State and the number one in the Nation for ag receipts per capita.   We are also home to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Daugherty  Water for Food Institute, which is leading the research we need to  ensure that our world's natural resources support food security for  years to come.   As we celebrate National Ag Week, I would extend a heartfelt thank  you to the farmers and ranchers who work hard and sacrifice each day to  feed the world.                            ____________________
