 Mr. President, it is Thursday, and it is that time of  the week that I like to come down to the Senate floor and talk about  somebody who is doing something great in my State, someone I get to  brag about, a special Alaskan, somebody we refer to as our Alaskan of  the Week.   Sometimes this person has made big headlines back home, maybe even  across the country, and throughout the State, people know them. But  oftentimes--and one of the reasons we started this whole series many  years ago--this is a person who has worked more behind the scenes day  in, day out, year in, year out, doing the kind of public service that  is so vital to the health and well-being of our communities throughout  Alaska, throughout America, but is not always recognized and certainly  not recognized enough.   Our Alaskan of the week, Fairbanks police officer Daniel Welborn, is  one of those people. He recently retired from the Fairbanks Police  Force after 26 years--more than a quarter of a century--and is one of  those everyday heroes who we think are important to highlight as an  Alaskan of the Week and as an American helping his fellow Americans and  Alaskans.   Before I get into Officer Welborn's story, let me tell you a little  bit about what is going on in Alaska right now. The weather has been  glorious in many areas--sunny in a lot of places, rainy in others. We  have a very big State. The summer solstice is just a few days behind  us. That is the longest day of the year and a huge day in Alaska-- midnight Sun, energy. It is great being in Alaska right now.   Most of the State has opened up with precautions, of course, in  place, given the pandemic. More and more people are getting out. The  salmon are certainly running, beginning to run up our rivers. The bears  are fully woke--maybe not woke in that sense, but they are awake.   I was home last week in Fairbanks celebrating the amazing life of my  mother-in-law, Mary Jane Fate, whom our family put to rest. She was one  of the most revered Alaskan leaders and elders who recently passed  away, and we had a beautiful, moving ceremony, talking about this  trailblazing woman.   I can't wait to get back home--get back home to Fairbanks in  particular, the Golden Heart City, where Officer Welborn has spent his  entire career protecting and defending.   As you know, much attention has been spent on our Nation's police  forces in recent weeks, but there hasn't been nearly enough attention,  in my view, drawn to what it actually means to be a police officer--not  an easy job--and to be a good police officer--a critically important  job--which the vast majority of police officers--certainly in Alaska  but I would say across America--are, good police officers who put their  lives on the line every day for us, and Alaskans and Americans should  be grateful that they do that.   As I have said many times before at police memorial ceremonies back  home, every job in our country, every job in my State is important, but  there is something special, noble, even sacred about a job that entails  protecting others and being willing to put your life on the line to  keep your fellow citizens safe.   So let me talk about a good police officer, one of many in my State.  Dan Welborn and his large Catholic family of seven brothers and sisters  moved to Fairbanks in 1988. Dan's father was in the Army, which, of  course, draws a lot of people to the Golden Heart City of Fairbanks and  to the great State of Alaska. We have more veterans per capita than any  State in the country. By his father and mother and probably, I am sure,  a bunch of his siblings, he was taught discipline and respect and the  importance of giving back to his community.   Dan graduated from West Valley High in Fairbanks and then went on to  the University of Alaska at Fairbanks--UAF, as we call it. As a  student, he began working with the campus police, which piqued his  interest in law enforcement as a career and led him--he put himself  through the law enforcement academy in Alaska.   Eventually, newly married and considering starting a family, Dan got  a job at the Fairbanks Police Department, and that is the job he has  kept for 26 years, and he has done it very well. He has done nearly  every job there is to do on the force. Traffic duty, patrol, oversight  of investigations, homicides, sexual assaults, fraud, forgery, computer  and internet crimes--you name it, Dan's done it. He helped build a  property crimes unit in Fairbanks.   He wrote dozens and dozens of grants to help the department get the  equipment it needed so they can keep up with the times.   His awards are extensive. I was looking at his record. It is very  impressive--Officer of the Year, numerous service awards and ribbons.   His community service is also extensive beyond just being a police  officer--serving on the board of Mothers Against Drunk Driving,  starting a project called Operation Glow in Fairbanks, which helps keep  kids safe on Halloween when they are out trick-or-treating.   In 2016, Officer Welborn was promoted to deputy chief of police  where, again, he excelled. He is known throughout the State for his  solid decisionmaking, his even temperament, and for the good way that  he has with people. He is judicious and stern when needed, but always  kind, considerate, and respectful, which is what we want in our police  force.   Service also runs in Dan's family. I love this part of his life. His  brother Doug is also a Fairbanks police officer, and his son Brett was  sworn in as a Fairbanks police officer on May 20, a month ago. Wow.  That is a family of service.   What he tells his son Brett is this:         It's important that you understand defensive tactics. [This       is not always easy work.] But the most important thing is       your people skills. You need to be able to sympathize       [empathize] with people, and take charge if you need to. And       if you need to take charge and you get someone under control,       you must treat them with professionalism and respect. It's a       hard thing to remember [sometimes], but it's the most       critical thing to remember.    That is Officer Welborn. That is sage wisdom.   Now, I hear that Dan will be moving to St. Louis to be close to his  beloved baseball team, the Cardinals. He will miss the community, his  job, and his  [[Page S3303]]  family. By the way, his sister Patty wrote this great letter to me,  which I read all about his community service.   Boy, Dan, your sister thinks you are amazing. We hope that you will  come back. Actually, we are pretty confident you are going to come back  to Alaska because we want you to come back. You are not done serving  our community.   We know this: Officer Welborn will certainly be missed, and he will  miss being a patrol officer. He loved working the traffic beat because  of all the people he got to meet and all the times he got to help  people on the road. Of course, there are things about the job he won't  miss. I am not sure this is talked about enough, images that will  likely stick with him and images that, unfortunately, haunt many police  officers across the country because the fact of the matter is, people  can be difficult. People can be brutal to each other, domestic violence  and child abuse. The police see it all. It is not easy, and he has  witnessed way too much of that brutality, and he has protected  Fairbanks' citizens from a lot of it.   Here is what he also knows: Mostly, the vast majority of people are  good, and that is so important to remember. Alaskans are good people.  Americans are good people. He has witnessed that, too, and he has  contributed to that goodness.   He recently told a story about a time at the department that will  stay with him. He talked about attending a wedding at a hotel. There  was a man there setting tables and working at the hotel. He looked at  Officer Welborn and said, ``Officer, can I talk to you for a minute?''  He said, ``Sure.'' This man went up to Officer Welborn and said:         Officer, you probably don't remember me, but you arrested       me years ago for a DUI. [I was having problems then, and]       I've turned my life around since then. All these years later,       Officer Welborn, I still remember how well you treated me.    Think about that. Those are the kind of good memories that will stay  with Dan too. So, thank you, Officer Welborn, for all you have done for  our community and the great city of Fairbanks. Thanks for your service  to Alaska and to America. Thanks for protecting us and for setting the  example with respect.   We wish you all the happiness in retirement. We really want you to  come back to Alaska, so don't stay in St. Louis too long. The Cardinals  aren't even that good of a baseball team.   Congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.   (Mr. SULLIVAN assumed the Chair.)
