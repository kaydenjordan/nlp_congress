 Mr. Speaker, ensuring everyone has access to  high quality and affordable healthcare is a top priority for me.   That is why, together with House Democrats, we have fought tirelessly  in Congress to bring down healthcare and prescription drug costs.   Finally, Medicare can negotiate lower prescription drug costs for  seniors and other beneficiaries, which will take effect in 2026.   I am excited that the first 10 Medicare part D drugs have been  selected for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.   In my home State of Texas, 623,000 seniors will save money thanks to  these negotiations.   We are building a healthcare system that prioritizes the well-being  of all Americans, regardless of their age, income, or background.   When it comes to healthcare, we are all in this together. We are  putting seniors over profits. We are putting people over politics.                            ____________________
