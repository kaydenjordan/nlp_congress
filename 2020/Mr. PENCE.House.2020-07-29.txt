 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Clifty Falls State  Park for its 100th anniversary. Located in beautiful Madison, Indiana,  Clifty Falls gives its visitors an experience that you can't get  anywhere else.   For 100 years, Hoosiers and Americans across the Nation have enjoyed  beautiful hiking trails and waterfalls in Clifty Falls. I congratulate  Clifty Falls State Park for its 100-year anniversary. Indiana is lucky  to have such a beautiful place.                              Keep America Safe     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to challenge mayors, Governors,  leaders of this country to stand up and shut down the rioting we are  witnessing in communities across our Nation. Anarchists are destroying  homes, businesses, and whole communities. These people are not peaceful  protestors. They are violent agitators.   The leaders of these cities need to get their act together and end  this violence. American citizens are getting hurt and, yes, even  killed, and it is time to stop this madness.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in calling to end this  lawlessness and to help keep all of our communities safe across this  country.                              Reopen our Schools     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for  reopening schools across our Nation. I have been talking to parents in  my district, Indiana's Sixth District, and the consensus is in: Let's  get our kids back to school.   The science is on our side. Both the CDC and Academy of Pediatrics  agree it is safe to reopen our schools. In fact, it would be unsafe to  keep our schools closed. The emotional scarring, unreported abuse, and  learning deficits of keeping our kids stuck inside staring at a screen  and away from socialization is far too great. Working parents doing  everything they can to put food on the table, they need our support.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot let an entire generation fall behind in  education. We must find a safe way to reopen our schools.                           Support President Trump     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for  President Donald J. Trump.   Perseverance in the face of lies from the media and his political  opponents shows fearless leadership and should be admired.   The D.C. swamp continues to attack him relentlessly, stopping at  nothing to take him down. The collateral damage in this grotesque war  against our President is the American people.   President Trump created an economy where minorities were thriving,  workers and families had good-paying jobs, and businesses were finally  flourishing. When Democrats and the media do everything in their power  to halt Trump's work, they are actually attacking the very American way  of life that we hold dear.   Mr. Speaker, I pledge to continue to support President Donald Trump  and his agenda to make the American people stronger than ever.                         Mental Health of our Nation     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the mental  health crisis our Nation faces as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.  The pandemic and the resulting economic crisis have resulted in a  mental health and substance abuse crisis like we have never seen  before.   Veterans, students, families, and Americans with a history of mental  illness or addiction are really suffering. To continue to shut down our  country does not make scientific sense, economic sense, or common  sense. It is  [[Page H3888]]  imperative we reopen our country and get Americans back to work, back  to school, and back to a healthy lifestyle.                            ____________________
