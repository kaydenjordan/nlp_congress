 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Recently, President Trump said: Who knew that health care could be so  complicated?   Well, 70 years ago, Harry Truman knew how complicated it could be  when he first proposed national health insurance. Lyndon Johnson knew  more than 50 years ago when he proposed, successfully, Medicare and  Medicaid. Richard Nixon knew when he proposed the individual mandate.  Bob Dole knew when he proposed the individual mandate. In  Massachusetts, Mitt Romney knew when he proposed the individual  mandate.   Mr. Speaker, recently, within the last week, the great on-the-street  writer, Jimmy Breslin, died. Amongst the great columns and the great  books he wrote, one of them that he wrote that will be with us in a  timeless manner was ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.''   That is what this institution has been like for the last 10 days.  There were caucuses and there were conferences. People were running  back and forth with new CBO scores and coming back to the floor with  new proposals. Members are put in the position of being offered special  arrangements so that they might be brought over the goal line--that,  after 61 times they have voted in this House to try to repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   Well, here is what we have in front of us this afternoon: a CBO score  says that 24 million Americans will see either an increase in premiums  or they will lose their insurance, there will be an imposition of an  age tax on older Americans, and a tax cut of $1 trillion. This bill has  gone from bad to worse.   If that wasn't enough, to get the votes to pass the bill, they want  to cut prescription drug benefits, mental health benefits, hospital  benefits, and maternity care; and, yes, every one of us in this  institution knows a family who is struggling with a loved one's  addiction, and they want to roll back that benefit.   Recently, the conservative columnist Bill Kristol tweeted:         The healthcare bill doesn't, A, lower costs that they have;       B, it doesn't improve insurance; C, it doesn't increase       liberty; D, it doesn't make health care better. So what is       the point?    Here is the point: it is a $1 trillion tax cut so that they can  change the baseline for their tax cuts that are coming down the road.  That is what this is about.   Now, the President said he wanted an insurance plan that covered all  members of the American family. What they are offering up today is a  plan that cuts health insurance for 24 million American family members.  It does not increase coverage, it does not lower costs, and it does not  strengthen consumer protections.    So what does it do?   Sadly enough, back to the old argument that we have had in this  institution for years: a $1 trillion tax cut for the people at the top  and special interests.   The former speaker here a minute ago, the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, spoke about perfection. I was here when this  legislation was authored, and I helped to write it. I can tell you this  right now: we knew it was not about perfection, but we subscribed to  the idea, as was the case with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,  that we would improve it as time went on. We would fix it so that all  members of the American family might benefit from the basic notion of  access and affordability as it relates to health care.   So what do we have here?   $839 billion of cuts to Medicaid, which is now long-term care for  members of the American family.   Do you know why?   Sixty percent of Medicaid dollars go to nursing home care, and they  want to cut $839 billion to provide a $1 trillion tax cut. Let me tell  you, members of the American family can understand that.   In Massachusetts, where proudly I can say 100 percent of the children  in our State are covered, 97 percent of the adults in Massachusetts are  covered. And guess what? It polls regularly in the high seventies as to  consumer satisfaction. A Republican Governor of Massachusetts has  advised them to go slowly and to go carefully, that this is not the  path that they want to travel down, as well as other Governors across  the country who happen to be a Republican.                                time  1400    The hard truth here today is they are asking the American family to  pay more to get less. Dozens of Republicans have said so today.   Secretary Mnuchin recently said that ``there will be no absolute tax  cut for the upper class.'' I hope that the Republican Conference  confers with Secretary Mnuchin so that they might get their facts  straight on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friend--and he is my  friend--from Ohio that his vote will result in 39,500 people losing  their healthcare coverage if this legislation prevails.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Levin), who was a substantive and major player in the development of  the ACA when it was passed.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 50,000 people in his congressional district in  Nebraska losing their health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Lewis), a giant in terms of the morality of our time and a good friend  and individual who helped write the Affordable Care Act, as well.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this  bill will result in 49,200 people in his congressional district in  Minnesota losing their healthcare coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Governor Charlie  Baker of Massachusetts that relates to the debate we are having today.           Office of the Governor, Commonwealth of Massachusetts,             State House,                                        Boston, MA, March 21, 2017.        Dear Delegation Member: Health care is once again at the       forefront of national and state policy discussions; I know we       all share the goal of ensuring access to quality, affordable       health care coverage for the people of Massachusetts. With       Congress set to take up the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       imminently, I wanted to share with you my administration's       analysis of the potential effects this bill would have on our       state.        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its score of       the AHCA on March 13. This analysis is broadly consistent       with concerns we have raised, with you and others, regarding       the bill's impact on the state and its residents' access to       affordable healthcare. Applying CBO's assumptions to       Massachusetts results in at least $1 billion of reduced       federal revenue beginning in 2020, and we estimate reduced       revenue of $1.3 billion in 2021, and $1.5 billion in 2022,       with likely a greater annual impact in the years that follow.        Specifically, our estimate extrapolated from the CBO       analysis of a $1.5 billion impact for FY 2022 includes $1.3       billion of annual MassHealth federal revenue losses and $200       million in annual reduced federal subsidies for private       insurance through the Connector.        Several key areas of concern for Massachusetts were not       included in the CBO analysis and could further impact the       Commonwealth's budget. For example, the CBO estimate does not       address 1115 waiver payments that we believe this bill would       put at risk. By FY22, the Commonwealth estimates an       additional $425-475 million per year of reduced federal       revenue in potential elimination of 1115 payments not       captured under the per capita targets, including federal       matching funds for a state-run ConnectorCare Wrap subsidy.        The actual experience for these and other factors is       significantly dependent on how the U.S. Department of Health       and Human Services implements the legislation and       unpredictable factors in the future (e.g., pharmaceutical       growth).        In addition to reduced federal revenue for Medicaid, the       CBO also projects a reduction in employer-sponsored health       insurance of 7 million people nationwide as a result of the       repeal of the federal Employer Mandate. This would exacerbate       a trend that Massachusetts has seen over the last several       years. Massachusetts repealed the Chapter 58 Fair Share       Contribution in 2013 in order to comport with the ACA. My       administration has proposed reinstating an employers' shared       responsibility for the costs of health care. This would be       increasingly important if the federal Employer Mandate were       repealed, as the AHCA proposes.        The Commonwealth does have certain protections in place       that could mitigate the impact of some of these changes.       Massachusetts retains its individual health insurance       mandate, reducing the likelihood that many people would drop       out of the insurance market due to the repeal of the federal       mandate. Massachusetts also has protective insurance coverage       laws that would not be superseded by the federal legislation.        The AHCA includes a provision that would prevent Medicaid       from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for providing important       health services such as cancer screenings. My administration       opposes this provision, and has already committed to funding       these services with state dollars if it should pass.        During conversations with governors across the country, the       Trump Administration has expressed a general openness to       providing greater state flexibility with respect to health       care, including through a letter issued by HHS Secretary       Price on March 14 to states. Our administration will pursue       additional flexibilities to stabilize our markets and ensure       continued coverage for residents and we urge you to support       these efforts by leading discussions in Congress to ensure       the people of Massachusetts continue to have access to a       quality health care system.        Overall, our analysis indicates that the AHCA would       increasingly strain the fiscal resources necessary to support       the Commonwealth's continued commitment to universal health       care coverage. I hope this information is helpful to you as       Congress takes up the American Health Care Act.        My administration and I will continue to stay in touch with       you as we work together to ensure access to quality,       affordable health coverage for all Massachusetts residents.            Sincerely,                                                  Charles D. Baker,                                                          Governor.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), who played a major role in the substantive contribution  he made to writing the ACA.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this  bill today will result in 68,300 people from his congressional district  losing their health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson), a very thoughtful member of the Committee on Ways and Means  who also helped to write the ACA.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague and my friend that with  his vote for this bill, 41,400 people from his congressional district  in Pennsylvania will lose their healthcare coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Larson), who is from an adjacent district and a close friend and a  long-time member of the Committee on Ways and Means and an individual  who also contributed mightily to the development and writing of the  Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that her vote for  this bill will result in 63,000 people in South Dakota losing their  healthcare coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), a visionary, certainly, a forward-looking individual who  also helped to write the ACA.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 70,000 people in his congressional district in  South Carolina losing their healthcare coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), who is a thoughtful member of the Ways and Means  Committee and lucky enough to have been educated in the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that her vote for this  bill will result in 42,000 people in her congressional district in  Indiana losing their healthcare coverage and care.   I include in the Record a letter from Republican Governor Snyder of  the State of Michigan raising his concerns about this legislation.                                                  State of Michigan,                                                Executive Office,                                        Lansing, MI, March 21, 2017.      Hon. Sandy Levin,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Levin: As Congress considers       legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and       reform Medicaid, I want to ensure you are aware of the impact       that changes may have on beneficiaries in Michigan who rely       on these programs for access to care and overall health. I       also want to provide my perspective on priorities for federal       health reform and highlight how they have been utilized at       the state level to drive meaningful reform that has increased       access to cost-effective care.        In its current form, the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       shifts significant financial risk and cost from the federal       government to states without providing sufficient flexibility       to manage this additional responsibility. The proposed       legislation reduces federal resources that our state relies       on to assist 2.4 million Michiganders enrolled in traditional       Medicaid and the Healthy Michigan Plan, our state's       innovative Medicaid expansion program.        The current federal debate has largely focused on the       Medicaid expansion population, including over 650,000       childless adults and parents that are enrolled in the Healthy       Michigan Plan. However, half of all children in Michigan are       served by traditional Medicaid each year and roughly 67,000       of them currently reside in your district. Moreover, more       than 338,000 individuals with disabilities receive their       health care and support services through Medicaid and an       estimated 22,000 of these individuals reside in your       district. Altogether, there are 1.75 million children,       seniors, pregnant women and disabled individuals served by       traditional Medicaid in Michigan, and roughly 119,000 of them       reside in your district. As you know, these are our state's       most vulnerable citizens, friends and neighbors. The proposed       AHCA will adversely impact them.        While reforming the nation's health care system is vital,       it is imperative that gains in health coverage and access to       care are maintained. These ideas are not mutually exclusive.  [[Page H2431]]         In Michigan, innovative approaches to improving quality and       value are being utilized to support each individuals'       personal responsibility for their health. This has resulted       in significant reductions of nearly 50% in uncompensated       care, a dramatic decrease in the number of individuals using       the emergency room as a regular source of care, and nearly       85% of enrollees taking part in annual primary or preventive       care visits. As drafted, the AHCA would eliminate coverage       from the 49,000 individuals enrolled in the Healthy Michigan       Plan in your district, as Michigan taxpayers assume       responsibility over time for up to $800 million in additional       costs. This cost shift will trigger a provision in Michigan       law ending the Healthy Michigan program.        I believe Medicaid reform is necessary, however, that       reform must be approached deliberately to ensure that state       flexibility and innovation are valued, Michigan providers       remain strong, and our most vulnerable citizens do not fall       through the cracks. Ideally, this would be done by removing       prescriptive program requirements that require states to seek       waivers when implementing innovative ideas. Instead, states       would be given performance based outcomes with federal       involvement only when performance is lacking.        If Congress moves forward in passing the proposed AHCA,       which shifts financial risk to state taxpayers, my       administration and the Michigan Legislature must possess the       flexibility necessary to manage that risk. The Trump       Administration may provide additional flexibility to states,       however, I am concerned that federal agencies may encounter       limitations in federal statute. Ultimately, Michigan cannot       rely solely on the promise of future action without seeing       all of the tools that will be at our disposal to manage the       program.        In addition, under the proposed AHCA, I remain concerned       about the affordability of insurance coverage in the       individual market. I am particularly concerned about the       impact this legislation may have on older Michiganders who       could see significant cost increases.        I welcome the opportunity to partner with you to provide       greater federal budget predictability and improve health       outcomes of Michiganders, which in turn relieves pressure on       other social programs. I have worked with other Governors to       develop a proposal to accomplish these objectives while also       preserving coverage for Michiganders, and I hope this can       serve as a blueprint for you as we work together to       accomplish these goals.        I look forward to continuing our partnership to help       Michiganders lead healthy and productive lives.            Sincerely,                                                       Rick Snyder,                                                          Governor.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who is a well-regarded member of the Ways and  Means Committee. I think it is fair to say that everybody in this  institution looks forward to his time when he gets up to speak.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 38,200 people from his congressional district  in Michigan losing their healthcare coverage, and 313,123 people in the  State of Michigan, indeed, did sign up for the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Crowley), a long-time friend, a very sound member of the committee, and  also the well-regarded chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this  bill will result in 40,900 people from his congressional district in  Iowa losing healthcare coverage. I also want to thank the gentleman for  being the first speaker on the Republican side to acknowledge that this  is a tax cut.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois  (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means  Committee and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus, and  a very strong performer on the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as to how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), a new member on the Ways and Means Committee, and  a very thoughtful Member of Congress.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. O'Halleran).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I want to make sure the people of America understand what  we are doing here in about 1 hour. We heard during the course of a  Presidential campaign the promise that everything was going to be  covered and we would be tired of winning.   If winning means that 24 million Americans are going to lose their  healthcare coverage, if winning means imposing an age tax on seniors,  if winning means higher out-of-pocket costs for working Americans, and  if winning means robbing $75 billion from the Medicare trust fund, we  don't want to be part of that victory lap.   This isn't about one person making up alternative facts. Our  statements today have been based upon the CBO, the National Rural  Health Association, the American Medical Association, the American  Association of Retired Persons, and the March of Dimes.   This bill has fewer covered, weaker protections, and higher costs.  Let's call this what it is today; it is a $1 trillion tax cut for the  richest amongst us.   The Republicans are now facing the art of the ordeal. They have a bad  plan, and they know it. They have scrambled for the last week to try to  figure out how to stitch it together, and it hasn't worked.   For those across this country, think of the following: no maternity  care, fewer hospital visits, no mental health services for those  families who are struggling with a family member who has an opiate  addiction, which is the crisis of our time.   This is more of the same: tax cuts for the wealthiest amongst us and  healthcare cuts for everyone else.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 24, 2017, on page H2433, the following appeared: Mr.  Speaker, I yield back the balance      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, I  reserve the balance    ========================= END NOTE =========================
