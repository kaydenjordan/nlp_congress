 Madam Speaker, the Republicans lost the majority and the  Presidency because of their incompetence on COVID and the economy, and  passed a tax cut for the rich that exploded the deficit by $400  billion, and the debt by $4 trillion.   So forgive me if I won't stand here and be lectured about fiscal  responsibility from folks who took their only moment in charge to give  windfalls to the wealthiest Americans, and now they are desperate to  paint a sad picture of America. They are invested in our Nation's  failure, solely as a desperate move to try to get back to power.   Meanwhile, we Democrats are delivering. First, we defended democracy.  I was up there in the Chamber on January 6 when a violent insurrection  attempted to stop the democratic, peaceful transfer of power. This  violent insurrection was stoked by my Republican colleagues. They don't  want to talk about that now. But that's too bad.   They attacked our democracy. They desecrated this Chamber by stoking  extremism. Yet, we got back here and they voted ``no'' and we voted  ``yes'' to make sure that American voters were heard and certified Joe  Biden's election  [[Page H3849]]  as President. And yes, some brave Republicans joined us because they  realized it was treason.   We will defend democracy and hold those responsible accountable  through the January 6 committee.   Second, we got the pandemic under control. We passed the American  Rescue Plan, put shots in arms, money in pockets, got kids back to  school and families back to work. Every American had access to the  vaccine; every American, and life is getting back to normal.   We stopped a great recession back in Florida, where we both have the  honor of representing. We stopped a foreclosure crisis that knocked in  half people's wealth, hurt through the generations, so many homeowners  in Florida and across the Nation.   Unemployment is down to 4 percent nationally and under 4 percent in  Florida. Yet, no Republicans voted for it.   Third, we passed the largest infrastructure law in our Nation's  history. The infrastructure plan will upgrade America, roads and  bridges, clean air and water, airports and ports, high speed internet  access for all Americans, including rural Americans left behind before,  and brownfield restoration and other environmental restoration. Ten  Republicans voted for it. We applaud them. But they were ridiculed by  their own party for voting for infrastructure.    What is wrong with the minority leaders in this Chamber if they are  going to attack their own Members for investing in America, something  that they had the chance to do? I would have voted for it under then- President Trump for an infrastructure package. But they failed to do  it. We got it done.   Then Democrats led this House to pass a bipartisan National Defense  Authorization Act. That is to protect the homeland, fund our military,  support our troops.   We passed a bipartisan budget just last week to meet the needs of the  American people, jobs, healthcare, education, the environment, local  projects; yes, supporting a robust immigration system, and making sure  that we can meet all the needs of the American people.   We also had bipartisan support for the war on Ukraine, the relentless  and disgraceful invasion by Russia of Ukraine. We have supplied them  with military weapons, training, humanitarian relief, and we will  defend democracy in Europe with that $14 billion we passed in a  bipartisan fashion here.   And yes, we need to still continue to address COVID-related  inflation. First, by getting COVID-19 under control, our economy is  finally producing more goods again. Things are more efficient now.  People are buying more services again to balance that out.   Second, our infrastructure law will upgrade our ports, our airports,  and our highways to improve supply chains.   Third, we are addressing price gouging of companies that are taking  advantage, particularly in gas and groceries.   Fourth, we are boosting domestic oil production to compensate for the  Russian oil ban which was very popular and demanded upon by my  constituents and others. And in the long term, we are investing in  renewable energy. And yes, the Federal Reserve will do their part to  help make sure we can address COVID-related and Ukraine war-related  inflation, and we need to do this together, rather than politicize it.   Next, we are turning the corner to go to the America COMPETES Act,  Madam Speaker, bringing American manufacturing jobs back home,  something that people have talked about for years. We will get this  done. We have had bipartisan support in the Senate. We had some  bipartisan support in the House. We will now go to conference.   And what will that mean? Bringing back home more microchip  manufacturing, which has made it harder to get cars and trucks on to  American car lots. We can make it here at home. We can make it in  America.   We will bring back personal protective equipment and other healthcare  manufacturing to help out, like we saw during the pandemic, where it  was a huge issue.   We will bring back telecommunications equipment. We invent  telecommunications equipment, but so much of it, all of it, is made  overseas. And with China now spying on us, we need to make sure we have  our domestic production ready to go.   And pharmaceutical production, biosimilar production, aerospace  production, like we do in East Orange County, as well as space  production; having the busiest spaceport in the world, 70 percent of  space flights going through there at Cape Canaveral, something that we  beam with pride about in Florida.   So as we hear about the mistakes of the past and trying to invest in  failure by many Republicans in this Chamber, the Democratic majority is  defending democracy. We have gotten COVID under control. We have passed  a major infrastructure package. We have passed bipartisan bills for the  budget, for our military, for the war in Ukraine. And now, we go on  next to bring American jobs home with the America COMPETES Act. The  future is bright if we work together, Madam Speaker.

Ultimately, she is driven every day by the  bravery of the club members she serves who face and have overcome  unimaginable obstacles, as well as the success they achieved through  mentors and club programming.
