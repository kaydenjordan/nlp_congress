 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and  solemn remembrance that I rise today to honor the life and legacy of a  former First Lady of the United States, a former First Lady of the  State of Georgia, a great wife, a loving mother, a doting grandmother  and great-grandmother, a dedicated servant leader, and a friend of  longstanding, Mrs. Rosalynn Smith Carter.   Sadly, Mrs. Carter transitioned from this life on November 19, 2023.  Her funeral service was held at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, November 29,  2023, at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia.   Rosalynn Smith Carter was born and raised in Plains, Georgia, to the  union of Wilburn Edgar Smith and Frances Allethea ``Allie'' Murray  Smith. She graduated as valedictorian from Plains High School and  attended Georgia Southwestern College, now Georgia Southwestern State  University, in Americus, Georgia, where she served as vice president of  her class and graduated in 1946.    In 1945, she began dating James Earl ``Jimmy'' Carter, Jr., also from  Plains and whose family farmed peanuts. Jimmy was attending the United  States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, at the time. They were  married in Plains on July 7, 1946, and they would go on to spend 77  cherished years together.   Following the death of her father-in-law, James Earl Carter, Sr., in  1953, Rosalynn, Jimmy, and their three sons returned to Plains,  Georgia, from Norfolk, Virginia, where he had been stationed in the  Navy as Jimmy was now tasked with running the family business.   Rosalynn took over its bookkeeping and proved herself a formidable  business partner.   After her husband was elected to the Georgia State Senate in 1962,  her role on the peanut farm grew, especially while he traveled to  Atlanta for legislative sessions.   In 1970, Senator Jimmy Carter launched his campaign for Governor, and  Rosalynn took a leading role on the campaign trail. In addition to  handling most of her husband's political correspondence and meeting  with constituents, Mrs. Carter began to travel  [[Page H6134]]  across the State of Georgia to campaign on his behalf.   Following Jimmy Carter's election as Governor, Mrs. Carter served as  Georgia's First Lady from 1971 to 1975, where she would take on the  role of Governor Carter's trusted adviser and confidant. She was  appointed to the Governor's Commission to Improve Services for the  Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped, where she formally began working  on one of her foremost initiatives: improving and breaking the stigma  surrounding mental health.   In 1972, Governor Carter gave me, a young, beginning lawyer, my first  political appointment, a seat on the Governor's Advisory Council on  Drug Abuse.   Governor Carter completed his term in January 1975. Georgia's  Constitution then banned its Governors from serving successive terms.   Prior to moving back to Plains, Governor Carter had already announced  his intention to run for President of the United States in the 1976  election.   Rosalynn Carter, once again, joined the campaign and quickly began  traveling the Nation on her husband's behalf to tell American voters  why the soft-spoken Georgia peanut farmer should become President of  the United States.   In November 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected President of the United  States, and Rosalynn accompanied him to the White House, where she  would make her mark in defining what it meant to be America's First  Lady.   While serving as First Lady of the United States from 1977 to 1981,  Mrs. Carter made it clear that she had no intention of solely carrying  out the duties traditionally left to wives of Presidents. As an equal  partner to her husband, she attended many Cabinet meetings and weekly  business meetings with President Carter, where she would be informed  and could give meaningful advice and counsel on the policy issues of  the day.   The egalitarian relationship between President and Mrs. Carter drew  widespread interest but also criticism from those who believed the wife  of a U.S. President should focus solely on homemaking and hosting White  House parties and events for foreign dignitaries.   The Carters brushed their critics aside, and in 1977, President  Carter appointed Rosalynn the honorary chair of the President's  Commission on Mental Health.   In 1979, the commission submitted a mental health systems bill to  Congress, and Mrs. Carter testified in support of the bill before a  U.S. Senate subcommittee, becoming the first Presidential wife since  Eleanor Roosevelt to do so.   Subsequently, the Mental Health Systems Act was passed by Congress  and signed into law by President Carter on October 7, 1980.   Following President Carter's loss in the 1980 Presidential election,  the Carter family returned to Plains, Georgia, where they continued to  make a positive impact on both their local community and the world.   Mr. and Mrs. Carter continued their ministry of service after that  time in the White House with the same vigor and urgency, becoming  heavily involved in Habitat for Humanity, whose international  headquarters was then located in Americus, Georgia.   The Carters' work with Habitat for Humanity drew national attention  through the annual Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project, which helped  the upstart nonprofit organization grow and construct thousands and  thousands of new homes for low- and middle-income families.   In 1982, Rosalynn and Jimmy founded The Carter Center, a nonprofit  human rights organization that has since become famous for its work to  eradicate disease, strengthen democracies, and alleviate human  suffering all around the world.                                time  1515    Mrs. Carter served as the vice chair of The Carter Center from 1986  to 2005 and served as a member of the board of trustees from 2005 until  her death.   Throughout her life, she sought to improve the quality of life for  those who suffered from mental illness and disability, including those  who care for them.   Mrs. Carter established the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers  in 1987 at her alma mater, Georgia Southwestern State University in  Americus. Today, the Rosalynn Carter Institute supports caregivers  across the United States through research, creating dementia and  Alzheimer's disease programs and other tools that help Americans be  effective caregivers to their loved ones.   Mother Teresa once said: ``A life not lived for others is not a  life.'' I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Rosalynn Carter  lived her life for others and went beyond the call of duty to do so.   It has been an honor to know Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter for more than  half a century. I will always cherish their friendship as well as their  sage counsel and advice, which has been invaluable to me as I have  served in Congress. They have been my constituents for 31 years, and  they did not hold back in expressing their opinion on the issues of the  day.   Together they rose to great heights, supporting and cherishing one  another along the way as they served the world around them. From the  Plains peanut fields to the Governor's mansion to the White House and  to communities around the globe, they always remained grounded, and  Plains remained home in their hearts.   Rosalynn Carter accomplished so much for so many for so long. She did  so with the grace of God as well as the love and support of her devoted  husband, their five children, their 22 grandchildren and great- grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues of the United States House of  Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and me along with the more  than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District and  people all around the world in honoring the great service to humanity  of Mrs. Rosalynn Carter and extending our deepest sympathies to her  family.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia's Eighth District  (Mr. Austin Scott), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia, my friend and my colleague, for his comments, and I thank him  for joining with me in organizing today's bipartisan Special Order hour  in honor of First Lady Rosalynn Carter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the 13th Congressional  District of Georgia (Mr. David Scott), the ranking member of the  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Georgia's First Congressional District (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Carter for  his remarks.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) of the Fourth  Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) of Georgia's  11th District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   I yield to the gentlewoman from the Fifth Congressional District,  (Ms. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Williams  for her remarks.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) of Ohio's Ninth  District, my fellow appropriator and a dedicated public servant.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time  is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) of the Ninth Congressional District.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those  words.   Mrs. Rosalynn Carter did so much in her lifetime, and she held many  leadership positions throughout it. She received numerous awards and  recognitions for her work. She served as the honorary chairperson of  the Georgia Special Olympics from 1971 to 1975. She was a member of the  Menninger Foundation board of trustees from 1986 to 2003. She was the  chair of the International Women Leaders for Mental Health, an honorary  fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, and a board member  emeritus of the National Mental Health Association. She was awarded the  Dorothea Dix Award by the Mental Illness Foundation, the Jefferson  Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, and the  Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize in Mental Health. She was  inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2001. Most notably,  in 1999, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter were jointly awarded the  Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, by  President Bill Clinton.   Rosalynn Carter was a great person not because of the titles that she  held, not because of the organizations that she served, but Rosalynn  was great measured by the true standard of greatness set by Jesus that  he or she who is great among you shall be your servant, and he who is  greatest shall be servant to all. Certainly, without a doubt, Rosalynn  Carter measures up.   Mr. Speaker, in concluding this Special Order hour, I thank my  colleague, Austin Scott, for working with me in order to organize  today's event, and I thank the Members who joined us in commemorating  the life and legacy of former First Lady Rosalynn Carter.   Though Rosalynn Carter has departed from this Earth, countless  Americans--in fact, countless people worldwide--will continue to have a  better life because of her compassion, dedication, and public service.   We will miss her dearly, but she will remain an inspiration for  generations to come.   To the Carter family, I extend my heartfelt condolences and prayers.   Mr. Speaker, I will close by reflecting on the fact that I attended  the wreath-laying ceremony at Georgia Southwestern State University  last week and the memorial services for Rosalynn Carter held at the  Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church at Emory University. During the  event, several poignant eulogies were offered, but I would like to  close this Special  [[Page H6138]]  Order by reading one that was special from her daughter, Amy Lynn  Carter. She said: ``My mom spent most of her life in love with my dad.  Their partnership and love story was a defining feature of her life.  Because he isn't able to speak to you today, I am going to share some  of his words about loving and missing her.   ``This is from a letter he wrote 75 years ago while serving in the  Navy: `My darling, every time I have ever been away from you, I have  been thrilled when I returned to discover just how wonderful you are.  While I am away, I try to convince myself that you really are not-- could not be--as sweet and beautiful as I remember. But when I see you,  I fall in love with you all over again. Does that seem strange to you?  Good-bye, Darling, until tomorrow.' ''    Sir Thomas Gray wrote in his ``Elegy Written in a Country  Churchyard'':       Full many a gem of purest ray serene      The dark unfathom'd caves of oceans bear:      Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,      And waste its sweetness on the desert air.    We are all so thankful that Rosalynn Smith Carter did not waste her  sweetness on the desert air. From Plains, Georgia, to the United  States, for the State of Georgia, and throughout the world and for all  of humankind, she truly made a difference.   We have all been truly blessed by Rosalynn Smith Carter.   As I close, I leave these words: To God be the glory for the life and  the legacy of Rosalynn Smith Carter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
