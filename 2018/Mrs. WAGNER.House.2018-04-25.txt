 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Genocide Awareness and  Prevention Month. Today we remember the millions of victims of genocide  throughout history, and we recommit to working toward the day when  genocide and mass-atrocity crimes are not only inconceivable, Mr.  Speaker, but they are nonexistent.   April marks the commemorations of some of the worst genocides in  history, including the Holocaust and Rwandan, Cambodian, and Armenian  genocides. Time and again, senseless bloodshed has ended innocent lives  and fractured families and livelihoods.   My hometown, St. Louis, is home to the largest Bosnian community  outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This community has shaped what the  city looks and feels like. It has added great cultural diversity to the  city, immense intellectual capital, thriving small businesses, and a  strong religious presence.   Two decades ago, members of our Bosnian community were refugees. In  1995, Orthodox Serbs, under the command of General Ratko Mladic,  initiated a horrific ethnic cleansing campaign against majority Muslim  Bosniaks. The escalating bloodshed forced 130,000 Bosnian refugees to  seek new lives in the United States. Thousands were murdered in  Srebrenica. Today I wish to honor these brave men and women.   The resilience of our Bosnian neighbors has enriched our city, and  their courage inspires me. It has inspired me to seek change. Tomorrow  I am offering an amendment to the State Department Authorization Act of  2018 asking the administration to study countries at risk of genocide  and mass-atrocity crimes and craft training regimens for U.S. Foreign  Service officers.   Should this bill become law, America's diplomats will have the know- how to respond to those conflicts on the ground and act before violence  spirals out of control. Most importantly, this amendment establishes  that the official policy of the United States of America is to regard  the prevention of genocide and atrocity crimes as a core national  security interest.    However, this is just one step in the right direction. The U.S.  Government must improve how it responds to conflicts. Last April, I  introduced the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act to  improve U.S. efforts to prevent mass-atrocity crimes, named after the  courageous Auschwitz survivor. The legislation honors the legacy of  Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel and his life work to fight evil around the  world.   Mr. Wiesel was just 15 years old when the Nazis deported him and his  family to Auschwitz. He was the only member of his family to survive.  Having witnessed the near total destruction of his people, he spent his  life defending the persecuted. In his honor, we fight to rectify  injustice and protect the most vulnerable in our society and across the  globe.   As Mr. Wiesel understood so well, the true horror of genocide is that  it is preventable, and the U.S. Government has the tools to effect real  change. The Elie Wiesel Act would affirm the mission of the United  States Atrocities Prevention Board and its work to coordinate  prevention and response efforts. It would also authorize the Complex  Crisis Fund to support agile, efficient responses to unforeseen crises  overseas.   This time, when America says ``never again,'' our actions will  reinforce our platitudes and our words. I thank the Chair, Mr. Speaker,  and I thank all of my colleagues who share in this fight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern) for his outstanding words and his support, his support  and that of Representative Randy Hultgren on sponsoring and  cosponsoring with me my piece of legislation, the Elie Wiesel Genocide  and Atrocities Prevention Act.   This truly is an issue that is not just about human rights and giving  voice to the voiceless and speaking for the most vulnerable in our  society; it is about human dignity across our globe.                                time  1830    It is about the U.S. responding to these conflicts in the way that  only we can and should do and provide the kind of moral authority and  support to do so through both our Congress and through our foreign  service officers and others who are working across the globe. So I  thank the gentleman for his fine words.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her kind words.   The gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney) is also a leader in this  cause and this effort that is really about, as we said, human dignity  and human rights across this world.  [[Page H3573]]    We want a day when no longer are these refugees suffering, whether it  is in Syria. On the day that President Macron addressed a joint session  here in this very Chamber, the President of the People's Republic of  France, that stood with the United States, along with the United  Kingdom, in the bombings against Syria that were targeted against those  who had been barrel-bombed and victimized and murdered by the Assad  regime in Syria.   We share a common bond with the Bosnian community. We both have very  large Bosnian communities, many of whom started out as refugees some 20  years ago. Now, as I said, the cultural diversity, the business, the  religious presence has been just wonderful to see flourish in a  district like Missouri's Second Congressional District, so I recognize  the common bond that we have there.   I thank Ms. Tenney for participating in this Special Order that goes  to the heart of genocide and mass atrocities across our globe. I know  that the people of Ms. Tenney's district in New York are also  appreciative of all she does there to represent them and those who are  the most vulnerable in our society, so I thank the gentlewoman from New  York.   I now yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot) for his kind words. He is a leader and a senior member of our  House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I also have the privilege of  serving on it.   It is an honor to have Congressman Chabot here at this Special Order  during Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month to give voice to those  millions of victims and to say we live for a time when this is  nonexistent in society.   I look forward, Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, to offering my amendment to  the State Department Authorization Act of 2018, asking the  administration to study countries at risk of genocide and mass atrocity  crimes and crafting the kind of training regimens for U.S. foreign  service officers that are so very important.   I look forward to the time when my piece of legislation, the Elie  Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act, will, Mr. Speaker, be  signed into law. It will improve the U.S. efforts to prevent mass  atrocity crimes, and I think we all, in this Chamber, on a bipartisan  level, Mr. Speaker, continue to hope and, more importantly, to work  towards a time when America says, ``Never again,'' and our actions  reinforce our words.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for coming out. I thank those  advocates on the Friends Committee on National Legislation's stand.  Together we remember the Carl Wilkens Fellowship and so many others  that stand with the victims of genocide and mass atrocities. It is an  honor to be with my colleagues here tonight and with the advocacy  groups that stand for the millions that say, ``Never again.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 45 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
