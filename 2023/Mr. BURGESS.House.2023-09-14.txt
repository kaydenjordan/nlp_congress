 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 681 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 681         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1435) to       amend the Clean Air Act to prevent the elimination of the       sale of internal combustion engines. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger  Fernandez), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 681, providing for consideration of  H.R. 1435.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1435 under a closed rule  with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, or  their designees. The rule does provide one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying  bill.   Today, the Republican majority continues to stand between President  [[Page H4311]]  Biden and Democrats in Congress and their disastrous policies that they  want to inflict on the American public.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is pretty simple: Republicans are for consumer  choice. Democrats, apparently, are not.   Democrats don't like it when consumers have choices. It seems that  our friends across the aisle, however well intentioned they may be, are  a bit squeamish about leaving choices in the hands of consumers  because, Mr. Speaker, in their heart of hearts, they don't trust  consumers. They think they will make the wrong choice.   The tendency amongst my Democratic friends is emblematic of the  larger liberal movement. That perspective, Mr. Speaker, can be  distilled succinctly: The general population requires guidance and  directions from elites, who are more enlightened, to prevent them from  making decisions that contradict progressive principles.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud my good friend from Pennsylvania, Dr. Joyce,  for standing between the Democrats and their central planners and  protecting American consumers.   Without this bill, Mr. Speaker, California and other Democratic  States could effectively ban internal combustion engines for all  Americans, regardless of where they reside. This is not what the  Founders intended when they designed our federalist system.   A de facto ban on the internal combustion engine is the point, Mr.  Speaker. President Biden and his surrogates in the Democratic Party  said: to end fossil fuels as we know them. Shame on us if we don't take  the Democrats at their word when they say things like that.   I understand that my friend and fellow member of the Rules Committee,  who I have the privilege of debating today on the floor, will likely  tell us the standards that California is looking to implement are the  prerogative of California. In most circumstances, I would agree with  that, but this isn't most circumstances, Mr. Speaker. What California  is trying to do is to usher in a de facto ban on the internal  combustion engine nationwide. I give my friends across the aisle credit  for their cunning.   Democrats have known that several States are aligned with California  in such a manner that allows California to set vehicle emission  standards that other States must then follow. Why any State would  surrender its own sovereignty to another is not consistent with this  country's founding, but that debate, Mr. Speaker, is for another day.   This is why we Republicans, particularly Republicans on the Energy  and Commerce Committee, oppose State attempts to ban the internal  combustion engine. This will adversely affect all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, California's waiver is a Trojan horse. What Democrats  can't win at the ballot box, they intend to farm out to their friends  in Federal agencies. California is part of America but does not speak  for the whole of America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Langworthy), a valuable member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   On the subject of paying taxes, I do hope the special prosecutor is  successful in ensuring that the President's family pays their fair  share in taxes. I know that is an ongoing issue before the courts now.   Mr. Speaker, according to a Stanford University study, California  will need to triple its electricity supply just to fuel all the  additional electric vehicles on the road as a result of the ban on gas  and diesel vehicle sales. The grid expansion alone is going to cost  Californians at least $75 billion in higher electric rates.   I want to reference a document prepared by the Committee on Energy  and Commerce because, obviously, that committee was responsible for our  underlying bill, and their discussion on electric vehicle mandates, on  how they are unaffordable and impractical.   The majority of vehicles, 95 percent on the road today, run on  internal combustion engines. Electric vehicles are still too expensive  for many Americans. I would reference that, basically, these are  subsidized toys for rich people.   The average transaction price of an electric vehicle was $17,000 more  than a gas-powered vehicle in 2022. Gas-powered vehicles continue to  outperform EVs with significantly higher ranges and greater towing  capacity, and they are less susceptible to issues caused by severe  weather conditions.   Electric vehicles lose 40 percent of their range in cold weather. We  are going to put all of our kids on electric schoolbuses in northern  States in wintertime and hope they get to their destination okay. If  they don't, the bus is not going to have enough power to keep the  children warm until they get a rescue vehicle out there.   The lack of vehicle charging infrastructure in many parts of the  country, especially rural areas, makes electric vehicles impractical.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Secretary of Energy for so eloquently  demonstrating that fact last week.   Rampant EV expansion could overwhelm the electric grid and compromise  grid reliability, which would result in blackouts and other issues.   We had a really hot summer in Texas. It made the newspapers in  several locations. Good news--solar energy did supply the grid with a  lot of solar power.   Here is a news flash for you, and you can't make this stuff up. The  Sun goes down every night. Just when everyone is getting home and  plugging in their electric vehicles, or maybe their electric  schoolbuses, and they come in the back door and: Oh, my gosh, this  house is hotter than Hades. Crank up the AC, and guess what? The Sun  set. Solar power is offline. The grid can't handle it. That is a  dangerous situation.   Finally, as the gentleman from Minnesota pointed out to us so  eloquently, China controls the vast majority of the mining, processing,  and manufacturing of critical minerals for electric vehicles, including  75 percent of lithium-ion batteries, as well as the processing and  refining capacity for over half of the world's lithium, cobalt, and  graphite. The administration unwisely prohibited mining in the northern  range of Minnesota, so the administration was all too eager to go to  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and employ child slave labor in  order to get those critical elements.    I thank my fellow members of the Energy and Commerce Committee for  bringing us this important piece of legislation to begin to roll back  some of the damage that President Biden has placed on the middle class.   I don't know why this administration has declared war on the middle  class, but they have, and it has been, unfortunately, readily apparent  every day since Inauguration Day 2021.   Republicans remain united in pursuing a legislative agenda that puts  the welfare of the American people above the special interests of a  few.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the rule and support the  underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Leger Fernandez is as  follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 681 Offered by Ms. Leger Fernandez of New                                   Mexico         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2.
