 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the 58  innocent souls who were taken on October 1.   No words can describe the devastation and heartbreak my community  experienced that night. So many families in Las Vegas and across the  Nation are still grieving from this unspeakable tragedy, and their  lives will never be the same.   I am forever grateful to our first responders, medical professionals,  hotel and security staff, and the kindness of strangers who helped the  wounded to the hospital and stood in line for hours to donate blood.   We will never forget the selfless and heroic acts by men and women  who risked it all and gave their lives for others that night.   As we continue to heal, what we have always known about our community  remains true: We are Vegas strong; we are resilient; and even in our  darkest hour, we come together united.                            ____________________
