 Mr. President, over the past week, the world has watched  in horror as once again an imperialist Russia sets its sights on a  sovereign nation in Eastern Europe.   Vladimir Putin's unjustified and unjustifiable war of aggression has  already left hundreds dead and created a massive refugee crisis as  noncombatants flee Russian attacks.   At this minute, Russia continues to press forward with attacks on  several fronts, with a focus on the capital city of Kyiv, but  courageous Ukrainian resistance, both from its formal military and from  an increasing number of civilians, is slowing Russia. Kyiv and other  major cities remain under significant pressure and could fall within  days, but Ukraine is demonstrating a fierce resolve and continuing to  blunt Russian advances.   Russia has also been a victim of its own deficiencies, such as poor  targeting, broken supply lines, and a limited ability to fight at  night. Surprisingly, Russia has not yet established full air  superiority, with some Ukrainian jets still flying and some air-to- surface systems still available. This means Ukraine can still fly  combat sorties and strike back against Russia. Similarly, Ukrainian  command, control, and communications appear to be intact.    How long these conditions can last, however, is an open question,  which underscores the urgent need to continue to provide Ukraine with  the weapons it needs to stay in this fight and to bring the free  nations of the world together to sanction and isolate Russia for its  unjustifiable aggression. This is Ukraine's fight, but the United  States and allies can provide weapons and humanitarian assistance while  imposing swift and severe sanctions against Russia.   We must also shore up NATO to send a signal to Putin that the United  States will make good on our defense commitments. This is essential not  only to help prevent this war from spreading farther into Eastern  Europe but to send a message to China that similar acts of aggression  will not be tolerated. We know Taiwan remains in the crosshairs of  President Xi, and just as Putin is flexing his power in Europe,  communist China is looking for any opening to pounce.   Many pundits have speculated about Putin's mindset and ultimate goal  with this attack and how far he would be willing to go despite mounting  losses. I think it is clear he is willing to take it to the next level.  We should be concerned that as Russia continues to meet heavy  resistance, Putin will order his generals to increase pressure no  matter the cost--this means no matter the cost to his own troops, many  of them young soldiers and conscripts, and no matter the cost to the  Ukrainian people.   Putin's failures in Ukraine and mounting international pressure may  also spur Putin to escalate beyond Ukraine and lash out against the  West. He has already ordered his nuclear  [[Page S849]]  forces on high alert--yet another unprovoked escalation that has drawn  immediate condemnation.   The United States and other free nations must match the resolve of  the Ukrainian people and respond with swift and severe consequences for  Putin and his cronies. The people of Ukraine have shown their fierce  determination to fight, drawing inspiration from emerging stories of  heroism.   A reported ``Ghost of Kyiv'' fighter pilot has allegedly scored six  kills against Russian jets. It may only be an urban legend, but it has  captured Ukraine's underdog grit nonetheless.   Ukrainian border guards on a remote island in the Black Sea refused  to surrender to the Russian Navy in a defiant radio transmission.   A Ukrainian solder sacrificed himself on Friday by manually  detonating charges to collapse a bridge when there was not enough time  to detonate them remotely before a Russian column closed in.   A Ukrainian woman defiantly addressed Russian occupiers, offering  them sunflower seeds and telling them to put the seeds in their pockets  so that sunflowers will grow when they die in Ukraine.   Ukraine has handed out over 18,000 weapons to reservists around Kyiv,  with social media posts showing men and women lining up to volunteer.  Ukrainian Parliament Member Kira Rudik is taking up arms, hoping to  inspire other women to join the resistance. Ukrainian media is  broadcasting instructions on how to make Molotov cocktails to attack  Russian vehicles.   Then there is President Zelenskyy, who has led the Ukrainians with  extraordinary resolution and courage. President Zelenskyy is believed  to be Putin's top target, and there are reports of Russian forces being  sent into Ukraine for the express purpose of assassinating Ukraine's  President. Yet, according to press reports, when he was offered the  chance to evacuate, Zelenskyy said:         The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride.    Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has also been visible in  Kyiv, saying Ukraine will resist ``forever'' when asked how long the  nation can hold out.   Ukraine's resolve has been on display for the world to see, as have  Vladimir Putin's true colors. Putin was given every chance to choose  diplomacy and peace. Instead, he chose war.   Putin has offered wild justifications for his attacks, suggesting  that Ukraine somehow posed a nuclear threat to Russia and is governed  by neo-Nazis and drug addicts. He has also called for Ukrainian  soldiers to defect and to ``take power into their own hands.'' It may  be that Russia is laying the groundwork for a narrative that there is  an organic pro-Russian contingent within Ukraine, possibly within the  Ukrainian military itself, to be stood up as an ``authentic'' coup to  carry out regime change. Putin has also claimed that the Ukrainian  military is moving equipment into residential neighborhoods, which  would be consistent with a resistance or insurgency defensive posture  but will also give Russia pretext to increase civilian targeting.    Vladimir Putin is apparently on a delirious quest to restore the  Soviet Union and once again see Ukraine under its thumb. Unfortunately  for him, he apparently reckoned without the people of Ukraine. Each  missile that strikes a village, every rocket that strikes an apartment  building, every tank that rattles by a once-quiet town will only  further stoke Ukrainian's resentment of the Kremlin.   Judging by the way Ukrainians are fighting, I don't think they will  ever accept Russian rule. As the growing number of Russians boldly  protesting in the streets--from Moscow to St. Petersburg to Siberia-- and online are making clear, Putin is also losing the trust of everyday  Russians, particularly of the younger generations whom he is likely  leaning on for conscripts and who will inherit a decimated economy.  Even the daughter of Putin's own spokesman posted on Instagram ``No to  war!'' which went viral before it was deleted.   Russian protests have spread to more than 50 cities, and, in keeping  with his KGB past, Putin's response has been to detain protesters and  restrict access to Facebook and Twitter. Unfortunately for him,  however, it has become clear that he will not be able to fully hide the  truth from the Russian people. Russians are clearly coming to know  Putin as a murderous warmonger who will isolate them from the free  world.   It is unfortunate that the world did not take a more aggressive  stance against Vladimir Putin before he invaded the sovereign nation of  Ukraine. I supported sanctions against Nord Stream 2 and the other  punitive measures of the NYET Act before Russia made its attack. It is  too bad it took Putin actually going to war for the world to get  serious about checking Russian aggression. However, I am pleased that  the United States and our partners are finally moving forward with  unprecedented sanctions against Russia's economy.   The United States is sanctioning Russia's central bank and freezing  its assets in the United States, and a growing number of nations are  united to block Russia from the SWIFT financial transaction messaging  system. If blocked from this system, Russia will have to conduct run- of-the-mill banking transactions directly between banks, adding costly  delays that should discourage any business with their banks. Putin has  also joined the select list of despots, like Kim Jong-un, individually  sanctioned by the United States.   While I am glad we have taken these steps, there is more we can and  should do, including directly targeting the lifeblood of the Russian  economy, and that is Russia's energy sector. Every dollar the world  denies Putin by not buying his oil and gas is one less dollar he has to  spend on his war of aggression in Ukraine.   The conflict in Ukraine is also a timely reminder that energy  independence is not only economic security but national security and  that here in the United States, we need to do everything we can to get  our energy producers off the bench and into the game so that we don't  have to rely on foreign regimes for energy supplies.   The situation is also a reminder of how important it is to make a  robust investment in our own military to restore our Nation's  readiness. The Vladimir Putins of the world will only respond to  strength, and we need to ensure that our Nation's military is prepared  to meet threats from traditional state actors as well as terrorist  organizations. When it comes to dictators like Putin, the best way to  secure peace is through robust deterrence.   As Congress reviews the administration's supplemental request for  foreign security and humanitarian assistance, we cannot offset this  funding by degrading our own defense. This is a military emergency-- just ask the people of Ukraine--and we should treat it as such. I hope  Congress will come to a sensible solution in the days and weeks ahead.   My thoughts and prayers today are with the people of Ukraine. I hope  they know that their courage and determination have inspired millions,  and I pray that the United States and freedom-loving countries the  world over will continue to do our part by providing the lethal aid  Ukrainians need to stay in this fight and by implementing biting  sanctions that will leave Putin and his cronies out in the cold.
