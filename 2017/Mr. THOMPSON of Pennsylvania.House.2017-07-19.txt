 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  about American craftsmanship as the White House celebrates ``Made in  America Week.''   American entrepreneurs, workers, farmers, and innovators have built  this country and drive our country. They are the heart of this Nation,  and they ensure that the ``Made in the USA'' label means quality and  value, which is something we treasure.   Pennsylvania has a rich history of being a manufacturing leader,  especially our storied Pennsylvania steel. The Commonwealth has been an  important cog in the wheel of this country's industrial revolution,  thanks to industries like iron, coal, and lumber, in addition to steel.   Our Pennsylvania farmers have fed, and continue to feed, generations  of Americans, providing safe, nutritious food for all of our neighbors.  This rich history continues today.   The Fifth Congressional District is home to numerous producers that  have made vital contributions to our prosperity. They have employed  American workers, produced American products, and grown American crops.  From heritage companies to newer, rising stars, we have a wide cross- section of products produced in the Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional  District.   Brookville Equipment Corporation in Jefferson County is the leading  American manufacturer of diesel locomotive engines, street trolleys,  and mining machinery. Brookville's mass transit resume includes fully  refurbishing streetcars for New Orleans, Philadelphia, and San  Francisco.   Since 1889, W.R. Case & Sons Cutlery Company has been fashioning  handcrafted pocketknives and sporting knives in McKean County. Zippo  Manufacturing Company, makers of the world famous Zippo windproof  lighter, owns Case knives today. Zippo is another family-owned business  based in Bradford since 1936.   Clarion Industries has two divisions in Clarion County: Clarion  Boards, which produces high-quality fiberboard used to manufacture  products such as laminate flooring, furniture, fixtures, cabinetry, and  moldings; and Clarion Laminates, the only ``Made in the USA'' flooring  manufacturer of its kind.   Emporium Powdered Metal, Inc., in Cameron County, is a powdered metal  manufacturer staffed with more than 120 years of combined experience.   Welch's, in Erie County, is particularly known for its grape juices,  jams, and jellies made from dark Concord grapes and its white Niagara  grape juice.   Clearfield Machine Company has been producing custom machining since  1868 in Clearfield County.   Since 1830, the Woolrich name has stood for the best in sportswear  for men and women, and it continues to make outerwear that combines  comfort and function in Woolrich, Pennsylvania.   GE Transportation is an American manufacturing giant. The  organization manufactures equipment for the railroad, marine, mining,  drilling, and energy generation industries in Erie County.   Major leaguers have been swinging our fine Pennsylvania hardwoods,  thanks to Jefferson County company BWP Bats. BWP's slogan is ``Built  With Pride.''   Huntingdon County's Bonney Forge has a state-of-the-art forge  facility capable of manufacturing our entire line of forged steel  fittings and forged steel valve products since 1875.   DiamondBack Truck Covers is a company two Penn State students started  in their garage in 2003. They make heavy-duty, utility-oriented,  diamond plate aluminum truck bed covers for pickup trucks in  Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, in Centre County.   Domtar Paper Company in Elk County is the largest integrated producer  of uncoated freesheet paper in North America, and the second largest in  the world, based on production and capacity.   Pul-A-Pump of PA, Inc., in Potter County, manufactures portable pump  pulling machines for those in need of water well technology, with a  unique dual traction belt design that is second to none.   Whirley Industries Incorporated in Warren County designs, develops,  and produces products for the food and beverage industry.   Centre County also boasts many new rising stars in high-tech  industries, including KCF Technologies, a dynamic technology company  that develops and commercializes products for industry and the  military.   Mr. Speaker, this is just a sample of the manufacturers who employ  our friends, families, and neighbors in the Fifth Congressional  District of Pennsylvania. These companies, and many others, produce  quality, American-made products, and we could not be more proud to  celebrate them during ``Made in America Week.'' Congratulations, and  keep up the great work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the  Nutrition Subcommittee, I rise today to speak about an important  program that gives SNAP participants access to more fruits and  vegetables.   SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, helps provide  low-income families with the resources they need to consume more  nutritious food. The Agriculture Act of 2014 created the Food  Insecurity Nutrition Incentive program, or FINI, which provided $100  million to support produce incentive programs around the country for  SNAP participants.   This means SNAP benefits could be used at farmers' markets, grocery  stores, and other farmer-to-consumer retailers serving rural and urban  communities.   Mr. Speaker, the FINI program is successful in achieving the  established goal of encouraging SNAP households to consume fresh,  healthy produce. More than 74 percent of shoppers reported that they  were eating more produce.   As the Agriculture Committee works to develop the next farm bill, I  know the FINI program should be reauthorized. The benefits of this  program are twofold: it supports local American farmers and provides  more Americans with quality food. That is what I call made in America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m.  tomorrow.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 19, 2017, on page H6030, the following appeared: adjourns  to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
