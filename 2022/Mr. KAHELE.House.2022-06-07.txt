 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of the fiscal year 2022 Water Resources and  Development Act, legislation which will invest in America's ports,  harbors, and inland waterways, as well as build more climate-resilient  communities.   For the first time ever, WRDA includes Section 219 environmental  infrastructure projects for the State of Hawaii, which will ensure that  Maui, Kauai, Hawaii and Honolulu County are able to address wastewater  infrastructure and confront these challenges head-on today, because the  cost of waiting is too great.   This WRDA will also, for the first time ever, include a provision  that will enable NHOs, or Native Hawaiian Organizations, to waive local  cost-sharing requirements of up to $200,000 for critical environmental  projects, which will open the doors to new environmental restoration  projects and career opportunities in every county. This provision will  help to provide more parity between indigenous communities, and I  applaud its inclusion in this bill.   I am proud to support this bipartisan effort to invest in our ports  and harbors, build more resilient communities, and support our  indigenous brothers and sisters across the country.
