 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for yielding to me  the customary 30 minutes for debate.   This measure is a bipartisan bill that will help Americans receiving  support from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families find good- paying jobs.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are more than 6  million job openings in our country. That is the highest level recorded  since we started tracking this data, yet the share of Americans  participating in the workforce is at a four-decade low. Clearly, there  are underlying issues  [[Page H5060]]  that need to be addressed to get more people plugged into the  workforce.   For people looking for jobs, TANF serves as a lifeline. TANF is  administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and is  designed to help in-need families achieve self-sufficiency. Under the  program, States receive block grants to design and operate their own  programs to fulfill the goals of the TANF program.   It is important to note that States are at risk of financial penalty  if TANF participants receive more than a year of education or if States  have more than 30 percent of the State TANF caseload in education and  training programs. Due to these limits, States have largely abandoned  efforts to promote or support work in their TANF programs. This is  important to understand because one of the most effective ways to get  more people employed is through employer-driven on-the-job training.   Research has shown that, properly structured, these programs result  in better and more stable employment, especially for individuals who  are otherwise unlikely to find work.   Although the measure we are debating today does not address this  issue, this bill will help tip the scale back toward job-training  programs. H.R. 2842 establishes demonstration projects that combine  work, training, and support for hard-to-employ TANF recipients.   This bill provides a onetime appropriation of $100 million to  subsidize these programs. After the 12-month period, States are going  to be required to report to Congress on the effectiveness of  subsidizing wages in moving individuals receiving TANF into full-time  jobs.   Since we are talking about jobs, we need to recognize that we as an  institution have not provided the necessary resources to get people  back to work. If you were to ask any Member of this body to outline his  or her top priorities, I guarantee you that job creation would be  mentioned every single time. We all agree on the need, but from there,  the conversation stops. There are lots of proposals in Congress to  create jobs, but we have been unable to pass a large-scale, bipartisan  bill for quite some time. This really needs to change.    Given the legislation we are debating today, it is interesting to me  that President Donald John Trump's budget proposal cut workforce  training programs by 39 percent. Rather than present a jobs bill, he  has presented a plan that would actually stop helping people looking  for jobs. That, in my judgment, is penny-wise and pound-foolish. In  bringing forward this legislation, I think it is being made clear that  this body does not share that approach, but we need to do more than a  single, targeted bill.   Five months into the Trump administration, Republican leadership  still has not put forward a single large-scale piece of legislation to  create good-paying jobs or raise the wages of hardworking Americans,  but its leadership has rejected Democratic proposals out of hand.   We should be working every day on creating jobs and raising wages for  everyone everywhere in America. But instead of focusing on job  creation, Donald John Trump's budget request would destroy  approximately 1.4 million jobs.   His budget would eviscerate billions of dollars from critical job- creating investments in infrastructure and innovation, dismantle skills  training programs like the one we are discussing here today, ransack  education benefits, and leave our country in a weakened state. Instead  of bringing jobs back to communities that have fallen on hard times,  the budget walks away from them.   So, Mr. Speaker, I will leave it at this. The underlying measure we  are debating today is a good step forward. But one step is not nearly  enough. We need to do more, not less, to strengthen our communities and  help working families.   Just as I urge Donald John Trump to move past the campaign rhetoric  and get serious, I also urge this body to lead with more bipartisan  measures that will provide for necessary resources for those who need  them most.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is a distinguished member of the  Committee on Ways and Means.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the  underlying legislation, which includes my amendment expanding  apprenticeships for American workers.   I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  supporting this important effort in the Ways and Means Committee, and I  look forward to its passage.   We can all agree that helping people find long-term employment in a  high-demand industry is one of the best ways to ensure that everyone  has economic security. But technological advancements like automation  and artificial intelligence are dramatically shifting the way our  economy works, and these changes are only going to accelerate.   We cannot allow American workers to be left behind. Congress needs to  be forward looking, not reactive, in crafting policies that help  workers who are displaced from the workforce. I believe that means we  need a national  [[Page H5061]]  commitment to addressing the skills gap and mitigating disruption in an  evolving 21st century economy.   Apprenticeships and on-the-job training are an important part of that  equation. Apprenticeships can be an incredible opportunity for  businesses and workers alike.                                time  1245    They allow employers to build a pipeline of qualified workers while  equipping job seekers with the specific skills they need to find and  keep good-paying jobs.   Oftentimes, they provide skills that are portable and meaningful  anywhere in the country, giving workers more freedom to transfer  between companies and industries.   In my home State of Washington, investments and apprenticeships have  been shown to give a higher return on investment than any other job  training program, returning $23 for each dollar that is invested.   It is important to remember these investments not only have an  incredible impact on our economy but also on people's lives by helping  them become more self-sufficient through specialized training and  increased earning potential.   I appreciate my colleague's bipartisan support for this amendment,  and I urge its passage in the underlying legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   President Donald John Trump campaigned on the promise of job  creation; however, his budget paints a very different picture. It cuts  job training programs by 39 percent, and its radical spending cuts  would lead to massive job losses.   In this body, we talk a lot about jobs, but we are 6 months into this  Congress and have failed to pass any major job creation bills. While  the bipartisan legislation before us today is, indeed, as my good  friend points out, a step in the right direction, we can and we must do  more.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say that I have an amendment in my  hand that will generate thousands of American jobs. If we defeat the  previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to  bring up Representative DeFazio's bipartisan bill, H.R. 2510, the Water  Quality Protection and Job Creation Act. This bill will create  thousands of new American jobs through increased investment in our  Nation's wastewater infrastructure. Here is a chance to take today's  momentum a step further and consider Mr. DeFazio's bill in addition to  the bipartisan TANF bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my very good friend, the distinguished ranking  member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee who will  discuss our proposal.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity.  As he noted, the President has talked and tweeted incessantly about  creating jobs and infrastructure investment, but, unfortunately, the  only substantive proposal to come out of the White House that relates  to infrastructure, infrastructure investment, and jobs is in his  budget, and it actually reduces Federal investment in infrastructure,  which would basically eliminate jobs.   So I mean, the bill before us today, bipartisan bill on  apprenticeships is great, but you have got to apprentice for something  that is real: a job in the end, construction.   America is falling apart, and, right now, we have nothing but  rhetoric coming out of the White House, and now ideology. They are  talking about privatizing all of the infrastructure in the United  States so that you will pay tolls everywhere you go, and, you know,  they call it asset recycling. They have come up with a catchy new name.  That has been floated, but they haven't put any substance behind it.   So this amendment would allow the House to debate and pass H.R. 2510,  Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. This bill would  provide $25 billion in direct infrastructure investment over the next 5  years to address America's crumbling wastewater infrastructure and  local water quality challenges.    The state of our water infrastructure, according to the American  Society of Engineers' report card of 2017, is a D-plus. Meanwhile,  municipalities across the country have a backlog of more than $40  billion--B, billion--in clean water infrastructure projects, and,  according to the EPA, communities need close to $300 billion over the  next 20 years to bring their systems into a state of good repair.   It is clear that we cannot continue to neglect the serious needs of  our aging water infrastructure. As these systems fail and degrade, they  pose a risk to the health and safety of our citizens and obviously the  environment.   I know the President promised, during his campaign, to make clean  water a priority. I agree with that. He promised to triple funding for  State revolving loan fund programs to help States and local governments  upgrade critical drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.   Well, here is a chance to deliver on that promise. H.R. 2510 does  exactly that. It triples investment in America's crumbling water  infrastructure.   I was a county commissioner at a time when the Federal Government was  a good partner, and, in those days, they put up 85 percent of the cost  of our wastewater system. We put up the other 15. You know, this  could--by renewing this legislation and a commitment to the State  revolving loan fund programs and adding in a grant component for lower  income areas, that could, you know, be a great step in terms of Federal  partnership and creating actual jobs for the apprentices that this bill  wants to create.   There is widespread support for this legislation. I include in the  Record letters of endorsement from 30 separate groups.                                     Ohio Environmental Council,                                                       Columbus, OH.      Hon. Garret Graves,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Napolitano: On       behalf of the Ohio Environmental Council, I am writing to       enthusiastically support the Water Quality  [[Page H5062]]       Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. This bill bolsters       the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) by authorizing $20       billion over five years for loans to improve wastewater       infrastructure in local communities. It also provides crucial       additional funding to help states control water pollution and       address challenges from outdated sewer systems.        The need for this bill has never been greater as the nation       faces a $40 billion backlog of clean water infrastructure       projects, with cities and towns needing $300 billion over 20       years to update their water systems. In Ohio, the American       Society of Civil Engineers found our state needs a total       $14.58 billion for wastewater improvements. The Clean Water       SRF is an essential resource to help meet this need.        The Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) program,       Ohio's Clean Water SRF, continues to provide fundamental       capacity to improve water quality for Ohio communities and       residents. The program includes several different loan       options that help both cities and rural communities prevent       water pollution. This includes funding to upgrade and replace       Home Sewage Treatment Systems (HSTS), as well as assistance       for wastewater collection and treatment, stormwater       activities, and efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution.       Interest from the WPCLF program funds the preservation and       restoration of aquatic habitat to counter the loss of natural       systems that helped maintain the health of Ohio's water       resources.        Since its inception the Clean Water SRF has provided $7.2       billion serving 621 villages, cities, counties and sewer       districts helping to curb pollution while providing quality       jobs. To ensure this program's continuing success and help       Ohio address our water infrastructure needs, I urge your       support for the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act       of 2017.            Sincerely,                                             Heather Taylor-Miesle,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                           California Association of                                             Sanitation Agencies,                                                     Sacramento, CA.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Ranking Member, Committee on Public Works and Transportation,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Members DeFazio and Napolitano: The California       Association of Sanitation Agencies (CASA) is pleased to       support your efforts to address the water infrastructure       funding gap and specifically the introduction of the Water       Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. For 60       years, CASA has been the leading voice for California's       public wastewater agencies on regulatory, legislative and       legal issues.        CASA agencies are faced with mounting challenges of aging       infrastructure, growing demands from increasing population,       and emerging challenges from changing climate conditions.       Confronted with these realities, there is clear demand for       increased infrastructure investment, including the need to       invest in water recycling infrastructure and clean energy       facilities derived from the wastewater treatment process.        Under your legislation, the Clean Water State Revolving       Fund (SRF) would be renewed at $20 billion over five years.       This authorization represents a critical down payment toward       a robust federal commitment to the nation's water       infrastructure needs. According to the report, the financial       burden to simply meet water quality and water-related public       health goals of the Clean Water Act (CWA) in California was       in excess of $26 billion in 2012. Due to drought conditions       and other strains on our wastewater systems, that figure has       only gone up over the last 5 years. Nationwide the demand for       all clean and drinking water infrastructure needs has been       estimated at more than $300 billion over the next two       decades. CASA also supports the bill's provisions to       authorize grant assistance for water recycling as well as the       programs to address stormwater flows and combined sewer       overflows. In California, the ability to construct water-      recycling projects is vital to a safe and reliable water       supply and to ensure protection of our ecosystems.        As you and your colleagues work to develop a comprehensive       water infrastructure policy for the nation, we look forward       to working with you to advance meaningful federal assistance       programs.                                                      Adam D. Link,      Director of Government Affairs.                                   ____                              American Society of Civil Engineers,                                        Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeFazio: The American Society of Civil       Engineers (ASCE) supports The Water Quality Protection and       Job Creation Act of 2017 to provide needed funds to fix the       nation's wastewater treatment systems.        The nation's wastewater treatment systems are the most       basic and critical infrastructure systems for protecting       public health and the environment, but are badly underfunded.       Nearly 240 million Americans--76% of the population--rely on       the nation's 14,748 treatment plants for wastewater       sanitation. By 2032 it is expected that 56 million more       people will connect to centralized treatment plants, rather       than private septic systems--a 23% increase in demand. In the       U.S., there are over 800,000 miles of public sewers and       500,000 miles of private lateral sewers connecting private       property to public sewer lines. Each of these conveyance       systems is susceptible to structural failure, blockages, and       overflows.        In March, ASCE released its 2017 Infrastructure Report       Card, which graded our nation's wastewater systems a ``D+.''       Many wastewater systems are aging and it's expected that over       the next two decades, requiring at least $271 billion to meet       current and future demands.        This legislation is an important step towards meeting our       country's wastewater investment needs and improving our       wastewater systems.            Sincerely,                                                 Brian Pallasch,                                       Managing Director, Government      Relations & Infrastructure Initiatives.                                   ____                                     Water Infrastructure Network,                                                        May 2, 2017.      Re WIN's Strong Support for the Water Quality Improvement and           Job Creation Act.       Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeFazio: The Water Infrastructure       Network (WIN), a coalition of the nation's leading       construction, engineering, municipal, conservation, public       works, labor and manufacturing organizations, strongly       supports the Water Quality Improvement and Job Creation Act.       WIN also commends your continued work to reauthorize our       nation's critical water infrastructure funding programs. The       United States is facing a water infrastructure funding crisis       as documented in recent reports by CBO, EPA and WIN pointing       to a shortfall in funding for clean water infrastructure that       exceeds $300 Billion over the next two decades. The Clean       Water Act was last reauthorized in 1987 and WIN believes that       consideration and passage of legislation providing       substantial increased investment in America's Water       Infrastructure is long overdue.        WIN is encouraged by the growing bipartisan support in       Congress for investing in our nation's clean water       infrastructure. The FY '17 Appropriation Package released       this week calls for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to       be funded at $1.39 Billion--a $414 M increase over the       original FY '17 funding request. The Trump Administration has       also made investments in our nation's water infrastructure a       top priority for the Environmental Protection Agency,       requesting increases in funding for both the Clean Water Act       and Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Funds in their       2018 Budget.        WIN believes Congress must seize this unique opportunity       make long overdue investments in our nation's critical water       infrastructure. Investments in water infrastructure make       eminent economic and environmental sense for our nation. WIN       is committed to working with you and the bipartisan       leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee       to advance water infrastructure funding legislation in the       First Session of the 115th Congress.            Sincerely,          The WIN Executive Committee--American Council of             Engineering Companies (ACEC), American Public Works             Association (APWA), American Society of Civil Engineers             (ASCE), Associated General Contractors of America             (AGCA), International Union of Operating Engineers             (IUOE), Laborers International Union of North America             (LIUNA), National Association of Clean Water Agencies             (NACWA), National Rural Water Association (NRWA),             United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (The             United), and the Vinyl Institute (VI).                                   ____                                  Oregon Water Resources Congress,                                         Salem, Oregon, May 3, 2017.      Re The Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017.       Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Washington, DC.        Representative DeFazio: On behalf of the Oregon Water       Resources Congress (OWRC), I am writing to express our       support of Congressman DeFazio's efforts to reauthorize the       Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and tackle the water       quality financing needs in the country under The Water       Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. The CWSRF is       an effective program that addresses critical water       infrastructure needs while benefitting the environment, local       communities, and the economy.        OWRC was established in 1912 as a trade association to       support the protection of water rights and promote the wise       stewardship of water resources statewide. OWRC members are       local governmental entities, which include irrigation       districts, water control districts, drainage districts, water       improvement districts, and other agricultural water suppliers       that deliver water to roughly 1/3 of all irrigated land in       Oregon. These water stewards operate complex water management       systems, including water supply reservoirs, canals,       pipelines, and hydropower facilities that serve a diverse set       of farmers, ranchers, and other water users contributing to       the local and global economy.  [[Page H5063]]         The CWSRF is a perfect example of the type of program that       should be reauthorized because it creates jobs while       benefitting the environment, and is an efficient return on       taxpayer investment. CWSRF funded projects provide family       wage jobs in construction and professional services industry       that are a crucial component to economic recovery in Oregon       and other states. Moreover, as a loan program, it is a wise       investment that allows local communities to leverage their       limited resources and address critical infrastructure needs       that would otherwise be unmet.        OWRC was very pleased to see the passage of the Water       Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN) by       Congress in December last year. An integral piece of the       funding puzzle for our member districts was reinstated by       this act, irrigation district eligibility for principal       forgiveness. The CWSRF is often an integral part of an       overall package of state, federal and local funding that       necessitates a stronger level of assurance that loan funds       will be available for planned water infrastructure projects.       Irrigation districts are often located in rural communities       and have a small number of farmers with limited capacity to       take on loan debt. Even a small reduction in the principal       repayment obligations can make the difference in whether or       not a district can move forward with a project.        The CWSRF program is an important tool utilized by OWRC       members across Oregon, and we applaud this effort by       Congressman DeFazio to reauthorize this key program. OWRC       looks forward to working with the Committee and this Congress       as the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017       moves forward.            Sincerely,                                                    April Snell,                                                 Executive Director,      Oregon Water Resources Congress.                                   ____                                              Southern Environmental                                                      Law Center,                                        Washington, DC, May 3, 2017.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jimmy Duncan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace F. Napolitano,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and the           Environment, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives DeFazio, Napolitano and Duncan:       Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) writes in support of       the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. At       a time when much of our nation's infrastructure is at a       breaking point, bolstering our national infrastructure funds       is more critical than ever. Thank you for your leadership on       clean water infrastructure investment.        This bill authorizes $20 billion in Federal grants over       five years to capitalize Clean Water State Revolving Funds       (Clean Water SRF). Across the country, many communities are       struggling with how to pay for needed investments and       upgrades to infrastructure that protects clean water and       public health. According to the 2012 Clean Watersheds Needs       Survey, municipalities need close to $300 billion in       investment over the next 20 years to bring their wastewater       and stormwater management infrastructure to a state of good       repair.        The Clean Water SRF provides a critical source of funding       to states to address water infrastructure needs and reduce       pollution from stormwater and wastewater across the country.       This legislation will help communities address the estimated       $40 billion backlog in clean water infrastructure projects.       Additionally, this investment in our water infrastructure is       good for the economy. The report Water Works: Rebuilding       infrastructure, Creating Jobs and Greening the Environment       shows that investments in our water infrastructure, including       green infrastructure, would conservatively yield 1.9 million       American jobs and add $265 billion to the economy.        This legislation authorizes $20 billion in Federal grants       over five years for the Clean Water SRF to provide low-      interest loans and additional loan subsidizations to       communities for wastewater infrastructure. We are supportive       of efforts to increase the resiliency of treatment works to       natural or man-made disasters. In the face of a changing       climate, resiliency of our nation's infrastructure is       increasingly important.        Also, this legislation authorizes $2.5 billion over five       years for grants to address combined sewer overflows (CSOs)       and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and recapture and reuse       of municipal stormwater. CSOs and SSOs pose a significant       health and safety risk to communities and can damage local       economies that are dependent on clean water and tourism. We       are supportive of funds to address this ongoing problem that       can cost communities significant resources to address.        Economists estimate that between 20,000 and 26,600       construction, engineering, and manufacturing jobs are created       for every billion dollars of federal investment in water       infrastructure. Investments in the Clean Water SRFs are       critical to protect public health, promote job creation, and       restore clean water in our rivers, lakes, and streams.        SELC appreciates your leadership on clean water       infrastructure investment and your continued work on reducing       pollution related to aging and inadequately funded       infrastructure.            Sincerely,                                              Navis A. Bermudez,                                        Deputy Legislative Director,                                 Southern Environmental Law Center.    Mr. DeFAZIO. And according to the National Utility Contractors  Association, every billion dollars invested in our Nation's water  infrastructure creates or sustains 27,000 real jobs in the private  sector. That means that the $20 billion in Federal investment in the  Clean Water State Revolving Fund, including H.R. 2510, would create or  sustain approximately 540,000 jobs.   This is real. It is real. Real jobs for real people and real  improvements in the infrastructure of this country. This would be a  great step forward, and I urge that my colleagues adopt the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I first want to address my good friend about the previous question  and the fact that it has not gone through the process. I will just  remind him that the chatter in Washington today is about a healthcare  measure that hasn't gone through the process, at least to the extent  that most of us would all want.   I also have great respect for my good friend from Oklahoma, and I  know he will see and get a chance to talk with President Donald John  Trump. I am not likely to.                                time  1300    But I would ask him to tell him when he sees him for me that I came  here in 1993, and there were 14,000 bridges in need of repair in  America, and last year the statistics from the society that does that  analysis showed that there are 54,000 bridges in need of repair in this  country. The point that I wish to make is that we need a serious  substantial infrastructure measure.   Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about jobs in this Chamber. I was at a  forum on Saturday, and someone mentioned: My governor's mantra is  ``jobs, jobs, jobs.'' And that person said: Well, he must mean that you  have to have three jobs in order to get by.   I am glad that we are here today considering a bill that will help  Americans in search of work to find a good-paying position that will  help them support themselves and their families. We have a lot of  issues facing us, and this bipartisan legislation is just one tiny step  forward in the right direction. I hope this measure translates into  more bipartisan bills.   Too often, from healthcare reform, tax reform--footnote right there.  My friend mentions that we will likely see a tax reform measure  sometime soon. I hope that it doesn't revert to trickle down. We have  seen trickle down. It did not work, and I hope we don't do that again.   We have an opportunity on other issues, and in many respects the  majority has shut out the minority from the process, just like what has  happened until today, at least, in the other body with reference to  healthcare.   The bills we have debated and even passed are projected to eliminate  millions of jobs. Even as we talk about job creation, my friends across  the aisle too frequently turn around and champion measures that would  do just the opposite. There is so much room for cooperation in this  area, yet time and time again we are kept out of the process, and the  results speak for themselves. For the sake of our country, this needs  to change.   Even though this is a bipartisan bill, it also serves as an example  of what I mean. I was disappointed that my Republican colleagues in the  Rules Committee blocked yesterday six germane amendments to this bill.  It is a sympton of the closed process. When we prevent germane  amendments from even being debated by the House, it does us all a  disservice, yet my friends across the aisle do it again and again.   Mr. Speaker, I will close with this: President Obama is credited for  creating 11.3 million jobs in our country. The economy added jobs for  75 straight months, and very fortunately that carryover for the last 5  months has continued.   While President Donald John Trump makes untenable pledge after  pledge, I watched every word of his speech last night in Iowa, and all  I heard was platitudes. I didn't hear anything about substance. And it  seemed like a road test for some new ideas. He makes these untenable  pledges, including a very humble promise to be--and I quote him--``the  greatest jobs producer that God ever created.''   The record is clear, the Democratic Party is, has been, and will be  the party of job creation, and is ready to work with my Republican  colleagues to continue significant job creation in this country.   So I will ask my friends across the aisle, let us continue the trend  of the past few years and work together to produce bipartisan measures  that will benefit the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
