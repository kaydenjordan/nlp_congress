 Madam Speaker, all across the country, including my  home district in Ventura County in California, Americans continue to  feel the overwhelming burden of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.   I regularly hear from small businesses fighting to keep their doors  open; from parents struggling to put food on the table after losing  their jobs; and from people who live in fear of being evicted from  their homes. It is imperative that we invest in our communities and  help our neighbors now.   With money specifically dedicated for vaccine development and  distributions, testing, the production of PPE, more relief for small  businesses, and additional aid for the unemployed and struggling  families, passage of the American Rescue Plan is critical to ensuring  economic recovery, getting our kids back to school, providing relief to  small businesses and, most importantly, saving lives.   My Republican colleagues went big when it came to massive corporate  tax cuts. It would be incomprehensible that we nickel and dime working  families and small businesses during the worst pandemic in over a  century.                            ____________________
