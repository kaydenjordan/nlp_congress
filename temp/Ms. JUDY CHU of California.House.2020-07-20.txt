 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  this amendment, which includes the text of my legislation, the San  Gabriel Mountains Foothills and Rivers Protection Act.   The San Gabriel Mountains provide 30 percent of southern California's  water, comprise 70 percent of L.A. County's open space, and are easily  accessible to more than 15 million Americans. But still, the L.A.  County region is amongst the most park-poor in the country, with too  many communities lacking access to outdoor recreation opportunities in  their own neighborhoods.    By creating the San Gabriel Mountains national recreation area by  building on the progress made by the establishment of the San Gabriel  Mountains National Monument, by designating new wilderness and wild  rivers, this amendment will provide outdoor recreation opportunities to  millions, improving their health and well-being.   I urge my colleagues to join me in strong support of this amendment.
