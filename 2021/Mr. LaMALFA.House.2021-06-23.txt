 Mr. Speaker, access to our public lands is being cut off  by road closures throughout the national forests in Region 5. The U.S.  Forest Service is citing public safety concerns due to hazardous trees  from past fire seasons.   But this blocks the public from accessing the public lands, and it  also prevents those roads being used as evacuation routes or access  points to fight fires in coming seasons.   One road that has been closed, the Greyback Road in the Rogue River- Siskiyou National Forest in northern California, is a California Office  of Emergency Services designated evacuation route for the town of Happy  Camp, California. If Highway 96 is blocked, this is the only other way  out of Happy Camp.   Litigation is preventing the U.S. Forest Service from working with  private-sector partners to clean up the forests. For example, in the  Mendocino National Forest, 300,000 acres burned in 2018. The Forest  Service wanted to do 4,700 acres, a tiny 2 percent of that, yet it was  blocked by a lawsuit from doing that cleanup work.   Without offering the salvage timber sale, that means it is going to  cost taxpayers $5.5 million instead of being able to recover some of  the money.   This litigation harms the public by leaving hazardous trees and snags  out in the forest, which create safety issues and become fuel for the  next fire season.   We must reform NEPA and ESA.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about infrastructure around  here. The American people wonder what is that actually going to mean  coming out here. Well, it really needs to be focused on things that we  are short of, but would be fixing our highways, fixing our bridges,  things like that.   In California, where I come from, the subject is water. Water storage  is desperately needed. We have had some years of drought, but we also  have not added to our water storage in a significant way in 40 years.  With a growing population, there is a growing need.   For example, what does that mean to all Americans, not just  Californians?   The food we eat. The top crops in California that are grown  approximately 99 percent or more in California are almonds, artichokes,  celery, figs, garlic, raisins, kiwis, honeydew, nectarines, olives,  cling peaches, pistachios, plums, sweet rice, and walnuts.   If California is not growing those items, where do we intend to get  those?                                time  1915    For almonds especially, California grows all the domestic production  Americans use and 77 percent of the global production. We also produce  92 percent of the Nation's avocados, grapes, lemons, and mandarins. No  avocados? No guacamole.   What are we going to do, import all this? We have to be producing  this stuff in the State of California.   What does that mean? We need to invest in water infrastructure. We  can be raising Shasta Dam, which is a Federal project. Eighteen feet  yields over 600,000 new acre-feet for these crops. We could be building  Sites Reservoir. Both of these have been invested in slightly by the  Federal Government lately. We need to do much more because we are the  leading State in so  [[Page H3078]]  many of the important products that Americans actually use.   So, we have to talk a lot more about water storage.
