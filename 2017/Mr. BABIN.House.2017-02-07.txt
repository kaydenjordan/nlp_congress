 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Byrne) for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I represent a part of the country that is the economic  engine of not only Texas but our entire Nation. My Houston area  district and the surrounding districts are responsible for some of the  strongest economic growth in our entire country. These are good, well- paying jobs. There are few places in the Nation where you can graduate  from high school, get some trade school certifications, and then be  earning close to six figures just a couple of years out of high school.   You can do that in my district, where the petrochemical plants are  thriving because of the low cost of crude oil and natural gas.  Manufacturing is coming back and growing strongly in the petrochemical  sector. Over $150 billion is being invested by American chemical  countries across the Nation, with the largest concentration in the  Houston area.   The previous administration took numerous steps to stop the oil and  gas boom, and the Bureau of Land Management rule that was published in  the waning days of the Obama administration was an example of one such  overreach. This ill-advised rule was aimed at removing States and  localities from  [[Page H1026]]  the BLM decisionmaking process and centralizing decisionmaking by a few  political appointees here in Washington, D.C.   This move simply undermines local communities and States. It  undermines our ability to develop oil and gas resources on public  lands. It threatens American jobs.   I call on my colleagues to put American manufacturing first. A vote  for this bill today is a vote for American manufacturing jobs, many of  them high-paying, blue-collar jobs and many of them union jobs across  America's petroleum and chemical plants.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support and vote for this bill.
