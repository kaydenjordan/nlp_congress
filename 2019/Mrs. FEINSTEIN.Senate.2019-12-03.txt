 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Sarah Pitlyk to the United States District Court for the  Eastern District of Missouri. Ms. Pitlyk's record is extremely  troubling and raises a number of questions about her ability to be a  fair and impartial judge.   Ms. Pitlyk was deemed by the American Bar Association to be Not  Qualified, one of only 3 percent of people reviewed by the Bar over the  past 3 years. This is the first that I have had occasion to review in  total. A district court judge, as you well know, must hit the ground  running. Ms. Pitlyk's lack of practical knowledge and experience would  significantly disadvantage the litigants appearing before her.   I also want to acknowledge the highly unusual nature of a ``Not  Qualified'' rating by the Bar; 97 percent of President Trump's nominees  have been rated at least ``Qualified'' by the American Bar Association.  This means that Ms. Pitlyk falls in the small minority--just 3  percent--of candidates deemed not qualified by the American Bar  Association. This shows how rare that rating is. The ABA has been  reviewing the qualifications, as you already know, of judicial nominees  since 1989. They know what they are doing, and those of us on the  committee take their evaluations very seriously.  [[Page S6801]]    Next, I want to discuss Ms. Pitlyk's record opposing women's  reproductive rights and limiting access to healthcare. Ms. Pitlyk  defended a State law banning abortion at 6 weeks, she opposed the  Affordable Care Act's coverage for contraception, and she defended  President Trump's Title X gag rule.   The Trump administration's Title X gag rule prohibits referrals for  abortion care and imposes onerous requirements on abortion clinics,  among other things. The rule effectively pushed Planned Parenthood out  of the Title X program, curtailing access to healthcare for millions of  low-income women and families.   Ms. Pitlyk has also filed multiple legal briefs that contain  misinformation. Last year, she argued without any credible evidence  that ``racism plays a profound role in the delivery of abortion  services.''   In another case, Ms. Pitlyk claimed--again without evidence--that in- vitro fertilization leads to ``higher rates of birth defects, genetic  disorders, and other anomalies.''   I think it is disqualifying for any judicial nominee to make  unfounded and unsupported claims, especially in a court of law.   Ms. Pitlyk has also made statements in her personal capacity opposing  access to healthcare. Just last year, she called the Supreme Court's  decision upholding the Affordable Care Act ``unprincipled.'' Earlier  this year, she said that the Supreme Court's reproductive healthcare  cases have ``gross defects.''   These statements and Ms. Pitlyk's legal work raise serious concerns  about her ability to apply the Supreme Court's important precedents  fairly and impartially. I am deeply troubled by her record, her lack of  experience, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing her  nomination.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from Politico  and a letter from the American Bar Association dated September 24,  2019, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the POLITICO, Nov. 19, 2019]               Susan Collins to Oppose Trump Judicial Nominee                            (By Marianne Levine)         Sen. Susan Collins will oppose Sarah Pitlyk, President       Donald Trump's nominee to become a federal judge for the       Eastern District of Missouri.        In a statement to POLITICO, the Maine Republican voiced       concern about Pitlyk's lack of trial experience, as well as       her stance on abortion given previous comments on gestational       surrogacy and past legal work.        ``Her lack of trial experience would make it difficult for       her to transition to a district court judgeship,'' Collins       said.        She also cited Pitlyk's comments in a brief she co-wrote in       2017 as a lawyer for the Thomas More Society, an anti-      abortion law firm. The brief stated surrogacy leads to the       ``diminished respect for motherhood and the unique mother-      child bond; exploitation of women; commodification of       gestation and of children themselves; and weakening of       appropriate social mores against eugenic abortion.''        Collins said Pitlyk is entitled to her personal views on       abortion, but she questioned ``given her pattern of strident       advocacy, whether she could put aside her personal views on       these matters.''        The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Pitlyk's nomination       along party lines in October, and a floor vote is likely in       the coming weeks.        While Collins supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to       the Supreme Court, she has voted against several Trump       judicial nominees this year.        In addition to Pitlyk, Collins opposed Steven Menashi's       nomination to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Chad       Readler's nomination to the 6th Circuit, Howard Nielson for       the District of Utah, Matthew Kacsmaryk for the Northern       District of Texas and Jeffrey Brown for the Southern District       of Texas.        All of those judges were confirmed by the GOP-controlled       Senate.                                   ____           American Bar Association, Standing Committee on the             Federal Judiciary,                                  Columbia, SC, September 24, 2019.      Re Nomination of Sarah E. Pitlyk to the United States           District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.       Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Feinstein: The ABA       Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has received a       full report on Sarah E. Pitlyk and a supplemental report by a       second reviewer. The Committee has unanimously determined       that Ms. Pitlyk is ``Not Qualified'' for the position of       federal district judge. I write to offer a brief explanation       of this rating. Our rating is based on the Standing       Committee's criteria as set forth in the Backgrounder. The       Standing Committee believes that Ms. Pitlyk does not have the       requisite trial or litigation experience or its equivalent. I       would like to point out that based on its peer review, the       Standing Committee's rating does not rest on questions about       Ms. Pitlyk's temperament or integrity.        The Backgrounder that provides guidance to our evaluation       process explains that a nominee to the federal bench       ordinarily should have a minimum of 12 years' experience in       the practice of law. This 12-year experience guideline is       neither a hard-and-fast rule nor an automatic disqualifier.       The Standing Committee's criteria provide that a nominee's       limited experience may be offset by the breadth and depth of       the nominee's experience over the course of his or her       career. Nominees with fewer than 12 years at the bar (as is       the case with Ms. Pitlyk, both due to the calendar and       periods of inactive status), but with substantial trial or       courtroom experience and/or compensating accomplishments in       the field of law, can and have been found qualified by our       Committee. However, Ms. Pitlyk's experience to date has a       very substantial gap, namely the absence of any trial or even       real litigation experience. Ms. Pitlyk has never tried a case       as lead or co-counsel, whether civil or criminal. She has       never examined a witness. Though Ms. Pitlyk has argued one       case in a court of appeals, she has not taken a deposition.       She has not argued any motion in a state or federal trial       court. She has never picked a jury. She has never       participated at any stage of a criminal matter.        The Standing Committee believes that a nominee should be       professionally competent to manage and resolve the many       diverse matters facing a federal judge on a daily basis. The       accumulation of experience and legal knowledge that is       acquired by a practicing lawyer both inside and outside of       the courtroom prepares a lawyer over time to handle a broad       spectrum of legal issues in a wide variety of subject matters       and to manage a courtroom over which he or she will preside       as a judge. The judicial system, the public, the trial bar,       and the nominee are not well served by appointing to the       bench a lawyer who, despite great intelligence, high       character, and experience researching and writing briefs,       lacks adequate trial court or equivalent experience.        While we respect the clerkship for which the nominee served       after graduation from law school, her legal practice to date       does not compensate for the short time the nominee has       actually practiced law and her lack of litigation, trial, and       courtroom experience. It is the Standing Committee's judgment       that Ms. Pitlyk does not meet the minimum professional       competence standard necessary to perform the responsibilities       required by the high office of a federal district court       judge.        Thank you for the opportunity to explain our rating to you.            Very truly yours,                                                William C. Hubbard.     Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
