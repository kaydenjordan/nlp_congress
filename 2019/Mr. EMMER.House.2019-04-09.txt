 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Mucaad  Hussein Abdalla, known by his friends and family as Siraaj.   Last month, a tragic incident took the lives of 157 individuals when  an airplane crashed in Ethiopia. This unfortunate event took the lives  of eight Americans, and one of those individuals was Mucaad Hussein  Abdalla.   Mucaad was a member of our community. Growing up in St. Cloud,  Minnesota, he graduated from St. Cloud Apollo High School and began a  career as a truck driver.   To his friends and family, Mucaad was simply known by his nickname,  Siraaj, meaning a light or a lamp. He brought laughter, joy, and light  to those around him.   We extend our most sincere condolences to his family and loved ones  for their loss.       Thanking KoriAnn Carter and the United Way of Central Minnesota     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize community resource  navigator KoriAnn Carter and the United Way of Central Minnesota for  working together on a pilot program to assist students and families at  Lincoln Elementary School with food, housing assistance, mentoring, and  after-school programs.   In addition, I want to recognize the work KoriAnn does through a  program called Girls On Arise To Succeed in partnership with the  Roosevelt Boys & Girls Club, McKinley Area Learning Center, and  CentraCare Health, which brings young girls together to discuss  important life topics and provide guidance.   For young women encountering family issues, experiencing  homelessness, or struggling with mental health issues, this group gives  them a space to talk to adults who care. Girls between 12 and 18 can  participate in one of the girls groups where they learn lessons in  healthy habits, the importance of education, how your current actions  impact your future choices, leadership skills, goal setting, and  gratitude.   These groups have transformed students throughout the St. Cloud area,  giving them an avenue to succeed as well as find community and  fellowship.   I thank KoriAnn and all the partners who make this possible. Their  work to foster the next generation of leaders makes our corner of the  world a better place.                         Congratulating St. Cloud VA     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the St. Cloud VA  for being one of only 18 hospitals nationwide to be selected to  participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs' efforts to establish  the highest level of care for our military veterans.   Our veterans and our community rely on the St. Cloud VA to provide  the highest level of care possible already. So to those of us in the  community, it comes as no surprise that our VA will now help lead the  Nation and the VA system to help establish these standards.   The selection is a great honor and testament to everyone who makes  the St. Cloud VA the success it is today. The opportunity to lead our  VA system to the highest standard of care for our Nation's heroes is  indeed a high calling.   Congratulations to the St. Cloud VA, and good luck in your mission.                            ____________________
