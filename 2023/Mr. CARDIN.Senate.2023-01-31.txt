 Madam President, I rise today, on the eve of the second  anniversary of the military coup in Burma, to introduce a resolution  marking the occasion--and the terrible 2 years that the people of Burma  have had to suffer since then. I am proud to introduce this resolution  today alongside my colleagues Senators Young, Merkley, and Collins.   The resolution condemns the illegitimate Burmese military coup and  calls for an immediate return to democratic governance grounded in  respect for civil liberties. Demonstrating our support for the Burmese  people is more important than ever, as the human rights situation in  Burma threatens to deteriorate even further.   Tomorrow marks 2 years since the Burmese military overthrew the  democratically elected Government in Burma, on the eve of what was to  have been the convening of the Parliament that was elected on November  8, 2020, and installed a repressive, authoritarian regime.   Since February 1, 2021, the Burmese military has reversed years of  uneven but generally positive democratic reform. The military has  engaged in mass atrocities, including by detaining over 13,000 people  for exercising basic freedoms and killing over 2,800 civilians,  including children. Today, over 17 million people in Burma are in need  of humanitarian aid, and 1.5 million people remain internally displaced  due to the ongoing violence and instability fostered by the military.   I would note that it is the same military officers now running the  country who were implicated in the genocide waged against the Rohingya  people, an assault that was recognized by the Secretary of State on  March 21, 2022, only the eighth such determination since the Holocaust.  The Burmese military continues to systemically target its most  vulnerable people, including women, children, and ethnic and religious  minorities. The junta also continues to silence activists and  opposition parties, most recently illustrated by the 33-year prison  sentence handed down to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi after a  series of sham trials.   Today, we honor those lives we have lost due to the junta's violent  repression and calls upon the Burmese military to end its senseless  killing of its own people.   The U.S. Senate fully stands behind those peacefully protesting for  their  [[Page S177]]  rights to freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. We also remain  committed to free and fair elections in Burma and the peaceful and  expedient transition to a civilian-led government. The United States  and the international community must hold accountable human rights  violators for their actions. This resolution calls on the President to  impose targeted sanctions and restrictions on those responsible for the  February 2021 coup and human rights abuses in Burma, including through  the bipartisan BURMA Act of 2022, which I was proud to have led, and  which was enacted as part of the NDAA in December.   While the February 2021 coup represents a major step backwards, the  United States remains steadfast in support of a free and prosperous  future for Burma. This resolution, which I am proud to introduce today,  will reaffirm the United States' solidarity with the Burmese people in  their quest for sustainable peace and democracy.   I would invite my colleagues to cosponsor the resolution, and I look  forward to early action in the Foreign Relations Committee and by the  full Senate.                            ____________________
