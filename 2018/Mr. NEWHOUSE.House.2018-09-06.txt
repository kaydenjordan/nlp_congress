 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kennewick Police  Chief Kenneth Hohenberg for 40 years of service to the Kennewick Police  Department.   Chief Hohenberg began his career as an officer at age 22, making him  the city's longest serving employee. He rose quickly through the ranks.  He served on patrol, both as a motorcycle cop and a DARE officer, a  sergeant, a lieutenant, and then captain. He attended the FBI National  Academy, an honor few police officers receive, and was named chief in  2003.   Not only is Chief Hohenberg one of the most respected police chiefs  in the State, but he is also a widely admired member of our community.  He has been named Benton-Franklin United Way Volunteer of the Year,  Kennewick Man of the Year, and Tri-Citian of the Year.   In central Washington, we know him as a man who is constantly looking  for opportunities to help and always willing to serve in and out of the  police department.   I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Chief Ken Hohenberg for  his tremendous service to the city of Kennewick and to Washington's  Fourth Congressional District.                          Congratulating Rowdy Barry     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Rowdy Barry,  Kennewick's own professional bullfighter, on a successful 33-year  career.   Rowdy grew up around rodeos and has been bullfighting rodeos of all  sizes since he was 18 years old. Putting himself between bulls and bull  riders requires a true dedication to the sport. Rowdy sacrificed his  time, as well as several injuries and broken bones, to keep riders safe  and to provide a few additional laughs for the audience. On September  15, Rowdy will be hanging up his bullfighting hat for good at the  Othello Rodeo.   Earlier this year, he was inducted into both the Kennewick Rodeo and  Omak Stampede Halls of Fame. The Walla Walla Frontier Days posters  honored him with some of his own artwork.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Rowdy  on a career that will not be forgotten in central Washington. I wish  him the best in his future.                          Congratulating James Webb     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize James Webb, a  Yakima native, for receiving the prestigious Louis H. Bauer Founders  Award by the Aerospace Medical Association this year.   It is not every day that a man born and raised in central Washington  is awarded the Aerospace Medical Association's highest honor, and Mr.  Webb deserves it.   After graduating from the University of Washington, James joined the  [[Page H7880]]  United States Air Force, where he completed 175 combat missions and  received the Distinguished Flying Cross as well as several other  awards.   James was inspired to research altitude decompression sickness,  finding solutions to help astronauts and pilots across the country and  around the world.   Before receiving the Founders Award, James won five other awards from  the association and also served as president.   Mr. Speaker, I thank James Webb for his contributions to aerospace  medicine. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on this  award.                            ____________________
