 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  achievements of the women athletes at North Carolina State University.   In addition to the women's basketball team winning their third  straight ACC championship, the women's cross-country team won their  first NCAA championship. And we also have the accomplishments of many  more.   Last spring, seniors on the women's tennis team won the NCAA doubles  championship.   Katharine Berkoff also claimed the 100-yard backstroke national title  for the second year in a row, while Katelyn Tuohy stormed to victory on  the track in the 5,000 meters.   Last month, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the  foundation of gender equity at educational institutions. This milestone  serves as an important reminder that too often women athletes don't get  the recognition they deserve.   Congratulations to the Wolfpack women on these amazing  accomplishments.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the CHIPS and  Science Act. Our Nation has long been a global leader in science and  technology, but we cannot afford to take that position for granted.   Our global standing rests not just on the ingenuity of our people but  also on our government's bipartisan commitment to supporting  innovation.   At this moment of unprecedented international competition, we  urgently need an unprecedented investment in the groundbreaking  research that powers America's economic growth. That is why the CHIPS  and Science Act is so timely and so important.   In addition to bolstering domestic production of semiconductors, this  landmark legislation will authorize more than $81 billion for the  National Science Foundation.   Crucially, the bill also funds research that will yield the cutting- edge clean energy technologies of tomorrow, cutting carbon emissions  and helping combat global climate change.   Madam Speaker, my district includes much of the Research Triangle,  our Nation's largest research park, which is home to hundreds of  companies breaking new ground in medicine, energy, telecommunications,  and more.   We are also proud of our leading research universities like N.C.  State University, HBCUs like Shaw and Saint Augustine's, and our  State's largest community college, Wake Tech, and we have a women's  college specializing in STEM, Meredith College.   Our investments in public-private partnerships afforded by the CHIPS  and Science Act will provide these North Carolina-based companies and  educational institutions with unprecedented funding and research  support.   Companies in my district, particularly startups, have struggled to  cope with the consequences of the global semiconductor shortage. To  meet that need, this bill includes more than $50 billion in chips  funding, which will mitigate current semiconductor supply chain  concerns, incentivize domestic production, and prevent another chips  crisis in the future.   I am also pleased that this package includes several bipartisan bills  I led with members of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee,  including the Energizing Technology Transfer Act, a version of the NSF  Technology Research Institutes Act, and the National Science and  Technology Strategy Act.   These bills will help facilitate the commercial application of clean  energy technologies by universities and private companies, the  development of a national science and technology strategy, and  investment in research and traineeship programs for graduate students.   The CHIPS and Science Act embodies the investment needed to empower  innovation in North Carolina's Second District and across the United  States. I support the rule and the underlying bill.
