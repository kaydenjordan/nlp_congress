 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program provides health  coverage to low-income children and pregnant women who have an annual  income above the Medicaid eligibility levels but have no health  insurance. It provides care, in other words, Mr. Speaker, for some of  the most vulnerable families in our Nation. It covers nearly 5,000  children in my home State. In fact, in fiscal year 2016, North Dakota  received $19 million in CHIP funding.   I encourage all of my colleagues to now support this important  program that has historically had bipartisan support. I also want to  urge my colleagues to quickly take up funding for community health  centers, the special diabetes program, and other health programs that  require extension.   Community health centers in North Dakota are already feeling the  negative effects of this funding uncertainty, particularly in hiring  and leasing decisions.   Mr. Speaker, we must not vote ``no'' on this CR because of what is  not in the bill, but we must vote ``yes'' because what is in the bill  is critical to the health of our children.
