 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, America has always been a place of economic  promise. Millions of people have come to this country in search of a  better life for themselves and an even better life for their children,  but in recent years this dream had started to dim.   Under the Obama administration, our economy stagnated. Too many  American families struggled. Worse, some economists were predicting  that weak economic growth would be the new normal. Republicans disagree  with that assessment. We didn't think the United States was doomed to a  future of weak growth and diminished opportunity. We knew American  workers and American businesses were as driven, creative, and  innovative as ever. We also knew they were facing a lot of obstacles,  including burdensome regulations and an outdated tax code that acted as  a drag on economic growth. So instead of giving up on the economy, we  decided we were going to get the economy going again by removing  obstacles to economic growth and job creation.   Over the past 21 months, that is exactly what we have done. We have  removed burdensome regulations, and last December we passed a historic  and comprehensive reform of our Tax Code.   The Tax Code isn't necessarily the first thing people think of when  they think of economic growth, but in actual fact, the Tax Code has a  huge effect on our economy.   A small business owner facing a huge tax bill is highly unlikely to  be able to expand her business or hire a new employee. In fact, if her  tax burden is heavy enough, she may not even be able to keep her  business open. Similarly, a large business is going to find it pretty  hard to create jobs or improve benefits for employees if it is  struggling to stay competitive against foreign businesses that are  paying much less in taxes.   Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code was  not helping our economy. It was doing the opposite, and so we took  action. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and  medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We lowered our Nation's  massive corporate tax rate, which up until January 1, was the highest  corporate tax rate in the developed world. We expanded business owners'  ability to recover the cost of investments they make in their  businesses, which frees up cash they can reinvest in their operations  and their workers. We brought the U.S. international tax system into  the 21st century so American businesses are not operating at a  disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.   Now we are seeing the results. Our economy is thriving. The economy  grew at a vigorous 4.2-percent pace in the second quarter of 2018.  Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law less than a year  ago, 1.7 million jobs have been created. U.S. job openings have hit a  record high of 6.94 million. In fact, the number of job openings has  exceeded the number of unemployed for 5 straight months. Think about  that. The number of job openings has exceeded the number of people who  are looking for jobs for the past 5 months.   Wages are rising at the fastest rate since 2009. Middle-class income  hit its highest level ever last year--ever--and the poverty rate  dropped to its lowest level since 2006. Small business optimism  shattered its previous record to reach a new high in August. I could go  on.   So what does this all mean? It means that if you need a job, there  are more jobs available and jobs with good benefits. It means there are  more opportunities for workers to advance and build rewarding and  secure careers. It means fewer families are having to live paycheck to  paycheck and that more families have money available to plan for the  future, such as for their kids' college or for their retirement. It  means small business owners can think about expanding their businesses  and hiring new workers instead of wondering how they are going to make  ends meet.   When the American people elected us to the majority almost 2 years  ago, we had one priority, and that was making life better for American  families. I am very proud we are succeeding, but we are certainly not  stopping here. We are going to continue working to expand opportunity  for Americans even further. We are going to continue to build on the  work we have done on other priorities, from equipping our military and  supporting our veterans to fighting the opioid crisis.
