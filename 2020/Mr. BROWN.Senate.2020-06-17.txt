 Mr. President, we are in the middle of a pandemic. The  President of the United States doesn't act like it, but Americans are  still dying by the hundreds--several hundred almost every day.   We are in the middle of an economic crisis. Again, the President of  the United States doesn't act like it. He crows about the unemployment  numbers when they are the worst since World War II.   And we are in the middle of a crisis of conscience. Millions of  Americans have taken to the streets to protest the murders of Black and  Brown Americans by the people supposed to protect them.   With all of these challenges, the President of the United States is  failing. The Senate should be stepping in right now to fill that  leadership void, to get more help to families and to communities that  are going bankrupt, to protect workers--to use every tool we have to  force the administration to get some kind of test trace isolate regime  in place to truly stop the spread of the coronavirus. We should be  listening to the protestors demanding justice in communities all across  the country, large and small.   They remind us this pandemic isn't a separate issue from racial  justice--it is all connected. It is not a coincidence that President  Trump stopped even pretending to try to fight the coronavirus once he  realized it was disproportionately Black and Brown Americans dying, not  very often one of his rich friends.   In the Senate, we have plans to get help and protections to workers;  we have plans to fund a scale-up of testing that gets us closer to the  level we need; we have plans to work to hold police accountable; we  have begun to tackle the systemic racism in our justice system.   Look at it this way: The last time I was on an airplane was in mid- March. I live close enough--6-hour drive between Cleveland and  Washington. In mid-March, there were about 90 coronavirus cases  diagnosed in the United States--halfway around the world from where the  Presiding Officer likes to emphasize it came from, Wuhan. About 900  miles from Wuhan is the capital of South Korea--Seoul. In South Korea,  around that same time, there were 90 cases. So South Korea had 90  diagnosed cases; the United States had about 90 diagnosed cases.   Since that date in March, fewer than 300 Koreans have died of the  coronavirus; over 110,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus.  [[Page S3047]]    In Korea, their unemployment rate now is under 4 percent; our  unemployment rate is somewhere between three and four times that.   That is clearly the incompetence--this is not a partisan statement. I  have watched my Republican Governor of Ohio, who has done a good job,  teamed up with Dr. Amy Acton, the health director, in combating this  virus early, while the President of the United States was still blaming  the virus on--saying it was a hoax or not real or whatever he said, and  then his inept leadership didn't scale up testing, didn't have any  national program to provide protective equipment to our people.   So we have seen the bungled leadership out of the White House-- 110,000 Americans passed away, an unemployment rate higher than at any  time in my lifetime--but we are not doing anything about that here in  this body. Why? Because Leader McConnell doesn't want to do anything  about it, for whatever reason. Instead of rising to meet the crisis of  the pandemic or unemployment or the protests on our streets, Senator  McConnell wants to create a new crisis by confirming more extreme  judges that are trying to take away America's healthcare.   The challenges we are facing as a country are bad enough. Imagine if  Leader McConnell and President Trump get their way--their handpicked  judges throw tens of millions of Americans off of their health  insurance in the middle of a pandemic. That sounds farfetched? Well,  no, it isn't.    In the middle of a pandemic, this President continues his lawsuit to  try to overturn the Affordable Care Act, even though the voters have  ratified it through a number of elections in 2012 and 2014 and 2016 and  2018. It still stands, but the President of the United States is trying  to take away people's healthcare. They are trying to sneak ACA repeal  through the courts since they couldn't do it in Congress.   While the rest of the country is distracted just trying to keep their  families safe, judges are deciding the fate of America's health  coverage right now.   The nomination we are considering this week--right now on the floor-- of Judge Walker is part of that effort. Judge Walker has served in the  Western District of Kentucky for just 6 months.   What makes him qualified for the DC Circuit? It is not the 6 months  he served in Kentucky. In fact, the bar association in Kentucky said he  wasn't qualified for that job. He has only had it for 6 months. What  makes him qualified?   Just go down the hall. I am sure you could have seen many, many times  Judge Walker when he was Law Clerk Walker or Young Man Walker or  Grandson of Contributor Walker going in and out of Senator McConnell's  office. He is a protege of McConnell's. He thinks the way McConnell  thinks; he acts the way McConnell acts; and that is what it is all  about.   Before his nomination to the district court, Walker praised then- Judge Kavanaugh for providing a roadmap the Supreme Court could use to  strike down the ACA. So it isn't just that Judge Walker is a young,  unqualified, extremist, far-right protege of the majority leader. It is  not just that. I mean, talk about the swamp. That is what that is.   What it is all about is putting another vote in a key place to  overturn the Affordable Care Act. He is calling upholding the ACA  indefensible and catastrophic.   I don't know how, in the middle of a pandemic, you look at the  American landscape, you see how many people have been sick--millions of  Americans have been sick--110,000 Americans have died, hundreds more  every day, and you think one of the most important things you can do is  strip millions of Americans of their healthcare.   He has continued his attacks on American healthcare protections since  he joined the Federal bench. In March 2020, at his formal swearing-in  ceremony as district judge, Judge Walker said the worst words he heard  while clerking for Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court were the Chief  Justice's rationale for upholding the ACA. The worst words he heard  from the man for whom he was working were his words to uphold the ACA,  the Affordable Care Act.   Now, what I forgot to mention was that when Judge Walker said that at  his swearing-in ceremony, there were a couple of important visitors  there.   Although the Senate should have been in session and finished our work  on the first round of the coronavirus, Senator McConnell--his office is  down the hall. As we know, Senator McConnell decided to adjourn the  Senate and go back to Kentucky for this swearing-in. Judge Kavanaugh,  another protege, if you will, of Senator McConnell's was there too.   So don't forget, Senator McConnell is on the ballot this year.  Senator McConnell faces an opponent who is running neck and neck with  him. It is a very Republican State, but Senator McConnell is not a  particularly well-liked figure in his State, as we have seen through  many years.   So Senator McConnell didn't do his job here. It is not just he didn't  do his job. He stopped us from doing our jobs so he could fly back, be  with Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh, to remind the voters in Kentucky  that he is the strong man who got Judge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court  and then to celebrate the swearing-in of just another young judge to a  Federal district court. That is where Senator McConnell's priorities  are.   We know Judge Walker is the latest in a long line of judges pushed by  President Trump, rammed through by Leader McConnell, as his minions,  shills, obedient junior Senators or sheep--you choose the noun for your  colleagues--all vote yes so you could put another member on another  Federal court who is trying to take away Americans' healthcare.   Chad Readler, from my State, who is now serving on the Sixth Circuit,  led the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the entire  Affordable Care Act, and David Porter, who holds a Pennsylvania seat on  the Third Circuit, wrote that the ACA ``violates the Framers'  constitutional design.''   What kind of law training do you have, and what kind of upbringing do  you have--what kind of way do you think?--that you would think that  providing healthcare to citizens is a violation of the Framers'  constitutional design? Who thinks that way? On and on it goes.   The American people want to keep their healthcare. They have made  that clear. They especially want to keep that healthcare in the middle  of, for gosh sakes, a pandemic. Leader McConnell needs to stop trying  to take it away through the courts and start letting us actually get to  work to make people healthier.   Let's get to work to save lives from the coronavirus. Let's get to  work to save lives from police violence. Let's get to work to save  lives from all of the inequities in our healthcare system. Let's get to  work to put money in people's pockets, help them pay the bills and stay  in their homes, and help State and local governments from laying off  thousands and thousands of workers.   Leader McConnell, let us do our job, the job for which we were  elected.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to express my  appreciation for a great Ohioan and public servant, Dr. Amy Acton, for  her leadership and expertise while serving as the director of the Ohio  Department of Health.   Born and raised in Youngstown, OH, Dr. Acton knew she wanted to be a  doctor from a young age. She attended Northeastern Ohio University  School of Medicine, studying pediatrics and preventive medicine. Dr.  Acton continued her education, earning a master's degree in public  health from the Ohio State University, where she went on to teach as an  associate professor.   In 2019, Governor Mike DeWine appointed her to lead our State' s  health department, the first woman to hold the position in Ohio's  history.   That job is always critical, public health is one of the most  important jobs our government does, and until a few months ago, it was  too often underappreciated. But 17 months ago, few could have predicted  just how vital Dr. Acton's role would be, as she stepped up to lead  Ohio's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 22, 2020, while much  of the Nation was still in denial about the quickly evolving pandemic,  Dr. Acton led the charge and issued a statewide stay at home order,  making Ohio one of the first States to do so. Understanding that the  best leaders are open and honest, Dr. Acton participated in the  Governor's daily press conferences. She answered questions and helped  explain the threat of COVID-19 and the actions her department was  taking to keep Ohioans safe through clever analogies, from brewing  storms to Swiss cheese.   Throughout the spring, under Dr. Acton's leadership, Ohio continued  to lead the country in taking bold action to slow COVID-19's spread.  Dr. Acton's early intervention, supported by science and data, saved  lives and significantly slowed the spread of the virus in Ohio.   Dr. Acton put the life and well-being of people over politics. She  used empathy and honesty to educate, inform, and comfort Ohioans in  uncertain times, exceeding the duties expected of her, to ensure the  health and safety of her fellow Ohioans.   Thank you, Dr. Acton, for your wisdom, bravery, and compassion  throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Your leadership saved countless lives  in Ohio. I am sure my Senate colleagues will join me in thanking Dr.  Amy Acton for her exemplary efforts.                            ____________________
