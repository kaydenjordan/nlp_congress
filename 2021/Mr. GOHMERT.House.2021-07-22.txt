 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much those observations. It  is so important for everybody to understand, the IRS is feared, and we  learn through people like Lois Lerner that it is not always honest, and  yet nobody has been held to account. I am hoping that at some point  that will occur. I am so grateful to my friend from Pennsylvania.   At this time I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Bentz, and I have to give a  shout-out to Bruce Westerman as the ranking member on the Natural  Resources Committee. This very morning, we had a Republican group, but  we couldn't get the whole committee to do it on that very issue of  forest fires and maintaining healthy forests.   Hopefully, we will get the majority to understand it is not enough to  just let nature take its course. You trim the undergrowth. You have  fire lanes so you can stop a fire when it gets started. There are so  many things that Republicans understand is just good forest management.   So whether it is lightning or something else that starts a fire, we  don't have to see 400,000 acres go up in flames. This administration is  determined not to do proper management of the forests, and so many  people get hurt.   I am proud to have a colleague like Mr. Bentz that will stand up for  what is best for forests, for nature, and has a lot of common sense in  the process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Georgia so much  for making the effort to stand up for the constitutional rights of  Members of Congress not to be detained from getting onto the House  floor. We have metal detectors still at each entrance. We didn't used  to have them at the Speaker's lobby. Those have been added.   We are co-plaintiffs in a lawsuit that will, hopefully, result in  those being removed so that we won't continue to have Republicans miss  votes because they get detained, even for the short time, when the  Speaker has full discretion as to when to bring down the gavel. We have  had a number of Republicans who have missed votes that they would not  have missed were there no metal detectors, and especially since there  is no intelligence from any source of any Member being a threat to  another Member then this totally unprecedented subjugating of House  Members below what their roles are and being sent by the same number of  people that sent the Speaker.   It is time to get rid of the metal detectors, get rid of the  subjugation and get back to the Nation's business.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say I am so excited about the freshman class  that came in this Congress. We just heard from three freshmen, and  these are folks, especially including my friend from Florida, Kat  Cammack, that has been added, and I am thrilled. I have been so  reassured by the freshman class that has come in and the common sense  that came with them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend, Member of Congress,  Kat Cammack. She has expressed so articulately what I have seen, what I  have experienced so many times spending the night on the border, going  down those dirt roads along the Rio Grande. It is incredible.   And some would think, Oh, well, isn't it compassionate to encourage  people to come to the United States. It is the most unneighborly,  uncompassionate thing that we could do. These are people who--other  than the gang members, those who are part of the cartels, those coming  from groups in the Middle East and other places that don't have U.S.  interests at heart, but so many of them, they are looking for a better  way of life.   Why do they not have a better way of life where they are, including,  especially, Mexico? Well, it is because of the unsecured border we have  that allows the Mexican drug cartels to make tens of billions of  dollars every year coming from America for the drugs, for the fentanyl  that kills, for the sex trafficking, for the human trafficking. We are  funding the corruption in Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, when my wife and I had our honeymoon, we didn't have  much money at all; $300 got us 5 nights, 6 days in a fabulous place in  Mexico. But we don't go back because the drug cartels no longer say  hands off of the tourism.   Mexico is being devastated by the drug cartels. And it is America and  administrations like this that are allowing them--actually making it  possible--not just allowing, making it possible. Some might say they  are truly accessories to the corruption, to the criminality that is  going on.   And in fact, evidence of that comes from the fact that as border  patrol had told me before, before this administration when they used to  talk to me and never ever tried to prevent me from getting to the  border and seeing exactly what is going on--that has all changed now.  This administration did not allow me, two nights in a row, trying to  get to the border, as I have done countless times before--wouldn't let  me get there. In fact, used the place where normally you get down from  the embankment, go through the wall that is being constructed by the  Trump administration, go down through the flat area, and then you come  up to the levee road, and then that allows you to get miles and miles  down the dirt roads along the Rio Grande where thousands of people are  coming across.   And they didn't allow it this time. They used the wall, not to keep  out illegal aliens, but to keep me from seeing the outrageous  travesties and tragedies that are going along our border, because  people are being lured to their detriment. In tort law, it would be  called an attractive nuisance; like having a swimming pool and having  no fence so that a child is drawn in and then drowns.   Well, this administration is luring people to their detriment. And I  have been there many nights, it is not on the list of questions that is  required to be asked, but so often the border patrol asks, How much did  you pay, basically, to drug cartels to bring you into the United  States? And it was usually between $5,000 and $8,000.   And then often they would say, You don't have that kind of money.  Where did you get that money? And they would indicate, Here and there;  get this much here, this much there. Friends in the U.S. sent this  much.   So what about the rest of the money? The drug cartels, they are going  to let them work it off when they get where they are going.   How do they get where they are going? Well, at that point, it is  either Health and Human Services or ICE. Border Patrol, their job is  along the border. They don't, once they transport to a facility, that  is usually the end of their transporting. But ICE, Health and Human  Services, and now we have the military that is also providing  transportation. But as the Border Patrol officer said, cartels call us  here in the U.S.--Federal Government. There are logistics. They get  them across the border, and then--they don't use UPS or FedEx or even  the U.S. Post Office--  [[Page H3830]]  they use the Federal Government and taxpayer money to ship these  indentured servants of the drug cartels all over the country to cities  all over the country wherever the drug cartel want them to be selling  drugs, sex trafficking, human trafficking. The U.S. Government actually  makes that happen. They facilitate that.   We have had so many Border Patrol--again, before this last visit to  the border when this administration wants to hide what they are doing  at the border--they say, Oh, well, if you give us enough notice, then  we will put somebody--and this is effectively what--they want to put  somebody--I am suppose to supervise--over me to watch what I am doing,  prevent me from doing proper oversight down where they are supposed to  be doing their job, prevent that from happening so that America does  not see how absolutely tragic this invasion is.                                time  1300    Yes, they are gang members, but so many people are coming in, and the  cartels know taxpayers in the U.S., who are funding the drug cartels,  are also going to pay for the education, all the needs of those coming  in.   This administration doesn't care. What they are looking at are future  Democratic voters. But they have to act quickly because the longer the  people are here, the more they realize, ``You know what? I am for hard  work, and I am for making my own way. I don't want to see babies killed  in the womb. I believe in working a full day. I do believe in marriage  and strong family, devotion to family. I believe in God,'' and they  start thinking, wait a minute, that sounds more like a Republican than  a Democrat. They don't believe in abortion, most of the folks, and they  do have faith in God and devotion to families.   If you read what BLM said they believed in, destruction of what they  call Western-style marriage is one of their biggest tenets. Why?  Because they are Marxist.   To get to Marxism, you have to create chaos. As Paul Harvey used to  talk about, one of the best ways, and a critically important way, to  create enough chaos so that you can move toward Marxism is to destroy  the family, the nuclear family.   Of course, BLM has it wrong. It is not Western-style marriage. It is  not something that North America or South America or Central America  came up with, what is typically called the West. It didn't come from  this side of the planet or this hemisphere, except in the Middle East.   A man named Moses had a revelation from God and let people know here  is what God says: A man shall leave his father and mother, a woman  shall leave her home, and the two will become one. That would be  marriage, not Western-style. I guess Middle Eastern-style.   It didn't originate here. It has been found throughout history to be  the best building block of a very strong society.   That is why surveys continue to find that although, of course, there  are people that excel coming from broken homes and other avenues, the  best chance a child has of succeeding in life is coming from a two- parent home and a strong nuclear family.   I have seen firsthand what Marxism does. I have heard the director of  what we would now call daycare in the old Soviet Union bragging that  these children don't belong to their parents: They are just temporary  caretakers. We monitor what parents tell their children. If they ever  say anything negative about the government, we immediately take the  child away and give them to a more deserving caretaker.   I thought, at the time, thank God I didn't grow up in the Soviet  Union. Thank God I grew up in east Texas, and I had a mother and  father, and they cared deeply about me. I was so grateful for the  blessings that I had had.   Wow, the Soviet Union. It failed because it was destined to fail.  Marxism is always going to fail. People think: Oh, but it sounds so  wonderful, share and share alike.   Now, you have a very small ruling class, and then you have everybody  else.   I have been in those stores. Toilet paper so often, no, it was not  available. But I learned, and I saw. Real luxuries, like real toilet  paper, the store would get those in and put those in the back. If you  were a government official, then when you came in, they would get you  some toilet paper.   If it is a shoe store, when they got good shoes in, they kept those  in the back for government officials. Why? Because they were sucking up  to the government officials.   In Russia, it was called blat, political pull. You wanted to have  some, so you kept the best of whatever you got in to sell for people  that had power. You would do favors for them so that you might have a  little power.   As one Soviet told me, a college student: In your country, you can  get ahead. No matter who you are, you can get ahead by hard work,  making more money, and then money will help you make your way up in  society. Here, there are only two ways to move up in society. One is to  suck up to people who have political power, and I guess maybe it is a  subheading of that, but it is also by ratting out other people.   As he told me: You can get ahead by working hard and making more  money here. The best way to move up is to step on other people. If you  see them do something inappropriate, then you rat them out and that  will allow you to move up.   Except for the very top people that have everything they want, the  other people mostly get the same amount of income. That was also tried  in Venezuela; it failed. It will always fail.   Anybody that was so stupid that they could not foresee what was  emerging, and that is a very strong, powerful middle class in the  United States and part of Europe, Marx couldn't see that coming. He was  too blind. He couldn't foresee the formation of labor unions that could  stand up to greedy Democrats, billionaires, such as we have here, the  billionaires that, by the way, paid hundreds of millions of dollars to  affect the election, who was able to vote, and how ballots were  gathered.   Well, over in the Soviet Union, you don't have to worry about that.  As Stalin pointed out, he didn't care who voted. He just cared about  who counted the votes.   We will be seeing evidence continue to emerge from Arizona and  Georgia, and, I think, eventually Pennsylvania. But to hear anybody say  that there was absolutely no evidence of fraud, it is like John Fund  said when he wrote the book about fraud in elections some years back:  The biggest fraud about elections is the statement there is no fraud in  elections. There has always been.   Lyndon Johnson certainly knew about that, as did people who tried to  research allegations of voting impropriety, and the courthouse burned  down, destroying evidence. These things have gone on.   Cook County, Chicago, you think there has not been fraud in Chicago?  You would have to be either crazy or dishonest to say there has never  been fraud in elections in Chicago.    It goes on. The trick is to try to minimize the fraud so you don't  disenfranchise so many people.   But there is evidence of fraud. There are hundreds, maybe thousands  of affidavits, sworn testimony, about fraud in the last election.   I know there is plenty in the media to say it didn't happen. Because  they are saying that, out of either ignorance or dishonesty, others  feel comfortable, including people right here on the floor, saying that  it is totally debunked, that there was no fraud in the last election.  That is a statement out of ignorance or out of being deceptive.   But we have to clean up the elections. We have to quit being a joke  in the eyes of foreigners who have paper ballots.   Even as bad as things have gotten in Iraq, there for a while, they  had free and fair elections. In 2005, having been over there right  after the first election, talking to one of the chiefs of police there,  he was telling about how--of course, the voters, when they voted, to  avoid fraud, you dipped your finger into purple ink that would last for  a couple of weeks so you couldn't vote a second time. If you didn't dip  your finger in there and have proof of who you were, you didn't vote  the first time.   He was telling me that a policeman who was monitoring the election  saw someone suspicious. Upon checking, he saw that he had a bomb, a  suicide vest. He threw the man down, jumped on top of him. Both of them  were killed. I said, wow, I guess that sent all the voters scurrying,  fleeing. He looked surprised and said, no, that they knew if  [[Page H3831]]  they got out of line, the policeman would have died for nothing.   The policeman died trying to secure the fair opportunity to vote.  Yet, nowadays, that is being belittled: We shouldn't even utilize voter  IDs. You shouldn't have to have an ID.   Well, that is the best way to ensure that there is not fraud in the  election, just like it is the best way to ensure that someone is not  illegally getting a gun or getting a cigarette or getting alcohol.  People produce those all the time. Let's quit disenfranchising so many  people that are voting lawfully by creating the ability to have people  vote illegally.   We keep hearing about: Oh, gee, that is not true. We need to censor  people and not allow them to speak or submit things online if they are  not in conformance with what the liberal Democrat high-tech industry or  the liberal Democrat media say is true or not true.   We listened to 4 years of lies about the Russian dossier when it was  produced by a former MI6 agent in England, who even admitted: Yes, my  sources, they could have been working for Putin.   It was a manipulation paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and  the Democratic National Committee. The FBI was in cahoots and, in fact,  even lied to the FISA court.   It really got my attention, having been a judge, to see that FISA  court judges had so little regard for their own status, their own  courts, that they would not take action to hold in contempt people who  held the court in contempt by lying, by defrauding the court, in order  to spy on a Presidential political campaign. My goodness, there has  never been a Presidential campaign treated as the Trump campaign was.                                time  1315    It even had a Democrat official on tape admitting: We are the ones  who paid for violence to get started at Trump campaign events so that  we could claim that Trump was stirring up violence.   That was in 2016.   For heaven's sake, we needed a Justice Department that would be just,  and we don't have it right now. For heaven's sake, I heard from a  constituent 2 days ago who that day was shocked to have two FBI agents  show up at her place of work in east Texas. She had not come to  Washington on January 6. She was at work in east Texas.   The only reason those FBI agents could have showed up at her place of  work was because her nephew texted her a picture of someone who was  here on January 6 in Washington and asked: Do you see anybody you  recognize? Because it looked like his aunt.   She said: Wow, I thought that was me.   Then jokingly she said: Don't turn me in.   Unless the FBI were monitoring these text messages which was either  by the grant of a warrant from a FISA court that, in my opinion, was  breaking the PATRIOT Act and was breaking the law to grant such a  warrant, or they were committing a crime and spying on people's text  messages without authority.   This is getting out of control here. Of course, we don't hear any  stories about the people who were looting and creating insurrections in  cities around America last summer. We don't hear about them being  arrested or having their homes wrongfully broken into by police or  Federal officials. No. But we are hearing about it, and the illegality  and the brownshirt tactics of the Federal Government needs to stop.   Mr. Hoyer says he was shocked 8 months was all somebody got for  disrupting an official proceeding. Well, that also happened on June 22,  2016 for 26 hours on this floor, and I am surprised that Mr. Hoyer  wants to see his fellow Democrats going to prison for more than 8  months for obstructing an official proceeding.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
