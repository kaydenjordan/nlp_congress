 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, first of  all, I want to agree with my distinguished colleague and friend from  Michigan as to almost everything he said, with the exception of article  IV.   This BDS provision is a really important provision, and I understand  what he is attempting to do with the exemptions. I understand he is  putting them in for the small businesses, but having said that, we  really believe this should apply across the board. Once we start the  exempting process, it is going to be very difficult to stop. So given  that, I object.    Madam President, I rise to complete, I hope, the lengthy  work we have done on S. 1--the first bill we introduced this year.   It is from the Foreign Relations Committee, and it is a bipartisan  piece of legislation which many people have had input into. It is a  conglomerate of several pieces of legislation that we have worked on  for a considerable period of time, and all of those I know are  supported in a bipartisan way.   I would like to walk through the five parts of this very briefly. The  first one, of course, is the United States-Israel Security  Authorization Assistance Act of 2019. That is one we spent a  considerable period of time on.   Without a doubt, Israel is one of the best friends we have in the  world. Certainly, in the neighborhood they live in, which is a very  dangerous neighborhood, they need our help. We work with them very  closely in many respects--in many national security respects, with  people who aren't out in the public realm and who will probably never  be out in the public realm, but they are important for the security of  Israel.   The second is the Jordan Defense Authorization Act. I think all of us  are aware, again, that Jordan is a great friend to have in the Middle  East. Like Israel, it lives in a very dangerous neighborhood. Jordan  has stood by us through thick and thin and through many challenges we  have had. Jordan also has, in its great humanitarian view, taken in a  number of refugees there.   As we work with Jordan, it is a cooperative effort to help them as  they sustain these populations of displaced people who hopefully will  be able to return at some point in time.   Thirdly, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 is also  included in this piece of legislation. This is a piece of legislation  that I think my friend from Michigan described quite aptly. It is named  after an individual who is very brave and who brought out a lot of  evidence of acts that people knew and suspected were happening. He  brought them out into the public.   This is a bill that will use America's power to sanction, and it will  refresh some of the sanctions we have already put in place. It is just  an excellent way to attempt to persuade Bashar al-Assad that he is  going in a very wrong direction, hurting his people as he is.   The Combating BDS Act of 2019 is an act that has some controversy to  it. Again, the goals have already been discussed on the floor for many  days and at considerable length. Without going into all of the details,  it is designed to see that the BDS activity is tamped down and that it  is not appropriate to use against our friend Israel.   Lastly, the most recent addition, of course, was the McConnell  amendment that has been added. This amendment has been badly  mischaracterized by the national media for a number of days now.   I keep reading where the national media writes that the U.S. Senate  rebuked--they used the word ``rebuked''--President Trump. Nothing could  be further from the truth.   In fact, when President Trump was running for office, he said his  bottom line was to attempt to get us out of some of these entanglements  that we have had.   One, of course, is Afghanistan, which has been on our mind for 17  years. The other was Syria. He rolled out the idea that we shouldn't be  considering that. This system worked exactly the way the Founding  Fathers intended for it to work. When it comes to foreign relations,  when it comes to these kind of matters, it is a joint operation between  the first and the second branches of government--between the  legislative and the executive branches of government.   After the President put this on the table as the leader of the  Nation, people began to talk. It was greatly debated both in this  body--in the U.S. Senate--in the House of Representatives, and within  the administration itself. What has happened with this piece of  legislation is, first of all, it commends the President for all of the  things he has been able to do in Syria and getting ISIS contained to a  very small area that remains. It also lays out the challenges we face  and commits to joining the President as we go forward and as we  continue the work that is ahead of us in the Middle East.   This is a great piece of legislation. I commend it to my fellow  Senators.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
