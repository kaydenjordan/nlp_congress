 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.   While I am grateful that congressional Democrats worked very hard to  improve the initial agreement, it still falls short in some critical  areas. Let me address one.   There is an undeniable and unbreakable link between trade and climate  pollution. Unfortunately, this agreement does not adequately address  the ongoing and immediate climate crisis that we face.   For 25 years, we have watched as NAFTA painfully outsourced American  jobs. Under this agreement, we will see the continued outsourcing of  pollution, undermining our domestic and international efforts to  address climate change.   The United States must get serious about this challenge and build  international cooperation and commitments through all vehicles  available to us, including our trade agreements.   Trade negotiations do not happen frequently, but their impact is felt  for generations. I cannot support a deal  [[Page H12286]]  which fails to even acknowledge the global climate crisis that future  generations will be left to bear.                            ____________________
