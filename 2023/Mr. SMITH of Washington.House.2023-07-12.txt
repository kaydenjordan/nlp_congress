 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Chair, I agree with Chairman Rogers. This is a very strong  bipartisan bill and it reflects the process that we go through every  year in passing the National Defense Authorization Act. We had a great  markup in committee. It was a bipartisan process. We considered at  least a thousand different amendments and ideas that were brought to us  by members from across the committee. We had very good debates in those  amendments, and we came out with what I think is an excellent  bipartisan product.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Rogers in his first year as chairman.  He has done an outstanding job of being inclusive of all of us and  producing a great bill.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the staff. The members sort of throw the ideas  out there and the staff are the ones that have to sort through them and  turn them into amendments and negotiate to try to get it done. We are  blessed with an outstanding staff on the Armed Services Committee. I  very much appreciate their support.   Mr. Chairman, I will start by emphasizing one of the last points that  Chairman Rogers made on accountability and efficiency within the  military.   The Department of Defense is a very large bureaucracy. We will never  completely eliminate any wasteful decision, but we are absolutely  focused on doing the best we can, and this bill reflects that to try to  make sure that we are getting our money's worth for the systems and  programs that we are funding. I think the chairman has done a great job  of leading on that.   Mr. Chairman, we are working toward getting a full audit of the  Pentagon. We are auditing piece by piece and empowering the Inspector  General to make sure that we do a better job of spending the taxpayers'  dollars.   Overall, the NDAA weaves three basic things into it. Number one, and  most importantly, is support for the men and women who serve in our  military and their families. Without this bill, crucial programs will  be lost that provide that support. We offer bonuses and other incentive  pay. We increased the basic housing allowance. There are all kinds of  issues that go toward the basic necessities that men and women in the  military and their families need to support them that doesn't happen  without this legislation.   We have mentioned, and I mention again, the importance of recruitment  and retention. That is one of the biggest issues. Are we supporting the  servicemembers and their families?   This bill is the opportunity that we, as Members of Congress, have to  make sure that we are doing that as a body.   The second big issue is modernizing the military. The chairman  mentioned this, as well. On the modern battlefield, technology and new  innovations are crucial. It is changing constantly and needs to be  updated. The Pentagon historically has not been great at fielding new  technologies quickly. We put a variety of different provisions in there  to help incentivize that and move them toward doing that.   The modern battlefield is about information systems, missiles,  missile defense, drone, and counter drone. We need to have the best in  all of that. We need to innovate, and this bill helps get us there.   Lastly, the bill recognizes the threat environment that we face. They  recognize the threat from China, the threat from Russia, and others to  make sure that we have adequate deterrence.   We continue the Indo-Pacific Defense Initiative to help offer that  deterrence to China, and, crucially, we continue to support Ukraine. I  want to emphasize that last point. You cannot be legitimately concerned  about the threat that China poses and not be willing to support  Ukraine.   If Putin and Russia are able to do what they want to do in Ukraine,  that gives a green light to President Xi and China to do the same thing  elsewhere. Russia must be defeated in Ukraine. A sovereign, democratic  Ukraine must survive for our country's vision of what national security  should be for the globe. You can't do one without the other, and I hope  we will do both.   Mr. Chairman, this is a very strong bill. I support the bill as it is  currently before us. The amendments that are in front of us are going  to be debated one way or the other, and I will still support the bill  after that.   As we all know, that is not the end of the story here. There is a  second rule  [[Page H3237]]  allegedly coming. I sincerely hope that the majority prioritizes  getting this bill done over the certain views of a small number of  extreme Members. We have a good bill. Let's pass it. Let's not mess it  up.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this piece of legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), the ranking member of the  Readiness Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), who is the ranking member  on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), who is the ranking member of  the Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, amen to Mr.  Gallagher's comments. I appreciate that impassioned speech.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Kim), who is the ranking member on the Military Personnel Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), the ranking member on the  Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the ranking member on the  Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Ryan), the vice ranking member of the full  committee.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I think we have heard during the course of this debate  exactly why this is such an important bill, why it is such a good bill,  and the effort that went into the process.   You have heard a bipartisan group of people, and people wide-ranging  on the political spectrum, from left to right, describe the process  that we go through to produce this product and why it is so important  that we pass it.   We face a very complex threat environment. Now I happen to be of the  [[Page H3242]]  opinion that it is not just military strength that is going to help us  negotiate that threat environment. For one thing, I very much applaud  the Biden administration opening up high-level discussions with China.  We need diplomacy. We need development. We need partners and allies  throughout the globe.   We also absolutely need a credible deterrent to deal with China and  Russia, and also, by the way, Iran and North Korea, as well as various  other transnational threats.   We are doing this I think in a responsible way, and we have put  together a good bill that will continue to support that process going  forward.   Again, I would emphasize what Representative Gallagher very  articulately said. This is how this process is supposed to work. This  is why we are effective Members of Congress. It is an example of how  this body should function, and we need more examples of that. We need  to pass this bill to continue that process.   It is regular order, working it through the committee, giving  everybody a voice, having debates, winning some, losing some. I don't  think there has ever been an NDAA that was everything that any one  person wanted.   Republicans liked a lot of things in it; didn't like others.  Democrats liked a lot of things in it; didn't like others.   That is what we have put together here.   The issue that is holding us up at the moment is around the issue of  basically recruitment and diversity. What I hope folks understand is  that what the Pentagon is trying to do is they are trying to  effectively recruit from across the country.   What a minority of the majority party wants to do is to torpedo this  entire bill to push a radical antidiversity agenda. We need to recruit  everybody, and we haven't always had the best record on this.   The reason there is a diversity equity inclusion portion in the  military is they recognize it is necessary to be able to effectively  recruit within certain groups of people who have been historically  discriminated against and marginalized.   Just to give you one of the most blatant examples:   Don't Ask, Don't Tell basically barred gay people from serving within  the military, and 13 years ago, we repealed that to allow gay people to  serve openly in the military. Every single Republican voted against  that bill because of that issue, because we were allowing gay people to  serve in the military.   Well, as we look at our needs right now in recruitment and retention,  can anyone credibly say that we would be better off if we barred gay  people from serving in the military?   That didn't happen by accident. We actually affirmatively went out  and recruited. Same for trans people; we had multiple efforts to ban  them from serving in the military. That doesn't help us. It, in fact,  undermines us.   We have had a long history of it being very difficult for women to  integrate in the military. I hate to keep citing the story, but hearing  the one woman who serves in our community talk about her experience,  that it was okay because she just knew that she had to work twice as  hard as the men in order to succeed illustrates the problem.   We have by and large done a decent job of recruiting people of color,  particularly Black people. When you look at the leadership in our  military, it is very, very White. So if you are a person of color, if  you are a woman, if you are gay, if you are trans, and you are thinking  about joining the military, can anyone credibly say that it isn't a  legitimate question to ask: Well, okay, but am I going to get a fair  shot? Am I going to be rewarded for my efforts? Am I going to be  promoted when I do a good job? Am I going to face discrimination and  bigotry?    For the Department of Defense to spend at least a little bit of time  going out in those communities and saying, we hear you and we are going  to give you a fair shot, we are not going to discriminate against you,  we are going to have conversations about this; certain Members of the  other side lose their damn minds at the concept of that conversation  even happening.   They want to pretend like that sort of bigotry doesn't exist. It is  like we are making it up, and why are we worrying about it. Well, if it  didn't exist it wouldn't be a problem. I would grant them that.   Again, the history is right there. It needs to be addressed if we are  going to recruit and retain.   We are an increasingly diverse country. Do we really want to take  huge chunks of that country and say, we are not going to use your  talents? We are going to put those resources on the side, and we are  not going to bring them forward.   Now, as I said in the Rules Committee, bad DEI programs are bad DEI  programs, and I am sure it happens. I haven't seen a program that  doesn't have some examples of working well and some examples of not  working well.   If we want to regulate that, if we want to say: Look, you are doing  this. We don't think you are doing that right; let's talk about it,  that could be a conversation we have. But the conversation that we  engaged in, and as Mr. Gaetz pointed out, there are provisions in this  bill that, frankly, I don't like, that restricts some of this already.  I am not fond of those.   That isn't enough for the radical rightwing MAGA Republicans. They  want to kill this bill because it doesn't discriminate enough against  people in this country, and that is just absurd.   This is a good, strong bill. It should go forward on its own merits  regardless of where you come down on that debate. To say that we need  to kill this good, strong bill because it needs to be more  discriminatory against people is something that I would hope that the  overwhelming majority of this body would reject.   Mr. Chair, let me just close by saying that we have five en bloc  amendments here; a whole lot of good things in there. Once we get  through those five en bloc amendments, we will have a very strong bill,  which will be bipartisan amended.   If we were to go right from the end of that debate, put that bill up  for final passage, it would get at least 350 votes--an overwhelmingly  bipartisan, strongly supported bill that the majority at the moment is  refusing to allow us to have a vote on as we try to negotiate that  extreme agenda that I just discussed.   Okay, if you want to debate with them, you don't want to talk, that  is fine. At the end of that process, I would hope that we would have  the courage to say, yeah, we hear you, you don't like it, vote ``no.''   That is a democracy, okay?   Vote ``no.'' Vote ``no,'' send out your press releases, do your whole  Facebook thing. You will raise a lot of money. We will pass a bill. We  will take care of the country. You will get on TV a lot. You will raise  a lot of money. Everybody is happy.   I don't see why we can't get to that conclusion. That is the real  worrisome thing here. They don't just support their agenda. The one  agenda they don't support is democracy. It is the idea that people  ought to have a vote, and if you lose, you lose.   No, if they lose, they are going to tear this place down, and they  are going to take everybody they can with them.                                time  1515    Gosh, I hope we don't let them do that. I hope we find a way to pass  this bill and work our way through the process and, for the 63rd  consecutive year, pass a National Defense Authorization Act that  supports the men and women of our military and shows that democracy  works just fine and we ought to continue to support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I don't have any speakers. I am very pleased to dispose of this  quickly, if you would like. I would just say I think it is an  outstanding amendment, and we ought to vote for it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I understand we have one speaker on the way, but they can catch the  next one.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would inquire if the gentleman  has more speakers. I will continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I once again urge support for  this en bloc amendment and thank the Rules Committee for putting it  together.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Chairman, I have no additional speakers  either so, once again, I will urge support for the en bloc amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Chairman, I have no  additional speakers, and I urge my colleagues to vote      The online version has been corrected to read: [] 1530  Mr. Chairman, I, too, have no speakers. I  urge adoption of the en bloc amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I once again urge adoption of en  bloc package No. 5, and I yield back the balance of my time.
