 Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the recent  decision by the National Jurisdiction Sentencing Court in Honduras to  acquit Honduran nationals Edwin Espinal and Raul Alvarez. Both men were  found to have been falsely accused of aggravated property damage,  aggravated arson, and the use of homemade explosives, charges for which  it turned out the government had no credible evidence.   Espinal and Alvarez spent 19 months in a maximum-security prison  awaiting trial. They were reportedly subjected to harsh conditions,  including receiving only 2 hours of sunlight per month. Despite being  accused of common crimes, special courts created to try members of  organized criminal networks presided over the process, including a  judge located at a military base. It took 4 years for a court to rule  on their case and to finally absolve them of charges that were  determined to be without merit.   Espinal and Alvarez, like dozens of other protesters, were arrested  during the 2017 electoral turmoil that culminated in the reelection of  current President Juan Orlando Hernandez. Their case was used as a  means to silence protesters and stifle discussion of the democratic  process and the need for transparent elections.   Edwin Espinal is a human rights defender who has faced political  persecution since 2009. He is not alone. Many human rights and  environmental defenders, as well as independent journalists in  Honduras, have suffered threats, arbitrary arrests, beatings, and  assassinations by Honduran police or others acting on their behalf.   I and others here have repeatedly voiced our concerns with the  Honduran Government's misuse of the judicial process to silence  dissent. Bringing charges with no credible evidence and holding social  activists and other critics in prison and subjecting them to lengthy  criminal processes undermines due process and erodes public confidence  in the integrity of the police and the courts.   I am also concerned with the lack of due process in the case of the  eight imprisoned water defenders from Guapinol that has dragged on for  years. And like many, I am waiting for the official sentencing hearing  of Roberto David Castillo, the convicted coauthor of the murder of  Honduran environmentalist and indigenous activist, Berta Cceres.   With another election just around the corner in Honduras, I urge the  Honduran Government to support a free and fair electoral process, as  well as freedom of expression, association, and assembly for all  Honduran citizens. And I hope that the Honduras' next leaders will  reject the corrupt practices and impunity of the past and support an  independent judiciary, uphold the rule of law, hold the police and  other public officials accountable when they abuse their authority, and  restore the faith of the Honduran people in government of the people,  by the people, and for the people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was with great pride that Americans  across the country tuned in this summer for the return of the Olympic  Games. I want to take a moment to celebrate the achievements of one  Vermonter who traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to represent our Nation--and  our State--in these celebrated games. Elle Purrier St. Pierre  represented the United States in the 1500-meter run at the 2020 Olympic  Games. This was Elle's first turn as an Olympian, and she certainly  made her mark, qualifying for the final in the 1500-meter, in which she  crossed the line in 10th place.   Elle is a Vermonter in the truest sense of the word. She grew up  working on her family's dairy farm in Montgomery Center, a town of less  than 800 people along the Canadian border. During her freshman year of  high school, she stumbled onto the Richford High School track team,  initially skeptical of long-distance running. Nonetheless, her raw  talent and grit quickly became clear, and she went on to become one of  the most decorated high school runners in State history.   In college, she ran for the University of New Hampshire, where she  garnered 11 NCAA Division One All-American titles and a championship  victory in the indoor mile her senior year. Upon graduation in 2018,  Elle signed with New Balance to run professionally. Although she has  only run professionally for 3 years, she has set new national records  in the indoor 1-mile and 2-mile distances.   In June, Elle won the 1500-meter at the U.S. Olympic Trials, breaking  the Olympic Trial record and securing her spot on the U.S. Olympic team  in the process. Elle sailed through the qualifying rounds of the 1500,  made it through to the finals where she competed against the strongest  and fastest runners in the world. While her friends and family could  not join her in Tokyo, they and so many others gathered in the Richford  High School cafeteria in the early hours of the morning to watch each  of her races live.   Even as her success as a professional runner has taken her across the  globe, her Vermont roots remain strong. Elle still considers Montgomery  Center her home, where she lives with her husband, Jamie, who is also a  dairy farmer. On September 25, Elle was celebrated at a welcome home  parade through the town of Richford. Throngs of fans cheered her on as  she took her well-deserved victory lap.   It is hard to overstate how proud we Vermonters are of Elle. She is  only the second Vermonter to compete in the Olympics for track and  field. At only 26, I am sure we will see more from Elle in the future.  I am very excited how Elle continues to perform in the years to come.   I ask unanimous consent that the article ``Welcome Home, Elle!  Richford Community Hosts Parade in Honor of Home-Town Olympian Elle  Purrier St. Pierre,'' published in the St. Albans Messenger, be printed  in the Record.    Welcome Home Elle! Richford Community Hosts Parade in Honor of Home-                  Town Olympian Elle Purrier St. Pierre                            (By Ruthie LaRoche)         On Saturday, Sept. 25, Elle Purrier St. Pierre walked       beneath the American Flag, hoisted high on the Richford       Volunteer Fire Department's ladder truck as part of a Welcome       Home parade held in her honor.        This August, Purrier St. Pierre represented the United       States of America, racing in the women's 1500 meter at the       2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.        Purrier St. Pierre walked just steps behind a white and red       heifer draped in the Stars and Stripes, the community she       represented with pride, cheering and waving as she passed.        A little while later, Purrier St. Pierre stood on a podium,       the crowd of parade-goers now encircling her, listening in       rapt attention as she spoke of her journey to the Olympic       stage.        Many knew her story well, but I'm sure there were portions       very few knew, and it was the unknown story that made the       community support so much more special.        ``Representing the United States of America on the Olympic       and world stage has been one of the highest honors of my life       so far,'' said Purrier St. Pierre.        ``Competing at the Olympics is the epitome of sports, and       wearing those three letters (USA) across my chest was one of       the best feelings I've ever had.''   Purrier St. Pierre spoke of her time in Tokyo and the thoughts of home                 that buoyed her up from half a world away         ``These Olympic Games were different than most, but they       were still astounding and historic. I tried to embrace the       challenges brought on by the pandemic but found myself       feeling very isolated throughout the experience,'' said       Purrier St. Pierre.        ``I spent many days alone since no friends or family       members were allowed to travel to Tokyo. I was trying to       mentally and physically prepare to compete against runners       who were the best in the world.''     Purrier St. Pierre was preparing to compete in the most significant                             race of her career         ``I knew I had prepared well for many years, but I'd be       lying if I didn't say it wasn't extremely daunting. Something       that helped me regain my courage was remembering the great       country, state, and community I was representing,'' said       Purrier St. Pierre.        ``I was thousands of miles away, but I felt the love from       this place and all of you. That love and support helped me       persevere through the games.''    On the team bus in Tokyo, Purrier St. Pierre received a message from                    home that brought tears to her eyes         ``I was on my way to the track to make my Olympic debut; I       opened my phone and saw a  [[Page S6775]]       picture of the American flag hanging from the Richford fire       truck high above Main Street, and I immediately began to       cry,'' said Purrier St. Pierre.        ``I cannot begin to explain how much your compassion and       support through this experience has meant to me.''        As she took the track, Purrier St. Pierre thought of the       community behind her.        ``I was racing for way more than myself; I was racing for       all the people that got me there and hoping to inspire the       next young generation in this great community,'' said Purrier       St. Pierre.        ``I was humbled to see the Franklin County community come       together to support one of their own; I could read your       messages, see your signs, and watch in awe as you all showed       up to the Richford High School gym to cheer me on.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, 10 years ago this month, Congress worked on  a broad bipartisan basis to pass the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act,  the biggest change to the United States patent laws in half a century.  The patent system exists to create incentives that promote the progress  of science and the useful arts for the benefit of the public. Our whole  economy depends on a working patent system that reinforces high-quality  patents while ensuring that poor-quality patents cannot throw a wrench  into the gears. Today, I am proud to introduce, alongside Senator  Cornyn, the bipartisan Restoring the America Invents Act to ensure that  the improvements we made to maintain high patent quality in the Leahy- Smith Act continue to work as Congress intended.   One of the challenges we confronted 10 years ago was that too many  invalid patents were being issued. Instead of rewarding true  innovation, these patents were being used to indefinitely extend  monopolies, quash competition, and harm American consumers. For  example, in the pharmaceutical industry, brand-name drug companies  would artificially extend a drug's patent term by patenting minor and  insignificant changes to the underlying product. In other industries,  entities that did not even make products would buy up tens of thousands  of questionable patents covering simple and obvious actions like doing  business on the internet, and they would sue thousands of small  businesses that sold innovative products online.   One of the biggest accomplishments of the Leahy-Smith Act was that it  empowered members of the public to challenge a patent's validity at the  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office--PTO--directly, providing a faster,  less expensive, and more accessible avenue than litigation in the  courts. These proceedings, called inter partes review  [[Page S6783]]  and post-grant review, have been wildly successful. According to one  economic impact study, in one 5-year period, the Leahy-Smith Act saved  the U.S. economy $2.64 billion in litigation costs alone, with more  than $1 billion more in added personal income for Americans.   The Leahy-Smith Act's new proceedings have been used thousands of  times and have had the aggregate impact of improving the quality of  patents in our patent system. Unfortunately, over time and especially  during the last administration, the PTO has limited the availability of  these proceedings beyond what Congress intended. The PTO began  routinely declining to hear challenges brought by members of the  public, even when those challenges met timing requirements, met all  other statutory criteria, and would have likely succeeded on the  merits. In 2020, roughly one in five challenges was summarily denied  proceedings by the PTO, undermining the intent of the Leahy-Smith Act.   Furthermore, whether a patent is valid should not depend on which  party is in the White House or what individual is in charge of the  agency. During the last administration, there was reported  nontransparent meddling by the PTO Director in the work of the  administrative patent judges who were making inter partes and post- grant review decisions. While the Supreme Court has recently held that  the PTO Director should have the last word on patentability decisions,  the public deserves to know when decisions are being made by dedicated  civil servant judges and when they are being made by the politically  appointed Director.   This bill fixes both problems and generally restores the Leahy-Smith  Act to what Congress intended 10 years ago. It requires institution of  inter partes review petitions that meet the statutory criteria and  further encourages district courts to stay litigation when a parallel  proceeding at the PTO will resolve the same validity issues. The stay  factors in this bill are intended to put a heavy thumb on the scale in  favor of a district court stay, preventing duplicative proceedings, and  protecting patent owners from having to repeatedly defend their  patents. The Restoring the America Invents Act further imposes  transparency. The PTO Director must provide a separate written opinion  when overriding part or all of a decision of administrative patent  judges, and the PTO Director may not interfere in any way in the  judges' initial decisionmaking. The public and any reviewing court  should get to see the judges' decisions first, before any political  actor might change the outcome.   This bill further clarifies other aspects of the Leahy-Smith Act. It  clarifies the intent of the Leahy-Smith Act that the PTO can address,  in inter partes review proceedings, certain clear instances of  invalidity: double patenting, where applicants amass dozens of patents  covering trivial iterations of an already-patented drug or other  product; and admissions by the patent owner, in the patent itself, that  someone else first came up with the invention. It clarifies that, when  patent owners want to amend their patent claims during these post- issuance proceedings, the PTO must fully examine and vet those claims  before issuing them. Likewise, the bill prohibits the PTO from issuing  new claims to a patent that are essentially the same as existing  claims, addressing the problem of patent thickets. And the Restoring  the America Invents Act addresses multiple related proceedings pending  at the PTO, specifying that the PTO must decide ahead of time how to  proceed, to avoid conflicting outcomes from separate parts of the  agency. This is in addition to the agency's ongoing obligation to make  rules addressing common situations, such as under 35 U.S.C.  Sec. 316(a)(4). The PTO should study frequent scenarios and determine  whether new regulations are needed to address them.   Fundamentally, we need to address why the PTO issues invalid patents  in the first place. But when these invalid patents have already been  issued, they need to be addressed on the back end. On this 10th  anniversary of the Leahy-Smith Act, I am proud to introduce this bill-- the Restoring the America Invents Act, that will restore the patent  system so it can continue to accomplish its goals into the next decade  and beyond, reinforcing high-quality patents while ensuring that poor- quality patents don't disrupt the American economy, costing Americans  untold sums in unreasonable drug costs and overly inflated prices  generally. I am excited to work alongside Senator Cornyn, on a  bipartisan basis, to pass this important piece of legislation. The  Founders envisioned the patent system to promote the progress of  science and the useful arts for the benefit of the public. It is time  to get back to the Founders' vision. I hope the Senate will act quickly  to pass this critical legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, Ms. Lummis, Mr. Johnson,          Mr. Lee, and Mr. Marshall):   S. 2895.
