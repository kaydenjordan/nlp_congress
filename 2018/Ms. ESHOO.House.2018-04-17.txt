 Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleague and dear friend, Paul  Tonko, for organizing this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, to all of Congresswoman Slaughter's staff that is here,  we pay tribute to them. She loved them, and she would talk about each  one of them. I don't know which one is which, but she thought that we  all knew which one was which. She had all the stories straight. She was  so proud of them.   There is so much to be said about Louise. She was a great mother. She  was a fabulous wife to Bob. She was a microbiologist. She was a great  grandmother. She represented a district in western New York with a  Kentucky accent. I don't think that will ever happen again.   She had a beautiful singing voice. I don't know how many Members know  that. When our country was attacked and the Congress went out in front  of the Capitol, it was Congresswoman Slaughter who started singing  ``God Bless America,'' and everyone joined in on that.   She was not only proud to represent the home of the feminists, those  revolutionaries, she was one herself, and she was damn proud of it. She  wasn't an apologist for any of it. She was proud of it because she  understood that that was what was going to move America forward.   She loved this House. She had a home on the Hill, and she had a home  in her district, but she loved this House. She used to stand right  here. This is where she did her work.   Mr. Speaker, don't cross Louise. Don't ever cross Louise. She was a  lady, but I will tell you something, you would feel the wrath of Louise  Slaughter if you went the other way on her.   The way I will always remember Louise is that she knew how to love.  She knew how to love well. She had a fierceness about her in taking  care of her constituents. They belonged to her, and she belonged to  them. As the leader recalled, the tribute they paid to her at her  memorial I think was second to none.   So, Louise, my friend, no one is ever going to fill your shoes around  here, but we stand taller because we knew you.   She showed us the right way to be a friend, the best way to represent  people, and how to fight tough and fight hard for the right things.   I loved Louise's accent. When you would see her on the floor, she  would say: Anna, have I told you this week that I just love you?   When she spoke, it was as if her words were just a security blanket  around you. You knew that she meant it. It was tender, it was loving,  and you knew that you had one of the best partners you could ever have  in any undertaking.   I think that Louise is very happy in heaven. I have no doubt that she  is chairing the big Rules Committee in the sky. I have no doubt that  when she got to the gate, there was absolutely no discussion whatsoever  as to whether she was going to take a high place in heaven because of  everything that she did on Earth.   So, Louise, be happy there. You earned it.   We miss her here, but we know that her spirit is with us, it always  will be, and that we will love her across eternity.        There was a poet that wrote these beautiful words: So she       passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for her on the       other side.    God rest you, Louise.
