 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Black History  Month, which has its roots with Carter G. Woodson as early as 1915 and  has been officially recognized since 1976.   Black History Month is an opportunity for celebration and discovery.  It is a time to share the successes and  [[Page S449]]  contributions of Black Americans that are woven deeply into the fabric  of American history.   Over the last year, we Marylanders made exciting history as Wes Moore  became our State's 63rd Governor, the first person of color to hold  that office and the only currently serving Black Governor in the  Nation. We also elected Anthony Brown, former Member of the House of  Representatives and a former Lt. Governor of Maryland, to be attorney  general. He, too, is the first Black to hold this position in our  State. They join Adrienne Jones, the first Black and first woman to  serve as Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, who has held that  post since 2019.   Nationally, the Senate made history by confirming Justice Jackson as  the first Black woman to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme  Court of the United States.   Mr. President, we are making progress. Representation matters. When  young girls and young boys of color see women and men who look like  them holding positions of power, it makes a real, important difference  in the expectations and aspirations they set for themselves.   As Bernice King, the youngest daughter of the late Reverend Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., and Chief Executive Officer of the Martin  Luther King, Jr. Center of Nonviolent Social Change, said:         If you don't think representation matters, you are probably       well-represented.    Representation matters in history as well. Throughout our country's  history, we have seen blatant attacks on the teaching of African  American history as well as gaping omissions. Today, unfortunately, we  continue to see these tactics playing out across our Nation.   Let me share a little of that history with you. The first Africans  arrived in North America in the 16th and 17th centuries. A group of  former Spanish slaves, freed by Englishman Francis Drake, arrived in  California in 1579 during his first voyage to circumnavigate the world.   The first recorded group of enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia in  1619. They would be the first of hundreds of thousands brought here  against their will and forced into servitude in North America. In 1641,  Mathias de Sousa was elected to the colonial Maryland legislature. He  was the first person of African descent to hold elected office in  British North America.   By 1776, at the time of the American Revolutionary War, estimates are  that about 20 percent of the population of the British colonies was of  African descent--20 percent.   By 1788, when our Constitution was ratified, the Founding Fathers  thought it appropriate that each of these men, women, and children were  only counted as three-fifths of a person.   After the Civil War, with the abolition of slavery, Reconstruction  meant opportunities for African-Americans in the South and the North,  including the right to vote and be elected to office, to own land, and  to participate in business.   In 1870, Mississippi elected the first African-American U.S. Senator,  Hiram Rhodes Revels, a one-time minister and school principal in  Baltimore. He was followed by Senator Blanche K. Bruce, who served in  this body from 1875 to 1881. African Americans were regularly elected  to Congress until 1901. From there, it would be 28 years until another  Black man served in the Congress.   The years between were turbulent and regressive. The summer of 1919  was dubbed ``Red Summer'' as White-on-Black violence exploded in dozens  of cities across the country and continued thereafter. On May 21, 1921,  Greenwood, a prosperous Black neighborhood in Tulsa, OK, known as Black  Wall Street, became the site of one of the most violent attacks on  Black freedom and progress in our Nation's history: the Tulsa Race  Massacre of 1921. A White mob killed an estimated 300 people and  destroyed more than 1,400 homes and businesses. Thousands of people  were left homeless.   Despite its severity and destructiveness, however, the Tulsa Race  Massacre was barely mentioned in the history books until the late 1990s  when the State formed the commission to document the incident. Tulsa is  but one example. Regrettably, there are many more instances of White  mob violence that also never made it into the history books.   Black history is American history, and attempts to whitewash or  ignore the role that African Americans have played in this Nation, even  before our founding, is an immense disservice. Slavery and segregation  and racism are ugly and dehumanizing, but they are part of America's  history.   For too long, our history lessons failed to acknowledge the African- American experience and the role that African Americans have played in  American history. We should all learn about the inventors like George  Washington Carver, who popularized crop rotation. Henry Blair, the  second African-American inventor in U.S. history to be issued a patent,  was born a free man in Glen Ross, MD, in 1807. His farm machinery  revolutionized planting. Garrett Morgan patented the first traffic  safety signal and developed the first gas mask. We should all learn  about the entrepreneurs like Madam C.J. Walker, whose hair care and  cosmetic business made her the first female self-made millionaire in  the United States. Robert Johnson cofounded Black Entertainment  Television on his way to becoming America's first Black billionaire.   We should all learn about scientists like Maryland's own Benjamin  Banneker, a largely self-taught mathematician, astronomer, and  surveyor. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson furthered our knowledge of  star and galaxy formation and evolution and has done as much as Carl  Sagan to popularize science, especially astronomy. All of these  individuals should take their place in our history books alongside  Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and Dr. King.   Unfortunately, instead of expanding the teaching of Black history, we  are seeing a retrenchment. In Florida, we have seen one of the most  brazen attacks on the teaching of African-American history and culture  with the Governor's rejection of the College Board's new Advanced  Placement African-American studies course. For more than a year,  Florida officials pressured the College Board to change its curriculum.   College Board officials have since denied they capitulated, but on  the first day of Black History Month, they released a revised  curriculum that deleted certain topics related to Black history. It  appears the board was eager to keep selling its program to Florida.  This past Saturday, board officials issued a statement saying:         We deeply regret not immediately denouncing the Florida       Department of Education's slander, magnified by the DeSantis       administration's subsequent comments that African-American       studies ``lacks educational value.'' Our failure to raise our       voice betrayed Black scholars everywhere and those who have       long toiled to build this remarkable field.    Florida is not acting alone. According to the Brookings Institution,  nearly 20 States have introduced legislation to ban any discussion  about conscious bias, privilege, discrimination, and oppression. At  least nine have succeeded in passing such legislation.   These efforts are aimed at suppressing the discussion of  uncomfortable truths about our past and even our present. They  eliminate responsibility for the collective work that we all must do  not only to acknowledge the centuries of harm done to Black communities  but also remedy the lasting effects of these harms.   The continued suppression of history happens in many more places than  schools alone, and we are all poorer for it. So much of what we have  learned for generations about history, music, culture, and more has  diminished or even extinguished the role of African-American creators,  writers, musicians, and others. We must teach our children and learn  for ourselves the full breadth of the American story--the good, the  bad, and the ugly--if we truly aspire to form a more perfect Union.   Philip Graham, the former president and publisher of the Washington  Post, is credited with saying ``Journalism is the first rough draft of  history.'' This is especially true with regard to Black history.   For decades, White newspapers barely acknowledged the African- American communities in their readership, except when there were  negative stories to tell. Brent Staples, an editorial writer at the New  York Times recently  [[Page S450]]  described the culpability of White newspapers:         Newspapers that championed white supremacy throughout the       pre-civil rights South paved the way for lynching by       declaring African Americans nonpersons. They embraced the       language once used at slave auctions by denying Black       citizens street courtesy titles Mr. and Mrs. and referring to       them in news stories as ``the negro.''    One year ago, the Baltimore Sun declared:         We are deeply and profoundly sorry: For decades, The       Baltimore Sun promoted policies that oppressed Black       Marylanders; we are working to make amends.    The newspaper founder, Arunah S. Abell ``was a Southern sympathizer  who supported slavery and segregation.'' As the Sun editorial stated:         Instead of using its platform, which at times included both       a morning and evening newspaper, to question and strike down       racism, The Baltimore Sun frequently employed prejudice as a       tool of the times. It fed the fears and anxiety of white       readers with stereotypes and caricatures that reinforced       their erroneous beliefs about Black Americans. Through its       news coverage and editorial opinions, The Sun sharpened,       preserved and furthered the structural racism that still       subjugates Black Marylanders in our communities today.    As White newspapers perpetrated lies and negative stories, Black  journalism emerged to fill the void. Freedom's Journal, the first  Black-owned and -operated newspaper, was founded on March 16, 1827, in  New York City. The newspaper's inaugural broadsheet powerfully  declared:         We wish to plead our own cause. Too long others have spoken       for us.    The Maryland-based Afro-American newspaper began publishing in 1892.  As the firm that owned the paper fell into bankruptcy, John H. Murphy,  Sr., a former slave who worked at the newspaper, borrowed $200 from his  wife and purchased its equipment in 1897. In 1922, the Afro was the  third largest Black-owned newspaper on the east coast, behind the  Chicago Defender and the Negro World.   The Afro-American, headquartered in Baltimore, now is the oldest  Black business in Maryland and the longest running, African-American  family-owned newspaper in the United States. John Sr.'s great- granddaughter, Dr. Frances ``Toni'' Draper, is the current publisher.   This Monday, I was privileged to join Dr. Draper and other leaders  from the local community to unveil a $2.2-million earmark for the AFRO  Charities, alongside my colleagues, Chris Van Hollen and Representative  Kweisi Mfume. These funds will be used to preserve the archives of the  Afro-American and develop a permanent home and research center for  these materials, the largest collection of its kind in our country.   The Afro-American has been published for more than 130 years. I have  seen a small fraction of these archives, and I can tell you that there  is so much history that needs to be preserved for the community, the  State of Maryland, and the Nation. The project will be digitized. There  are approximately 3 million photographs, several thousand letters, back  issues of the AFRO, personal audio recordings of U.S. Supreme Court  Justice Thurgood Marshall and Dr. King, and so much more.   Since its inception, the Black press has played a critical role in  the struggle for freedom for African-Americans by highlighting issues  that mainstream media ignored or misrepresented. As Dr. Draper of the  Afro-American wrote recently:         If there were no Black press, would America draft its story       honestly and equitably, and in a way that bends--however       slowly--towards justice? We think not. The Black press in       America plays a crucial role shaping and preserving our       community's history from the perspective of our people and       advocating for a better, brighter day.    Today, so many Black journalists continue to walk boldly in this  tradition, uncovering the stories of our time with an eye towards  justice and civil rights. At the forefront of these media professionals  is the National Association of Black Journalists, which is  headquartered at the University of Maryland, College Park. This  organization was founded in 1975. It is a nonprofit association with  more than 4,000 members in the United States and worldwide. The  organization advocates for diversity in newsrooms, works to create  strong ties among Black journalists, and expands job opportunities for  Black media professionals. The organization provides scholarships and  works with high school students to encourage Black students to pursue  journalism careers. Black history is America's history. Black  journalism is essential to telling the American story.   On March 31, 1968, Dr. King gave his last Sunday sermon--this one was  at Washington National Cathedral. He said:         We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is       long but it bends toward justice.    The obstacles we face are harmful and hurtful. But they are temporary  stumbling blocks.   On February 1, I was proud to join my friend Representative Mfume in  introducing the National Council on African American History and  Culture Act of 2023. Our legislation would create a 12-person National  Council on African American History and Culture to advise the National  Endowment of the Humanities in the best ways to amplify the work of  black creators, strengthening teaching and learning in schools to  ensure Black history and culture is recognized, and provide critical  resources dedicated to preserving Black history.   On February 7, I was proud to invite Governor Moore to be my guest at  President Biden's State of the Union Address. Seated behind President  Biden was Vice President Kamala Harris, a woman of color and the first  female Vice President.   Before the State of the Union Address on February 4, the Senate  Curator removed the bust of former Chief Justice Roger B. Taney from  the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the Senate wing of the Capitol  Building. We are making progress. The removal was in accordance with  legislation I am proud to introduce with Representative Steny Hoyer.  Taney, a Marylander, authored the infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857,  ruling that African Americans could not be considered U.S. citizens and  that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in the U.S.  territories. Our legislation directs the Joint Committee on the Library  to commission a bust of Thurgood Marshall, another Marylander, for  display in the Capitol Complex, preferably near the Old Supreme Court  Chamber.   One Justice sought to prolong slavery; the other--the first African- American to sit on the Nation's highest Court--helped to advance civil  rights in this Nation due to his successful Supreme Court argument in  Brown v. Board of Education, which held that the doctrine of ``separate  but equal'' has no place in American society.   Removing the Taney bust from the Old Supreme Court Chamber is making  the right decision about whom we choose to honor. Across the Nation,  monuments to enslavers are coming down.   In Requiem for a Nun, William Faulkner famously wrote:         The past is never dead. It's not even past.    Black history is America's history. Black History Month is so  important because it forces us to face who we are and where we are  going. In doing so, it helps us respect and ultimately aspire to be a  more perfect Union.                   national children's dental health month     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize February as  National Children's Dental Health Month. Since 1981, this month has  afforded us the opportunity to acknowledge the importance of children's  dental health, recognize the significant strides we have made, and  renew our commitment to ensuring all children in our country have  access to affordable and comprehensive dental services. To echo Former  U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, ``There is no health without oral  health.''   Despite recent encouraging reductions in tooth decay, also known as  dental caries, particularly among younger children, dental caries  remains one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. About one  in four preschool children experienced caries in primary teeth, and at  least one in six children aged 6 to 11 years experienced dental caries  in permanent teeth. Deferring routine preventive and restorative dental  care increases the need for more advanced and expensive dental  services, which are even less accessible, further widening the  inequalities.   There is a persistent pattern of disparities in which children from  lower  [[Page S451]]  income and minority racial and ethnic groups generally experience more  disease and have less access to treatment. Children from low-income  households are twice as likely to have cavities, compared with children  from higher income households. According to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, CDC, for children aged 2 to 5 years, about 33  percent of Mexican-American and 28 percent of non-Hispanic Black  children have had cavities in their primary teeth, compared with 18  percent of non-Hispanic White children. For children aged 12 to 19,  nearly 70 percent of Mexican-American children have had cavities in  their permanent teeth, compared with 54 percent of non-Hispanic White  children.   Tooth and gum pain can impede a child's healthy development,  including the ability to learn, play, and eat nutritious foods.  Children who have poor oral health often miss more school and get lower  grades than children who have good oral health.   Untreated cavities can cause pain, infections, and can lead to  problems eating, speaking, and learning. In some cases, they can even  be fatal. In 2007, Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Prince George's  County resident, tragically died. Deamonte's death was particularly  heartbreaking because it was entirely preventable. What started out as  a toothache turned into a severe brain infection that could have been  prevented by an $80 extraction. After multiple surgeries and a lengthy  hospital stay, sadly, Deamonte passed away 16 years ago this month.   Since the tragic death of Deamonte, we have made significant progress  in improving access to pediatric dental care in our country,  particularly in my home State of Maryland. For example, in 2009,  Congress reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP,  with an important addition: a guaranteed pediatric dental benefit.  Research shows that CHIP generally offers more comprehensive benefits  at a much lower cost to families than private coverage.   Additionally, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, has significantly  improved the affordability of and access to healthcare, including  dental care, for millions of Americans. The ACA required most insurers  to cover essential health benefits, EHB. I was particularly pleased  that pediatric services, specifically pediatric dental care, were  identified as part of the 10 categories of healthcare services included  in the EHB package. As a result, pediatric dental insurance coverage is  available for purchase on all State-based insurance marketplaces, like  in Maryland, and the Federal marketplace. The dental coverage offered  through ACA plans in all States covers a minimum set of benefits to  ensure children have coverage for essential dental services.   Expansion of dental insurance coverage has enabled early intervention  for more children from low-income households. Today, 9 in 10 children  in the United States have dental insurance. Dental care is also a  mandatory benefit in Medicaid for children since it is provided through  the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program.  Still, research has found that although State Medicaid Programs cover  children's dental services, fewer than half of all publicly insured  children get recommended care.   Therefore, there is more work to be done to ensure that once children  have access, they actually get the care they need. This week, I was  proud to join Senators Lujan and Collins in introducing the Oral Health  Literacy and Awareness Act. The legislation would create an oral health  literacy campaign, leveraging existing healthcare programs, to ensure  that children start off strong and develop important oral health habits  for the rest of their lives.   Additionally, in January, I was pleased to introduce, along with  Senator Stabenow and Congresswoman Barragan S. 109, the Ensuring Kids  Have Access to Medically Necessary Dental Care Act. Our legislation  would eliminate lifetime and annual limits for dental care for children  under CHIP. The bill would also require States to provide  ``wraparound'' CHIP dental coverage, meaning CHIP would cover dental  services for eligible children who are not enrolled in CHIP. Currently,  if a child is eligible for CHIP but instead has coverage under a group  health plan or employer-sponsored insurance, States have the option of  providing dental-only coverage to this child through CHIP. This bill  requires that dental coverage be offered.   In addition to dental insurance coverage for children, improving oral  health care for the parents and communities can improve children's oral  health outcomes. For example, a recent study found that Medicaid adult  dental coverage was associated with a reduction in the prevalence of  untreated tooth decay among children after parents had access to  coverage for at least 1 year. The study found that all children saw  improvements in oral health, and non-Hispanic Black children  experienced larger and more persistent improvements than non-Hispanic  White children. A Medicaid dental benefit for adults would enhance the  progress for children and provide much needed dental care and improve  oral health outcomes for adults.   That is why I am proud to champion legislation, the Medicaid Dental  Benefit Act, which would extend comprehensive dental health benefits to  tens of millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid. The legislation  would also provide States with a 100-percent Federal match for the  dental benefit for 3 years. This investment of Federal funds would  support States to set up or improve their dental benefit and includes  funding for culturally competent and linguistically appropriate  provider education in addition to outreach efforts to better connect  enrollees to oral health care. I was particularly pleased that, last  year, Maryland extended access to dental care fo adult Medicaid  beneficiaries, providing access to over 740,000 Marylanders.   Oral health is an integral part of overall health. It should not be a  luxury or reserved for the most privileged. Access to affordable dental  care is essential to preventing tragedies like the death of Deamonte  Driver from ever happening again. So, as we celebrate, we must also  recommit to expanding access to afford care to all children. I urge my  colleagues to join me in this effort. Let us continue to building upon  the progress made to date in advancing the access of oral health to  protect individuals around the country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Kahn nomination be considered expired and the  vote on confirmation of the nomination be at a time determined by the  majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 44, Jill E. Steinberg  to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Georgia; that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    The clerk will report the nomination.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jill E.  Steinberg, of Georgia, to be United States Attorney for the Southern  District of Georgia for the term of four years.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
