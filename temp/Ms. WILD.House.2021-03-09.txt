 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the most important pro- labor legislation in several generations, the Protecting the Right to  Organize Act, otherwise known as the PRO Act.   For far too long, the deck has been stacked against the right to  freely organize and collectively bargain. We have seen the result.  Despite massive gains in productivity and economic growth, working- and  middle-class American workers' purchasing power and real wages have  barely moved from where they were 40 years ago. Meanwhile, the gains  that were created by those workers have flowed overwhelmingly to the  super wealthy at the very top.   Let's level the playing field and give America's workers a seat at  the table. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the PRO Act, and I  urge the Senate to pass it and get it to the President's desk for  signature.
