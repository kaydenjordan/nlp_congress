 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it has been a rough weekend in Texas. Last  weekend, tragedy struck the city of Allen, TX, and a driver in  Brownsville drove into a group of migrants, killing a number of them  and injuring others. In both cases, the circumstances surrounding these  incidents are still being investigated.   On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, people of all ages visited a  popular outdoor mall in the suburbs north of Dallas. That is where  Allen is. Shoppers filtered in and out of stores with their children  and were enjoying what appeared to be a normal weekend, but, as we know  now, the day took a tragic turn when a man drove up to the crowded  shopping mall and got out of his car with a gun and began  firing. Shoppers ducked behind cars and ran into stores. Customers  crowded into tiny storage rooms. Parents used their own bodies to  protect their children. The shooter murdered eight innocent people and  wounded seven others before being killed himself by police. The victims  were between the ages of 3 and 37.    A patch on the shooter's clothing and his social media posts suggest  that he might have espoused White supremacist and other extremist  views. As I said, law enforcement is still gathering information about  him and his motives, but what we know so far is that he was discharged  from the army prematurely due to mental health reasons. But it is  unclear if that discharge or any other factors would have legally  disqualified him from purchasing a firearm.   Obviously, a dishonorable discharge, a felony conviction--those sorts  of things--would result in your being prohibited under existing law  from purchasing a firearm, but we don't know whether there are other  circumstances beyond his premature discharge from the army after only 3  months due to mental health reasons which rise to the level necessary  to invoke one of those disqualifying actions.   So at this moment, there is still a lot we don't know. And, of  course, at times like this, we are all trying to make sense of this  unspeakable tragedy. Obviously, I am eager to learn more about the  circumstances that led to this attack. But one thing is for sure, and  that is local law enforcement officials leading this investigation and  searching for answers have already done heroic work, thanks to an Allen  Police Department officer who was at the mall for other reasons and who  was able to respond quickly and neutralize the shooter. But for that  police officer, many others would have been injured and died.   So I am grateful to the police officers, the emergency medical  technicians, and healthcare workers who responded to this tragedy--as I  said, especially the heroic officer who responded to gunfire and  immediately ran toward the danger.   The shooter was carrying multiple weapons and had five additional  guns in his car. If not for the quick action of that police officer,  there is no question that even more families would be grieving today. I  have spoken to local officials who are responding to this crisis,  including Mayor Ken Fulk and Police Chief Brian Harvey. I offered my  condolences and offered whatever help we might be able to provide,  whatever assistance we can provide.   One of the things Chief Harvey told me that he particularly  appreciated is the FBI had come forward with crime victim services, a  number of FBI agents providing that assistance to the victims of this  terrible shooting, which relieves a lot of the pressure on this local  police department. And, of course, the FBI is now taking the lead in  the investigation, supported by Texas Rangers, the Department of Public  Safety, and, of course, the Allen Police Department.   So, today, I join all Texans in grieving this senseless tragedy. We  mourn the eight lives that were stolen and lift up the survivors, who  will never forget the horror they endured that day.   I know, Mr. President, because I have been part of negotiations over  the last few years involving the so-called Fix NICS legislation-- Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and I took the lead  [[Page S1556]]  on that bill to try to fix gaps in the background check system. The one  area of consensus between people who are avid supporters of the Second  Amendment and those who believe that we ought to ban some types of  weapons, even for law-abiding citizens--the one area we can agree on is  that people with criminal records and people who are mentally ill  should not be able to purchase firearms. And that is simply enforcing  current law.   So we were able to do something in the Fix NICS bill a couple of  years back--I think it was 2018 now--that I believed met my test for  whether we should do legislation like that, and that is: Will it save  lives? And I believe it has.   More recently, we passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which  is so new that it is only now being implemented. This bill did, of  course, a number of things. It provided for an enhanced background  checks for gun purchasers between the age of 18 and 21. The reason why  that age group is so important is because the profile of many of these  disaffected young men--who are obviously suffering from severe mental  illness, who are so tortured that they not only want to commit suicide,  they want to take other people with them--that cohort, that group of  young purchasers, I believed we needed to go back and look at some of  the juvenile records for mental health adjudications, for criminal  convictions.   These are the sorts of things that, if you had been an adult, would  disqualify you, and you would not be able to purchase a firearm under  existing law. But in Uvalde, TX, Salvador Ramos turned 18 years old,  and even though everybody in the neighborhood knew he was a ticking  time bomb--he had tortured animals; he had posted threats on social  media; he shot his own grandmother who insisted he go back to school  after a long absence due to COVID restrictions--he was able to purchase  firearms without revealing anything about his juvenile record, without  consulting with the local police, who knew him well.   That has all changed by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. And the  most recent tally I saw from the FBI is that approximately 100  different purchases have been intercepted for individuals between the  age of 18 and 21 who had disqualifying juvenile records that are now  being queried as a result of that bill.   But the other parts of it that were so important are that we made the  single largest investment in community-based mental health care in  American history in that bill. We were able to find an offset so it  didn't involve spending new money, but it was billions of dollars in  investment so more communities can have locally based community health  services. Because, frankly, there are too many people falling through  that net. The net doesn't really even exist.   And we also made sure that our schools provided more comprehensive  services. Part of the problem, though, is that, as there is more demand  for mental health counseling and treatment, there are not enough people  qualified to provide those sorts of services. So this is a huge  problem.   The bill provided grants and incentives to educational institutions  so more people would train in those areas and so there would be more  resources available for people suffering from psychological stress or  even mental illness so that they can hopefully get better and become  productive members of society.   So I know, at times like this, people say: Well, we need to do  something. Twice in recent history the U.S. Congress has come together  on a bipartisan basis to do something that meets that test I mentioned  a moment ago: Will it save lives? And I believe, in both instances, the  legislation we passed that was signed by the President will save lives.   But, of course, then we see what happened in Allen, and we wonder:  What else is there? I mentioned the fact that these mass shooters, not  only are they taking the lives of innocent people, they are,  essentially, committing suicide themselves. They know they are not  going to make it out of here alive. And there is this phenomenon that I  learned from law enforcement called ``suicide by cop'' where actually  mentally ill individuals who are unwilling to take their own life will  encounter the police in a violent encounter which results in their loss  of life, which, essentially, is a way of their committing suicide.   I believe these mass shootings are also a form of suicide because  these shooters know they are not going to make their way out of it.  But, tragically, not only do they take their own life; they take the  lives of innocent others.   So we grieve with all the families and the entire community in and  around Allen, TX, as we do each time one of these incidents occurs, and  we will continue to look for ways we can find solutions to this sort of  violence. But eventually or ultimately, I believe, what we are talking  about are crimes; that while we can investigate crimes, we can  prosecute crimes, we can punish crime, and we can even deter crime, but  we haven't yet figured a way to stop crime.   But, hopefully, there is more we can do.    Mr. President, I honor today Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa  for his lifelong commitment to the rule of law, particularly his 40  years of extraordinary service in our Federal judiciary. Currently,  Judge Hinojosa is the longest serving Federal judge remaining in active  service.   Born in Rio Grande City, TX, to Miguel and Josefina Hinojosa, Judge  Hinojosa learned the value of hard work early on, graduating  valedictorian from Rio Grande City High School. Judge Hinojosa then  went to the University of Texas, where he graduated with honors in  1972. Judge Hinojosa continued his studies at Harvard Law School. After  graduating from Harvard Law School in 1975, Judge Hinojosa clerked for  a year on the Texas Supreme Court. Judge Hinojosa then entered private  practice in McAllen at the law firm Ewers & Toothaker. Rising to the  level of partner in 1979, Judge Hinojosa specialized in business  litigation and employment law. In 1983, President Reagan nominated  Judge Hinojosa to be a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern  District of Texas. On May 5, 1983, he received his formal commission.   During Judge Hinojosa's 40 years on the bench, he has served with  distinction, fairness, and impartiality. His peers, colleagues, and the  Texas legal community have recognized his immense impact by awarding  him the University of Texas Distinguished Alumnus Award, the Edward J.  Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award, and the Border Texan of  the Year.   As a district court judge, Judge Hinojosa has tirelessly worked to  improve the rule of law. Indeed, he has taken on leadership roles in  the Fifth Circuit Judicial Counsel, the Judicial Conference of the  United States, and on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. In these various  positions, he has helped craft solutions and made recommendations to  improve sentencing, the operations of the courts, and access to  justice.   Judge Hinojosa's distinguished service extends beyond the courtroom.  Judge Hinojosa served on the board of directors of the John G. and  Marie Stella Kennedy Memorial foundation, the board of trustees of the  University of the Incarnate Word, the board of trustees of the  University of Texas Law School Foundation, and the board of directors  of the Ex Students Association of the University of Texas.   It is evident that Judge Hinojosa has dedicated his life and career  to serving others and improving communities in Texas and beyond. For  this work and the work that he has still yet to accomplish, I would  like to recognize him. Thank you, Judge Hinojosa.  [[Page S1564]]                                ____________________
