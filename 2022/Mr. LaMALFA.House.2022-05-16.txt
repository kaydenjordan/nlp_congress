 Madam Speaker, it has become painfully obvious in recent  months how important energy and the energy supply is in all aspects of  our lives here in the United States and to our allies around the world.   The effect of not enough energy indeed has been very harmful to our  economy, yet we are at a space where  [[Page H4974]]  we have so much abundance, so much potential, and so much we were doing  just before this administration came into place. We are sitting on the  largest untapped oil reserve in the world--amazingly enough--here in  the United States.   If we had been utilizing this properly, instead of launching an  assault on domestic energy production, our Union would be in a much  better state. As we know, on the first day in office, President Biden  shut down the Keystone Pipeline, on and off, on and off over the years,  suspended pending oil and gas leases, halted domestic energy  production, which stopped exports on liquefied natural gas to our  allies overseas.   We have seen how important that is when Europe has become so reliant  on Russian natural gas. Poland recently just cut off supply buying from  Russia so they would not be so dependent, as well as the Germans and  other Eastern European countries.    Now, what we have seen since all this lack of exploration and  shortness of supply is the prices have skyrocketed on everybody. It is  really hurting rural America, especially with the need for farming  crops, fertilizer, all the different aspects that go into food  production, and that in return causes food shortages.   We are really putting ourselves in a bad, bad position by having a  lack of energy policy or one that is really an anti-energy policy. We  have seen the national average for a gallon of gas up to $4.48. In  California, it is getting closer to $6 on average.   What bothers me is that over time do people get lulled into this as  being normal? No, folks, this is not normal, and it is not necessary.  It doesn't need to be this way because, as I mentioned, we have so much  untapped energy in this country. The miracle of hydraulic fracturing  has made natural gas so abundant that we have been able to be a strong  exporter of it.   I remember not too many years ago we were figuring out, are we going  to have to find a way to have our gas imported and upgrade our ports to  bring it in? No. Hydraulic fracturing has made possible cheap natural  gas to export to our allies, such as in Western Europe. We need to be  doing much, much more of that so we don't have our friends, the  Germans, and Poland, and others, that are reliant upon energy coming  from Russia.   With the regulatory and tax policies that have discouraged gas  production, California only produces, for example, a fraction of what  it is capable of when it was once one of the leading oil and gas- producing States.   What would our Nation look like if we were producing to our full  potential? It would probably look a lot like what we were 15-16 months  ago when we had abundance in everything; energy, and food wasn't  emptying off the shelves. We would be in a much better space.   Indeed, these short-sighted policies are harming regular, everyday  Americans. Food production, I can't emphasize enough, when we are  running short on the shelves already--and this is before the 2022 crop  has even been completely planted or come in--in my home State of  California, probably half of agriculture is going to be shut down: half  of agriculture. Why? Water policy. With that lack of water policy, all  the water rushing out to the ocean in order to try to save an already  missing fish or something called Delta salinity, we are not going to  plant half of our agriculture in our home State. That has effects on  American food: costs, availability, and quality.   Are we just going to import it all? No, it is not going to work that  way. It all strings together. It is all interrelated. With that water  policy, it also negatively affects energy because we are not going to  make hydroelectric power like we can.   This administration is hell-bent on getting rid of some of our dams  in California and others around the West that make hydroelectric power.  Hydroelectric power is CO2-free, no carbon dioxide. Our last  nuclear power plant in California, they want to shut that down;  CO2-free.   The energy policy on all different aspects is collapsing. Indeed, 20  percent of the Nation's power is from nuclear source, and about 25  percent of that power is threatened, that it will be shut down within  the next 10 or 15 years if things aren't done to make up for that. We  need an energy policy that makes sense.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, President Biden's assault on domestic  energy production isn't limited to just gas and oil. A new report  revealed that a quarter of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are at risk  of closure in just a few years, raising already high energy costs to  struggling families across the country.   Despite being carbon-free, which my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle love to talk about carbon even though it represents only 0.04  percent of the gases in our atmosphere--let's play along.   Nuclear reactors make zero CO2, so why are we making it so  difficult to put in place--indeed, only one nuclear reactor has started  construction in the U.S. in the last three decades. Since 2013, 12  reactors have closed, so none new have opened.   Why are they making it so difficult to re-license existing plants or  license new ones?   Yes, we want to build in a strong safety factor. Why does it have to  cost hundreds of millions of dollars or more to do the job to keep a  CO2-free--0.04 percent of our atmosphere--keep that  CO2 down, keep these plants operating, and keep our homes  lit up.                            ____________________
