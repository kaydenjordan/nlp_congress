 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 504, legislation to  permanently authorize the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business  Travel Card Program.   Mr. Speaker, this is a common-sense measure to make permanent a  program that has been successful since its inception in 2011.   More than 30,000 Americans currently hold fast-track cards that  expedite business travel to Pacific Rim countries. The world economy is  fast-paced and constantly evolving, and it's important to reduce  bureaucratic obstacles for America to remain competitive.   The APEC Business Travel Card helps Americans travel faster and more  efficiently throughout the Asia-Pacific region, allowing them to spend  more time on business, and less time in airport lines. We must ensure  that our business leaders have the resources they need to compete in an  increasingly globalized economy, which is why I'm proud to support the  permanent extension of this program.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, S. 504.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
