 Madam Speaker, New Mexico is a border state with  Texas. Because of the extreme abortion ban, our Texas hermanas are  driving hours to receive abortion care in New Mexico.   We are receiving women's rights refugees with open arms, hearts, and  open clinics. To deputize complete strangers to interfere with a  woman's health choice is constitutionally, medically, and morally  wrong.   Many minority, LGBTQ, and low-income women can't afford to travel and  access quality healthcare. Let's pass the Women's Health Protection Act  so that we can protect women's freedom in every State.
