 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized as if in morning business for such time as I shall consume.    Madam President, first of all, I am going to do something  that is a little bit unusual. I will start off by saying thank you. We  have got a lot of people to thank. Yet we never seem to do that.   When we look at what happened in Afghanistan over the past 20 years-- I can't approximate how many times I was over there--that was tough  duty for those guys and the gals there; it was not easy. This is not  the place you want to go take a vacation--and to their families. Then,  of course, on August 26, we were reminded so painfully of what we ask  our troops and their families to do. They lay it all on the line for  this country. Our servicemembers represent the very best of us. Over  the past 20 years, they did everything that they could in Afghanistan  to root out evil and to champion American values. I couldn't be more  grateful to or have more respect for them than I have today.   I say this not only because we should say it more often but because  it is important to remember that what we saw in Afghanistan over the  past few months was not a failure of our military; it was a failure of  the Commander in Chief--the President of the United States--and the  people who advised him on his policy in Afghanistan.   I still don't know who those people are, and, you know, I have  chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee and other committees.  People ask me, when I go back to my State of Oklahoma--they will say:  Hey, who is advising the President to do all these things? I have to  tell them I don't know, and I have been around for a long time. I don't  remember any administration where I just honestly didn't know who was  making the decisions and who was advising--in this case, advising the  President.   But what we did witness, though, was a failure of the Commander in  Chief and whoever was advising him. No one can look at what happened  over the past few months and claim that it was a success like President  Biden did. It was a disaster. Leaving Americans behind, and allies-- don't forget our allies who are still left behind. It was un-American.   The administration keeps saying: ``We didn't inherit a plan.'' That  is false. They inherited a condition-based agreement and made their own  policy decisions. It was condition-based; it wasn't open-ended. It was  something that was out there, and they had the reins.   Let's keep in mind, this administration has a majority in the House  and the Senate and the White House, and they make their own decisions.  And they say: We didn't have a plan. They had a plan, and we had a  plan, but everything we did and the previous administration did was  condition-based.   So according to the condition-based approach, President Trump agreed  to withdraw our troops from Afghanistan if and only if the Taliban  acted against al-Qaida. Now, that is one of the things. There were many  other conditions, and one condition was to leave some of our troops  there, not just to walk away, to vacate. And those conditions were in  line when this administration came in, and that didn't happen.  President Biden knows it. Secretary Blinken admitted it.   When President Biden announced his decision to withdraw back in  April, a senior administration official told the Washington Post: ``The  President has judged that a condition-based approach is a recipe for  staying in Afghanistan forever.'' That is a quote.   Just last week, in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  when asked if the Taliban had severed its relationship with al-Qaida,  Secretary Blinken said the relationship has not been severed.   Let's keep that in mind. We keep hearing that, yes, they are taking  action against that administration, but the relationship has not been  severed.   Now President Biden says that he will hold the Taliban accountable,  but he didn't hold the Taliban accountable while our troops were still  in Afghanistan. I mean, that is when we had the leverage to do it, but  we didn't do it, and he has presented no plan for holding the  terrorists accountable now.   This decision--this rushed withdrawal that has left the Taliban  stronger than it was in 9/11 was President Biden's alone. He is  responsible for the chaos that followed. He is going to be held  accountable and should--everyone who advised him to make such a  horrible decision.   Now, what is more outrageous to me is that President Biden left  Americans behind. That is not something we do. He said that we were  going to get everyone out, and that didn't happen.   You know, when historians look back at this--this may be decades from  now, centuries from now--this is what they will remember: The Biden  administration knowingly left Americans behind.   The administration has tried to downplay this. Early in the  evacuation, Secretary of State Blinken said that there were perhaps  10,000 or 15,000 American citizens in Afghanistan. Our men and women in  uniform, working tirelessly and effectively with our diplomats under  incredibly difficult circumstances, managed to evacuate about 6,000 of  our citizens. Now, according to my math, that means that between 4,000  and 9,000 Americans were left behind. Secretary Blinken says that there  were only 100 and that the rest of them preferred to stay in  Afghanistan.   By the way, some legitimately did prefer to stay in Afghanistan  because they were married people, they had families, and they made it  very clear that--when something like this normally happens, families  are moved as a family unit. Not there. That is not what happened.   So that is more than bad math; it is a lie. We know and every  congressional office that tried to get people out of Afghanistan  knows--and I know this because our Senate office was very busy at that  time helping people to get out--that there were many U.S. citizens who  wanted to leave Afghanistan, but they couldn't leave because the  Taliban would not let their families go with them. Well, that is  exactly what I would expect from the terrorists who were there at that  time.   So Secretary Blinken wants you to think that these people made a  choice. He wants to hide the fact that the administration in which he  serves created its own hostage crisis and gave the Taliban the upper  hand.   Keep in mind when we talk about this, it is the Taliban. They were  the terrorists.   He also wants you to think it was the fault of those families they  didn't get out before August, repeating that they had been telling  Americans to leave for months. There is a kernel of truth to that, but  it is clouded by the fact that they repeatedly stated that it would be  a year, probably more, before Kabul was at risk of falling to the  Taliban. Instead of 36 months, the fall of Kabul only took 36 hours.   In addition to American citizens, President Biden left behind our  Afghan partners who risked everything to support our shared security  goals. I was out there many times in the past, talking about that very  thing, about the problems they had and the dangers they were in.   Now, these are not our American citizens; they were some of our  allies who were left over there. In addition to American citizens,  President Biden left behind our Afghan partners who risked everything  to support our shared security goals. As a result of the President's  decision, Afghan women and children have been thrown back to the stone  age. We all know that. We know what they are doing right now. We don't  have to guess.    Our allies and partners around the world are questioning our  credibility, our leadership, and our commitment. These are our allies.  They are not used to having the rug pulled out from under them. This is  the first time.   Our enemies are bolstered by President Biden's policy, which puts  Taliban terrorists in charge of Afghanistan--a policy that spread the  perception that we not only abandoned our allies and partners, but we  also abandoned our own citizens.   Seeing all these failures, Americans are demanding accountability,  and they deserve it.  [[Page S6610]]    But let's make this crystal clear: None of this is the fault of our  military. Our military leaders, the ones with real experience on the  ground, advised the same thing that I did, and that is, leave a small  force in Afghanistan. Now, this would have supported the Afghan  military, prevented the Taliban's takeover, kept the pressure on the  terrorists, reassured our regional partners, and kept our homeland  safe.   President Biden pretends that none of this was possible. He claims  that he had two options: a massive deployment or zero troops, which is  not true. In fact, I publicly supported a third option: maintain a  small force to preserve our air power. We can't do the air power  without some troops on the ground. We needed to have some troops on the  ground--we did--counterterrorism operations and military options.   Many of us here supported a small, tailored deployment to protect our  core interests, and so did his own military advisers. Yet, when he was  asked, ``Did your top military advisers warn against withdrawing on  this timeline? Did they ask you to keep 2,500 troops?'' President Biden  said, ``No, they didn't. That wasn't true.''   But it was true. We talked to the--in fact, you are going to find  something out this coming Tuesday when we have a hearing. We are going  to have many of the principals whom we really haven't heard from,  principals who were involved in advising the administration as to what  the military wanted and didn't want.   Except it was. We know that now. The former commander of U.S. Forces- Afghanistan, General Miller, told the Senate Armed Services Committee  just this last week--this is our committee, the committee I chaired for  some period of time--he said no. Now, he didn't tell President Biden  directly because President Biden didn't even bother calling his top  commander on the ground before making his decision, but General Miller  did report it to the chain of command.   Now, we are talking about General Miller. At that time, he was the  top commander on the ground. So the President didn't even consult him  as to whether or not we should--he made it very clear he advised him  not to go, not to close everything up.   He also tried to say that al-Qaida is ``gone'' from Afghanistan and  that ``terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world.'' Well,  we know that is not true. General McKenzie said al-Qaida remains the  main focus in the region.   Last week, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency--that is  LTG Scott Berrier--said that the projected timeline for al-Qaida to  have the capability to threaten our homeland is 1 to 2 years at most,  if not sooner, and that is it.   So President Biden was not telling the truth in that area about  having only two choices. He didn't tell the truth about getting  American families out of Afghanistan. He failed to tell the truth about  the advice that he got from his military commanders, saying that his  military commanders did not advise him. We know better than that, and  if you don't know it, stick around for next Tuesday, and you will find  out. He didn't tell the truth about al-Qaida not being a threat.   So I have to wonder, if he is not telling the truth about this, what  else is he not telling the truth about? If we can't trust the President  on this, if we can't trust him to tell the truth and we can't trust him  to put together a good strategy in Afghanistan, how can we trust him to  protect the Nation from our strategic competitors?   After watching President Biden stumble badly in Afghanistan, I am  worried that he won't pursue a strong strategy to push back on China,  and China is our top threat right now. We all know that. We don't like  to talk about it, but it is true.   As former Secretary Gates famously wrote in his memoir, President  Biden has ``been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and  national security issue over the past four decades.'' That was  Secretary Gates, former Secretary of Defense.   I am also worried about the administration desperately trying again  to return to the Obama administration's failed Iran deal and offering  Iran massive sanctions relief, sanctions that were put on in the  previous administration to get their--of course, we know Iran would  just use the sanctions relief to ramp up terrorism.   You know, I don't know how the American people--maybe it is the  people in Oklahoma. They are the ones I have talked to more than any  other groups. You know, what else would they do? What would Iran, with  their background, do with sanction relief or with funds? They would use  it on terrorism. That brings us back to Afghanistan, which is only one  of many, many examples in the Middle East and North Africa where the  administration has no plan for countering terrorists and keeping us  safe.    President Biden and his administration have broadly talked about a  new over-the-horizon strategy to counterterrorism. ``Over the horizon''  means that we don't have boots on the ground. We send airplanes in from  afar--something our military leaders have told us is way more difficult  than most people believe, far more expensive, and almost impossible  without partners on the ground.   We can't do it. You can't just lead with military airpower. Even if  it is possible, experts are telling us it won't be effective. We  haven't even seen a plan for how this will be enough to keep American  families safe.   This is a failure of leadership. Along the way, President Biden has  tried to blame everyone else--the Afghan Security Forces, the Afghan  Government, and the previous administration. But the blame lands  squarely on him, and he owns this.   We should expect his failures in Afghanistan to bleed into other  issues. China and Russia see a weak America now. Terrorists see safe  havens and use Afghanistan as a rallying cry.   I still have a lot more questions and expect President Biden and his  administration to have more answers. Thirteen brave Americans died in  the chaos created by President Biden's policies. We need explanations  and we need accountability.   We are going to hear from Secretary Austin, General Milley, and  General McKenzie next week. This is going to be on Tuesday. I have  reminded people of that for a long time because we need to have a clear  understanding, and we will get that understanding. We are going to  start to understand this--just what went wrong, who is to blame, and  what we need to do to protect ourselves. This is going to be an open  meeting. This is not a classified meeting. This is an open meeting that  is going to take place this coming Tuesday. We are going to be doing  this as transparently and openly as possible because the American  people deserve the truth. Our servicemembers and their families who  sacrificed so much over the last 20 years deserve that, too, and we are  going to give them the truth. That is going to happen next week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on Friday, September 17, 2021, Vance Air  Force Base celebrated its 80th anniversary. On this day, we honored the  community, leadership, cadre of instructors, and over 35,000 pilots  Vance has trained since 1941. Vance AFB is the top pilot-producing base  for 2 years running and enables our Nation to provide and defend global  power projection.   Vance Air Force Base's history dates back to 1941, originally founded  as Air Corps Basic Flying School in Enid, OK. After World War II, the  base reopened as a permanent facility on August 26, 1948, and became  Vance AFB on July 9, 1949. The base is named in honor of Lt Col Leon  Robert Vance, Jr., a native of Enid, who posthumously received the  Medal of Honor for gallantry in action over France on June 5, 1944.   For 80 years, Vance has served as the model for empowering the future  of the U.S. Air Force through innovation and focuses on supporting  flight operations everyday. The 71st Flying Training Wing operates over  200 aircraft, conducting more than 50,000 sorties annually, and logging  more than 74,000 flight hours in the T-1A Jayhawk, T-6A Texan II, and  T-38C Talon. Soon, Vance will add the T-7 Red Hawk to its training  aircraft fleet. The base graduates 370 exceptional U.S. Air Force and  allied student pilots from pilot training each year.   Vance is lucky because it benefits from outstanding community support  and partnerships. The base supports more than 1,400 civilian employees  and 1,400 military members and their families in the local area. Vance  has a remarkable $381.2 million impact on the local community. On  September 17, thousands of friends and families who make the Vance  mission a success gathered to celebrate the history and future of the  base.   Vance strives to accomplish its mission every day to deliver the  world's best pilots, develop resilient airmen and families, deploy  combat ready warriors, and demonstrate Vance culture. I am proud that  Vance will continue to train the finest airmen for the finest Air Force  in the world. On behalf of my colleagues and the entire U.S. Senate, I  want to congratulate the Vance AFB community on 80 years of excellence  in service to our Nation. ``Vance Proud!''                            ____________________
