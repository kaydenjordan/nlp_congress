 September 19, 1977, Black Monday is when all the steel  mills closed in Youngstown, Ohio, and we have been waiting since then  for a transformational investment into the State of Ohio. This bill is  going to allow Intel to come to Ohio and convert a $20 billion deal  into a $100 billion deal: 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time  jobs with an average wage of $135,000 per year. It is going to  transform the industrial Midwest. It is going to allow us to out- compete China.   This is also a national security issue.   Young people who have been leaving Ohio for generations are going to  be able to come back. This is an unbelievable bill.   This is the first step towards an industrial policy in the United  States of America, and it is time for us to quit the politics, stop  trying to score political points, stop putting party over country, and  lay down our arms.   My God, if we can't agree on this, what in the hell are we going to  agree on?  [[Page H7382]]    Rebuilding the manufacturing base?   Good-paying jobs?   Union construction?   Out-competing China?   National security?   Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it together.   But we have a small group of people who have hijacked the Republican  Party, and the leadership in this House on the Republican side is more  concerned with defeating Democrats than doing something that is best  for the United States of America. We just saw it in the Senate with the  burn pits legislation, and we are seeing it here with the CHIPS  legislation: party over country.   So July 28, 2022, is going to be Black Thursday--the day the  Republican Party has been hijacked and aligned themselves with  Communist China.
