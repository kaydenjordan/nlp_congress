 Mr. Speaker, crime and the fear of crime impacts the  lives of every American.   We know its rising pace: carjackings at record highs; smash-and-grab  robberies surging; and at least 12 major cities breaking homicide  records in 2021.   We know its price in dollar terms: $200 billion annually in a  regressive crime tax.   We know its widespread costs to families who are afraid to walk the  streets at night.   We know the tragic costs it inflicts in death and suffering.   And we know its root cause: soft-on-crime policies, far-left  prosecutors, and radical Democrats. From Seattle and Portland to New  York City and Washington, D.C., Democrats have failed the first duty of  government. They have failed to keep citizens safe.   Now, some House Democrats want to erase their own soft-on-crime  record, but the American people will not be fooled. This Congress, 219  House Democrats voted for a bill that would cost local police  departments hundreds of millions of dollars.  [[Page H4726]]    The American people can't afford Democrats' radical agenda of fewer  police officers on the streets, fewer criminals behind bars, more  victims of violent crime.   Our police officers can't afford it either. Last year, more officers  were murdered in the line of duty during President Biden's first year  in office than at any point since 1995.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that again. Last year, more officers were  murdered in the line of duty during President Biden's first year in  office than at any point since 1995.   One of those officers was Kern County Sheriff's Office Deputy Phillip  Campas. He was a rising star who was killed in the line of duty last  year after his SWAT team responded to a domestic violence call. He  leaves behind a wife and a young family.   He grew up in my hometown, and he went to the exact same elementary  school and junior high that I did. Campas was a bright example of what  it means to serve others. Fittingly, this year, his name was added to  the Roll Call of Heroes on the National Peace Officers' Memorial in  Washington, D.C.   To Deputy Campas' children, we cannot begin to imagine your sadness  and pain, but I want you to know this: Your father was a hero. We will  never forget him.   Mr. Speaker, the solution to safer communities is the exact opposite  of Democrats' radical agenda. This crime crisis deserves serious  leadership, and it starts with stepping up and supporting law  enforcement.   Our brave officers face enormous challenges, yet they choose to wear  the uniform every day. It is not enough to fully fund them. They must  know we have their backs.   So, as National Police Week begins, I want to say something our law  enforcement officers don't hear enough: Thank you. Thank you for  protecting our communities. Thank you for protecting our children.  Thank you for protecting our country.   While radical Democrats want to defund, demonize, and abolish the  police, Republicans salute you, and we will always support you.                            ____________________
