 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to wish one of my constituents  from my hometown of Anaheim, Ms. Margaret Marie Peters, a very happy  94th birthday.   Margaret was born in the year of the Great Crash. From an early age,  she wanted to learn, and her grandmother taught her how to read and  write. She graduated first in her high school class, and she was the  first to graduate from high school in her family.   Later, Margaret married a decorated World War II marine. Together,  they raised five daughters in Anaheim. In her forties, she attended  college classes. It was something she always wanted to do. Later on,  Margaret spent 29 years working for Disneyland.   Margaret will turn 94 on February 2, and she has witnessed many  changes in this great country. Clearly, the United States today has  come a long way since 1929.   Margaret, happy birthday to you and many more.                            ____________________
