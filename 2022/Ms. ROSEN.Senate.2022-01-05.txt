 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my  remarks, the Senate recess until 2 p.m. and the postcloture time on the  Witkowsky nomination expire at 2:15 p.m.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of former Senate Majority Leader Harry Mason Reid. To some in this  Chamber, Senator Reid was a colleague, a mentor, a friend. To me and to  so many Nevadans, he was also a source of inspiration and pride. His  life, coming from the humblest of beginnings, is the definition of the  American dream.   During his decades of public service, from the State assembly to the  Lieutenant Governor's Office, to chairing the Nevada Gaming Commission,  he became the most powerful leader in Congress. This former boxer from  a tiny town called Searchlight always put Nevada first.   Senator Reid served five terms in this very Chamber, and what he  accomplished during those decades here, particularly as majority  leader, is remarkable. Senator Reid stopped Yucca Mountain. He made  sure Nevada would not become the Nation's nuclear waste dump. He is the  reason we passed the Affordable Care Act into law, providing quality,  affordable healthcare to tens of millions of Americans. He did more  than anyone to rescue Nevada's economy from the depths of the great  recession. He passed crucial Wall Street reform to hold the big banks  accountable for that economic crisis and prevent a future one. He  established Nevada's first national park, Great Basin National Park. He  saved Social Security from being privatized. He was a fearless champion  for bold action to stop climate change, and he was a tireless fighter  for comprehensive immigration reform and the Dream Act.   Because Senator Reid celebrated our State's diversity and recognized  its importance, Nevada is an early State, the first in the West when it  comes to choosing each party's nominee for the White House. No matter  the issue, if it impacted Nevada, you can be sure Senator Reid would do  anything to deliver for our State. He was a voice for all Nevadans, and  if you ever went to an event for Senator Reid, he would remind you by  making sure ``Home Means Nevada''--that is our State song--was sung in  honor of our beloved State.   This is how he got things done. He was blunt. He was direct. He was a  real straight shooter. He didn't mince words. When he identified a  problem, he would work relentlessly to find a solution. As so many of  us here know, you could try as hard as you wanted to, but you could  never leave the conversation or hang up the phone before he did. He  said what he needed to and was on to his next piece of work.   I want to share the best advice Senator Reid gave to me. He said  this: Take every call. Listen to every person, whether you agree with  them or not, and then tell them when you are with them and tell them  when you are not. Be open and honest in your conversations.   These are words I try to live by here every day. They were things  Senator Reid was respected for.   Senator Reid also knew that the constituent services, the work we do  with our teams, literally saves lives and directly helps families, and  it touches so many people. It is the most important and personal work  we do and, through that work, can often become the foundation for  legislation at the Federal level.   When I was thinking about whether or not to run for the Senate,  Senator Reid invited me and my husband Larry over to his home to talk  to him about making that decision. Well, in Senator Reid's style,  instead of taking the lead to tell us what to do and give us advice, he  actually asked his wife Landra to talk to us about her experience.   Well, anyone who has met Landra Reid knows what an incredible woman  she is. Senator Reid was a family man, and he adored her and their  children, of course, grandchildren, and I believe even great- grandchildren so very much. As my friend Brian Greenspun wrote the  other day in the Las Vegas Sun, ``To Harry Reid the greatest  accomplishment he had was his family.''   Anyway, in Senator Reid's living room, Landra told me and my husband  [[Page S33]]  how she juggled being a mom of not one, not two, not three, not four,  five kids--five kids--while Harry was working as a Capitol Police  officer to put himself through law school while running tough campaigns  and while serving long days and nights in Washington. Needless to say,  there is not much that can top that. So the Reids provided my family  with the inspiration I needed as I was considering what a life in the  public view would look like.   Their love for each other, their journey and ability to make it work  over six decades--raising kids, keeping their love strong--showed me  how important it was to have a strong family, of course, and friends as  the foundation for this work of public service.   You know, we spend a lot of time here in Washington talking about  politics every day, but it is the personal things at the end of the day  we all know really matter, and that is the work that Senator Reid did  for Nevadans. He fought to make families' lives just a little bit  easier, whether they knew it or not, so that they could focus on what  matters, what was most important to them.   I want to honor Senator Reid for his lifetime of fighting the good  fight for our State. He helped make Nevada what it is today--a world- class destination and truly a great place to live, work, and raise a  family.   I want to thank Landra and the entire Reid family for sharing their  husband, their father, and their grandfather with Nevada and with the  Nation. The American people have benefited so much because of their  sacrifices and his willingness to serve. Thank you.   Thank you, Senator Reid.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
