 Madam Speaker, I fear that the recent actions by the  administration to end energy development on Federal land will come at  an extremely high cost to the people of the United States, and that  cost will be borne disproportionately by the segment of our population  who can least afford to pay it.   As an example, I offer my home State of California, which, according  to the United States Census Bureau, has the highest rate of poverty of  any State in the country. That poverty rate is driven in no small part  by the extremely high cost of energy in California.   To take those misguided policies and extend them to the rest of the  country would be an abdication of our responsibility to protect the  most vulnerable segment of our population, the poor and the working  poor, on whose backs the burden of higher energy costs will be felt  most keenly.                            ____________________
