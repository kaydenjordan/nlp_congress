 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   I rise in support of the Paycheck Protection Program Increase Act. In  Arkansas, there are more than 13,000 pending PPP loan applications,  representing over $1.1 billion, Madam Speaker, of loans in limbo.  Likewise, many await the SBA's disaster loan funding and wait for it  now.   The timing of this additional funding is critical, and yet, again, I  regret the delay by many leaders on the other side playing politics one  more time with the livelihoods of our constituents.   After the passage of this important package, I am confident that our  employers and our consumers will prudently be able to combine common  sense and follow the CDC precautions and get back to work, back to  seeing patients, back to the barbershop, back to their faith  communities, and back to some semblance of normalcy.   Americans always come together in times of crisis. We will defeat  this foreign invader. We will get our economy back to full capacity.
