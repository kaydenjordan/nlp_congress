 Madam Speaker, I am against the impeachment  effort by the Democrats.   President Trump has held over 600 rallies in the last 4 years. None  of them included assaulting police, destroying businesses, or burning  down cities.   Democrats have spent all this time endorsing and enabling violent  riots that left billions in property damage and 47 dead across the  United States.   Democrats are on record supporting violence when it serves their  cause, in their own words on social media, on interviews, and on the  fundraising platform ActBlue.   Democrats support defunding the police when it is someone else's  city, someone else's home, and someone else's business. Democrats will  take away everyone's guns, just as long as they have guards with guns.   Democrats' impeachment of President Trump today has now set the  standard that they should be removed for their support of violence  against the American people.
