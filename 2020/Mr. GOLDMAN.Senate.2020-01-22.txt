 Uh-huh. And in the July 2nd or 3rd meeting in       Toronto that you had with President Zelensky, you also       mentioned investigations to him, right?        Ambassador VOLKER. Yes.         And, again, you were referring to the Burisma       and the 2016 election.        Ambassador VOLKER. I was thinking of Burisma and 2016.         Okay. And you understood that is what the       Ukrainians interpreted references to investigations to be,       related to Burisma and the 2016 election?        Ambassador VOLKER. I don't know specifically at that time       if we had talked that, specifically, Burisma/2016. That was       my assumption, though, that they would've been thinking about       doing that, too.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Giuliani became an inescapable presence to  both Ukrainian officials and American diplomats. To the Ukrainians,  Rudy Giuliani was seen as both a potential channel to President Trump  and an obstacle to a productive U.S.-Ukraine relationship.   A top aide to President Zelensky texted to Volker that ``I feel that  the key for many things is Rudi and I [am] ready to talk with him at  any time.''   But everyone understood that Mr. Giuliani was no rogue agent. He was  acting at the direction of the President. Ambassador Sondland clearly  described Mr. Giuliani's role in regard to the President. Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid       pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President       Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public       statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election,       DNC server, and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the       desires of the President of the United States, and we knew       these investigations were important to the President.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Concern about Mr. Giuliani's influence began to  grow. On July 10, at a meeting between Ambassador Taylor and two  Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said they were ``very  concerned'' because Mr. Giuliani had told the corrupt prosecutor  general, Lutsenko, that President Trump would not meet with the  Ukrainian leader.   Back in Washington, two important encounters at the White House  further revealed the existence of a corrupt quid pro quo. Ambassador  Sondland first broached the investigation in a meeting in Ambassador  Bolton's office with Bolton's Ukrainian counterpart and President  Zelensky's top aide. Also present were Secretary Perry, Ambassador  Volker, and NSC officials Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.  Toward the end of the meeting, the Ukrainians raised the topic of an  Oval Office meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky.  Ambassador Bolton started to respond when Ambassador Sondland  interjected and raised the demands of the investigation.   Here is how Lieutenant Colonel Vindman recalled the conversation:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          The next excerpt when the President references       you is a short one, but he said: ``Well, she's going to go       through some things.'' What did you think when President       Trump told President Zelensky and you read that you were       going to go through some things?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. I didn't know what to think, but I       was very concerned.         What were you concerned about?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. She's going to go through some       things. It didn't sound good. It sounded like a threat.         Did you feel threatened?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. I did.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. During that same call, President Trump also  took the opportunity to praise Yuriy Lutsenko--Mr. Lutsenko, who is the  former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was widely regarded by the  entire free world, including our European allies and the International  Monetary Fund, to be corrupt and incompetent, but Donald John Trump,  our President, praised him on that call.   He told President Zelensky:         I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was       shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are       talking about that, the way they shut your very good       prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.    Think about this contrast. The President bashed a career American  diplomat and an anti-corruption champion whom he unceremoniously  removed because she was viewed as an obstacle to his efforts to solicit  foreign interference in the 2020 election and then at the same time  praised someone who he thought could be an asset--a former Ukrainian  prosecutor whom the free world views as an obstacle to the rule of law.  The idea that President Trump cares about corruption is laughable. It  is laughable.   A plain reading of the rough transcript of the July 25 call also  sheds light on the quid pro quo involving the  [[Page S470]]  Oval Office meeting that had been sought.   President Zelensky said on the call:         I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the       United States, specifically Washington, DC. On the other       hand, I also wanted to ensure you that we will be very       serious about the case and will work on the investigation.    As all of you know here in this distinguished body, quid pro quo is a  Latin term. It means ``this for that.'' The statement that I just read  shows that President Zelensky fully understood at the time of this July  25 call that if he yielded to President Trump's demand for phony  investigations, he would get the White House meeting in the Oval Office  that he desperately sought. This for that.   President Trump has repeatedly insisted that his July 25 conversation  with President Zelensky was ``a perfect call.'' His staff at the White  House apparently believed otherwise. The press office issued a short  and incomplete summary of the July 25 call. Let me read it for your  hearing:         Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with       President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine--    (Disturbance in the Galleries.)   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. And the scripture says: ``For the Lord loves  justice and will not abandon His faithful ones.''   This is the White House call readout of July 25, 2019:         Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with       President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to congratulate him       on his recent election. President Trump and President       Zelensky discussed ways to strengthen the relationship       between the United States and Ukraine, including energy and       economic cooperation. Both leaders also expressed that they       look forward to the opportunity to meet.    That is the official White House readout of the call dated July 25,  2019. The official readout provided to the American people omitted key  elements of the President's conversation. Let's review.   The official readout did not mention the phony investigations  requested by President Trump. The official readout did not mention the  Oval Office meeting sought by President Zelensky. The official readout  did not mention President Trump's elevation of a debunked conspiracy  theory promoted by Vladimir Putin about 2016 election interference. The  official readout did not mention President Trump's demand that Ukraine  investigate his domestic political rival, Joe Biden. The official  readout did not mention that President Trump maligned and threatened  Ambassador Yovanovitch. The official readout did not mention that  President Trump praised a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor.   The complete conversation, however, between President Trump and  President Zelensky that we just outlined offers powerful evidence that  President Trump abused his power and solicited foreign interference in  the 2020 election.   Several members of the President's staff listening in on the call  immediately grew concerned.   As he sat in the White House Situation Room listening to the  conversation, LTC Alexander Vindman realized that the President's  demands of the Ukrainian leader were ``inappropriate'' and  ``improper.'' He quickly recognized that as the President began  referencing the Bidens, Burisma, and CrowdStrike, the call was  diverging from the official National Security Council talking points  that he helped prepare.   Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, a 20-year Iraq war veteran, Purple Heart  recipient, and American patriot, testified in the context of the call  that due to the unequal bargaining position of the two leaders and  Ukraine's dependence on the United States, the ``favor'' that President  Trump sought would have been perceived by President Zelensky as a  demand. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman worried that the call would  undermine U.S. national security interests, and he knew immediately  that he had a duty to report the contents of the call to White House  lawyers.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         I was concerned by the call. What I heard was       inappropriate, and I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg.        It is improper for the President of the United States to       demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a       political opponent. I was also clear that if Ukraine pursued       an investigation--it was also clear that if Ukraine pursued       an investigation into the 2016 elections, the Bidens and       Burisma, it would be interpreted as a partisan play. This       would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing bipartisan       support, undermining U.S. national security, and advancing       Russia's strategic objectives in the region.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Recounting the content of the call based on his  detailed handwritten notes, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman told the lawyers  that he believed it was ``wrong'' for President Trump to ask President  Zelensky to investigate Vice President Biden.   Other witnesses were also troubled by what they heard. Vice President  Pence's adviser, Jennifer Williams, expressed concern that President  Trump raised a ``domestic political matter'' on an official call with a  foreign leader. She testified that the mention of investigations struck  her as unusual and more political in nature. She said: ``I guess for me  it shed some light on possible other motives behind a security  assistance hold.''   Timothy Morrison, a former Republican congressional staffer who  replaced Dr. Fiona Hill in July of 2019, also reported the call to  National Security Council lawyers.   After the call, President Trump continued to push the scheme forward.   On July 26, the very next day, Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador  Taylor met with President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials in  Kyiv.   According to David Holmes, the Ukraine-based U.S. diplomat who served  as the notetaker, the Ukrainian leader mentioned that President Trump  had brought up some ``very sensitive issues'' during the July 25 call-- ``very sensitive issues.''   Ambassador Sondland then had a private meeting with Andriy Yermak,  President Zelensky's top aide. The two men insisted that the meeting be  one-on-one with no notetaker--perhaps due to the ``very sensitive  issues'' that might come up. Ambassador Sondland testified that he and  President Zelensky's aide ``probably'' discussed ``the issue of  investigations.''   After these key meetings in Ukraine, Ambassador Sondland went to  lunch with David Holmes and two other American officials. Mr. Holmes  sat directly across from Ambassador Sondland--close enough to hear the  details of an extraordinary telephone call between Mr. Sondland and  President Trump. As Mr. Holmes related during his sworn testimony under  oath, Ambassador Sondland pulled out his unsecured cell phone and  ``said that he was going to call President Trump to give him an  update.'' What happened next was shocking.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         While Ambassador Sondland's phone was not on speakerphone,       I could hear the President's voice through the earpiece of       the phone. The President's voice was loud and recognizable,       and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for       a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume. I       heard Ambassador Sondland greet the President and explain he       was calling from Kyiv. I heard President Trump then clarify       that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland       replied, yes, he was in Ukraine, and went on to state that       President Zelensky ``loves your ass.''        I then heard President Trump ask, ``So he's going to do the       investigation?''        Ambassador Sondland replied that he is going to do it,       adding that President Zelensky will do ``anything you ask him       to do.''    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. ``He is going to do it.'' He will do ``anything  you ask him to do.''   Immediately after this call with President Trump, Mr. Holmes followed  up with Ambassador Sondland.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         DAVID HOLMES. After the call ended, Ambassador Sondland       remarked that the President was in a bad mood, as Ambassador       Sondland stated was often the case early in the morning.        I then took the opportunity to ask Ambassador Sondland for       his candid impression of the President's views on Ukraine. In       particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that       the President did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine.       Ambassador Sondland agreed that the President did not give a       [expletive] about Ukraine. I asked, why not, and Ambassador       Sondland stated that the President only cares about . . .       ``big stuff.'' I noted that there was . . . ``big stuff''       going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. Ambassador       Sondland replied that he meant . . . ``big stuff'' that       benefits the President, like the . . . ``Biden       investigation'' that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. The       conversation then moved on to other topics.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. During the July 25 call, President Trump asked  for the favor of these two phony political  [[Page S471]]  investigations immediately after the Ukrainian President brought up  defense assistance for Ukraine.   The following day, Ambassador Sondland confirmed to President Trump  that Ukraine would indeed initiate the investigations discussed on the  call, which was the only thing the President cared about with respect  to Ukraine. He didn't care that Russia was forcefully occupying eastern  Ukraine. President Trump didn't care that thousands of Ukrainians  apparently have died fighting for their democracy. He didn't seem to  care that supporting Ukraine bolsters America's national security, but  he cared about himself as it relates to the prospects of his reelection  in 2020.   In November, President Trump denied that he spoke to Ambassador  Sondland on July 26, telling reporters: ``I know nothing about that.''  But in his public testimony, Ambassador Sondland contradicted that  assertion with official records he obtained from the White House.   Ambassador Sondland further explained that Holmes' testimony  refreshed his recollection about the July 26 call, which Ambassador  Sondland had not originally described when he first appeared at a  deposition before the House.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Also, on July 26th, shortly after our       Kyiv meetings, I spoke by phone with President Trump. The       White House, which has finally, finally shared certain call       dates and times with my attorneys confirms this. The call       lasted 5 minutes.        I remember I was at a restaurant in Kyiv, and I have no       reason to doubt that this conversation included the subject       of investigations. Again, given Mr. Giuliani's demand that       President Zelensky make a public statement about       investigations, I knew that investigations were important to       President Trump.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President Trump said that his July 25  conversation was a perfect call. It was far from perfect.   In a perfect call, the President would not demand a political favor  from a vulnerable Ukraine under attack by a Russian foe. In a perfect  call, the President would not demand that a foreign leader investigate  a Russian-inspired conspiracy about the 2016 election. In a perfect  call, the President would not pressure a foreign government to target  an American citizen for political, personal gain.   In a perfect call, the President would not solicit foreign  interference in the 2020 election. In a perfect call, the President  would not threaten the well-being of a highly respected American  Ambassador and say she was going to ``go through some things.'' In a  perfect call, the President would not praise a disgraced former  prosecutor whom the free world viewed as corrupt and incompetent, and  in a perfect call, the President would not have directed a foreign  leader to follow up with Rudolph Giuliani, a human hand grenade.   This was not a perfect call. It is direct evidence that President  Donald John Trump corruptly abused his power and solicited foreign  interference in the 2020 election.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                            ____________________     You said previously that you were alarmed to       learn this. Why were you alarmed?        Ambassador TAYLOR. It is one thing to try to leverage a       meeting in the White House; it is another thing, I thought,       to leverage security assistance--security assistance to a       country at war dependent on both the security assistance and       the demonstration of support. It was--it was much more       alarming. The White House meeting was one thing, security       assistance was much more alarming.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Upon learning from Mr. Morrison that the military  aid may be conditioned on Ukraine publicly announcing these two  investigations, Ambassador Taylor sends an urgent text message to  Ambassador Sondland asking: ``Are we now saying that security  assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?''  And the response by Ambassador Sondland: ``Call me.''   Well, you know what that means, right? You get a text message that is  putting it in black and white:   Are we saying security assistance and the White House meeting are  conditioned on investigations?   Call me.   In other words, don't put this in writing; call me.   Ambassador Taylor did, in fact, call Sondland. Informed by notes he  took at the time of the call, he summarized that conversation as  follows.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. During that phone call Ambassador       Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he       wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will       investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the       2016 election.        Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized       that he had made a mistake by earlier telling Ukrainian       officials that only a White House meeting with President       Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of the       investigation. In fact, Ambassador Sondland said,       ``Everything was dependent on such an announcement, including       security assistance.''        He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a       public box when making a public statement about ordering such       investigations.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador Taylor testified that his  contemporaneous notes of the call reflect that Sondland used the phrase  ``public box'' to describe President Trump's desire to ensure that the  initiation of his desired investigations was announced publicly. A  private commitment was not good enough.   The State Department has Ambassador Taylor's extensive notes, and of  course we would like to show them to you to corroborate his testimony,  but pursuant to the President's instructions, the State Department will  not turn them over.   You might recall from the tape yesterday that Ambassador Taylor said:  They'll be shortly coming, I'm told.   Well, somebody countermanded that instruction. Who do we think that  was? But you should see them. If you have any question about what  Sondland told Ambassador Taylor, if the President's counsel tries to  create any confusion about what Sondland told Taylor about his  conversation with the President--and, look, Sondland had one  recollection in his deposition and another recollection in the first  hearing and another recollection in the declaration. You want to know  exactly what happened in that conversation when it was fresh in  Sondland's mind and he told Taylor about it and Taylor wrote it in his  notes, you are going to want Taylor's notes.   In any courtroom in America holding a fair trial, you would want to  see contemporaneous notes. This Senate should be no different. Demand  those notes. Demand to see the truth. We are not afraid of those notes.  We haven't seen them. We haven't seen them. Maybe those notes say  something completely different. Maybe those notes  [[Page S478]]  say no quid pro quo. Maybe those notes say it was a perfect call. I  would like to see them. I am willing to trust Ambassador Taylor's  testimony and his recollection. I would like to see them. I would like  to show them to you. They are yours for the asking.   On September 25, the Washington Post editorial board reported  concerns that President Trump was withholding military assistance for  Ukraine and a White House meeting in order to force President Zelensky  to announce investigations of Vice President Biden and purported  Ukrainian interference in the U.S. election.   The Post editorial board wrote:         But we're reliably told that the president has a second and       more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to       intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching       an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe       Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting Ukraine's help with       his Presidential campaign; he is using U.S. military aid the       country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.    So that is September 5. The President on notice: Scheme discovered.  September 5.   September 7, the evidence shows, President Trump has a call with  Ambassador Sondland where the President made the corrupt argument for  military aid and the White House meeting even more explicit.   On September 7, Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump on the  telephone. After that conversation, Ambassador Sondland called Tim  Morrison to update him on that conversation. Unlike Sondland, who  testified that he never took notes, Morrison took notes of the  conversation and recalled it during his public testimony. Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Attorney GOLDMAN. Now, a few days later, on September 7,       you spoke again to Ambassador Sondland, who told you that he       had just gotten off the phone with President Trump. Isn't       that right?         Well, you weren't dissuaded then, right?       Because you still  [[Page S480]]       thought that the aid was conditioned on the public       announcement of the investigation after speaking to President       Trump.        Ambassador SONDLAND. By September 8, I was absolutely       convinced it was.         And President Trump did not dissuade you of       that in the conversation that you noted you had with him?        Ambassador SONDLAND. I don't recall, because that would       have changed my calculus. If President Trump had told me       directly--         No, I'm not asking that. I am just saying, you       still believed the security assistance was conditioned on the       investigation, after you spoke to President Trump; yes or no?        Ambassador SONDLAND. From a timeframe standpoint, yes.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. OK, so here we have Sondland saying that whatever  his recollection may be about that call, he was still very clear what  the President wanted and he was very clear there was a quid pro quo.  That is consistent, obviously, with what Mr. Morrison had to say and  Ambassador Taylor. In other words, he didn't believe President Trump's  denial of a quid pro quo, and neither should you.   Sondland's understanding was further confirmed by President Trump's  own Chief of Staff. On October 17, in a press briefing at the White  House, Mick Mulvaney admitted that President Trump withheld essential  military aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate  the conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election.          Are you also aware that the security       assistance hold was not lifted for another 10 days after this       meeting?         And am I correct that you never did learn the       reason why the hold was lifted?         Colonel Vindman, you didn't learn a reason why       the hold was lifted either; is that right?        Colonel VINDMAN. Right.         Colonel Vindman, are you aware that the       committees launched an investigation into the Ukrainian       matters on September 9, 2 days before the hold was lifted?        Colonel VINDMAN. I am aware, and it was lifted.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Ambassador Taylor, the person in charge at the  U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who communicated the decision to the Ukrainians,  also never got an explanation. Here is what he said.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Are you also aware, however, that the security       assistance hold was not lifted for another 10 days after       this?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Finally, on September 11, I learned that       the hold had been lifted and the security assistance would be       provided. I was not told the reason why the hold was lifted.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mark Sandy, a career officer at OMB, testified  he only learned of the possible rationale for the hold in early  September after the Acting DNI had informed the White House about the  whistleblower complaint.   Sandy testified that sometime in early September he received an email  from his boss, Michael Duffey. Approximately 2 months after the hold  had been placed, the email ``attributed the hold to the President's  concern about other countries not contributing more to Ukraine'' and  requested ``information about what additional countries were  contributing to Ukraine.'' This was a different explanation than OMB  had provided at the July 26 interagency meeting that referenced  concerns about corruption.   The Lieutenant Colonel testified that none of the facts on the ground  about Ukrainian efforts to combat corruption or other countries'  contributions to Ukraine had changed before President Trump lifted the  hold.   According to a press report, after Congress began investigating  President Trump's scheme, the White House Counsel's Office opened an  internal investigation relating to the July 25 call. The following  slides provide excerpts from a report in the Washington Post.   As part of that internal investigation, White House lawyers  reportedly gathered and reviewed hundreds of documents that revealed  extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the  hold on military assistance for Ukraine that had been ordered by the  President.   These documents reportedly include ``early August email exchanges  between Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and White House budget  officials seeking to provide an explanation for withholding the funds  after the President had already ordered a hold in mid-July on the  nearly $400 million in security assistance.''   The Washington Post article also reported, and this is a quote:  ``Emails show OMB Director Vought and OMB staffers arguing that  withholding the aid was legal, while officials at the National Security  Council and State Department protested. OMB lawyers said that it was  legal to withhold the aid, as long as they deemed it a temporary  hold.'' You should be able to see these documents, but the White House  has withheld them from Congress. The House can't verify the news  report, but you could. You could do that if you could see these  documents. You should subpoena them, and there is no reason not to see  all of the relevant documents.    The lengthy delay created by President Trump's hold prevented the  Department of Defense from spending all congressionally appropriated  funds by the end of the fiscal year, as we have mentioned before. That  meant the funds were going to expire on September 30 because, as we  know, unused funds do not roll over to the next fiscal year. This  confirmed the fears expressed by Cooper, Sandy, and others--concerns  that were discussed within the relevant agencies in late July and  throughout August.   Ultimately, approximately $35 million of Ukraine military  assistance--that is 14 percent of the DOD funds--remained unspent by  the end of the fiscal year. In order to make sure that Ukraine did not  permanently lose the $35 million of critical military assistance that  had been frozen by the White House, Congress had to pass a provision on  September 27--3 days before the funds were to expire--to ensure that  the remaining $35 million could be sent to Ukraine.   George Kent is an anti-corruption and rule-of-law expert. He told us  that American anti-corruption efforts prioritized building  institutional capacity, support for the rule of law, not the pursuit of  individual investigations, particularly of political rivals. Here is  how he explained their approach.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
