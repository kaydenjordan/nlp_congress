 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney and Chairman  Connolly for their leadership, and I thank the bipartisan leadership  with Representative Mace and the Republican committee.   This is the most significant legislation to address the challenge  that quantum computing poses to our security. The reality is that  quantum computing is going to be much faster and can do many more  things than regular computing.   For example, if you have an iPhone and you have a pass code on the  iPhone, now you have a computer that can do a billion different  combinations to try your pass code in a matter of a few seconds.  Chances are they can break through the pass code. The problem is that a  lot of the bad actors--they have been stealing American data from our  government in anticipation of having these quantum computers, these  super-fast computers--try all the combinations to break through.   I am proud that this committee, in a bipartisan basis, came together,  and said: We need to make sure that our security in our critical  agencies do not suffer from these computers that can try all these  codes. Let's design that security in a way that will be safe, even with  quantum computing.   The bill directs the agencies to start having those algorithms now  that are not vulnerable to these supercomputers. It is an example, with  Representative Mace and the committee, of Congress actually working, of  Congress being proactive, of Congress looking ahead on the horizon and  anticipating problems to keep the American people safe.   Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the bipartisan spirit. I acknowledge  Geo Saba, my staff, and all of the staff on the Oversight and Reform  Committee, both the majority and minority, for helping make this  possible.
