 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for his  years of bipartisan work that went into this bill.   I am proud to support this bill today because I believe that it will  strengthen the ability of investors to make informed decisions.  Exchange-traded funds are valuable and popular tools for investors to  diversify risks and returns through a single security at low cost. This  bill will help investors understand the various ETF choices on the  market.   I was proud that the House passed our bill, H.R. 910, earlier this  Congress by a vote of 405-2. This bill is essentially the same bill and  incorporates, among other things, an amendment by Senator Elizabeth  Warren to reiterate that the safe harbor will not be available to  affiliates of the ETF, including the fund's registered investment  adviser. I am really proud of the bipartisanship that went into this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Hill)  for working with us on this bill over the past years and look forward  to it now being sent to the President's desk and signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
