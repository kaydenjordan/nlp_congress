 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois. No one knows  how many lives and souls Reverend Billy Graham saved. We know that for  every one he saved, he saved two, two saved four, four saved eight, et  cetera.   One life we know he saved was Louis Zamperini. Louis' story is in a  book called, ``Unbroken,'' and a movie by that same name. He was a  track star, a silver medalist, 1936 games, Olympic games in Munich. In  World War II, he flew B-24 bombers. That was a dangerous plane. Twice,  his plane crashed. The second time, he floated the Pacific Ocean for 47  days. He said: ``God, if I survive this ordeal and get back to America  alive, I'll seek You and serve You.''   He was captured by the Japanese and spent the rest of the war in a  prison war camp in Japan. A guard there he called, ``The Bird,'' knew  of Louis' fame, and he beat him to a pulp every single day. Louis said:  ``I was constantly being tormented by the guy. And you talk about hate.  I wanted to kill him.''   His nightmares of the POW camp came home. He was consumed by anger.  One night, Louis dreamed he was strangling The Bird to death. Instead,  he woke up to find out he was strangling his wife, Cynthia. He started  getting drunk as a skunk every night to forget about the horrors that  plagued him.   With her husband getting drunk every single night, Cynthia filed for  divorce, and that is when a friend invited her to see the Reverend  Billy Graham crusade in a Los Angeles tent dubbed, ``The Canvas  Cathedral.'' She accepted Christ that night.   She convinced Louis to attend Reverend Graham's service. After  storming out of that tent the first night, Louis returned for one more  evening. That time, the Bible verse Billy Graham quoted went straight  to Louis' heart. He said: ``Of all my near-death experiences, my life  never passed before my eyes. But when Billy Graham quoted Scripture, my  life did pass before my eyes.'' For the first time in years, Louis  remembered the promise he made God when he was floating in the South  Pacific.   That night, he went forward and accepted Christ, and the biggest  miracle of his life was set in motion. Louis' transformation was so  complete that he returned to Japan to share the Gospel with the  hundreds of Japanese troops that tortured him that he once hated. He  watched many of them accept Jesus Christ.   He went to share his faith all around the world, speaking at several  Billy Graham crusades, and had a great  [[Page H1327]]  friendship with Reverend Graham that lasted until Louis' death on July  2, 2014.   Before he died, Louis said these important words: ``This Billy Graham  thing is a phenomenal miracle the way it started, the way it spread  out. I'm one guy that got saved, and I've spoken to hundreds of  thousands and had my testimony in papers where millions read it. One  person. Think of the spider-web effect all over the world.''   Thank God for Reverend Billy Graham. Amen, Louis. Thank God for  Reverend Billy Graham.                                time  1915
