 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Republicans in this  Chamber want to scream and shout about our broken immigration system  while putting forth the most unserious, cruel bill that is effectively  dead on arrival in the Senate and fixes absolutely nothing.   This bill is a rerun of Donald Trump's biggest failures at inhumane  border policies. This is the child deportation act because that is  exactly what this does.   It doesn't address any single issue at the border. It doesn't create  pathways to citizenship for those legally attempting to receive asylum,  which is a right in this country. It focuses on expediting child  deportation and detaining unaccompanied minors, and even spending  millions of your taxpayer dollars on a pointless border wall.   Floridians back in my home State know that this is nothing less than  hateful, unserious legislation, because we are watching Governor Ron  DeSantis do the same thing: spending millions to detain and fly  migrants for a political show while criminalizing vulnerable people and  families.   The American people sent us here to work, and instead, GOP leadership  offers them pointless bill after pointless bill that only proves how  hateful rightwing policy has become.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and advocacy  of someone so many in the Orlando community considered a friend and  loved one, Alaina Slife, who lost her life 2 weeks ago, which has left  a hole in Central Florida.   Alaina was a daughter, a sister, a partner, and a friend to so many.   I actually had the honor of meeting her through the clouds of tear  gas during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, where she was an  accomplice and an ally and a fighter in the fight for justice for every  single person.   She seemed to wake up every day with a mission in her heart to help  people, and she devoted her life to empowering others and fighting for  a better State and a better world for all central Floridians and  everybody.   Today, I honor and remember her life's work and offer my deep  condolences to her family and loved ones. She was a warrior in our  community and will be greatly missed, but she lives forever through the  joy, and the shared fight and struggle of our people. I thank her so  much for her work.                            ____________________
