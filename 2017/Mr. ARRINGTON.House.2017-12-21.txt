 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my new friend, great colleague, and mentor as I  have made my transition into this great body. He tells me that all  freshman Members come in and have big wins like tax reform and these  big, tremendous wins, not for the Republican Party, but for the  American people. I am so proud to have been a part of that. I am proud  to call Mr. Gohmert my friend.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the Borden County Coyotes'  hard-fought victory over Jonesboro in the Division 1, 1A Six-Man  Football State Championship. This was the Coyotes' seventh State  championship appearance, fifth State championship win, and the second  year in a row these two teams faced off in the six-man State  championship game.   Going into the championship game, only six opposing teams had scored  against the Coyotes all year long. They boast the best six-man defense  in the State, have been named the best six-man team in the Nation, and  are ranked number 1 in the class 1-A division rankings.  [[Page H10414]]    With the discipline and determination they showed all season long,  this team turned a two-point lead at halftime into a 60-22 win in the  State championship.   I want to commend both teams on their tremendous success and  sportsmanship and congratulate, especially, Coach Richey on preparing  our Coyotes to achieve a perfect season.   I would be remiss if I did not thank the parents and the teachers and  the administrators and the fans who were always there throughout this  season to ensure the Coyotes always gave their Borden County best.   There is nothing like high school football in west Texas. Go Coyotes,  and go west Texas.                     Happy 80th Birthday to Dr. Bill Dean     Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish a happy birthday, 80  years, to a dear friend, a Lubbock native, and a legend at Texas Tech,  Dr. Bill Dean.   Dr. Dean has always been a leader and has always had a servant heart  when it comes to serving his community and the campus community at  Texas Tech. I don't know anyone who loves Texas Tech University and the  students at Texas Tech like Bill Dean.   He was elected to the student body presidency when he was a student  at Tech. He got 3 degrees and became a professor, an associate dean,  and, ultimately, in his current role, serves as CEO of the Texas Tech  University Alumni Association.   He was named the best teacher nine times by his students.   Dr. Dean, you are the very best, and you represent the very best of  west Texas and Red Raider Nation. I want to say, blessings to you, and  I hope you have many, many more years on that college campus because  you have had an amazing impact on thousands of the lives of young  people who come through that university, like me.   Thank you for your commitment. Thank you for your service and your  leadership, and God bless you and Peggy. ``Guns Up.''
