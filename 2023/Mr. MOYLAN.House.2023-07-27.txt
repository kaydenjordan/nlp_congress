 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Roger Williams and Ranking  Member Nydia Velazquez of the Committee on Small Business for allowing  me to sit in on their hearing yesterday focused on the challenges that  face rural small businesses.   I thank Representative Shri Thanedar for allowing me to be the  Republican lead on his bill, H.R. 4661, also known as the One Stop Shop  for Small Business Licensing Act of 2023.   Small businesses are vital to Guam's economy and are the embodiment  of the American Dream and entrepreneurial spirit.   Guam's economy thrives thanks to the hard work of committed,  dedicated, and resourceful small business owners. It is not easy owning  and running a small business, and these enterprises face issues that  are not concerning to large corporations.   A common issue that I have heard about from small business owners  from the Guam Chamber of Commerce and the witness panel in yesterday's  hearing is the limited access to capital. This continues to be  increasingly difficult with high interest rates and inflation  continuing to be a burden on how business is conducted.   Consequently, small businesses are forced to invest less in their  company and find it difficult to expand, offer more goods and services,  and provide more jobs.   While Guam is not exempt from the macroeconomic issues that plague  our economy, we have our own set of challenges that make doing business  in Guam more difficult.   Every business across the Nation is currently feeling the effects of  inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain issues. In Guam, these  challenges are magnified because of the island's geographic location.  Shipping costs greatly increase the cost of goods, and Guam's labor  shortage is worsened because of this isolation, requiring the use of H- 2B visa workers.   As a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, nearly every  business in my district qualifies as a rural small business.   The issues small businesses face are my issues, and I will continue  to do everything in my power to support them and, by extension, the  people of Guam.               Congratulating the Guam Association of Realtors     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate the Guam  Association of Realtors, or GAR, for the launch of their assistance  program for both homeowners and renters and for receiving a grant of  $500,000 to fund their program.   It was several months ago when my island community was struck by  Typhoon Mawar, leaving it in devastation. Many were left stranded,  homeless, and without the means to rebuild their lives. It is through  programs like this that we can rebuild our community and provide a  much-needed lifeline for our people.   GAR's legacy dates back several decades and is part of one of the  largest and most influential trade industries in the Nation, the  National Association of Realtors. Their primary objectives include  promoting and maintaining high standards of conduct, providing a  unified medium for real estate owners, and creating an atmosphere of  unity.   I applaud the executive director, Peggy Llagas, the hardworking staff  and management of GAR, and the board of directors for their  contributions on Guam and for giving our community hope.                            ____________________
