 Mr. President, when we took up tax reform, we had one  goal, and that was to make life better for hard-working Americans. That  involved a couple of things. For starters, it involved putting more  money in Americans' pockets right away by cutting their taxes, and  Americans are already seeing the tax relief we passed in their  paychecks.   But we knew that tax cuts, as helpful as they are, were not enough.  We wanted to make sure we created the kind of economy that would give  American workers access to the jobs, wages, and opportunities that  would set them up for security and prosperity in the long term. Since  jobs and opportunities are created by businesses, that meant reforming  our Tax Code to improve the playing field for businesses so that they  could improve the playing field for workers, and that is what we did.   I am proud to report that it is working. Since tax reform was passed,  business after business has announced good news for workers: pay  increases, bonuses, and better benefits, including increased retirement  benefits, new and better education benefits, and enhanced parental  leave benefits.  [[Page S3746]]    A recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers  reported that 77 percent of manufacturers plan to increase hiring as a  result of tax reform, 72 percent intend to increase wages or benefits,  and 86 percent report that they plan to increase investments, which  means new jobs and opportunities for workers. Meanwhile, a recent  survey from the National Federation of Independent Business reports  that 75 percent of small business owners think that the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act will have a positive effect on their businesses.   A number of small businesses are increasing wages, and that has  recently hit a record 35 percent. In April, for the first time since  the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the data, the number of  job openings outnumbered the number of job seekers. For the first time  since they started keeping track, the number of job openings is greater  than the number of people who are actually seeking employment.  Meanwhile, in May, unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 18  years, and wage growth increased at the fastest pace since July of  2009.   In other words, it is a good day for American workers. There is  nothing better than seeing opportunities improve for hard-working  Americans. I am proud of the benefits the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is  delivering for American workers. I look forward to seeing this law  produce even more benefits for workers in the future.   Mr. President, if there is one thing that we tend to automatically  rely on, it is the strength of our military. We are accustomed to  having the best fighting force in the world and assuming we can meet  every threat. But military strength doesn't just spring up  automatically; it has to be developed, and once developed, it has to be  maintained. But in recent years, we haven't met this responsibility.   While we have the very finest soldiers in the world, they don't  always have the tools they need to defend our Nation. Budgetary  impasses paired with increased operational demands have left our Armed  Forces with manpower deficits and delayed the acquisition of 21st- century weapons and equipment. Meanwhile, other major powers hostile to  the United States have been building up their militaries. As a result,  our military advantage has been steadily eroding.   In a 1793 address to Congress, President Washington said:         There is a rank due to the United States among nations       which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the       reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must       be able to repel it. If we desire to secure peace, one of the       most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must       be known that we are at all times ready for war.    Ronald Reagan put it a little differently. He said:         Well, to those who think strength provokes conflict, Will       Rogers had his own answer. He said of the world heavyweight       champion of his day, ``I've never seen anyone insult Jack       Dempsey.''    There is no better way to secure peace than to make sure the U.S.  military is the strongest, best equipped, most capable fighting force  in the world. If we want to protect our Nation and promote peace around  the world, it is imperative that we rebuild our military.   Since President Trump's election, Republicans have been working to  reverse the underfunding of our military and to restore our Nation's  fighting force. In March of this year, we arrived at a budget agreement  that contained the largest year-to-year increase in defense spending in  15 years.   The fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which we are  considering this week, is the next step in rebuilding our military.  This bill invests in research and modernization to ensure that our men  and women in uniform will be equipped to meet 21st-century threats,  including those posed by major powers. It reforms the outdated Officer  Personnel Management System to improve career flexibility and merit- based advancement. It makes reforms to the civilian leadership  structure at the Department of Defense to make it more agile,  especially for hiring technical talent. It implements measures to deter  additional aggression from Russia and China--two of the biggest threats  to the security and stability of the world in the 21st century. It  provides a 2.6-percent pay increase for our men and women in uniform-- the largest pay increase for our servicemembers in nearly 10 years.   I have offered a number of amendments to further the bill's mission,  including one to expedite the backlog of foreign military sales. This  will support the administration's efforts to balance trade deficits,  support domestic industry, and permit America's security partners to  make greater investments in their own capabilities.   I am also working on an amendment to allow the Air Force to  incorporate the B-21 bomber when determining criteria for training  airspace requirements. This will build off a report I secured in last  year's Defense Authorization Act on how to optimize training airspaces.  My amendment will enable the Air Force to formally incorporate this  future aircraft into its planning.   I know the bill managers have a host of amendments before them, and I  am hopeful that the Senate can come to an agreement and include many of  those.   If we want our Nation to be secure, if we want to promote peace and  stability around the world, then we need to ensure that our military is  the strongest, best equipped fighting force in the world. This year's  National Defense Authorization Act will help our military regain its  competitive edge and equip our men and women in uniform with the tools  they need to meet and defeat the threats of the 21st century.   I am grateful to Senator Inhofe for his leadership and to Senator  McCain, who can't be with us today but whose tireless work is reflected  throughout this bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to  pass this legislation this week and ultimately get this bill to the  President so that the important work of defending this country can  continue.   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
