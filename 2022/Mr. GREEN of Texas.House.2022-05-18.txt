 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise today  to say that those who tolerate hate, perpetuate hate--it is not enough,  Mr. Speaker, for us to prosecute the purveyors of the hate. Those who  pull the trigger, those white supremacists, it is not enough to  prosecute them individually. We have to prosecute hate itself. If we  fail to do so, we fail our country.   This is a country that allows us the freedom to move about, to go  into stores and to other places of business. Business itself is going  to suffer if we don't stop this.   I beg the business community, the Chamber of Commerce: Come out of  the shadows.   Where is the business community? Denounce this white supremacy.   Where is the clergy? Denounce this white supremacy.   Join me in a moment of silent prayer for all of those who have  suffered.                            ____________________
