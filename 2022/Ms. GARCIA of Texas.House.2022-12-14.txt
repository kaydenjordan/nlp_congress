 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 20 innocent  little children and 6 brave teachers who were taken from their families  10 years ago today at Sandy Hook Elementary School.   I truthfully can't even comprehend the immense pain that these  families must have felt and continue to feel every day.   I never want another family to experience this type of loss. That is  why we must remain committed to ending the gun violence epidemic that  plagues our country.   Earlier this year, House Democrats passed the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act, which President Biden swiftly signed into law. It will  save lives by funding violence prevention programs at schools,  expanding background checks for those under 21 years of age,  strengthening mental health resources, and so much more, but the fight  is not over.   I promise to continue fighting until we are all saved from gun  violence because we owe this to the victims of gun violence, their  families, and their children.   We will always put children over the NRA. We will always put people  over politics.                            ____________________
