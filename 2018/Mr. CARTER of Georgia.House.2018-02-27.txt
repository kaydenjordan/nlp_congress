 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Michael Kenny for being named the 2018 grand marshal of the Savannah  St. Patrick's Day Parade, the second largest St. Patrick's Day Parade  in the United States. It is important for everyone in Savannah, but  most specifically, it is important for the Savannah Irish.   Savannah has a historically large Irish community, integral to the  fabric of our city, and the St. Patrick's Day Parade is a direct result  of this impact. The first public observance of the holiday began in  1824, and now the parade has around 280 bands, families, soldiers, and  floats, all marching through the streets of Savannah.   A family affair, the Kenny family owns a successful local roofing  company and has worked with the parade for over 40 years. His father,  Nicolas Kenny, Jr., was the grand marshal in 1978.   In past years, the committee has chosen between many candidates for  grand  [[Page H1321]]  marshal, but this year, Mr. Kenny was the only person nominated, a  testament to the support and respect he maintains throughout Savannah.   Mr. Speaker, I know that Mr. Kenny will do a great job with this  year's festivities, and I look forward to the celebration.                            ____________________
