 Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that  Senators Alexander and Menendez be allowed to speak for 5 minutes each  before the vote scheduled at 2 p.m. today.    Mr. President, 50 years ago, the world was transfixed by  a grainy, black-and-white image of Neil Armstrong descending a ladder,  preparing to take humankind's first steps on the Moon. I was one of  more than half a billion people--the largest television audience in  history--glued to the TV screen on that day. I was actually in high  school, and, like so many Texans at the time, I was totally engrossed  in what was going on.   Staring at the television, it was hard to imagine that hundreds of  thousands of miles away, two brave Americans were sitting on the  surface of the Moon while their comrade remained in lunar orbit up  above. I didn't quite understand what this development would mean for  the future; I just remember thinking at that moment how proud I was to  be an American. I looked up to these three men, and I still do, and I  marvel at their courage, their intelligence, and their patriotism, as  well as that of the tens of thousands of Americans involved in getting  them to the Moon in the first place.   We now know that this lunar trio had quite a sense of humor. Michael  Collins was once asked in an interview what he was thinking about in  the moments leading up to the liftoff on July 16, 1969, and he joked,  ``I was thinking of per diem, you know, how many dollars per mile we'd  be paid for this voyage.'' Upon the astronauts' return, we learned that  when Buzz Aldrin stepped off the ladder, he told Armstrong he was being  careful not to lock the door behind him. And when talking about the  fact that most of the photos from the surface of the Moon were of  Aldrin, Neil Armstrong joked, ``I have always said that Buzz was the  far more photogenic of the crew.''   While the first lunar landing meant many different things to people  around the world, there is one thing that was abundantly clear: That  date--July 20, 1969--established the United States as the world leader  in human space exploration. It also put my hometown, the place of my  birth, Houston, on the map as a hub for spaceflight innovation in the  United States.   We all remember the very first words uttered by Neil Armstrong after  landing. He said, ``Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has  landed.'' Of course, he was talking to the greatest minds of the  generation, who were working at Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX.  The men and women at Mission Control Center exercised full control over  Apollo 11, from the launch at Kennedy Space Center, to landing on the  Moon, to the splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.   For more than 50 years now, the Johnson Space Center in Houston has  been at the heart of America's space program. The success marked the  turning point in space exploration, and folks across Texas are eager to  celebrate this momentous anniversary. You can do like I have and visit  Johnson Space Center yourself and see NASA's Mission Control from  Apollo. It was redesigned to look exactly the way it did in 1969, down  to the retro coffee cups and glass ashtrays. You can watch the Houston  Astros take on Oakland while wearing Apollo 11 caps. Across the State,  you can see special movie screenings, space-themed menus, and ``ask an  astronaut'' events to educate our next generation of space travelers.   To commemorate this historic mission in Washington, I introduced a  bipartisan, bicameral resolution with my colleagues Senator Brown,  Congressman Babin, and Congresswoman Horn last month. I thank my  colleagues who supported this effort and urge my fellow Senators to  join me in passing it this week. This resolution honors Apollo 11's  three crew members--Buzz  [[Page S4883]]  Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins--whose bravery and skill  made this feat possible. In addition, it commends the work of the  brilliant men and women who supported this mission on Earth, including  mathematicians like Katherine Johnson and the astronauts who lost their  lives in previous spaceflight missions.   To ensure that America remains the leader in human spaceflight, this  resolution also supports the continued leadership of the United States.  With this in mind, earlier this year, I introduced a bill called  Advancing Human Spaceflight Act with Senator Peters from Michigan to  provide greater certainty and stability for our space program.   This legislation will extend the authorization for the International  Space Station through 2030 and launch the United States into a new era  of space exploration.   Our future astronauts need spacesuits with advanced capabilities  beyond what current technology can do, so this bill will also direct  NASA to develop the next-generation spacesuit for future exploration to  the Moon, to Mars, and beyond.   In order to make this dream a reality, this legislation will allow  NASA to partner with private space innovators to ensure we have the  best and brightest working to achieve these goals.   In addition, this bill will, for the first time, codify human space  settlement as a national goal. I believe this legislation will help set  the stage to launch the United States into a new era of space  exploration, and there is no better time than this momentous  anniversary to recommit ourselves to American leadership in space.   In the year since that first ``small step,'' we have watched goal  after goal being set and then met. From the Viking 1 landing on Mars to  the Voyager Program exploring the outer planets, to the International  Space Station making human space habitation a reality, I have no doubt  that the success of the Apollo 11 mission made each of these victories  possible and paved the way for the future.   For the 50th anniversary of the lunar landing, today we honor the  brave and brilliant astronauts, physicists, engineers, mathematicians,  and scientists of all kinds who made our Nation the first to touch down  on lunar soil. We are grateful for their courage, their sacrifices, and  their immeasurable contributions to our Nation's space program.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
