 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3755,  the so-called Women's Health Protection Act. This should be called the  destruction of unborn babies at any stage of development act.   The principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are  America's  [[Page H5146]]  foundation. Without question, life is the fundamental component to both  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   The American people understand the importance of protecting life. An  AP Poll shows that 54 percent of Americans believe abortions should be  illegal in the third trimester. Another 26 percent believe it should be  illegal in most cases in the third trimester. What is more, 65 percent  of Americans believe abortion without restriction should be illegal  during the second trimester as well.   But this latest Democrat scheme would go against the wishes of the  American people and make abortion on demand for any reason legal until  the time of birth.   It is clear to see that the so-called Women's Health Protection Act  is not about protecting the lives of unborn female babies. It is about  handing the anti-unborn baby industry a victory it has sought for many  years.   I oppose H.R. 3755, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We are a  country that up until now has valued life, and the majority of  Americans still value life, especially the lives of unborn children.
