 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to the closed rule and the underlying bill.   H.R. 2, the child deportation act, was developed in an extreme MAGA  echo chamber. Homeland Security Committee Republicans defeated all 43  amendments offered by Democrats to fix the bill's many flaws.   This closed rule goes a step further and blocks House consideration  of amendments like the one I filed adding 1,700 CBP officers at ports  of entry to process migrants, facilitate trade and tourism, and  interdict fentanyl.   More than 90 percent--as you have already heard--of hard drugs are  interdicted at ports of entry--this is information passed to us by  CBP--but Republicans refuse to make investments in the many ports of  entry workforce or technology.   Worse yet, the bill does nothing to address cartels and fentanyl  trafficking.   The rule doubles down on Donald Trump's border wall by blocking  consideration of an amendment filed by Representative Troy Carter to  protect landowners from eminent domain.   With new border wall segments likely to cost about $46 million per  mile, building 900 miles of wall could total billions.   Finally, this closed ruled blocks consideration of Representative   Robert Garcia's amendment to strike language that villainizes community  and religious organizations which provide basic necessities to  migrants.   H.R. 2 is written so poorly that it could force the American Red  Cross to verify each person's immigration status before offering help.  Can you imagine if groups have to say, ``Show us your papers''? That is  just cruel.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the child  deportation act. This cruel, inhumane, and unworkable bill was written  in an extreme MAGA Republican echo chamber.   Considering H.R. 2 today under a closed rule is a cynical move on the  part of Republicans to exploit the operational challenges associated  with the lifting of title 42 public health restrictions.   Republicans have a short memory. Just in February, they voted to lift  title 42 when they voted to lift the COVID-19 health emergency. It sets  Customs and Border Protection up for failure by shifting all processing  to ports of entry without providing any additional resources.   To make matters worse, it would bar CBP from leveraging technology to  process migrants in an orderly way. H.R. 2 doesn't fund a single new  officer at our ports of entry, where more than 90 percent of fentanyl  is interdicted.   In committee, we tried to get an additional 1,700 officers to build  greater capacity, but Republicans refused to do it.   Furthermore, this xenophobic bill would strip DHS funding from any  community or religious organization that helps migrants. The language  is so broad that an organization that places water in a remote area of  the desert or provides a pregnant mother with a safe place to sleep  would be ineligible for DHS funding. It is so broad that they may be  refused homeland security grants to help protect their facilities.   Denying assistance to nonprofits is just plain shameful, particularly  after what we saw in Brownsville this past weekend. There is reporting  that a man who rammed his SUV into a crowd outside a migrant shelter,  killing 8 and injuring at least 10 others, was fueled by invasion and  alien rhetoric. My heart goes out to everyone hurt by this senseless  act of violence.   The language in this bill is so far-reaching that it would force the  American Red Cross to verify every person's immigration status before  providing lifesaving services. Can you imagine if they had to say,  ``Show your papers,'' before evacuating people? That is just inhumane.   Get this: H.R. 2 is so broadly written that it would actually impede  detention and deportation.   Mr. Speaker, FOX News viewers who support deporting migrants should  take a look at section 115(c) in division A. If enacted, it would  prohibit DHS from contracting with any nongovernmental organization to  transport or shelter ``inadmissible aliens.''   This language would prevent ICE from contracting with private  companies to facilitate deportation or provide detention space because  these companies are nongovernmental organizations. Yes, you heard that  right. This bill is so poorly written that it could actually prevent  ICE from deporting people.   Over the next 2 hours, Democrats will discuss many other problematic  provisions of this extreme MAGA bill that Republicans cobbled together  and that we learned yesterday would blow a $6.1 billion hole in the  budget.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this child  deportation act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the extreme MAGA Republican  default on America act, which the last speaker voted for, would result  in an across-the-board cut of 22 percent for the Department of Homeland  Security, which would undermine border security.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, Republicans want it both  ways. First, they vote to reduce the number of Border Patrol agents in  the field by 1,400 under their default in America act, and now all of a  sudden, they want to do something different. So either you are for it  or you are against it, but you can't have it both ways.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget  Office says the child deportation act would ``decrease the population  of the United States by about 600,000 people, mostly by reducing the  number of unaccompanied children present in the country.''   Republicans claim to be concerned about exploitation and abuse of  unaccompanied children, but their answer is  [[Page H2221]]  to slam the door shut and deport them from the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Goldman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, on March 15, Border Patrol  Chief Ortiz told the Homeland Security Committee that ``cartels control  an awful lot of the southern border south of the United States.''   Last time I checked, south of the United States meant Mexico and not  five of the nine U.S. Border Patrol sectors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez).    Mr. Speaker, at some point you have to  correct the Record. We had a debt ceiling budget vote several weeks  ago. The Republican-approved debt ceiling budget would cut the DHS  budget by 22 percent.   So you can't be for something, but you don't invest in what you say  you are for.   I will step back a little further and say that if Republicans are  really serious about border security, then they would have joined  Democrats in passing last year's government funding bill. It provided  more than $17 billion to Customs and Border Protection alone and a 17  percent increase in the Border Patrol budget, but unfortunately,  Speaker McCarthy voted against that, too.                                time  1930    Democrats have been to the border. In April of this year, I took nine  Members to the border. We talked to a lot of people. I have been on the  committee quite a while. I have gone to the border a number of times to  see, so one visit I didn't go to is not the end of the world. I was on  the border before the Speaker was in Congress, so there is history here  that we just need to make sure that we all understand.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, the extreme MAGA Republican  default on America act, which the last Speaker voted for, would result  in CBP not being able to seize nearly 900 pounds of fentanyl because of  the draconian cuts to its budget.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.   Robert Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, on February 1, the last  speaker voted against the public health emergency that served as the  legal basis for the use of title 42 at the southwest border.   My colleagues want to have it both ways, which is why, I guess, he  supports H.R. 2, the child deportation act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva), the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, if Republicans were serious  about border security, they would have joined Democrats in passing last  year's government funding bill, which paid for an increase of 300  Border Patrol agents, the first increase since the Obama  administration.   Not only did the last speaker not support it, she voted to have 1,400  Border Patrol agents fewer in the field under the extreme MAGA  Republican default on America act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Thanedar).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 squeezes Customs and  Border Patrol officers working at ports of entry by failing to provide  resources to cover the increased workload that will result from the  bill.   If Republicans were serious about border security, they would have  joined Democrats in passing last year's government funding bill, which  appropriated $60 million to hire an additional 125 CBP officers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Clarke).                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 does nothing to  combat illicit narcotics like fentanyl. If Republicans were serious  about border security, they would have joined Democrats in passing last  year's government funding bill, which provided $70 million for  intrusive inspection technology at ports of entry where most dangerous  drugs are interdicted.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Salinas).    Mr. Speaker, while the imposition of a  nationwide E-Verify on all businesses found in this bill is not part of  the Homeland Security division, it still affects me as a Member of  Congress from a rural part of the country.   I cannot overstate how damaging this language is to the agriculture  labor in my district. Many of my rural Republican colleagues know this,  too. To put it bluntly, if enacted, this bill will force American  farmers to go out of business.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of opposition against  the child deportation act from the AFL-CIO; SEIU, Service Employees  International Union; and the Agriculture Workforce Coalition.                                                         AFL-CIO,                                        Washington, DC, May 8, 2023.        Dear Representative, I am writing on behalf of the AFL-CIO       to urge you to oppose H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act of       2023. This bill advances a divisive agenda that would       increase risks to the lives and livelihoods of workers,       children, and families. Rather than punitive, enforcement-      only approaches, we urge Members to pursue meaningful reforms       that expand rights and protections for all.        Successive waves of immigrants and refugees have always       helped to build, serve and feed our nation. Today is no       different. Far from posing a threat, newly arriving migrants       can make valuable contributions to our society when afforded       the proper supports to allow them to effectively integrate       into our communities. The labor movement is committed to       welcoming more refugees, asylum seekers and other forced       migrants and helping them to integrate into the workforce       with good union jobs.        H.R. 2 fails to provide the effective and humane policy       solutions needed to address the flaws and injustices in our       immigration system. This bill would implement unbalanced  [[Page H2229]]       policies focused on deterrence, detention, and removal that       violate key principles of human and worker rights. Among many       concerns, the bill seeks to severely restrict asylum, reduce       protections for children, limit relief options for the       administration, erode due process, expend taxpayer resources       on a border wall, strip funding for humanitarian programs,       and promote detention and deportation of immigrants and       families.        Any serious attempt to use immigration policy to lift wages       and standards must start with a broad and inclusive pathway       to citizenship, not the costly expansion of a flawed       mechanisms that fail to ensure basic worker protections.       Unfortunately, the workforce provisions in H.R. 2 move us       further in the wrong direction. The bill would mandate the       use of E-Verify, which has often been used by employers as a       tool to bust unions and chill the exercise of workplace       rights. It would also cause significant harm to the workforce       by limiting the ability of asylum seekers to obtain work       authorization and stripping rules that were designed to lift       standards and wages for agricultural workers in the H-2A       program.        As a nation, we must uphold our humanitarian obligations       and insist on strong protections and rights for all workers,       children and families, regardless of immigration status.       Amidst escalating displacement and exploitation, we urge you       to vote NO on the Secure the Border Act.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                             SEIU,                                       Washington, DC, May 10, 2023.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I urge you       to vote no on H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act of 2023.        SEIU opposes this bill in its entirety because it is built       on a false and small-minded premise that immigrants are a       menace to be feared, fought against, and punished. If we let       unfounded fear guide our immigration policies, we will       squander the powerful social and economic benefits that       immigrants provide. Immigrants today, like those of the past,       are a source of tremendous pride, productivity, and promise,       who make our nation stronger.        Our laws should therefore be designed to promote their       orderly integration and thus to maximize the benefits they       provide. H.R. 2 takes the opposite approach. It offers no       solution to the real global challenges that are uprooting an       unprecedented number of persons worldwide, and it ranks among       the most extreme and unworkable immigration bills that have       ever received a vote in Congress.        Among its many harmful provisions, H.R. 2 would endanger       children by mandating their incarceration with family members       and eliminating legal protections for unaccompanied children.       It would eliminate meaningful access to the asylum system for       many persons fleeing persecution, and deny work authorization       to individuals seeking asylum. It would criminalize visa       overstays of as little as 10 days, no matter how innocent the       explanation. It would expedite construction of Trump's       worthless and expensive wall at any cost. It would make E-      Verify mandatory for all businesses after a short phase-in,       despite evidence that doing so would merely encourage the       growth of the black-market underground economy and that it       would impose a burden on small businesses. And it would limit       federal partnerships with nonprofit and faith-based groups,       and punish them financially for fulfilling their humanitarian       mission. Instead of proposing solutions, H.R. 2 would       actually encourage lawlessness by blocking lawful paths for       migrants fleeing nations in crisis, and denying work       authorization while applications are pending.        Like most Americans, SEIU is frustrated by the lack of       progress towards the immigration reform that our nation       desperately needs. Such reform would legalize undocumented       immigrants, reform legal immigration pathways, and put       balanced procedures in place at the border that ensure order       and security as well as humane treatment. The toxic,       divisive, and mean-spirited measures that make up H.R. 2       would not do any of that, and SEIU urges you to vote no on       the bill. SEIU may include votes on this bill in our       congressional scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                 Rebecca Wasserman,      Government Relations Director.                                   ____                                  Agriculture Workforce Coalition,                                                     April 19, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan, Chairman      Hon. Jerrold Nadler, Ranking Member,      House Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan and Ranking Member Nadler: We, the       Agriculture Workforce Coalition (AWC), are writing in       opposition to the consideration of the Border Security and       Enforcement Act of 2023 (H.R. 2640) without concurrent,       meaningful legislation to address the labor crisis faced by       America's farmers, ranchers and growers. As organizations       serving as the unified voice of agriculture in the effort to       ensure that America's farmers, ranchers and growers have       access to a stable and secure workforce now and in the       future, we believe that the reforms envisioned in H.R. 2640       relative to mandatory E-Verify, on their own, would cause       agricultural production to fall by $60 billion dollars, and       food prices to increase by 5-6 percent. This would be       crushing to an already struggling and vulnerable industry.        Mandatory E-Verify without workable solutions for both the       domestic workforce and our H-2A employers puts these American       jobs, and the economies of communities across the country, in       jeopardy. As we have repeatedly stated, agriculture faces       unprecedented challenges from rapidly rising costs, many of       which are imposed by the federal government, as well as       competition from imported agricultural products typically       produced at a lower cost. American agriculture relies heavily       on foreign-born workers due to the extremely limited supply       of domestic farm labor. Continued inaction by Congress in       light of these realities will mean more fields lying fallow,       more farmers losing their livelihoods and fewer of the foods       we eat being grown in America.        The economic impacts of this will spread far beyond the       farm gate as Americans working in industry sectors both       upstream and downstream of the farm will see their jobs       threatened. Studies have shown that each hired farm employee       supports 2 to 3 full-time American jobs in the food       processing, transportation, farm equipment, marketing, retail       and other sectors.        The path forward is clear--Congress should pass a solution       that addresses both our current agricultural workforce and       modernizes our guest worker program to meet future needs.       Only then can we support the implementation of a mandatory E-      Verify policy. The AWC remains committed to working with the       House Judiciary Committee members and others to develop       legislation that addresses agriculture's labor needs.            Sincerely,        American Farm Bureau Federation, AmericanHort, Florida       Fruit & Vegetable Association, International Fresh Produce       Association, National Council of Agricultural Employers,       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Farmers       Union, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork       Producers Council, National Potato Council, USA Farmers, U.S.       Apple Association, Western Growers Association.                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Sorensen).    Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget  Office estimates that the child deportation act provision requiring DHS  to negotiate with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to return  unaccompanied children will result in 550,000 children being deported  back to the violence they fled from over a 10-year period.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 is an anti-immigrant and un-Christian bill, just  as legislation previously introduced by Representative Roy was. That is  why nearly 150 community and religious groups oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in opposition from 136  community and religious groups, including Bethany Christian Services,  Catholic Charities, and Union for Reform Judaism, Sojourners, U.S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the Jesuit Conference.                                                       May 8, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.     Vote Recommendation Opposing H.R. 2 Secure the Border Act of 2023         Dear Representative: The undersigned state, local, and       national immigration, civil rights, public health, education,       religious, labor, climate justice, and other organizations       write to respectfully request that you VOTE NO on H.R. 2, the       Secure the Border Act of 2023, set to receive a vote on the       House floor on May 11. The bill would dismantle the asylum       system and cause immeasurable harm to immigrant communities.       The newly elected majority is driving an intentionally       divisive agenda to amplify anti-immigrant animus without       moral and effective policy solutions. We ask you to oppose       this anti-immigrant bill that would:        1. Deport Unaccompanied Children. The bill would end Health       & Human Services funding for legal representation of       unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, depriving       children of the attorneys their safety depends upon. It would       also provide only a cursory screening process for children at       the border, risking children's summary return to human       trafficking and other dangers. The bill subjects all       unaccompanied children to an accelerated removal process       worse than what currently exists, and allows for detention of       unaccompanied children in jail-like border facilities for up       to 30 days--ten times longer than permitted under current       law.        2. End Asylum. The bill would effectively shut down our       current asylum system by adding dozens of new restrictions on       asylum, including eliminating the right to seek asylum for       those who cross the border between ports of entry and barring       asylum for those who transit through a third country. It       would make it nearly impossible for migrants to seek asylum       in the U.S. and significantly easier to deport asylum       seekers, including families and children, into harm's way.       This will only sow chaos at the border, rather than       ameliorating it.        3. Restart `Remain in Mexico'. The bill would restart the       failed and dangerous Remain in Mexico program for all       migrants, including unaccompanied children who were       previously exempted under the Trump administration. Seeking       to unilaterally return asylum seekers to other countries       without consulting the receiving country nor the migrant       results in refoulement of the migrant to danger and       problematic foreign policy implications.        4. Jail Immigrant Families. The bill would require family       detention for any families attempting to enter the U.S. to       seek asylum, as well as any families who previously entered       the U.S. without visas. Like all immigration detention,       family detention centers have a well-documented history of       abusive conditions, including inadequate medical care and       mental health deterioration for asylum seekers, survivors of       trauma, and children.        5. Mandate E-Verify. The bill would require E-Verify for       all employers in the U.S., severely damaging our economy,       harming American workers, and resulting in billions of       dollars in lost government revenue. National implementation       of E-Verify raises concerns about efficiency, due process,       and racial profiling and decreased employment among Latinos.        6. Gut Programs that Work: The bill would strip funding for       the Alternative To Detention Case Management Pilot Program,       Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and the vital       Shelter and Services Program, which has helped communities       around the country receive reimbursement for costs related to       humanitarian responses to migration. These programs have been       effective at providing services crucial to preventing more       deaths under CBP custody and immigrant detention and have       reduced impacts on receiving communities.        7. Burden our Local Communities by Making it Impossible for       Employers to Hire Asylum Seekers with Work Authorization.       This bill eliminates work authorization for asylum seekers       who cross between ports of entry and requires six month       renewal periods for asylum-based employment authorization.       Combined with USCIS processing time, this would effectively       make it impossible for businesses, even in the face oflabor       shortages, to employ asylum seekers. These provisions will       exponentially increase the backlogs at users and make it even       more difficult for USCIS to timely process applications. This       runs counter to bipartisan efforts to improve the employment       authorization process for asylum seekers and will create an       unnecessary burden on local communities.        8. Undermine Essential Partnerships with Humanitarian       Organizations. The bill would bar any and all DHS funding for       NGOs, including faith-based NGOs, that provide shelter,       transportation, food or legal assistance to vulnerable       immigrants, including those who arrive on a visa and later       become ``inadmissible.'' Congress should be investing more in       non-profit organizations providing respite care, legal       service providers, trauma-informed care and community-based       service providers, not subjecting them to the punitive       measures in this legislation. This measure would impact NGOs       across the country that receive DHS funding, including       organizations working with FEMA during an emergency-it's       ``show me your papers'' for the Red Cross.        9. Resume Building Trump's Border Wall. The bill would       restart the construction of the border wall, a harmful waste       of taxpayer resources. It would allow DHS to exempt all       border infrastructure construction, development, operation,       and maintenance from any law except the Constitution, thereby       reducing the rule of law at our borders. The bill would also       restrict the ability for landowners, local communities and       tribes to assert legal challenges opposing the construction       of the wall, and thus pave the way for irreparable and       unchecked harms to the borderlands. We have already seen the       negative consequences from the Trump Administration era       resulting in: bulldozed Native American burial sites;       dynamited pristine mountain wilderness; segments of the wall       being constructed in flood plains; and the unjust seizing of       private ranches and farmlands.        10. Eliminate Parole Authority. The bill would decimate the       parole power that presidents historically have used to parole       individuals in response to humanitarian emergencies or in       furtherance of foreign policy objectives. It also precludes       the President's recent parole programs for Ukrainians,       Afghans, Cubans, Haitians, Nicaragruans, and Venezuelans, and       cuts work authorization for parolees.        11. Jail Any Person who Overstays a Visa. The bill would       jail and penalize immigrants who have violated any condition       of their visa or overstayed by 10 days or more, even for       violations that occur due to circumstances beyond the       individuals' control such as a medical emergency. This       provision would even make it a crime for anyone on a visa to       apply for asylum, given they would not have  [[Page H2231]]       left once their visa expired. Congress should focus on       solutions that regularize the status of long-term residents       and fix our broken immigration system.        12. Balloon Border Agents. The bill would require Border       Patrol to hire enough agents to reach 22,000 on board       (currently there are roughly 19,500) and restrict Border       Patrol agents from performing ``duties of processing       coordinators.'' Processing coordinators currently perform       duties such as transporting and processing migrants and       carrying out mandatory welfare checks. With only around 1,000       processing coordinators currently in the field, this       restriction would seriously hinder Border Patrol's efforts to       fairly and efficiently process asylum seekers and carry out       their law enforcement mission. CBP is overfunded with funding       streams that push resources towards enforcement and wasteful       surveillance, while humanitarian needs go underfunded.        We urge you to vote in ways that protect immigrants and       VOTE NO against H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act of 2023 in       the upcoming floor vote. We must oppose racist, xenophobic,       unconstructive proposals that add fuel to hate and present no       constructive and moral solutions. Thank you for your time and       attention.

Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy and Minority Leader Jeffries: As       President of Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA), I wish to       express our strong opposition to the Secure the Border Act of       2023 (H.R. 2). If adopted, this legislation would severely       restrict vulnerable people's access to asylum, detain more       families including children, undermine U.S. efforts to       effectively manage immigration, and dismantle the public-      private infrastructure currently in place to manage the       humanitarian crisis at the southern border and its impact       throughout the country.        The gospel calls us to provide shelter for those who are       homeless, feed the hungry, and ``welcome the stranger.'' The       work of Catholic Charities is humanitarian not political.       While we do not oppose all the provisions in H.R. 2, several       of them, if enacted, would severely hinder the government and       nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from aiding migrants who       need services, care, and assistance.        The proposed legislation would reverse many protections for       migrants and restrict asylum access, including long-standing       protections that promote the best interest and safety of       unaccompanied children who arrive in the United States. H.R.       2 would defund Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs that       provide participants access to basic services such as       housing, medical care, and legal representation.       Additionally, H.R. 2 would prohibit funding to the Department       of Homeland Security (DHS) for disbursement to faith-based       organizations and other NGOs, effectively cancelling the       cooperation of these organizations with federal, state, and       local governments in receiving newcomers, combatting human       trafficking, addressing homelessness, and responding to       natural disasters and other emergencies. The end result would       be the dismantling of a system to help migrants and local       communities rather than its improvement to meet the       challenges of the moment.        No one can deny our immigration system is broken. Moreover,       the situation at the southern border is dire and needs a       compassionate, humane, and orderly response. However, many of       the provisions in H.R. 2 are contrary to these values and       will threaten the lives of vulnerable persons seeking refuge,       burden state and local communities, and disrupt our nation's       ability to respond to disasters.        While we strongly oppose this legislation, we continue to       call on Congress and the administration to work together to       reform our immigration system and to support policies that       are just, humane and well-coordinated. We look forward to       continuing to work with you to find solutions that uphold       human dignity and promote the common good.            Sincerely,                                  Sister Donna Markham, OP, PhD,                                                    President & CEO,      Catholic Charities USA.                                   ____                        [From Sojourners, May 8, 2023]   Safety and Compassion Can Exist Without Extreme Measures. Sojourners  Urges Representatives to Vote no on H.R. 2., the Secure the Border Act                                  of 2023         Washington, D.C.--In response to H.R. 2, the Secure the       Border Act of 2023, Sojourners released the following       statement:        On May 11, 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives is set       to vote on H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act of 2023. If       passed, the bill will harm millions of migrants fleeing       violence from their home countries by effectively dismantling       the asylum system. The bill would also have a negative       economic impact on local communities by denying work       authorization to asylum seekers who traveled through a third       country or who cross between ports of entry. Unaccompanied       minors will be at risk of further danger as the bill seeks to       end the Department of Health and Human Services' funding for       legal representation.        At Sojourners we have long embraced a consistent ethic of       life, seeking to protect the dignity and sanctity of life;       our migrant family around the globe must be included in this       commitment. Ending asylum will mean certain death for many of       our most vulnerable siblings seeking protection; including       women and children who have already faced a traumatic journey       as they seek safety in the U.S. We urge representatives to       oppose H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act of 2023, as it is an       assault on the inherent dignity and worth of human beings       seeking refuge and it violates current U.S. immigration law       and international treaties.        ``We take the word of God seriously, so when Jesus' words       in Matthew 25 tell us to `welcome the stranger,' we cannot       sit idly by  [[Page H2232]]       as Christians and allow injustice in our nation by ending       asylum and denying welcome to our migrant family,'' said Rev.       Adam Russell Taylor, President of Sojourners.        ``As someone who has accompanied and become legal guardian       of unaccompanied minors fleeing for their lives, the negative       impact this bill will have would not only endanger the       physical lives of migrants but also risk the soul of our       nation--it is up to us as followers of Jesus to embody his       teachings and speak up and take action against this inhumane       bill,'' said Vanessa Martinez Soltero, Immigration Narrative       and Power-Building Organizer at Sojourners.        ``To seek asylum is a human right guaranteed by U.S.       immigration laws and enshrined in the U.N. declaration of       Human Rights and the Refugee Convention of 1951. Decades of       humanitarian migration give witness to the horrors that       people seeking asylum experience. The U.S. inspection       protocols, thorough background checks, and rigorous       screenings have consistently proven that safety and       compassion can go hand in hand. Instead, leaders of the       Republican Party are instilling fear and capitalizing on the       end of Title 42, the health policy that prevented asylum       seekers from presenting themselves at the border, to wield an       anti-immigrant agenda through the introduction of H.R. 2.''       said Sandra Ovalle, Director of Campaigns and Mobilizing,       Sojourners.                                   ____           United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Committee             on Migration,                                        Washington DC, May 5, 2023.        Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the U.S.       Conference of Catholic Bishops' (USCCB) Committee on       Migration to express our strong opposition to H.R. 2, the       ``Secure the Border Act of 2023.'' If enacted, this measure       would fundamentally weaken our nation's decades-long       commitment to humanitarian protection. Provisions of this       bill would endanger unaccompanied children and inflict harm       on other vulnerable persons, decimate access to asylum,       mandate damaging detention and removal practices, restrict       access to legal employment, limit--and potentially       eliminate--federal partnerships with faith-based and other       nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), undermine the rule of       law, and more.        We do not question the good intentions of lawmakers who       seek to enact legislation that would secure our nation's       borders. Indeed, we join in the call to enact effective and       humane border management as part of a framework of       comprehensive immigration reforms. As stated previously, we       also do not discount the challenges at our border with       Mexico, nor the right of nations to maintain their borders.       We have continuously acknowledged the right of sovereign       states to impose certain juridical conditions on immigration       for the sake of the common good, consistent with Catholic       teaching. However, our faith also compels us to be ``vigilant       advocate[s], defending against any unjust restriction [on]       the natural right of individual persons to move freely within       their own nation and from one nation to another'' and to call       attention ``to the rights of migrants and their families and       to respect for their human dignity, even in cases of non-      legal immigration.''        Pope Francis has stated that ``safe, orderly, regular and       sustainable migration is in the interest of all countries.''       Undoubtedly, effective border management is necessary to       achieve that. However, H.R. 2 would not humanely secure our       border with Mexico or help to alleviate increased migration       throughout the Western Hemisphere.        We understand that there may well be a number of provisions       in this bill that you support. However, this legislation       contains such a combination of harmful measures that we       believe its passage, on the whole, is beyond justification.       Such provisions include those that would:                       Endanger Unaccompanied Children         We are deeply concerned about the impact this bill would       have on unaccompanied children (UC). The measure would       override many of the fundamental protections put in place by       the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection       Reauthorization Act of 2008 and the Flores Settlement       Agreement. For example, it would eliminate protections for       young children and children with intellectual disabilities by       removing the requirement that Department of Homeland Security       (DHS) officials ascertain whether a child is able to make an       independent decision to withdraw his or her application for       admission to the United States prior to possible removal. It       would also subject every UC to expedited screening and, for       those deemed eligible at that time, appearance before an       immigration judge within 14 days, without any meaningful       access to legal counsel or a child advocate. This is coupled       with a provision that would abolish all existing government-      funded legal representation programs for UC. Furthermore, the       bill would eliminate the current requirement that UC be       transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and       Human Services (HHS) within 72 hours of being encountered by       DHS, and those deemed ineligible for relief by Customs and       Border Protection (CBP) could be detained indefinitely by       DHS. Detention facilities operated by DHS are notoriously       inadequate places for children to spend any length of time.       Collectively, these and other changes made by the bill would       intolerably alter how our country responds to these       vulnerable children, many of whom suffer severe trauma before       even reaching our border.                          Decimate Access to Asylum         As conveyed earlier in the 118th Congress, we oppose       efforts to inhibit meaningful access to our nation's asylum       process, which this bill would do in several ways. For       instance, it would eliminate asylum as an option for anyone       who enters the United States in between ports of entry with       no exceptions for highly vulnerable individuals, including       unaccompanied children. However, under this bill, even the       ability to seek asylum at a port of entry could effectively       be blocked in favor of ``operational control'' for any person       without a visa, as well as those who transited a third       country before seeking asylum in the United States. This is       coupled with provisions that, among other things, bar asylum       for anyone who makes a claim based on resistance to       recruitment or coercion by criminal or terrorist       organizations, effectively requiring that persecution be       carried out by the state, even in situations where the state       is unwilling or unable to intervene in persecution committed       by non-state actors. Such limitations are inconsistent with       international agreements acceded to by the United States and       longstanding precedent. They also demonstrate a concerning       disregard for the prominence and impunity enjoyed by criminal       and terrorist organizations in many countries. Furthermore,       the bill would require a fee of ``not less than $50'' for       each asylum application filed without the possibility of a       waiver. The right to seek asylum should never hinge entirely       on one's ability to pay for it. It is already difficult to       qualify for asylum under existing law, and further limiting       asylum eligibility in these ways will merely increase       obstacles to potential relief for those with bona fide       claims.               Mandate Damaging Detention and Removal Practices         As mentioned, the bill would subject unaccompanied children       to indefinite detention by DHS. This would also be extended       to families with children on a mandatory basis and seems to       apply retroactively, meaning families already awaiting the       completion of their immigration proceedings for any length of       time before enactment of the bill would be required to be       remanded to immigration detention. Moreover, suggesting a       disregard for accountability and the wellbeing of persons       placed in immigration detention, the bill would defund the       Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, curtailing       oversight at the same time it maximizes detention for all       individuals, families, and unaccompanied children. Likewise,       the bill would eliminate funding for the Case Management       Pilot Program, a more humane and cost-effective alternative       to detention specifically designed to facilitate compliance       with immigration proceedings, even for those ultimately       deemed ineligible for relief in the United States. For asylum       seekers who enter the United States from Canada or Mexico       (whether at or between ports of entry) who cannot be detained       or removed, the bill requires that they be returned to the       contiguous country from which they arrived and remain there       for the duration of their immigration proceedings. In seeking       to revive an expanded version of the immoral and unlawful       Migrant Protection Protocols, the bill dismisses the need for       diplomatic negotiations and creates significant       constitutional questions.                       Restrict Legal Employment Access         Eligibility for employment authorization is already limited       under existing law for those seeking asylum. However, this       bill would go even further by requiring that eligible asylum       seekers (those whose cases have been pending for at least 180       days) reapply for employment authorization every six months.       These applications to renew work authorization will compound       the existing backlog for immigration benefits adjudicated by       U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), further       delaying all manner of benefits under the agency's purview.       Because USCIS processing times already exceed six months for       many seeking employment authorization, it could be impossible       for an asylum seeker to attain lawful employment at all under       the terms of this bill, regardless of how long his or her       case is pending. The measure would also prevent most people       granted humanitarian parole from seeking employment       authorization. These changes would only encourage asylum       seekers and parolees to pursue employment without       authorization or else leave them with no choice but to rely       on social services, charity, and emergency care to meet their       basic needs.                     Limit Federal Partnerships with NGOs         Multiple provisions of this bill target NGOs that partner       with DHS to provide a myriad of services to citizens and       noncitizens alike. Ostensibly, these provisions would prevent       the disbursement of DHS funding to NGOs that ``facilitate or       encourage unlawful activity, including unlawful entry,'' as       well as those that ``provide, or facilitate the provision of,       transportation, lodging, or immigration legal services to       inadmissible aliens.'' In both cases, this language is overly       broad, ambiguous, and unworkable. Given their vast expertise       and the trust they've earned from American communities, many       Catholic and other faith-based organizations have long       partnered with DHS to provide a range of services, including       disaster relief, assistance for lawful immigrants  [[Page H2233]]       seeking to naturalize as U.S. citizens, humanitarian relief,       services for victims of trafficking, and more. The phrase       ``inadmissible aliens'' would be difficult, if not       impossible, for NGOs to apply, since admissibility of       noncitizens is not always readily apparent and, indeed, is       often a matter to be adjudicated by the government. Contrary       to the same subsection's heading, ``inadmissibility'' is also       not an indicator of unlawful entry into, or unlawful presence       in, the United States. As drafted, these provisions could       even be interpreted to prevent schools, houses of worship,       and other organizations from qualifying for the Nonprofit       Security Grant Program amid a rise in violent attacks on       those places. Equally concerning is that the same section of       the bill would prevent any funds from being appropriated to       DHS for the purpose of processing into the United States any       persons arriving between ports of entry, calling into       question DHS' ability to rescue persons encountered in the       desert in life-threatening circumstances and process       unaccompanied children, victims of trafficking, victims of       torture, and others who-even under the bill's own terms-would       warrant such processing.                  Diminish the Humanitarian Parole Authority         Humanitarian parole has been used by every administration,       whether Republican or Democrat, since President Dwight D.       Eisenhower, who directed the Attorney General to parole into       the United States 15,000 Hungarian refugees fleeing the       Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The use of parole has often       been necessitated by emergencies emanating from war and other       conflicts--situations in which such a streamlined mechanism       proved vital to save lives. Even when Congress enacted the       Refugee Act of 1980, largely due to dissatisfaction with the       executive branch's use of parole, it chose to preserve this       discretionary authority, acknowledging the need to ``avoid       crippling the [United States'] ability to respond to [such]       emergencies.'' This bill, however, would abandon that       realistic understanding by severely limiting the use of       parole in such situations. It would also restrict the use of       parole for those seeking asylum, such that it would       effectively be unavailable, furthering the unnecessary and       inhumane use of detention.                Expedite Border Wall Construction at Any Cost         We have long opposed the construction of a wall spanning       the entire U.S.-Mexico border, especially with the dangers it       poses to human life and the environment. However, this bill       would establish unprecedented authorities to advance border       wall construction, which include the ability of the Secretary       of Homeland Security to waive ``all legal requirements       necessary'' to ensure the wall's expeditious design, testing,       construction, and maintenance. This is combined with a       prohibition on consultation with local leaders and property       owners, among others, that exceeds seven days, with the       purpose of such consultation being to ``minimize the impact       on natural resources, commerce, and sites of historical or       cultural significance for the communities and residents''       (removing existing references to ``quality of life'') located       near the border. The bill would effectively undermine       constitutional property rights and further abrogate the       rights of those living near the border by prioritizing       federal land acquisition above such rights.        This is by no means an exhaustive explanation of the       objectionable provisions contained within H.R. 2, given, for       example, its criminalization of visa overstays for the first       time in our country's history (even if inadvertent or based       on a pending adjustment of status) and its E-Verify mandate       for all employers, among other issues. Nevertheless, the       provisions discussed underscore the extreme nature of this       bill, its incompatibility with Catholic social teaching, and       its inconsistency with our nation's broadly bipartisan       commitment to humanitarian protection.        We take this opportunity to reiterate that ``[n]o       combination of legal pathways or harsh enforcement measures       will suffice to meet the complex challenge of forced       migration facing our country and hemisphere. Only through a       long-term commitment to addressing root causes and promoting       integral human development throughout the Americas, combined       with an overhaul of our immigration system, will we be able       to achieve the conditions necessary to sustainably reduce       irregular migration.''        For these reasons, we urge you to oppose the passage of       H.R. 2 and to support the drafting of bipartisan legislation       that is more in keeping with our nation's rich tradition of       welcome. We remain committed to working with you and the       Administration to address the complex issue of migration,       including the need for humane border management that respects       the God-given dignity of migrants. Thank you for considering       our views and for your work in service of the common good.            Sincerely,                                    Most Reverend Mark J. Seitz,                                                  Bishop of El Paso,      Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.                                   ____                                                  Jesuit Conference,                                   Office of Justice and Ecology,                                        Washington, DC, May 9, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Jesuit Conference       Office of Justice and Ecology, I write to express our strong       opposition to HR 2, the Secure the Border Act, which would       drastically limit the ability to seek asylum in the U.S. The       bill fails to treat our migrant brothers and sisters with the       dignity we all share as beloved children of God.        Every day, our neighbors arrive at the border asking for       help, many fleeing violence and persecution. Yet since the       beginning of the pandemic, most of those arriving at our       southern border have been expelled without even an       opportunity to present their case for asylum.        HR 2 would drastically limit the ability to seek asylum in       this country, require the detention of families, and make it       much more likely that migrants seeking safety are deported       into dangerous situations. Furthermore, it would cause chaos       at the border and significantly undermine the ability of       humanitarian organizations to provide essential services.        While the United States has a responsibility to protect its       borders, it also has an obligation to provide protection to       those fleeing violence and persecution in their own       countries. This legislation falls well short of that       obligation, violating central tenets of the Christian faith       that call us to welcome the stranger and love our neighbors       as ourselves.        As people of the Gospel, we ask you to oppose these efforts       and help keep our country a place where those fleeing       persecution can find safe haven.            Sincerely,                                               Rev. Ted Penton, SJ,                                  Secretary of Justice and Ecology.    Mr. Thompson of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget  Office estimates that the bill would ``affect the legal status of about  4.4 million people who would be granted parole or asylum under current  law.''   Parolees fleeing war in Ukraine and the Taliban in Afghanistan, as  well as those from Haiti and other failed countries in this hemisphere  would be required to leave the United States, and CBO anticipates that  ``half would reside unlawfully in the United States.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans claim that the Biden administration's  policies have led to open borders, but nothing could be further from  the truth.   President Biden has, with little help from Congress, worked to  dissuade migrants from taking the dangerous journey northward. The  Biden administration is surging resources to the border. Even as it  ramps down title 42 removals, it is using title 8 authorities to  promptly remove and bar reentry from certain crossers.   At the same time, the Biden administration is working to make the  asylum process more orderly through the CBP One app.   It has also stood up a parole process for certain Venezuelan,  Nicaraguan, Cuban, and Haitian migrants that in March were credited  with a drop of 72 percent in the 7-day average from a high of 1,231 in  January.   H.R. 2 would take those tools away from DHS.   Mr. Speaker, in the unlikely event that this cruel, extreme, and  unworkable bill makes it to the President's desk, he has promised to  veto it.   To quote the Statement of Administration Policy: ``H.R. 2 does  nothing to address the root causes of migration, reduces humanitarian  protections, and restricts unlawful pathways, which are critical  alternatives to unlawful entry.'' It goes on to say: ``This bill would  make things worse, not better.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the administration's statement.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 2--SECURE THE BORDER ACT OF 2023--REP. DIAZ-BALART, R-FL, AND 15                                 COSPONSORS         The Administration strongly supports productive efforts to       reform the Nation's immigration system but opposes H.R. 2,       the Secure the Border Act of 2023, which makes elements of       our immigration system worse. A successful border management       strategy must include robust enforcement at the border of       illegal crossings, deterrence to discourage illegal       immigration, and legal pathways to ensure that those in need       of protection are not turned away to face death or serious       harm.        The Biden-Harris Administration's approach to border       management is grounded in this strategy--expanding legal       pathways while increasing consequences for illegal pathways,       which helps maintain safe, orderly, and humane border       processing. However, the Administration is limited in what it       can achieve by an outdated statutory framework and inadequate       resources, particularly in this time of unprecedented global       movement. H.R. 2 does nothing to address the root causes of       migration, reduces humanitarian protections, and restricts       lawful pathways, which are critical alternatives to unlawful       entry.        The bill would cut off nearly all access to humanitarian       protections in ways that are inconsistent with our Nation's       values and international obligations. In addition, the bill       would make processing less efficient by prohibiting the use       of the CBP One mobile application to process noncitizens and       restricting DHS's parole authority, such that successful       programs, like ``Uniting for Ukraine,'' would be prohibited.       The bill would also reduce authorized funding for essential       programs including the Shelter and Services Program that       provides a critical source of funds for state and local       governments and reduces pressure at the border.        While we welcome Congress' engagement on meaningful steps       to address immigration and the challenges at the border, this       bill would make things worse, not better. Because this bill       does very little to actually increase border security while       doing a great deal to trample on the Nation's core values and       international obligations, it should be rejected.  [[Page H2235]]         If the President were presented with H.R. 2, he would veto       it.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time for closing.   Mr. Speaker, it is remarkable that Republicans are getting behind the  child deportation act, a bill that would blow a $6.1 billion hole in  our Federal budget at the same time that they are feigning concern  about the Federal deficit.   Today, the other side has said a lot about how the Biden  administration is  [[Page H2236]]  handling the ending of title 42, but remarkably, not one of them  acknowledged that they voted to lift it in February.   Enactment of H.R. 2 would do nothing to keep fentanyl out of our  communities or protect unaccompanied children.                                time  2045    Just for the record, in our section of the bill, fentanyl is not even  mentioned. I would hope at some point the other two discussions  tomorrow might talk a little more directly about fentanyl if it is in  there. It is not in our section at this point.   For the record, the information that we have about 90 percent of the  fentanyl coming into the country comes from the Chief of the Border  Patrol. It is his information. We can only take him at his word.   Those five ports of entry that the chair talked about, that was not  what he said. He said it was in Mexico, not in the U.S., in terms of  being controlled by the cartels. I think we all will admit the cartels  do not control the border within the boundaries of the United States.  It is a play on words, but at least we can be accurate with that.   In terms of how we determine who comes, who is captured, and how the  fentanyl is collected, I suggest that you talk to the FBI, Homeland  Security Investigations, or DEA. They are the persons who interview the  people who are caught at our ports of entry.   More importantly, most of the people who we catch at our ports of  entry are American citizens. They are not, for the most part,  immigrants or aliens, or whatever you want to call them, trying to come  into this country illegally. They are American citizens.   In terms of guns, the cartels are a violent operation. There is no  question about it. We need to do everything that we can to stop them.  We can't keep American guns from going to Mexico unless we come up with  an enhanced policy to do that.   We have to acknowledge that the majority of the guns that the cartels  are using are coming from the United States. As the record will  reflect, there is only one gun store in the entire country of Mexico.  It takes months for an individual to even get cleared to buy a gun. We  just want the record to reflect the truth.   Enactment of H.R. 2, as I said, would do nothing to keep fentanyl out  of our communities or protect unaccompanied children. What it will do  is penalize communities and religious organizations that care for  vulnerable people.   Section 115(b) is so broad that a nonprofit hospital that admits an  undocumented migrant would be deemed as facilitating unlawful  activities. Cartels and smugglers are champing at the bit to see this  bill enacted into law.   H.R. 2 would create conditions where desperate people will be left  with few options but to try to enter the U.S. illegally between ports  of entry. It would be a boon for smugglers' illicit business.   We should be coming together to enact sensible border and immigration  policies that support our communities and economy. We can do better  than the child deportation act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this extreme MAGA bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
