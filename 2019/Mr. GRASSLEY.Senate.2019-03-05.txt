 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as if in morning business.    Madam President, I would like to make a point about the  so-called Green New Deal. It is very obvious it is a reference to  Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s. The implication is that  what the New Deal did for the Depression should be a model for the  environment.   There is just one great big problem: The New Deal in the 1930s didn't  work. It didn't get us out of the Great Depression. The Depression  didn't end until we entered World War II.   Just like the original, the Green New Deal sounds like really bold  action, but it is really a jumble of half-cocked policies that will  dampen economic growth and will hurt jobs.   Everything our government ought to be trying to do is to encourage  economic growth and to create jobs.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I intend to object to any unanimous  consent request relating to the nomination of William R. Evanina to be  Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center,  PN192.   When I noticed my intention to place a hold on this nominee back in  June of 2018, I made it very clear to the public and to the  administration my reasons for doing so, and I put my statement of those  reasons in the Record. I have done that consistently, not only since  the rules of the Senate require every Member to do that, but even  before that rule was ever put in place.   I continue to experience difficulties obtaining relevant documents  and briefings from the Justice Department and the Office of the  Director of National Intelligence, ODNI, related to 2016 election  controversies. On several occasions, Deputy Attorney General, DAG, Rod  Rosenstein has personally assured me that the Senate Judiciary  Committee would receive equal access to information provided to the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, HPSCI, with regard to  any concessions in its negotiations regarding pending subpoenas from  that committee. However, I and the Judiciary Committee have not  received equal access.   For example, on August 7, 2018, I wrote to the Justice Department and  pointed out that the House Intelligence Committee had received  documents related to Bruce Ohr that we had not received. The Department  initially denied those records had been provided to the House  Intelligence Committee. After my staff confronted the Department, we  eventually received some Bruce Ohr documents. In that 2018 letter I  have referred to, I asked for documents based on my equal access  agreement with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, and I have not  received a response to date.   I have since learned that the Justice Department has taken the  position that Director Coats has prohibited them from sharing the  requested records with the committee.   In addition to the records request, in May 2018, the Director of  National Intelligence and the Justice Department provided a briefing in  connection with a pending House Intel subpoena to which no Senate  Judiciary Committee member was invited.   Thus far, the committee's attempts to schedule an equivalent briefing  have been ignored.   The administration's continued, ongoing, and blatant lack of  cooperation has forced my hand. I must object to any consideration of  this nomination.   In the authorizing resolution that created the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence, SSCI, the Senate explicitly reserves for  other standing committees, such as the Senate Judiciary Committee,  independent authority to ``study and review any intelligence or  intelligence-related activity'' and ``to obtain full and prompt access  to the product of the intelligence and intelligence-related activities  of a department or agency,'' when such a  [[Page S1655]]  matter ``directly affects a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of  that committee,'' S. Res. 400. As I understand it, the information at  issue here falls into that category.   Thus, unfortunately, I must object to any consideration of this  nomination. My objection is not intended to question the credentials of  Mr. Evanina in any way. This objection falls squarely on the  administration's continued failure to uphold their end of the  agreement. The executive branch must recognize that it has an ongoing  obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a timely and  reasonable manner.                            ____________________
