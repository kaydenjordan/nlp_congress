 Mr. President, Senator McConnell has come to the floor to  complain about what he calls obstruction of President Trump's judicial  nominees. The majority leader must feel that many of us suffer from  amnesia.   It was just last year Senate Republicans, under the leadership of the  same Senator McConnell, set a new standard of obstruction. The most  prominent victim of Republican obstruction, Chief Judge Merrick  Garland, was President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court. Never,  never in the history of the U.S. Senate has the Senate denied a Supreme  Court nominee a hearing and a vote. Senator McConnell led the  Republicans last year in doing that.   Then, Senator McConnell refused to even meet with Judge Garland,  refused to give him the courtesy of a meeting, even though the judge's  qualifications were unquestioned and even though he had been confirmed  to the DC Circuit with broad bipartisan support.   The way Senate Republicans treated Merrick Garland was disgraceful,  but Judge Garland was far from the only victim of Republican systematic  obstruction during the Obama Presidency. In 2016, there were 30  noncontroversial judicial nominees--17 women and 13 men--who were  denied a floor vote by Senate Republicans. All but two of these  nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous  vote of Democrats and Republicans. Some of these nominees--like Edward  Stanton of Tennessee and Julien Neals of New Jersey--sat on the Senate  calendar for more than a year, waiting for a vote which the Republican  majority leader and his Members refused to give them.   During the last 2 years of President Obama's administration, the  Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 22 judges in 2 years. That  is the lowest number of confirmations in a Congress since 1952. By  comparison, in the last 2 years of George W. Bush's Presidency, the  Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed 68 judicial nominees--22 under  Republicans and Obama and 68 under Democrats for President Bush.   That is not all. Republicans also obstructed 18 Obama nominees by  denying them blue slips. That is the permission slip from a Senator  from the State of the judicial nominee. That included five nominees who  had been State supreme court justices who were not approved by  Republican Senators to move to the Federal bench: Lisabeth Tabor Hughes  from Kentucky, Myra Selby from Indiana, Don Beatty from South Carolina,  Louis Butler from Wisconsin, Patricia Timmons-Goodson from North  Carolina.   Senate Republicans turned obstruction of judicial nominees into an  art form under President Obama. Yet Senator McConnell, day after day,  has said: ``I think President Obama has been treated very fairly by any  objective standard.''   He comes to the floor now regularly to complain about ``obstruction''  of Trump nominees. Senator McConnell and the Senate Republicans set the  standard for obstruction. If Leader McConnell thinks President Obama  was treated fairly with these facts, it is hard to understand why he is  complaining about the treatment of President Trump's judicial nominees.   So far this year, the Senate has confirmed four of President Trump's  circuit court nominees and four of his district court nominees. At the  same point in his first year, President Obama had one circuit court  nominee and three district court nominees confirmed. Twice the number  have been confirmed under President Trump as were confirmed under  President Obama in each of their first years. President Trump's  nominees are moving twice as fast as President Obama's.   Senator McConnell controls the floor schedule. If he wants to  schedule more votes on judges, I suppose he has the power to do so. He  is exercising that power by doing something that has never happened in  the history of the Senate. Four circuit court judge nominees will be  considered this week in the Senate.   Since the Republicans in the Senate are dedicating this week to  judicial nominations, it gives us a good opportunity to look at the  nominees President Trump has put forward for lifetime appointments to  the second highest courts in the Federal system.   Time and again, we have seen President Trump nominate people who are  far outside of the judicial mainstream. For example, there is John  Bush, now a judge on the Sixth Circuit, who blogged about the false  claim that President Obama wasn't born in the United States, compared  abortion to slavery, and said in his hearing that he thinks  impartiality is an aspiration for a judge, not an expectation.   There is Damien Schiff, nominee for the Court of Federal Claims under  President Trump, who called Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy ``a  judicial prostitute.''   There is Jeff Mateer, a Trump nominee for the district court in  Texas, who described transgender children as part of ``Satan's plan''  and who lamented that States were banning so-called ``conversion  therapy,'' the pseudoscience of attempting to ``convert'' LGBT  Americans into heterosexuals.  [[Page S6887]]    There is Thomas Farr, Trump nominee for the district court in North  Carolina, whom the Congressional Black Caucus describes as ``the  preeminent attorney for North Carolina Republicans seeking to curtail  the voting rights of people of color.''   There is Greg Katsas, nominee for the DC Circuit, who refused to say  at his hearing whether the torture technique known as waterboarding is  illegal.   There is Brett Talley, a nominee by President Trump to be Federal  trial judge in Alabama, who has never tried a single case and he wrote  in a blog: ``I pledge my support to the National Rifle Association,  financially, politically, and intellectually.''   There is Alabama district court and Trump nominee Liles Burke, who  hung a portrait of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in his office  and defended it at his hearing, saying it had ``historical  significance.''   There is Oklahoma district court nominee Charles Goodwin, who  received a very rare rating of ``not qualified'' to be a Federal judge  from the American Bar Association.   The list of Trump nominees goes on.   Routinely, we see judicial nominees under President Trump who have a  history of taking ideologically driven positions that are out of the  mainstream. Nearly all of these nominees are members of the rightwing  Federalist Society, which President Trump uses as his gatekeeper for  the Federal bench.   Do you remember Neil Gorsuch, the Supreme Court Justice? Do you know  how he was notified that he had been chosen to be a candidate for the  Supreme Court? You would expect a call from the White House, right-- maybe even a call from the President? No. The White House decided to  delegate to the Federalist Society to notify him. They called Mr. Leo,  their director, and said: Why don't you call Mr. Gorsuch and give him  the good news? Well, it is no surprise to those of us who know that the  Federalist Society, this conservative group, is now the gatekeeper of  all the Federal judges under President Trump.   Many of these nominees have given no reassurance that they will be  independent as judges. And the question obviously is, What impact will  the President--who has unfortunately denigrated and pressured Federal  judges in the past--have on them?   Let's consider the nominees before the Senate this week.   Professor Amy Coney Barrett, who has been nominated to sit on the  Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, is a distinguished professor at Notre  Dame Law School. She has strong academic credentials. She clerked for  Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. But she has no judicial  experience. And she told the Judiciary Committee that she could only  recall three litigation matters that she worked on in her entire  career--three. She has never served as a counsel of record in an  appellate case or ever argued an appeal.   Given her lack of judicial record and her minimal record as a  practicing lawyer, the Judiciary Committee looked at Professor  Barrett's academic writings to try to understand who she is and what  she believes. Basically, that is all we had to go on.   Much of Professor Barrett's writings deal with when she believes it  is acceptable for judges to deviate from precedent. For example, in a  2003 law journal article, she called for ``federal courts to restore  flexibility to stare decisis doctrine.'' In a 2013 article, she said  that it is ``more legitimate for [a justice] to enforce her best  understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks  clearly in conflict with it.'' These are extraordinary--some would say  even extreme--views of the obligation of a Federal judge to follow  established precedent from someone who is seeking a lifetime  appointment to the second highest court in the land.   I would like to address Barrett's Law Review article. She co-wrote an  article in 1998 with John Garvey in the Marquette Law Review entitled  ``Catholic Judges in Capital Cases.'' This article was about what she  perceived then as the recusal obligations of ``orthodox Catholic''  judges. The article said some provocative things. Here are some  examples:   ``A judge will often entertain an ideological bias that makes him  lean one way or another. In fact, we might safely say that every judge  has such an inclination.''   ``Litigants and the general public are entitled to impartial justice,  and that may be something that a judge who is heedful of ecclesiastical  pronouncements cannot dispense.''   She wrote, when discussing the ``behavior of orthodox Catholics in  capital cases,'' that ``the judge's cooperation with evil passes  acceptable limits when he conducts a sentencing hearing.''   This is an article written by the nominee. This is an issue raised by  the nominee. It was such a profound statement about the relationship  between conviction, conscience, and religious belief, that it was the  subject of many questions from many Senators on the Judiciary  Committee.   For the last 2 days, Senator McConnell has come to the floor and  talked about the left asking questions about Amy Coney Barrett's  religious beliefs. Obviously Senator McConnell has not read the  transcript from the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Some have suggested it was inappropriate for the Judiciary Committee  to even question the nominee about the impact of religious belief on  the discharge of her duties. Some of my colleagues have questioned the  propriety of such questions in light of the Constitution's clear,  unequivocal prohibition on religious tests. But I would remind the  Senate that it was the nominee herself, in this 47-page Law Review  article, who raised this issue on whether the teachings of the Catholic  Church should have any impact on the discharge of judicial duties of a  Catholic judge.   So was it any surprise that at least five different Senators--three  Republicans and two Democrats--asked her about the article that she  coauthored? It is no surprise that the gravity of this publication and  the issue it raised led committee members on both sides of the aisle to  ask questions about the nominee's religious beliefs, the contents of  her writings, and how it would impact the discharge of her duties if  she was approved by the Senate.   Who asked the first question about the religious beliefs of Amy Coney  Barrett? It was the Republican chairman of the Committee, Charles  Grassley. He noted that Professor Barrett had been outspoken about her  Catholic faith and asked her when it was proper for a judge to put  religious views above applying the law. Chairman Grassley also asked,  in his second question, how she would decide when she needs to recuse  herself on grounds of conscience.   Senator McConnell comes to the floor and suggests that any reference  to that article somehow raises questions of religious bias. Let me say  for the record that I do not believe Chairman Grassley is guilty of  religious bias, nor have I ever seen any evidence of it. It was hard to  imagine how he could avoid the obvious. She had written a lengthy  article--coauthored an article on a subject, and he felt duty-bound, as  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to ask her questions about her  beliefs on the subject. I don't believe that Chairman Grassley would  ever apply a religious test to any nominee, but he and many of us felt  it important to ask Professor Barrett to state her position clearly on  the convergence of her faith, her conscience, and her duties as a  Federal judge.   Similarly, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch felt it necessary to ask  Professor Barrett to make clear a judge's duty when the laws or  Constitution conflicts with the judge's personal religious beliefs.  Again, I do not believe Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, would  apply a religious test to any nominee, but the nominee's writings and  the questions those writings raised led him to ask the nominee that  question.   Later in the hearing, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, raised  the same issue. I will quote what he said to Professor Barrett:         I've read some of what you've written on Catholic judges       and in capital cases, and in particular, as I understand it,       you argued that Catholic judges are morally precluded from       enforcing the death penalty. I was going to ask you to just       please explain your views on that because that obviously is       of relevance to the job for which you have been nominated.    That was from Republican Senator Ted Cruz. I do not suggest that he  was guilty of any religious bias in asking the question about an  article written by the nominee.  [[Page S6888]]    I take our Constitution seriously when it says there should be no  religious test for public office, but many Senators on the Judiciary  Committee--three Republicans and two Democrats, including myself--felt  the writings of the nominee warranted an inquiry about her views on the  impact of her religion on a judge's role. That is far from a religious  test in violation of the Constitution.   At her hearing, I asked Professor Barrett several questions about her  1998 Law Review article. I asked her whether she still agreed with her  article. She said in general that she did. I said that even though I am  a Catholic, even though I have gone through 19 years of Catholic  education, I have never run into the term ``orthodox Catholic,'' which  she used in that article. I asked her if she could define it. What was  she saying? Whom did she describe? She said it was an imperfect term  but explained the context for her use of it. I asked her whether she  considered herself in that category, using her term which she put  forward as carrying certain obligations on judicial recusal. She  acknowledged again that the term is a proxy and that it wasn't a term  in current use.   Some have argued that I was imposing a religious test--somehow, the  three Republican Senators asking the same question have not been  challenged--or that I was insinuating that Catholics can't serve on the  bench. That is absurd. I myself am Catholic. I deeply respect and value  the freedom of religion in our country and the Constitution. And I will  let my record speak for itself about the number of Catholic nominees  whom I have appointed to the bench or tried to appoint to the bench  with the concurrence of the Senate during the course of my career. I  voted for many judicial nominees who are of the Catholic religion,  including Judge Ralph Erickson, who is outspoken about his Catholic  faith and whom I voted to confirm several weeks ago. I am also sure I  voted against nominees who were Catholic as well because I didn't think  they had the experience, judgment, or temperament to serve in the  Federal judiciary.   At nomination hearings, I ask questions to try to understand how the  nominee would approach the job of a judge. I asked Professor Barrett  questions about issues she raised in her academic writings that could  directly impact the discharge of her judicial duties.   I would note that Professor Barrett put forward her views as part of  the academic legal debate. Contrast that with Paul Abrams, President  Obama's nominee for the Central District of California, who was  aggressively questioned by committee Republicans last year about  statements he made while speaking at his synagogue. Republicans  ultimately blocked Paul Abrams' nomination. No one on this side of the  aisle--not this Senator or any Senator--questioned whether they were  applying a religious test in rejecting his nomination.   When judicial nominees have put forward their views on issues like  the intersection of law and faith as part of the academic legal debate,  I think it is fair for members of the Judiciary Committee to ask them  about it. That is no religious test by my measure.   I voted against Professor Barrett's nomination in committee because I  don't believe she has sufficient experience to be a circuit court judge  and because of her writings about precedent. No one doubts that she is  smart, but she has barely spent any time in the courtroom. The only  basis we have to judge her on is on her academic writings.   Let's be honest. If a Democratic President had put forward a nominee  with as little practical legal experience as Professor Barrett and with  a similar history of advocating for not following precedent, I think we  know exactly how the Senators on the other side of the aisle would have  voted. As it stands, I cannot support Professor Barrett's nomination.    I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs.  McCaskill) and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are  necessarily absent.

The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend Senator  Duckworth to recognize the 100th anniversary of Chicago's Navy Pier,  one of the most visited attractions in Illinois and the Midwest.   Navy Pier, originally named Municipal Pier, was the first of its  kind. The pier was created to bring revenue into the city by supporting  industry and tourism. The pier opened in 1916 and served as a port for  commercial shipping and provided the entertainment and recreation  needed to transform Chicago's lakefront into a popular tourist  attraction.   During World War I and World War II, the pier was used as a naval  training center for over 60,000 Navy recruits and was later named Navy  Pier to honor the Navy personnel who served and contributed to the  national war effort.   Throughout its history, Navy Pier was home to several Chicago  institutions and traditions.   Navy Pier was also the former home to the University of Illinois at  Chicago from 1946 to 1965, nicknamed ``Harvard on the Rocks,'' and  served more than 100,000 students.   Navy Pier originally held the famous Taste of Chicago in 1978 and  today continues to host a variety of festivals, conferences, trade  shows, and live entertainment.   Navy Pier opens its doors to locals and visitors to experience  Chicago's rich historical and cultural history while enjoying  activities and the city's lakefront. Its popular attractions, including  the iconic ferris wheel, have attracted more than 9 million visitors a  year, generated millions of dollars in revenue, and created thousands  of jobs for the region.   It is no surprise that Navy Pier has been labeled a Chicago historic  landmark with its significant contributions to the city of Chicago and  the Nation.   Navy Pier continues to promote tourism and support economic growth in  Chicago and the Midwest, while improving its facilities and core  missions to better provide services to visitors. It is with great pride  that I join Senator Duckworth in honoring Navy Pier and its many  accomplishments.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2037         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
