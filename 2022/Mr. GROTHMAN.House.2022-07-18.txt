 Madam Speaker, in the midst of all the talking about  the love affair the Democratic Party has for abortion and talking about  Ukraine and making another vote there, I am afraid the press isn't  going to pick up on the numbers that have just been released for border  crossings of illegal immigrants or people we have not appropriately  vetted for June of 2022.   It is a hot month in Mexico and a hot month on the border, so the  numbers are not as great as the prior month, but compared to past  Junes, we have once again set a record, and nothing is being done about  it.   If you look at two Junes ago, June 2020, a total of about 11,000  people were allowed in this country.   Last June, we shot up from 11,000 to 79,000, and this year we are at  142,000.   Madam Speaker, that is 142,000 in one month; once again, a record in  June of the number of people crossing the border, and all this body can  talk about is Ukraine and abortion. It is time to talk a little bit  about the future of the country and ask what the Biden administration  is doing to stop this invasion.                            ____________________
