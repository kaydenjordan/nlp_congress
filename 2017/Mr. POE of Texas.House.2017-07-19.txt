 Mr. Speaker, today I was joined by some Members of  Congress, along with other Americans, in taking a stand for the First  Amendment right of freedom of expression.   We stood across the street from the Turkish Embassy, where, a few  weeks ago, Turkish President Erdogan was visiting. But while a peaceful  protest was taking place in May, Dictator Erdogan's security detail  crossed the street and assaulted and beat up U.S. citizens protesting  the rogue regime.   People were injured. The outlaws escaped arrest and fled to Turkey.  No apology was issued by the Turks, but, rather, the government  justified the assault on Americans. Erdogan should not be welcome back  into the United States until he apologizes. Also, the culprits must  face justice in American courts.   The First Amendment right of freedom of expression is the First  Amendment because it is the most important of all of our rights. No  foreign tyrant can assault the First Amendment or assault Americans  without consequences. This should never occur on our soil.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
