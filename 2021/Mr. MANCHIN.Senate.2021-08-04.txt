 Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  and I will explain my reasons.   Senator Daines' amendment seeks to alter the funding levels of  provisions in the Energy Infrastructure Act as reported out of the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Specifically, the amendment  cuts funding for hiring veterans and Native youth to do fire prevention  projects and directs that funding to postfire rehabilitation projects  and to States that carry out projects on Federal land.   We are supportive of both postfire projects and States doing work on  Federal land. That is why we funded these programs at unprecedented  levels in our bill. However, we also support funding for veterans and  Native youth. So I do not believe it is appropriate to cut the funding  for this program.   So I urge my colleagues to please vote no on this amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Amanda  Hoffman, a legislative fellow on my staff, be granted privileges of the  floor for the remainder of the 117th Congress.
