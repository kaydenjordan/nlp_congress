 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise to honor the lives of two fallen FBI agents, Daniel Alfin and  Laura Schwartzenberger.   On Tuesday morning, while executing a Federal warrant in a child  exploitation investigation, Special Agent Daniel Alfin and Special  Agent Laura Schwartzenberger were shot and killed in the line of duty  in Sunrise, Florida. They died protecting our most vulnerable citizens  and the community they loved.   This was, sadly, the FBI's deadliest day since the tragic events on  9/11. It has also been more than 30 years since two agents were gunned  down together in the line of duty.   A 16-year veteran of the FBI, Special Agent Laura Schwartzenberger's  specialty was pursuing crimes against children. Her work with the FBI  Miami field office's Innocent Images national initiative led to the  arrest of those involved in the exploitation of children and  ``sextortion.'' She leaves behind a husband and two children.   Special Agent Daniel Alfin was a 12-year veteran of the FBI. He was a  veteran agent who led the investigation into a dark website called  Playpen, one of the country's largest child pornography operations. He  also leaves behind a wife and one child.   While I did not have the good fortune of knowing these two special  agents, I know this: These were two heroes taken from us, and we lost  them way too soon. These were incredible parents torn from their  families. They were extraordinary public servants trying to make our  community a safer place to raise our families.   To their loved ones and colleagues, I struggle to find words that can  offer solace and comfort in their time of distress. The great poet  William Wordsworth once said: ``Not without hope we suffer and we  mourn.''   Perhaps he meant that we find hope in the belief that our thoughts  and prayers will, in time, heal their families and their colleagues,  and in the hope and the belief that the children of these fallen heroes  will grow up knowing that their parents made the sacrifice to make  their world and our world a better place.   Agents Alfin and Schwartzenberger put their lives on the line every  day to help us be safer. We lost them to a senseless act of violence by  someone with a total disregard for the lives of others. We lost them to  evil.   We grieve their loss, not only to the community they served, but to  the families and loved ones that they leave behind. They made the  ultimate sacrifice and, for that, Americans will be forever in their  debt and forever grateful.   May their memories be a blessing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise to support H. Res. 72, legislation I never hoped to author.   My resolution would remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from  her committee assignments. We have already heard today a lot about  precedents, so let me explain the precedents which brought us here.   Congresswoman Greene advocated for the execution of a leader of this  House. She advocated for the execution of former President Obama. She  encouraged violence against law enforcement and has a long record of  racist, anti-Semitic, and Islamophobic comments.   She spread cruel conspiracy theories, even claiming the horrific mass  school shootings in Sandy Hook and Parkland were staged, and even  stalked a young survivor of one of those tragedies, calling him a  ``coward.''   These are unprecedented comments and actions by a Member. No one else  on this floor has called for violence against other Members and law  enforcement. Only one Member has done that and refused to back down,  and that is the real precedent we are dealing with today.   We have also heard about regrettable conduct before taking office, a  so-called statute of limitations on bad behavior. Prior to her floor  remarks this afternoon, Congresswoman Greene spent this entire week  doubling down on her promotion of violence, bigotry, and conspiracy  theories.   Her response to her critics just yesterday was: ``I won't back down.  I'll never apologize.''   We have also heard today about revenge and whataboutism. Greene  herself threatened that when Republicans wield the gavel, Democrats  will face a similar fate.   And if a Democrat proposes violence against Members and peddles  dangerous lies and conspiracy theories, then refuses to renounce them  and our caucus refuses to police it, then punishment would be in order.   That is the reality of what we are dealing with today with  Congresswoman Greene. We are dealing with conduct that brings shame on  this House and a pointed refusal to denounce or internally police it by  Republicans.   Congresswoman Greene's past support and present reaffirmation for  violence, intimidation, lies, and racism is dangerous. It is exactly  the kind of conduct that helps fuel domestic terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, I don't take this threat of violence lightly. Two years  ago, a pipe bomb, one of 16 sent around the country in my name, sat in  my district office for more than 24 hours with my staff handling and  moving around it before anyone knew or told them it possibly contained  an explosive device. None of my staff signed up for that kind of  threat. No one should be terrorized at work.   But what delivered that bomb to my office was not just one disturbed  man. It was the culmination of endless lies, conspiracy theories, and  hate that drove someone to violently attack his political rivals.   We all saw that unfold again with deadly consequences here in the  Capitol on January 6. We can't afford to have these kinds of violent  threats continue and certainly not from someone in this very House.  This is not about whether we find Marjorie Taylor Greene's speech  offensive.    The point here is that she has promoted and advocated violence.  Denying her a seat at committee tables where fact-based policies will  be debated and crafted is an appropriate punishment and restraint of  her influence.   Congresswoman Greene chose a dangerous and harmful path into this  House, one filled with deliberate lies that fomented violence. Once  elected and seated here as a sitting Member, she then also chose not  only to stand by, but affirm those words and actions.   A deathbed, mild walk back of a couple of wild conspiracy theories  just moments ago is not enough to prevent her future harm. Importantly,  there was no apology for the hurt and harm caused, and she did not  express regret for the stalking of a teenage mass-shooting victim; nor  for life-threatening statements she made or promoted against the leader  of this House, and so much more.   Now that she has made her choices, the House must limit the future  harm and violence that she can invite on this body. The deceptive and  inflammatory  [[Page H350]]  conduct that fueled such violence cannot be tolerated anywhere,  certainly not in this House.   We can take an important step toward restoring integrity, security,  decorum, and truth in this House by removing Congresswoman Marjorie  Taylor Greene from her committee assignments.   While it is an action we do not take lightly, it is the necessary  course of action in the face of her extraordinary behavior that is  unbecoming of a Member of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot here today  so, in closing, let me remind my colleagues that we were sent here, not  only to uphold the Constitution, but to uphold the standard of conduct.   Let me share with you what should have happened. What should have  happened is some remorse for the pain that the gentlewoman from Georgia  has caused and to acknowledge that pain, the damage that she has  caused, the violence she has advocated.   I would have hoped that she would have realized, like so many of us  have, the awe and gravity of serving in this institution and that,  despite all the harm that the words and actions she has taken have  caused, that now that she is a Member of this body, she truly  understands and is sorry she stalked the teenager who was a victim of a  mass shooting; sorry that she actually suggested that our leader of the  House of Representatives should meet a bullet as her end; sorry that  she suggested that President Obama should have his life snuffed out.   But none of that happened, and that is why she has forfeited the  right to serve on committees in this House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise to honor the lives of two fallen FBI agents, Daniel Alfin and  Laura Schwartzenberger.   On Tuesday morning, while executing a Federal warrant in a child  exploitation investigation, Special Agents Daniel Alfin and Laura  Schwartzenberger were shot and killed in the line of duty in Sunrise,  Florida.

These were two heroes taken from us way too soon while trying to make  our community a safer place to raise our families. We grieve their loss  not only to the community they served but to the families and loved  ones they leave behind. They made the ultimate sacrifice, and we will  be forever grateful.   Madam Speaker, I ask the House to please pause for a moment of  silence in memory and honor of these heroes who gave their lives  protecting our children.                            ____________________
