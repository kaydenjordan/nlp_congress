 Mr. President, in August I had the honor of traveling to a  tiny town, to a small diner in Auburn, IN. The purpose of my visit was  to present a military service medal that was nearly 75 years in the  making. Over the last few months, I have had a lot of opportunities to  think about those moments in Sandra D's Cafe and what they have meant  to me. As we approach Veterans Day, I would like to share a few of  those lessons.   I served in the military for 10 years, and I saw firsthand the  sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform. As an elected  representative, I have had further opportunity to visit veterans who  served in conflict zones and families who made incredible sacrifices to  [[Page S6424]]  keep us all free. I learned just how much a sacrifice we truly ask of  our troops and their families.   In the Marine Corps, we have a motto: ``Semper Fidelis.'' Rarely do  we tell folks what it means. It means ``always faithful''--faithful to  our Nation and faithful to all those who protect it, faithful to all  those who serve in peacetime and are prepared to protect it. It is why  I wear this memorial bracelet around my wrist. The folks back home know  I wear it. I remind them of it often because it is important. This  bracelet honors LCpl Alec Terwiske. He was a fellow U.S. marine from a  small town in Dubois, IN, in southern Indiana. On September 3, 2012, he  was tragically killed--for all of us--in Afghanistan.   His mom, Sandy, has become a close friend. She asked me to wear this  bracelet to honor his memory, and I do so. I do so proudly every day to  remember Alec and Sandy and the rest of their family and also to  remember all those men and women who love our country and what it  stands for so much that they are prepared, if necessary, when called to  do so, to put their lives on the line for all of us. It takes a special  person to take up arms in defense of our country. It takes a belief and  cause much greater than ourselves. That cause is, in fact, what America  is all about. It is that very belief that makes me think back to that  cafe in Auburn.   Sandra D's father, Robert Egli, was a World War II veteran who  survived the war. He lived a long and happy life back home in Indiana  and didn't say much about his military service. In fact, when I showed  up, Sandra didn't know much about the story. I did a little personal  internet research in the car on the way there to deliver her father's  missing Bronze Star, and what I found out was very interesting.   It was World War II, in the Philippines, the Pacific theater.  Robert's unit was involved in a battle that saved the lives of 511  American prisoners of war. His actions and those of the other American  GIs with him allowed those Americans to return home, to marry their  sweethearts, to start a family, and to pursue the American dream.   Now, think about it. This is the beauty and the magic of the gift  that so many of our men and women in uniform have given or are prepared  to give. Because of the sacrifice of Robert Egli, there are hundreds of  Americans who have had children and grandchildren who are now alive  today. As a result of his beautiful act of courage, his selfless act of  service on behalf of all of us, his patriotism, his sacrifice, maybe  tens of thousands of people across America are alive.   For these reasons and many, many more, we must never stop working to  ensure that our veterans receive the respect they deserve. That  includes ensuring that our veterans receive the care they are due after  they are back, safe and secure, at home.   The Senate has already taken up and passed many pieces of nonpartisan  legislation--commonsense legislation which I cosponsored and was proud  to see become law that will improve the lives of our veterans.   The VA MISSION Act is perhaps the most notable and ambitious effort  where we have all come together to support our veterans. This law has  already dramatically improved the way veterans receive their  healthcare. We have also taken steps to speed up the appeals process  for veterans through the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization  Act. No one should ever have to wait years or, perhaps even in the  worst instance, pass away, waiting on their benefits. We made  significant improvement with respect to that process.   We improved the way our veterans are cared for in nursing homes, and  we worked together to provide urgently needed support for veterans who  may be contemplating suicide. This year, I have introduced another  piece of legislation, working with Tammy Duckworth, a wounded warrior  herself and distinguished Member on the other side of the aisle. We  introduced the VETS Safe Travel Act to provide TSA Precheck benefits  for those veterans who have been severely wounded on the battlefield.  This VETS Safe Travel Act would help 70,000 amputees, 100,000 paralyzed  veterans, and 130,000 blind veterans who are currently subjected to a  rigorous and demeaning screening process when traveling. Unfortunately,  the legislation has, at least so far, been languishing in the House of  Representatives, and its delay, of course, means veterans in need will  be left waiting. I would really hope that before the House takes  another recess week, they can take up and pass this important  legislation. I think our veterans have more than earned it.   Working together, we made significant strides for our veterans in  recent years, but of course we must always keep striving to do more. It  was George Washington, a veteran himself, of course, who once said:         The willingness with which our young people are likely to       serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly       proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier       wars were treated and appreciated by their nation.    Let's treat them well. Let's appreciate them fully this Veterans Day  and every day. I encourage you to remember your neighbors, the  servicemembers in your State, and servicemembers around the country and  deployed around the world. I encourage you to think of all those people  before and those still with us who are proud to call themselves  veterans of our military.   May God bless our veterans. May God continue to bless America.
