 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to  an urgent problem facing my district. Each and every one of these dots  represents children with elevated toxic levels of lead in their blood.  The red dots represent the higher levels, the yellow dots, obviously,  the lower levels. You could almost draw my district if you follow the  red dots.   The fact is, Madam Speaker, that many of these kids are being  poisoned by lead in their homes and, yes, even in their schools. This  is a problem that disproportionately affects Latinos in our community.   We need action to replace these lead pipes and ensure our kids have  clean, safe water, no matter where they live. That is why I am proud of  our work in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law will  bring $2.9 billion to replace lead pipes in Texas schools.   While we have more work to do, our work in this Chamber is a critical  first step to improving our infrastructure and protecting our children.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.   Our democracy is built on the sacred principle that every American  has an equal and fair right to vote. But States like my home State of  Texas are imposing laws that are already limiting that very sacred  right.   Between bills like SB1 and extreme gerrymandering, the voices of many  Texans are being diluted and silenced, especially Latinos. We cannot  let this stand.   It is our responsibility, our duty to protect voting rights for every  American, no matter what ZIP Code they live in or what language they  speak. The Freedom to Vote Act will do just that for Latinos and for  all Americans.   By banning partisan gerrymandering, restoring the Voting Rights Act,  and creating new protections for voters, we will ensure every American  makes their voice heard.   Mi voto, mi voz.   (English translation of Spanish is as follows: My vote, my voice.)
