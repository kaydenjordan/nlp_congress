 Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to stand here  in the House of Representatives, to have the opportunity to address  colleagues, friends, and the Nation. I especially thank the leadership  for allowing these privileges.   I am grateful to the many people who are still here as we continue  with our statements on the floor of the House. You work tirelessly, and  it seems that you work endlessly, Mr. Speaker. I think it appropriate  that we thank you for being here with us into the late hours as we  present our floor messaging.  [[Page H3400]]    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here tonight to announce that my dear  friend and colleague, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, has joined me in  reintroducing a resolution in recognition of Fair Housing Month.   Housing, Mr. Speaker, is a basic human right, but access is too often  limited based upon race, sex, national origin, and sexual orientation.  This resolution marks the 51st anniversary of the congressional passage  of the Fair Housing Act, properly styled title 8 of the Civil Rights  Act of 1968.   The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination concerning the sale,  rental, and financing of housing based upon race, national origin,  religion, sex, or familial status. This year, Mr. Speaker, also marks  the 31st anniversary of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.   More than 50 years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in  Washington, D.C., Dr. Martin Luther King delivered his famous ``I Have  a Dream'' speech. It was considered, and it is still considered, one of  the greatest speeches in American history.   In his speech, Dr. King called for racial equality and an end to  discrimination. Passionately, he argued that all men are created equal  and should be treated equally. Although that was not the case in  America at that time, he believed it must be the case for America's  future.   I must tell you, we have come a long way, Mr. Speaker, but we still  have a great distance to go to realize the dream of Dr. King, a world  where persons are judged by the content of their character, not the  color of their skin. Dr. King was a very strong supporter of fair  housing, and he envisioned a society free of discrimination.   I would like to speak just a moment about access to affordable  housing. Each year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development  releases the ``Annual Homelessness Assessment Report.'' This is  released to Congress. It provides the best available estimates of  homelessness and how it is impacting the United States.   According to the 2018 report, there were 552,830 persons experiencing  homelessness in the United States on a single night in 2018.   The report also provides details on the demographics of the people  experiencing homelessness. For example, for women and children in 2018,  nearly 160,000 children and youth experienced homelessness,  representing nearly 30 percent of the total persons who are in a state  of homelessness. Over 216,000 women and girls experienced homelessness,  or 40 percent of the total persons who experienced homelessness.   Racial minorities were disproportionately represented among people  experiencing homelessness in 2018. African Americans comprised 40  percent of all people experiencing homelessness, despite making up only  13 percent of the Nation's general population.   Hispanic or Latino persons comprised 25 percent of the total, despite  making up but 18 percent of the Nation's general population.   Nearly 38,000 veterans experienced homelessness in 2018, or 9 percent  of the total.   Furthermore, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition,  the U.S. has a shortage of more than 7.2 million rental homes that are  affordable and available to the lowest income renters in our country.   After the 2008 financial crisis, it became clear that we need to  address the epidemic of discrimination in lending where communities of  color are disproportionately targeted. I can recall, having been on the  Financial Services Committee, how we received testimony from persons  who indicated to us that as a result of this downturn in 2008, the  community of color, the African American community in particular, lost  a generation of wealth. This is something that we are still trying to  recover from.   This is why we need the Fair Lending for All Act. The Fair Lending  for All Act would create such a fair lending testing program that would  penalize individuals who discriminate. When they do so, and they  discriminate invidiously and cause harm to persons, when they hold  predatory loans and they make these loans, they will be held  accountable because we must ensure we are not only understanding the  patterns of housing discrimination more thoroughly but also understand  that we are providing clear oversight and guidelines to combat housing  discrimination.   In 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,  commonly known and well-known as the Kerner Commission, concluded in a  groundbreaking report that White racism led to pervasive discrimination  in employment, education, and housing.   In 2015, the Black homeownership rate was just over 40 percent,  virtually unchanged since 1968. Over that same period, White ownership  increased 5.2 percentage points to 71.1 percent, 30 percentage points  higher than the Black homeownership rate.   As a result, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act  on April 11, 1968, 1 week after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther  King. In fact, there are many people who contend that before the demise  of Dr. King, the Fair Housing Act would not have been signed as quickly  as it was.   Dr. King, as you know, was assassinated. For many of us, it was a sad  and dark day in the history of our country. We were saddened by what  happened to Dr. King, notwithstanding the fact that the Fair Housing  Act became law as a result of his untimely demise.   The Fair Housing Act was conceived to battle discrimination in  housing related to these housing transactions that are supposed to  allow everyone to access housing but don't always accomplish those  goals.   More than 4 million Fair Housing Act violations occur each year  against people of all protected classes, including based on sexual  orientation and gender identity. Less than 1 percent of the violations  of Fair Housing Act laws are reported each year.                                time  1915    In 2017, approximately 28,843 housing discrimination complaints were  filed. Of these, 20,595 complaints, or approximately 70 percent, were  filed with local private, nonprofit, fair housing centers.   Housing bills in the 116th Congress include H.R. 123, the FHA  Additional Credit Pilot Program Reauthorization Act.   We introduced this on January 3, 2019. This would extend section 258  of the National Housing Act, which established an automated process for  providing alternative credit rating information for mortgagors and  prospective mortgagors.   I would add that, simply put, this would give persons who pay their  light bills, their gas bills, their water bills, all of their utility  bills timely but they don't have thick credit files--in fact, they have  thin credit files, and some of them have no credit at all, in addition  to these bills that they pay on a monthly basis--an opportunity to have  these payments scored so that they, too, might have the opportunity to  own a home.   Representative Vicente Gonzalez is one of the cosponsors of this  legislation.   H.R. 166, the Fair Lending for All Act, was introduced on January 3  of 2019, and this would establish an Office of Fair Lending Testing to  test for compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, ECOA, and to  create criminal penalties for invidious discrimination in lending.   H.R. 149, the Housing Fairness Act, was introduced on January 3,  2019, and it would instruct the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development to conduct a nationwide testing program.   This nationwide testing program would be utilized to detect and  document differences in the treatment of persons seeking to rent or  purchase housing or obtain a refinance of a home mortgage loan. It  would measure patterns of adverse treatment because of race, color,  religion, sex, familial status, disability status, or national origin  of renters, home buyers, or borrowers. And it would measure the  prevalence of such discriminatory practices across the housing and  mortgage lending market.   H.R. 165, Improving Access to Homes for Heroes Act. This was  introduced January 3, 2019. It would provide Congress with the  information it needs, as we work toward ending homelessness among our  veterans, by requiring HUD to provide Congress with an annual report  that gives a comprehensive assessment of the efforts being made to  provide housing assistance to our veterans, and it would also require  public housing agencies to include veterans in their public housing  planning.  [[Page H3401]]    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be associated with all of the bills. We  are honored to act as original sponsors of all of these pieces of  legislation, but I am much more proud of the fact that, in this  country, we are still making progress, but we really have come a long  way.   I can remember a time when the public housing in this country was  segregated, literally--tax dollars providing housing that was  segregated.   I am proud to say that we have come a long way and integrated the  public housing, housing paid for with American tax dollars.   I can remember a time in this country when there were neighborhoods  that persons of African ancestry were restricted from living in.  Restrictive covenants were prevalent. And there are still some  neighborhoods that there is a degree of difficulty acquiring access to;  but, generally speaking, restrictive covenants are no longer in  existence to the extent that they are commonly used to exclude persons  of color, and other persons as well, based on religious preferences,  from the neighborhoods.   This is a country that still has a long way to go, but this is a  country that has made some great strides.   Notwithstanding the strides, however, we must continue to do our very  best to make sure every person who wants housing and can afford it can  get housing, which means that we have to have affordable housing.   I was very proud this week that just passed, in Houston, Texas, to  visit an area in my district, the Ninth Congressional District of  Texas, where a project had been razed, as in eviscerated, and there was  a raising, if you will, of another project.   This project cost approximately $30-plus million, and it was  subsidized in part from CDBG dollars from this Congress to the tune of  about $3 million.   It was a wonderful thing to see this new growth, if you will, this  new housing development in this community. It is a wonderful project  that has amenities that you might expect to find in an upscale  neighborhood.   Within the center for persons to use, the common area, there is a  business center right within that complex. There is also a facility for  meetings. There was an exercise room. And their plan is to have a  swimming pool. Yes, people who need affordable housing do swim. They  enjoy exercising, and they want to have the opportunity to go online  and conduct business just as other people do.   So it was a wonderful thing to see this project have all of these  various amenities that you might find in an upscale neighborhood.   I was there with a good many people who were just proud to be a part  of the community and to see this development take place within their  neighborhood.   As you know, we dwell in our houses, but we live in our  neighborhoods. And in living in a neighborhood, you want to make sure  that you have got quality housing. You want parks. You want schools.  You want the opportunity to have your food source immediately available  to you, readily available.   This is all a part of what is being developed as a result, in part,  of these new housing projects coming online.   So it is important for us to continue to use community development  dollars in a very positive way, so that we can continue to develop, not  just homes for people, but neighborhoods for people to live in as well  as homes for them to dwell in.   Houston, Texas, I am proud to say, has a mayor who has made it his  mission to be a good partner in the wise and judicious use of these  community development dollars. That is but one project that I can call  to your attention. I have attended the ribbon cutting of many other  projects that are similarly situated.    I would add, as I come to a close, that the housing crisis that we  are experiencing now is one that is quite visible. In my lifetime, I  don't think I have seen this number of people dwelling on the bridges,  dwelling along the side of freeways, dwelling under trees.   We say that home is where the heart is. If this is true, we have to  query: Where is the heart of the homeless? Where is the heart of the  homeless? Is it on a bridge or under a bridge or near a park bench at  night? Is it someplace where those of us who lead lives adorned with  luxury don't have them in sight?   Where are the homeless? Where is the heart?   But the question really isn't, where is the heart of the homeless  person. The question is: Where is our heart?   Where is the heart of a nation that is the richest in the world that  can tolerate this level of homelessness that is in plain sight?   You don't have to look very far to see it. Many of us take the  freeways and we avoid it, but it is right there for all to see.   Where is our heart? Where is the heart of the country that can put  people on the moon, the country that can house people in space  stations; where is the heart of the country that can do all of these  magnificent things, yet have persons who are sleeping under bridges?   I am proud that the Honorable Maxine Waters, the chairperson of the  Financial Services Committee, has a bill that we are taking up, a bill  that would accord some many billions of dollars for the homelessness  part of it, some $5-plus billion, and it would attempt to tackle this  problem of homelessness in a very positive way.   It is not just another Lilliputian effort. This is a noble effort to  do what we can to provide homes for people who are living on the  streets of life in the richest country in the world.   So, this month I am proud to bring this resolution to the floor, and  I am proud to tell you that we are going to tackle these problems. We  may not solve them immediately, but we have the will to solve them  eventually.   This is our challenge. This is our quest. And this is what we must do  in the richest country in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 27 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  May 2, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
