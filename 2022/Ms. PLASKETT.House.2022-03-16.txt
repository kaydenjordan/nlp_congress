 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the CROWN Act,  Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair, H.R. 2116, which  I urge this body to pass this Friday in the House.   I stand in support for all the girls and women who need the freedom  to be who God made them, to be their beautiful selves from the tips of  their toes to every twist, wave, and coil of their beautiful hair.   Fifty-three percent of Black mothers, whose daughters have  experienced hair discrimination, say their daughters experienced the  discrimination as early as 5 years old.   Eighty-six percent of Black teens who have experienced hair  discrimination state that they experienced it by the age of 12. Trauma  means that teenage girls are missing a week of school per year due to  their hair dissatisfaction.   As a small girl, I remember after school telling my mother about a  man joking about my perfectly coifed, round Afro. Her lioness reaction  gave me the strength to endure microaggressions I received when I wore  my hair in locs, then cornrows or braids as an adult.   These biases continue to perpetuate unfair scrutiny, and I stand and  ask you all to stand with me for my daughter and for others like her to  be their most glorious selves.                            ____________________
