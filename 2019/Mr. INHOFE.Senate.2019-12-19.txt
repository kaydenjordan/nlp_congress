 Mr. President, on another subject, even though I am very  close to this subject in that I chaired the Armed Services Committee,  and that is where all of this really began, I do want to mention one  thing about what happened this morning. I think our leader over here,  Mr. McConnell, did a superb job. He made it very clear on the  impeachment that took place last night. It is something that has not  happened before. It is the first time it has happened, in that there is  no impeachable offense, and it is nonetheless, I think, all driven by  hatred. When you stop to think, here it is right before Christmas, and  the hatred that is driving that, it is wrong.   I want to mention something that is significant, that you haven't  thought of, I say to the Presiding Officer. That is, this 153rd day of  the year is very significant. That is December 19. People have not  stopped to realize the significant things that have happened on  December 19 throughout our history and the history of the world, going  all the way back to December 19, at 11:54, Henry II became King of  England. We haven't really thought about the fact what does that mean  to us today, but we will before long.   In 1843, December 19, again, Charles Dickens wrote ``A Christmas  Carol.'' It is the most watched, listened to, and sung event every  Christmas.   In 1932, December 19, the British Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC,  began transmitting overseas. That was the beginning of a whole new  world of knowledge and understanding.   In 1950, December 19, NATO named General Dwight D. Eisenhower as  supreme commander of the Western European defense forces.   Then in 1972, December 19, Apollo 17, the last of the Apollo moon  landings returned to earth.   December 19 of 1984--I remember this well because I was in Hong Kong  when this happened--that was when China signed an accord returning Hong  Kong to the Chinese sovereignty. A lot of people thought it was good at  the time to accept people from Hong Kong. I was there, and look what  has happened now after all these years. I would have to say that  hysteria has continued to this day.   Then, in 1998, December 19, the U.S President Bill Clinton was  impeached. I was there at that one, too. We have something to compare  it with now, but that was December 19, 1998.   The event that is more significant by a landslide is what happened on  December 19, 1959. On December 19, 1959, my wife Kay and I got married.  That makes this the 60th anniversary of our wedding. Just look at all  the beauty that has followed us, 20 kids and grandkids. All of that in  that 60-year period of time.   What I want to say is the beautiful life that we are still having  together--and I would like to say at this point that Kay, after 60  years, is still loving, and I wish you a happy anniversary; and to  everyone out there as you celebrate the birth of Jesus, Merry  Christmas, and God bless you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, after visiting our southern border  countless times, most recently in August when I toured the Mexican side  of the border with their deployed National Guard units, I know that we  face a dire situation that is only improving because of the aggressive  action taken by President Trump. As he and I both know, more needs to  be done. Securing our border is vital to national security.   In our discussions with the Mexican Government following my recent  trip, they expressed strong support for doing work on their southern  border to stem the tide of illegal immigrants from other nations in  Central America. Accordingly, I am proud to introduce the Mirador- Calakmul Basin Maya Security & Conservation Partnership Act, which will  provide critical resources to the region to supplement the efforts made  by the Government of Mexico to secure its own southern border. These  resources will be critical because increased insecurity and lack of  economic opportunity in this region are drivers of emigration from  Guatemala and Mexico to the United States as local communities face  pressure to participate in deforestation, logging, narcotics  trafficking and other illicit activities. It is in the best interest  for the national security of the United States to support political  stability, reduced migration, reduction of poverty, and enhanced  economic development around the basin in Guatemala and Mexico.   The Mirador Basin features beautiful Mayan ruins with networks of  pyramids, palaces, and ancient cities that many consider to be the  eighth wonder of the world, and I would agree. I used to fly my plane  over the Mirador Basin, and I have seen the magnificent structures with  my own eyes. My legislation will support efforts made by the Department  of the Interior, the Department of State, the Mexican Government the  Guatemalan Government and various universities and research  institutions to secure this region and ensure future generations are  afforded the same opportunity to see these magnificent Mayan ruins.   One of the most important things we can do to secure this region is  support the local communities surrounding the Mirador Basin by  providing economic opportunity and ensuring that this community  receives direct economic benefit. If the members of the local community  are able to find work in the region, it will greatly reduce the  incentive to attempt the arduous journey to illegally immigrate to the  United States.   Mr. President, it is critical that we secure our southern border.  Border security is national security. It is just that simple. There are  many proposals targeting this issue, and I support many of them-- including building the wall. This additional legislation is a targeted  approach, and I thank Senators Udall and Risch for joining me in this  initiative.                            ____________________
