 Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Judge  Stephanie Davis, who is nominated to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court  of Appeals.   Judge Davis has spent her entire career in Michigan, and we are  better for it. Judge Davis began work in the U.S. Attorney's Office in  the Eastern District of Michigan in 1997. During her time there, she  served in the office's civil and criminal divisions. She prosecuted  fraud, bank robbery, embezzlement, violent crime, public corruption,  and criminal conspiracies involving drug trafficking, as well as money  laundering. She oversaw community and law enforcement initiatives and  led the office's diversity efforts.   In 2016, Judge Davis became a magistrate judge for the U.S. District  for the Eastern District of Michigan.   In 2019, with the strong support of both Senator Peters and myself,  Judge Davis was nominated by President Trump to serve as U.S. district  judge for the Eastern District of Michigan. Her confirmation was  bipartisan, and so was her support in committee for this Sixth Circuit  nomination.   Judge Davis has done an outstanding job every place she has been  serving the people of Michigan, and I have no doubt that she will  continue her strong record of public service on the U.S. court of  appeals.   I have had the opportunity to get to know Judge Davis, and it has  really been a joy. She is not just an extremely accomplished jurist,  she is also a wonderful person, and those qualities, no doubt, are  needed more than ever these days. So it is with great confidence that I  urge my colleagues to support this wonderful nomination.   Mr. President, I would now ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 2:15 as is part of the schedule.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have two requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
