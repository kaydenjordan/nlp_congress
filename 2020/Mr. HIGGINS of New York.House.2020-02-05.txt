 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly support this bill, which would  increase funding to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to $475  million by the year 2026.   This funding is essential to the health of the Great Lakes. We have  made incredible progress to restore plant and animal habitats, control  invasive species, combat harmful algal blooms, improve water quality,  and clean up the environment of this region.   The revitalization of the Buffalo River in my district, which was  once declared ecologically dead, environmentally destroyed, it is now a  destination for nature and recreation and is one of the great success  stories of this program.   It has yielded impressive economic benefits. Every $1 in funding  generates $3.35 in economic activity. In Buffalo, the number is greater  than $4.   Attacks on clean water now threaten the progress that we have already  made, and there is still much work left to be done. I urge my  colleagues to join me in enthusiastically supporting this bill.
