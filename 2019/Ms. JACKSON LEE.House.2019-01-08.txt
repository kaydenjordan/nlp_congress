 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 259, the  ``Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019'' that extends the ``Medicaid Money  Follows the Person'' rebalancing demonstration project.   The ``Medicaid Money Follows the Person'' demonstration project  supports reintegration of persons with special needs into their  communities.   Since its creation in 1965, Medicaid has been the largest source of  medical and health-related services for Americans with a low income and  limited resources.   Over 75,151 people with chronic conditions and disabilities have  transitioned from institutions back into the community through ``Money  Follows the Person'' programs as of December 2016.   My home state of Texas was among the first 30 states chosen to  participate in the ``Money Follows the Person'' demonstration in 2007.   The ``Money Follows the Person'' demonstration project has helped  more than 10,000 individuals transition from institutional to  community-based services in the state of Texas.   In the 18th Congressional District of Texas there are 162 nursing  homes and out of 162 nursing homes only 67 nursing homes accept  Medicaid.   43 percent of seniors in Houston, Texas earn less than $30,000 per  year.   Texas has the second largest number of individuals with disabilities  of all the states and the percentage of individuals with disabilities  in the state of Texas is 11.7 percent.   In the fiscal year of 2016, Health and Human Services has budgeted  over $16 million in federal funding to help individuals transition out  of nursing facilities, State Supported Living Centers, Intermediate  Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and  other institutions.  [[Page H237]]    The ``Money Follows the Person'' demonstration project has helped  states and the federal government save money. From 2008 to 2013, it  generated $978 million in reduced Medicare and Medicaid costs after the  first year of transitioning participants to home- and community-based  care.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  259.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 269,  the ``Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation  Act of 2019.''   H.R. 269 reauthorizes and strengthens emergency preparedness and  response programs and efforts Health and Human Services (HHS) and  modernizes the regulatory framework at the Federal Drug Administration  (FDA) for over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and provide the FDA with stable  funding to do so through a new user fee program.   H.R. 269 strengthens HHS's emergency preparedness and response by  improving benchmarks and standards, addressing military and civilian  partnerships for trauma readiness, and clarifying state liability law  for volunteer health care professionals.   Additionally, H.R. 269 calls for reporting on the national blood  supply and public health preparedness and response capabilities and  capacities of hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other health  care facilities.   H.R. 269 also allows for the regulation of certain nonprescription  drugs that are marketed without an approved drug application, addresses  the misbranding of OTC drugs, and calls for an annual update to  Congress on the conditions under which certain OTC cough and cold drugs  are generally recognized as safe and effective for children.   H.R. 269 grants authority to assess and use OTC monograph fees as a  source of stable funding to the FDA for its use to modernize the  regulatory framework.   This legislation will benefit all communities by strengthening and  assessing the emergency response workforce, improving the preparedness  and response of health system infrastructure, taking into consideration  at-risk individuals and children, providing guidance for participation  in exercises and drills, and create national advisory committees on  disasters.   In 2014, Dallas, Texas was faced with an Ebola virus outbreak, one of  the world's most deadly viruses.   Howard Duncan was visiting family in Dallas when he became the first  person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States.   In addition to Duncan, two nurses who provided care to him also  became infected.   Zika made its first appearance in Texas in 2015.   In 2016 Texas had 315 cases of Zika, and in 2017, 55 cases were  confirmed.   2017 brought a high severity flu season along with Hurricane Harvey.   80,000 people died of the flu during the 2017 through 2018 season and  over 30,000 people, or 9 percent of the population, were hospitalized.   The severity of the 2017-2018 flu season was in part due to the flu  vaccine, unfortunately, only being effective against only 30 percent of  the viruses circulating.   Also in 2017, the 18th District of Texas and the Gulf Coast saw the  devastation of Hurricane Harvey.   The economic cost of Hurricane Harvey was $125 billion, tying it with  Hurricane Katrina as the most costly storm in U.S. history.   More importantly, 107 people lost their lives due to Hurricane  Harvey.   Then there is the ongoing shortage of medical supplies, specifically  saline solution.   Since 2014 there has been an ongoing shortage of saline, and when  Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017, the country's largest supplier  was damaged causing an even larger shortage.   The saline shortage coupled with a severe flu season in 2017-2018 has  some worried that the demand will quickly outpace the supply.   H.R. 269 will help address these and other local, state, and national  emergencies.   Not only does H.R. 269 address HHS emergency preparedness, but it  also allows the FDA to better do its job to keep Americans safe.   In 2018, the FDA issued at least 1,412 warning letters regarding the  misbranding of products under its jurisdiction.   An alarming number of these letters regard OTC drugs and supplements.   H.R. 269 provides the FDA a stable funding source so that it may  continue its regulation of  [[Page H266]]  certain nonprescription drugs that are marketed without an approved  drug application and address the misbranding of OTC drugs.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  269.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 251, the ``Chemical  Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Extension Act,'' which will  extend by two years the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards  Program (CFATS) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and for  other purposes.   I thank Chairman Bernie Thompson of the House Homeland Security  Committee for his leadership in introducing this important bill to  improve chemical facility security.   The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards CFATS program is the  first in the nation to focus specifically on security at high-risk  chemical facilities.   Through this regulatory program, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) works with facilities to ensure they have security measures in  place to reduce the risk associated with certain hazardous chemicals,  and prevent them from being exploited in terrorist attack.   These facilities must submit their chemical holdings to DHS via a  process known as a Top Screen, which in turn is used by DHS to  determine if the facilities is considered high risk and must develop a  security plan.   The Department of Homeland Security reported more than 90,000 Top- Screen submissions from more than 40,000 unique facilities, of this  number, CFATS program currently cover 3,355 facilities.   Today, Texas is the national leader in petroleum refining and  chemical products production.   Texas alone produces 5.1 million barrels of crude oil per day, which  accounted 29 percent of total U.S. refining capacity.   According to the Businessintexas.com, more than 3,700 energy-related  establishments are located within the Houston Metropolitan Statistical  Area.   The Houston area contributes 40 percent of the national petrochemical  capacity.   The great benefits of the chemical industry provide to our nation a  significant economic strength that cannot be underestimated.   Unfortunately, this great reward does not come without risks.   In 2013, a deadly fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas killed 15  people, injured over 200 people and wiped out hundreds of homes.   On November 15, 2014, a leak of nearly 24,000 pounds of toxic  chemical killed four workers at the E. I. DuPont de Nemours insecticide  plant in La Porte, Texas.   In 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused a chemical plant explosion.   That is why it is important that we vote today to implement the  following recommendations from the report:   1. Extend by two years the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards  program of the Department Homeland Security and other purposes.   2. Continue outreach in support to the DHS effort to identify  chemical facility that are high risks, which will expand availability  of CFATS compliance assistance materials and engage stakeholder to  raise awareness of CFATS requirement and make improve the safety.   Because the mission of DHS is to ensure that our homeland is safe,  secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards, effective  communication within the organization is crucial.   Since its founding, the Department of Homeland Security has overcome  many challenges as an organization but much more progress must be made  regarding Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program.   Although not a panacea, H.R. 251 is a step in the right direction  because it will help improve DHS' overall functions so that it can more  effectively protect our people.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 226, the  ``Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management,''  which amends the Small Business Act.   This act would require the Administrator of the Small Business  Administration to provide in its business goal report information as to  how many small businesses are participating in the ``best in class''  vehicles so Congress can ascertain the effectiveness of such  contracting vehicles for small firms.   H.R. 226 amends ``the Small Business Act to include best in class  designations in the annual report on small business goals prepared by  the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and for other  purposes.''   The report is to include among other things, the number of small  business concerns awarded contracts and the dollar amount of such  contracts awarded within each such designation to qualified HUBZone  small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled  by women, small business concerns owned and controlled by service- disabled veterans, and small business concerns owned and controlled by  social and economically disadvantaged individuals.   Mr. Speaker, 99.9 percent of women-owned businesses are small  businesses, whereas the majority of male- and female-owned employer  businesses have fewer than five employees, more male-owned small  businesses employ five or more employees.   Of the 30 million small businesses nationwide, 8 million are owned by  minorities.   Between 2007 and 2012 minority owned small businesses increased in  volume by around 38 percent.   Small businesses ``are the engines of job creation in the United  States.''   Small businesses contribute to growth and vitality in many important  areas of economic and socioeconomic development.   Small businesses create jobs and job opportunities, spark innovation,  and provide opportunities for women and minorities to achieve financial  success and independence.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  226.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 227, which  amends the Small Business Act to specify what credit is given for  certain subcontractors and to provide a dispute process for non-payment  to subcontractors.   Mr. Speaker, it is of the utmost importance that we pass this  legislation to ensure subcontractors receive the credit and payment for  performance that they have earned.   Between 2010 and 2016, Texas' population grew at the second-greatest  rate in the country, accompanied by increased demand for residential,  retail and commercial space.   With this increased demand came an increase in small businesses and  the need for subcontractors across the state.   This fact alone explains why H.R. 227 is so important not only to  small businesses throughout the country but specifically the small  businesses and subcontractors in Texas that deserve compensation for  their performance in a timely manner.   The Houston Chapter of the American Subcontractors Association (ASA- HC) is a collective voice for a diverse membership that was created in  order to ensure quality, safety and ethics in construction trades.   ASA-HC advocates for legislative reform and provides educational  opportunities for the subcontracting community.   Since ASA-HC's founding in 1966, more than 2,500 member companies  throughout the United States, and more than 160 members in Houston  benefit from the advocacy ASA offers to its members.   These hard-working Americans deserve nothing less than our maximal  support for this bill.   Not only do these Americans deserve our support for H.R. 227, they  deserve our maximum efforts to end the government shutdown.   Thousands of subcontractors whose pay comes from federal contracts  have little hope of recouping the pay they lost when the government is  not operating.   Julie Burr, a single mom from Kansas City, struggles to support her  family during this shutdown.   She has been out of work and cannot receive pay for the two weeks  prior to the shutdown because there is no one to process her time  sheet.   She has taken extra shifts in her side job as a seasonal employee at  Barnes and Noble, but it only makes up 25 percent of what her normal  pay would be and she has had to ask for an extension on her rent  payment, which was due on the first of the month.   Ethan James, a 21 year old minimum-wage contractor can only  realistically miss three to four days of work before his standard of  living is compromised.   He now risks missing his rent payment because he is not receiving the  checks he depends on to sustain himself.   These hardworking Americans deserve more, we cannot afford to drag  our feet on such an important issue.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 227 and standing  true to our nation's commitment to supporting and protecting small  businesses and subcontractors.   I include in the Record a new article entitled ``During Shutdown,  Janitors, Security Guards and other Federal Contractors receive no back  pay.''                      [From ABC News, January 2, 2019]       During Shutdown, Janitors, Security Guards, and Other Federal                      Contractors Receive No Back Pay                   (By Stephanie Ebbs and Anne Flaherty)         While hundreds of thousands of federal workers will have to       wait for back pay after the government shutdown ends,       thousands more whose pay comes from federal contracts have       little hope of recouping the pay they lose when the       government isn't operating. Some contractors are turning to       other means to make up for the lost income, like taking extra       shifts at a second job.        Julie Burr, an administrative assistant for the Department       of Transportation in Kansas City, said she doesn't expect any       compensation for the time she's been out of work during the       shutdown and that she can't even get paid for the two weeks       before it started because there's no one to process her time       sheet.        ``I'm just trying to take one day at a time honestly,''       Burr said in a phone interview. ``I keep turning on the news       and think maybe today's the day something will happen.''        She said she's taken extra shifts in her side job as a       seasonal employee at Barnes and Noble but it only makes up 25       percent of what her normal pay would be and she's had to ask       for an extension on her rent payment, which was due on the       first of the month.        Burr even set up a GoFundMe page to try and help with some       of the expenses and is concerned that even if she can set up       a payment plan it could hurt her credit score.        ``I'm a single mom . . . we aren't a two income family or       anything. It's just me, and I'm kind of trying to make things       meet and if it comes to the point of selling items in the       house I'll do that,'' she said.        During previous government shutdowns, Congress has passed       resolutions approving back pay for most federal workers. But       contract workers like custodians and security officers, whose       hourly wages are funded by private companies, don't get paid       unless they work.        According to 32BJ SEIU, that means sudden unemployment with       no end in sight for the 370 Smithsonian security officers in       Washington D.C. protecting the popular museums--which house       everything from Judy Garland's ruby red slippers from ``The       Wizard of Oz'' to Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis       airplane--as well as the 50 security officers who work for       Smithsonian museums in New York.        32BJ SEIU is a large property service workers' union that       estimates some 2,000 of its members are facing potential       paycheck disruptions as a result of the shutdown, including       some 70 custodians at the Agriculture Department alone.        Most of those workers aren't eligible for back pay because       they are paid by private companies with government contracts       instead of being government employees.        It's a particularly ironic twist for federal workers caught       in the showdown between President Donald Trump and       congressional Democrats over funding for a border wall.        The union said that almost of all of its members are       African-American or Latino and many don't support Trump's       efforts to build a border wall.        ``A true focus on America would mean support for the       hardworking men and women who keep our government safe, clean       and running every day while supporting their own families and       communities across the country,'' said Jaime Contreras, a       32BJ SEIU vice president, in a statement.        ``I wish everybody would just sit down and come to a       compromise,'' she said.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 128 the  ``Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act,'' which clarifies the  duties of the SBA's Office of Advocacy.   I support this legislation because, among other things, it mandates  the SBA Office of Advocacy to examine small business issues in  international economies and authorizes the Office to represent small  businesses interests before international entities and foreign  governments dealing with regulatory and trade initiatives that affect  small businesses.   The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy is an  independent voice for small  [[Page H275]]  business within the federal government that advocates on the behalf of  this vital sector of the U.S. economy.   H.R. 128 clarifies and amends the duties of the Office of Advocacy to  better serve the concerns of small businesses before Congress, the  Federal Government and the international economy.   Small businesses are a critical component of the United States  economy and the 8 million minority owned businesses reflect the  diversity of our economy and our country.   Small businesses make up 44 percent of the U.S. wages and salaries  paid annually to employees which helps stimulate and drive the rest of  the U.S. economy.   SBA reported in 2018 that 99.9 percent of businesses within the  United States are classified as Small Businesses, encompassing almost  50 percent of all employees with the United States.   In Texas, 98.6 percent of firms with employees were small businesses  in 2012 and 93 percent of goods exported internationally were by small  businesses.   By including the international economy within the interests of the  SBA Office of Advocacy, small businesses will be able to compete  effectively with international entities and expand to their full  potential.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  128 and upholding the importance of small businesses within our own  economy and our presence internationally.
