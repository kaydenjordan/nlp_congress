 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. George Dillard,  whose leadership and guidance have made him a valuable member of our  Peachtree City community in the Third District of Georgia.   This is the second time that Dr. Dillard has joined me here in the  Nation's Capitol to pray for the Members of the House of  Representatives, and we are extremely grateful that he did just that.   George has been a vitally important part of the Third District for  over 25 years since he and his family moved to Peachtree City to serve  at the Peachtree City Christian Church, where he still serves to this  day.   George has been married to his wife, Renee, since 1988. They have  three children and one grandchild. George and his family live in  Peachtree City, Georgia.   I commend Dr. Dillard for his commitment to our community and Nation.  There is not a week that goes by where George isn't a visible and  welcoming part of the Fayette County community.   The grace and love he has shown to his parishioners and his neighbors  throughout his 24 years in Peachtree City are unparalleled, and I am  truly honored to have Dr. Dillard here with me today as he prays for  our Nation.                            ____________________
