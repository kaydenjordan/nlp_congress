 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a pioneer of  broadcast journalism, news anchor Art Franklin, who will be making his  departure from CBS 42 in Birmingham, Alabama, on Friday, April 29.   Art Franklin is a multiple Emmy Award-winning journalist whose  broadcast career has spanned more than 38 years and earned him more  than 100 community and journalism awards, including two Emmy Awards.  And, most recently, he was awarded an Edward R. Murrow Award in 2021  for excellence in innovation as anchor of CBS 42's Coronavirus House  Calls.   Art currently anchors the CBS 42 Evening News at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6  p.m., and 10 p.m., after returning to Birmingham to anchor the CBS 42  Morning News with Art Franklin, and served as a managing editor.   Art first came to Birmingham in 1991 and spent 12 years at WBRC-TV,  where he was a trailblazer, becoming Birmingham's first African- American male to anchor in prime time.   During his career of almost four decades, Art has worked as a radio  announcer, a radio news director, a production manager, a talk show  host of both radio and television, a television news producer, host of  a television public affairs show, and the producer of the National  Association of Black Journalist Awards show that was aired on BET.   In addition to his time as a journalist, Art was the CEO of Atlanta- based independent record company 285 Records.   The author of a book, ``Give It All You Got,'' Art launched in 2021  the Art Franklin Collection, a clothing line of men's ties, bow ties,  shirts, and custom suits.   Art sits on numerous boards in the State of Alabama. He is an avid  cook and tennis player, and he is a proud member of Omega Psi Phi  Fraternity.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Art Franklin for his  extraordinary career and contributions to broadcast journalism.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Art. We in Birmingham are so proud of  all that he has done, and we wish him much luck in his endeavors.       Recognizing Princeton Baptist Medical Center's 100th Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of Princeton Baptist Medical Center and Baptist Health  System in Birmingham, Alabama.   For a century, the Princeton Baptist Medical Center has been  dedicated to serving the most vulnerable in our communities by  prioritizing community health and expanding access to healthcare.   As a faith-based hospital, Princeton was built on the premise that it  would provide services to patients, regardless of their ability to pay.  During its first day of operation, Princeton served 39 patients, with  11 more admitted by the day's end, without any operating capital.   Since then, the Princeton Baptist Medical Center began expanding  rapidly, undergoing multiple major hospital renovations. As the  hospital's infrastructure grew, so did its network, expanding to meet  the needs of its patients by adding new departments to expand critical  services and research, as well as to keep abreast of the latest medical  developments.   During the 1990s, additional hospitals joined Princeton Baptist to  build one of our State's largest and most comprehensive network of  acute-care hospitals: The Brookwood Baptist Health.   Since its humble beginnings, Princeton Baptist Medical Center has  remained active in the community, hosting several residency and  mentoring programs. It even became the first healthcare center in the  United States to implement a pastoral education program and student  internship.   Now, with more than 230 physicians, an additional 1,700 employees,  and 505 licensed hospital beds, Princeton Baptist Medical Center  continues to be a centerpiece in our Birmingham community. I am honored  to be their partner in our fight to expand healthcare access to all  Alabamians.   I am proud to honor Princeton Baptist Medical Center for its profound  contributions to our community as they celebrate 100 years of service.   Madam Speaker, I thank Princeton Baptist Medical Center.                            ____________________
