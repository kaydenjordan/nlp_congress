 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chair Fleischmann very, very much for his  serious attention to our complex bill and his cordiality and very  constructive attitude throughout.   I begin by thanking our diligent staff for all their hard work on  this bill. On the minority staff, I thank Scott McKee, Jocelyn Hunn,  and Adam Wilson. On the majority staff, I thank Angie Giancarlo, Perry  Yates, Nora Khalil, Richie O'Connell, Scott Prutting, and Janet  Harrington. On my personal staff, I thank Margaret McInnis and Mayely  Boyce.   As we work on this Energy and Water bill, I place in the Record how  deeply saddened I am by the passing of our dear colleague in the other  body, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who dedicated the best years of her  life to our country.   As Energy and Water appropriators, Dianne and all of us worked  closely over many years to protect the waters of the United States and  to build a brighter, cleaner energy future and to assure America's  nuclear capabilities are secure.   Her acute mastery of the energy, water, and security needs of our  Nation had no comparison, and her dignified, noble public service is  truly a great loss to our Nation.   There is not time during our bill's consideration today to fully  express my thoughts, but I am so deeply saddened for California's loss,  for our Nation's loss, and for all who grieve the loss of the longest- serving woman in Senate history.   All I or any of us can do is laud Senator Dianne Feinstein's  productive career of exemplary effective public service. Rest in peace,  my dear friend.   We consider this important measure at a moment in which the United  States economy is growing at record rates, producing historic levels of  job growth due to the laws enacted by the last Congress.   With historic job growth, revenues are now coming into the private  sector and the Federal Government at much higher levels than before  because post-pandemic, millions more people are working. Companies are  earning money.   The American people again are doing what America does best: being  productive and leaving our Nation to the future in better condition  than we found it.   Indeed, this gross domestic product/debt chart clearly illustrates as  a result of robust economic growth, our Nation has bent the debt curve  as a percentage of GDP for the first time in modern history.   Here we go. It is going down. That is where we want it to go, yes. We  are beginning to pay down our Nation's accumulated debt, largely  amassed from the costs of past wars, the old debts that were not paid  for by those that conducted them at the time.                                time  1745    Then we had the pandemic and, sadly, over several decades, the tax  cuts that were enacted allowed the wealthiest and most productive  powerful corporations in our country not to carry their fair share of  the tax load. I think it is important that everyone share in our  Nation's responsibilities.   In this context, I must offer that I am unable to concur with my able  colleague, Chairman Fleischmann, on this particular appropriation bill.  I prefer a more realistic energy and water allocation that meets the  critical energy and water needs of our Nation, not just for today but  for the energy independence and the water security for America in  perpetuity. We are not out of the woods on this, we have got a lot of  work to do.  [[Page H5067]]    Energy and water security are national security--think about it. Yet,  the nondefense spending in this bill is $6.4 billion lower--25 percent  lower--than last year's effective level. That is a radical,  irresponsible reduction. It repeals over $5 billion for critical energy  programs from the Inflation Reduction Act that would have helped  American families save money on their monthly energy bills while  simultaneously creating thousands of jobs, good-paying jobs, in new  energy technologies.   For energy and water needs, it is not an overstatement to say people  in our Nation live or die by decisions being made here in Congress.   Since World War II, America has paid a terrible price for its  unconscious slide into foreign dependency on imported energy. While we  have made strides toward energy independence after a half century of  effort, starting in the late 1970s, we still haven't scored at the home  plate of U.S. energy independence in perpetuity.   Recently, I read an article that said our country is going to import  petroleum after 2040. Well, guess what? I am not voting for that. Our  position must be to keep American energy and our people secure here at  home. That is one of the major purposes of this bill.   Hasn't our Nation learned repeatedly the hard way that when gasoline  prices top $4 a gallon, our economy is thrown into deep recession. It  is pretty clear. It should be obvious why U.S. energy independence is  so vital. No foreign power should ever again make America vulnerable.   Energy security is national security. We must ensure energy security  within our own borders. We cannot depend on foreign sources in the  event of energy disruptions that are natural or malignly concocted to  do us harm.   Energy impacts every person's well-being. It allows our Nation to be  free, and free of foreign malign influence. How well we know our  Nation's fate can be impacted by events outside our borders.   News outlets are correctly reporting that Russia's unprovoked war on  Ukraine is being waged on more than one front, surely including energy.  Russia is known for manipulation of global oil and gas prices through  reserves they control. In fact, global oil prices surged to nearly $100  per barrel in September after Saudi Arabia and Russia continued their  curtailment of oil supplies.   The sharp escalation in geopolitical risk in the Middle East from the  brutal Hamas terror attack in Israel has oil markets on edge. Check it  out. Let us not forget that the Middle East accounts for more than one- third of the world's seaborne oil trade. Again, energy resources are  intricately bound to the fate of liberty halfway around our world. Let  us make our home front impenetrable.   Energy also allows our private sector and its workforce the ability  to flourish in a modern economy with millions and millions upon  millions of living wage jobs in energy production and conservation,  across all sectors: natural gas, ethanol and biodiesel, nuclear, fossil  fuels, thermal heat recovery, renewables, advancing sectors of hydrogen  and fusion energy, and advanced nuclear platforms.   Meanwhile, imaginative energy conservation and other developing  technologies are being created by America's amazing inventors in new  building materials, solar and electrified windows, biofuels, geothermal  and thermal heat recovery, wind and wave energy, to name but a few.  America will never ever lose through power of invention because we are  a free people.   Let me turn to our water responsibilities. New, major engineering  challenges lie before America. Ask the citizens along the drought- stricken Mississippi and the Louisiana corridor as saltwater creeps  north, or the flood victims in New York City.   Across our Nation, cities are having to manage water and wastewater  loads for which they were not engineered. In rural America, farmers are  losing crops because of increasing rainfall, an inability to manage  water in their fields, and drainage systems that were built for another  era. Frankly, a century or a century and a half ago. Well, times are  changing.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation are needed  now more than ever to handle regional approaches to new and changing  water flows, whether it is down the Mississippi, along our coasts, in  the Great Lakes, or the dry, irrigated West.   There is an old expression: ``Don't try to fool Mother Nature.'' I  would say: Don't ignore Mother Nature. This is one such moment in  American history. I must express the Energy and Water Appropriations  bill before us is completely inadequate. It does not meet our country's  needs in this new era of climate change.   If I need offer more proof, Americans and America are paying billions  more in disaster relief. This country paid over $150 billion last year  in disaster damage, significantly higher than the $60 billion average  from the last 30 years. How about that--doubling and a half. Well, that  is a big warning sign that one simply can't ignore.   We ought to be investing that money upfront to avoid those disasters  by properly funding this bill. We must robustly meet the needs of the  future, not flounder in the past.   In other areas of the bill, I continue to be troubled by the  unsustainable spending in the Department of Energy's weapons programs.  We know we have to keep a tight lid on them because they have a  tendency to overspend when we don't watch.    Further, I am concerned how this bill cuts nuclear nonproliferation  programs that reduce nuclear risks and counter the global challenge of  nuclear proliferation.   Finally, the bill includes numerous controversial poison pill policy  riders that sadly show extremist Republicans are not interested in  bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. America can and  must do better on the new age frontiers of energy and water.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the full Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Chair, I look forward to responding to my dear  friend, former Chair Simpson. However, first, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking  member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee, who does such a phenomenal job.    Mr. Chair, I wish to offer a few thoughts here regarding  what our esteemed colleague, Mr. Simpson, said about the Federal  balance sheet.   If you think of your own checkbook, when you work and earn money, you  have an entry that is positive. You have a payroll check or earn  interest on something. Then, if you have to pay a bill, you put a minus  sign and subtract it, and you see what is left.   What is interesting about the arguments from the folks on the other  side of the aisle is, they only talk about what is subtracted. They  don't talk about what is being added. Both revenues and expenditures  are a part of the Federal budget.   It is interesting to me. I have served in Congress for a while now,  and the other side never talks about revenues. They only talk about  expenditures. The interesting thing about revenues is when an economy  is booming, you are bringing more revenue into the Federal Government.  The Federal debt, as a percent of our economic prowess right now, is  decreasing because we are growing the economy. What we are spending in  this bill causes more economic growth. That is a good thing.   What the other side is not talking about is that there are a lot of  free riders in our country, and they are not paying their fair share of  revenues into the Treasury. We have to talk about that side of the  budget, too. There are a lot of people who are what I call free riders.  We are paying for them. Some of the richest people in this country and  some of the biggest corporations aren't paying their fair share of the  load. You have to look at both sides of the ledger.   I wanted to put that on the floor today in order to adopt the proper  policies. It will be a most interesting discussion as we move forward  with the new debt commission that has been formed. It will be  interesting if they bring both pages in the ledger, both the revenues  and the expenditures.   As our chart shows, the Federal debt, as a percent of GDP, is going  down for the first time in modern history. We better not do anything  that stops that because it is one of the answers, as well as getting  those who are free riders to pay their fair share.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, Congress needs to write bills that meet our  country's needs, and I reiterate my disappointment that the energy and  water bill before us today does not adhere to the agreed to levels in  the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.   The American people are counting on us to work together, not draft  partisan bills that will never become law.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. I know it  took a lot of effort on the part of the chair, and we appreciate your  cooperation. The en bloc contains noncontroversial amendments from  Members of both parties, and I have no objections. I urge support of  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   Let's be clear. This amendment reduces funding for the Army Corps of  Engineers' investigations account by $715,000, with the amendment  description's stated intent of eliminating funding for the Delaware  River Basin Commission.   I will note that the actual bill language of the amendment only  reduces funding for the account. It does not in any way eliminate  funding for the Delaware River Basin Commission.   However, I vigorously oppose the stated intent behind this amendment,  especially since the Delaware River Basin, which flows into the  Delaware Bay and then into the Atlantic Ocean, covers over 13,000  square miles in four States.   As established by law through the Delaware River Basin Compact that  went into effect in 1961, the Commission consists of the Army Corps of  Engineers and the four basin State Governors. Those States include  Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York.   The Corps of Engineers in these States work as equal partners for  planning, development, and regulatory actions for the river basin.  Frankly, all across the country we are facing issues that deal with  very large watersheds and basins that in the past centuries and decades  didn't face what we face today with water flows.   While the Commission's work could be further discussed, my strongest  reason for opposition to this amendment is that the underlying bill  provides $715,000 to the Delaware River Basin Commission as community  project funding on behalf of two Members of this body. The community  project funding process allows Members of Congress to request funding  for their community to meet urgent needs that they identify. There is a  rigorous process for vetting and inclusion of community project  funding, including strict transparency and accountability rules. I am  shocked that one Member would target another Member's community  [[Page H5085]]  project funding through an amendment on the floor.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank Congressman Neguse for yielding and  compliment him on the hardworking representation of the people of  Colorado.   There could not be a more complex water system than the one that his  community is a part of, and most of America has no idea about the  plumbing of the West, so I really compliment him.   I know that funding provided in this bill will help advance or  complete projects to protect the Humpback Chub, Bonytail, Colorado  Pikeminnow, and Razorback Sucker that are feeling the impacts of  drought while allowing water development projects to proceed.   We know many reports, including one from the United Nations just a  couple years ago, talked about the extinction of natural species across  our country and world. We must combat these efforts to prevent  biodiversity loss, particularly in areas like the Colorado River, which  was diverted for the first time in American history recently. That is a  showstopper by anyone's measure.   We need to provide the resources necessary to continue this  collaborative work in the Upper Colorado and San Juan Basins.   I thank my colleague for his leadership on this. I also thank the  chair of the subcommittee for his great effort to try to accommodate as  many members as possible.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, first of all, I have great respect for the  gentleman who offers this amendment, but I do find myself in the  position of opposing it.   In step with the myriad amendments offered by Republicans to reduce  leadership salaries, this amendment seeks to reduce funding for the  Bureau of Reclamation's policy and administration account by $5  million, ostensibly to fund it at the fiscal year 2022 enacted level.  However, in fiscal year 2022, $64.4 million was appropriated for policy  and administration, so this amendment reduces this funding by $4.321  million below the fiscal year 2022 enacted level.   The Bureau of Reclamation brings water to 31 million people and is  the second largest producer of hydroelectric power in the United  States, producing enough electricity to serve 3.5 million homes. This  account funds day-to-day Bureau of Reclamation management,  administrative, and policy functions that are necessary to ensure  effective and efficient implementation of all Bureau of Reclamation  programs from which 31 million people receive water and 3.5 million  homes receive electricity. That is a big job.   This account also funds the Office of the Commissioner and regional  offices. This leadership is critical for ensuring that one in five  Western farmers has irrigation water for 10 million acres of  farmland that produce 60 percent of our Nation's vegetables and 25  percent of its fruits and nuts.  [[Page H5087]]    According to the United States Census Bureau, my colleague comes from  a district of approximately 751,000 people, of which approximately 1.5  percent are in occupations related to farming, fishing, and forestry. I  don't think the gentleman's amendment benefits his district.   With the West reeling from the historic megadrought, the worst in  1,200 years, where we have just had to divert the Colorado River for  the first time in American history, why would any of my colleagues want  to hamstring the Bureau of Reclamation's management and the direction  and guidance necessary to achieve Reclamation-wide program and mission  accomplishment? This is a moment in American history when we need to  help them.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.   I hear what he is saying, but I think that we have to work harder  together to embrace the future and not just depend on the past.   I agree with him on fossil fuels and rare earths. We visited the  fossil fuel energy center in southwest Pennsylvania. I was fascinated  by some of the work going on there. I think we need to fund it, and we  are.   This amendment reduces funding for the Department of Energy's energy  efficiency and renewable energy account by $1.2 billion, and I don't  think that that places America in the position I want her to be in,  which is number one in the world.   Now, that proposal is also on top of another $466 million reduction  in the underlying bill itself and the $1 billion reduction incorporated  by the manager's amendment.   This funding provides for clean, affordable, and secure energy and  ensures American leadership in the transition to a global clean energy  economy.   I will tell you, this past year in my region of the United States-- and it came here to Washington, ultimately--a very strange haze began  floating down from Canada into the United States due to the forest  fires up there and the changing nature of the environment. I have lived  in the same place my whole life, and I never saw anything like that  before. It ruined my rhododendron plant. All that gunk got all over it.   I was talking to a friend who came up from Florida, and he goes:  Marcy, the winds took that all the way down to near the panhandle in  Florida.   I said: Are you kidding me? It got down that far? The Earth's  ecosystem is changing, and we have to catch up to Mother Nature.    The account being targeted funds the Office of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy, the Office of State and Community Energy Programs  that supports important services like the Weatherization Assistance  Program to save energy, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply  Chains, and the Federal Energy Management Program itself.   Those programs focus on energy technology ranging from biofuels--the  first biofueled F-16 flew out of the 180th Fighter Wing in my district.  That was a great moment. That was almost 15 years ago.   Biofuels have now become such an important part of our economy, as  well as hydrogen, solar, wind, and a whole broad range of energy  technologies to make America energy independent in perpetuity-- geothermal, what we are learning on that; advanced manufacturing;  building efficiency and weatherization; and the list goes on.   Without these programs, we are jeopardizing U.S. leadership across a  range of possibilities. The world is set to invest a record $1.8  trillion in clean energy in 2023, and that is expected to climb to $4.5  trillion by the year 2030. We want to be a leader. With $4.5 trillion  per year on the line, we have the choice to embrace American leadership  and invention.   Let me just mention that if the Department of Energy's goals are  achieved, the hydrogen industry will produce $140 billion in revenue  and over 700,000 jobs by 2030.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful  amendment, but I am very happy to continue to work with the gentleman  to find ways that we can reach accommodation.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and rise in  strong opposition to this amendment.    The underlying bill already cuts the energy efficiency  and renewable energy program by $1.5 billion or 42 percent below last  year.   Now, there are a lot of people that are complaining about that, and I  would be the first one to say that our country should not cede any new  markets or capitulate to global competitors in the field of energy.   I think that we have to keep our foot on the accelerator in many  energy sectors. The gentleman is right. Texas has been a leader in so  many ways; certainly in wind energy, but not just that.   In terms of the solar industry and how do we pay down the debts that  prior Congresses and administrations racked up? We grow our economy.   By growing our economy, more revenues come in, and they are. They are  coming into the private sector. They are coming into the government.   A whole lot more people who aren't paying their fair share of taxes  should be, and that would help. The way we balance budgets is not to  kill economic growth.   One of the areas we grow in is energy. These are jobs that are good  jobs, and they create wealth for the Nation.   We have to keep up our dominance in this country. For the solar  industry, which is something I am terribly interested in, I represent  the most important domestic manufacturer of solar in our country.   Overall, the whole industry across our Nation supports 333,000 jobs  now. Mr. Chair, 20 years ago, they were in a very different position,  and 40 years ago, they almost didn't exist.   America is now creating utility scale solar, and the invention of the  American people is unstoppable. We can't give a signal that we are  going to capitulate to anybody, but we have got to develop these new  energy sectors.   The gentleman is right about the grid. The grid is worn out all over  this country. Ask anybody in Ohio about that. It has been  underinvested.   We will find a way by growing the economy, and some of the new bills  we have passed for infrastructure have allowed us to modernize the  grid.   Well, let's connect the dots. We can choose to give up American  leadership in these technologies, or we can actually put our foot on  the accelerator.   I really think that the gentleman's amendment, though he believes it  is well intentioned, does move America backward, and I cannot support  it, and therefore, I oppose it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise  in opposition to this amendment. I am sure the gentleman offering it is  well-intentioned.   I will say, in many of the energy technologies that I have observed,  unlike the real estate industry, they always say real property, you can  tangibly touch it, you can see that it is there, you can measure it.  ARPA-E really focuses on that which is not yet measurable.   If you see the movie ``Oppenheimer'' and you look back at the history  of our country and how we began to actually move into atomic energy, it  was very experimental and very dangerous. The government got involved,  and at that point in history we had to win a war. We learned a whole  lot about nuclear energy at that point, but part of it was  uncontrollable.   I was at an event yesterday with companies that are working on  unbelievable technologies, which aren't quite solved yet, but where we  can take metals like titanium and nickel and do things with them to  carry current that we never were able to do before. They are working  with research labs because it is so utterly complicated.   I would say to the gentleman, you know, sometimes private enterprise  doesn't invest because the research has to occur through a longer  period of time, and you need programs like ARPA-E who do the most  amazing work. Our fracking technologies, our drilling technologies for  natural gas, those came through not the private sector initially, they  came through the Government of the United States because there wasn't  any private sector company willing to invest.   I know in my own district, where we are known for the glass industry,  some of the research that has been necessary to thinly layer different  types of material in order to produce more efficient solar panels  actually had to be assisted with government help because there were no  angel investors in my part of the country. So the Department of Energy,  through photovoltaic research, discovered inventors who were doing  great things in America, and helped them to move their technology  forward. Now we have the greatest domestic producer of solar in the  middle part of the country--not California, not the East Coast, not the  South, but in the Great Lakes region.    What I have seen out of ARPA-E is high-level basic research that most  companies, frankly, aren't dedicated to. It is very different than the  real estate industry, it is over a longer time horizon.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment.  [[Page H5092]]         Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment  and in support of the Appalachian Regional Commission.   Let me say that the Commission itself is a partnership between the  Federal Government and 13 State governments, focusing on 423 counties  across the Appalachian region.   Residents in part of Pennsylvania--evidently the gentleman's area is  not covered--are served by this Commission. Since 1965, the Appalachian  region has been struggling, and they have made progress. They have made  significant progress.   The number of high-poverty counties in Appalachia has been cut by 60  percent since 1960. It is a long road. The regional poverty rate has  been cut by more than half. God bless them.   However, the region still lags behind the Nation and continues to  encounter challenges such as the severe substance abuse crisis, as well  as a downturn in the coal economy. This is the part of America that we  have to lift up.   I have been very impressed with the work they are doing in terms of  restoration of the natural environment and expanded tourism. They are  working together collaboratively.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment. Let's help the American people who need it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is one more controversial  poison pill policy rider that sadly shows extremist Republicans are not  interested in bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.   Now, let's have a little math. In 2012, before the Bush tax cuts, the  Congressional Budget Office showed revenues exceeding primary spending  for the next 65 years and that debt as a percentage of GDP, our gross  domestic product, everything that we make in a year, would decline  indefinitely. How about that. That was 2012.   Since then, tax cut extensions and the Trump tax cuts have added $10  trillion to the debt to date, and their cost will increase enough over  time to account for the entire long-term growth in debt ratio. The  Trump tax cuts are costing us $2 trillion per year. Just look at it. It  is unbelievable. Remember, those benefits are disproportionately  enjoyed by the most wealthy.   If we truly want to protect the American taxpayer, we should be  marking up bills at levels agreed to between the President, Speaker  McCarthy, and signed into law in the Fiscal Responsibility Act rather  than bringing the government to the verge of a shutdown and now marking  up bills that don't just break the deal but obliterate it by cutting  critical domestic investments.   I can't wait for the Debt Commission to actually get the facts out  there for the American people, because I have been listening to this  all evening. It is very much off the mark. Let's get serious about  passing bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Department of Energy is charged with  implementing congressionally directed energy efficiency standards. When  the gentleman blithely says he doesn't like unelected bureaucrats, the  people who work in these departments are trained and actually help  consumers.   Frankly, I think it is helpful for consumers to know, when they are  going to buy a blouse, let's say, whether it is cotton or rayon. It is  sort of nice to have the label on there. If you are driving a car, it  is nice to know how many miles per gallon the car is going to get. You  sort of get a sense of if you are going to buy this one or another one.  With refrigerators, I think it is really great that you see how much  energy it uses so you can buy a more efficient refrigerator, so you  have your electricity bill go down.   I don't know why the gentleman is objecting to helping the American  consumer make better choices. In accordance with the statutes that we  have passed, the Department of Energy has published regulations in the  Code of Federal Regulations--in other words, it is not by some whim-- for more than 60 categories of appliance and equipment types. That  helps consumers make good choices.   The Department of Energy drafts the energy efficiency regulations  with the full participation of equipment manufacturers and the public  at large. The process includes thorough consideration of all comments  and concerns.   In following the law, the Department of Energy has issued proposed or  final standards for 24 product categories so far this year. Again,  these actions are by congressional direction. They just don't pick them  out of the air. Actually, it is a process of law. These actions result  in direct energy savings while also improving the reliability and  performance across household appliances and commercial and industrial  equipment.   There is a quote from   Daniel Webster in this House that tells us in  our time and our generation, may we perform something worthy to be  remembered. That is a really good quote to think about.   I think it is safe to assume that virtually all Americans, let alone  all of the people in this room, have benefited from some of these types  of efficiency standards over the course of their lifetimes.   The benefits are real. As a result of the Department of Energy's  efficiency actions, cost savings for American families and businesses  are projected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. The Department of  Energy estimates that this specific rule would slash household utility  costs by $1.5 billion annually, which is something the American people  want to do, and save consumers $24.8 billion on their energy bills over  30 years. That is a big deal.   Further, if Congress does not like these standards, that should be  addressed by new laws through the Energy and Commerce Committee, not by  funding prohibitions. I would suggest to the gentleman, he might want  to go before that committee.   Stopping the Department of Energy from finalizing, implementing, or  enforcing energy efficiency standards will only create uncertainty for  manufacturers and consumers.                                time  2045    With respect to the energy efficiency standards for consumer  furnaces, if my Republican colleagues are concerned about the rule's  potential to increase costs for homeowners, then I would suggest that  they should not be seeking in this bill to rescind the Inflation  Reduction Act funding for home energy efficiency rebates, which will  help many hardworking Americans afford energy efficient heating units  that will actually save them money on their utility bills in the long  term.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
