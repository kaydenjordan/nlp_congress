 Mr. Speaker, I opposed the original version of this  resolution, not to defend Mr. Schiff's lies, but to defend the process  that exposed those lies. We must never punish speech in this House,  only acts. The only way to separate truth from falsehoods or wisdom  from folly is free and open debate. We must never impose excessive  fines that would effectively replace the constitutional two-thirds vote  for expulsion with a simple majority.   This new version removes the fine and focuses instead on specific  acts, most particularly the abuse of his position as Intelligence  Committee chairman by implying he had access to classified information  that did not exist and his placement into the Congressional Record of  the Steele dossier that he knew or should have known was false.   I hope, however, that we will hereafter return to the principles of  due process that the Democrats stripped from our precedents in the last  session.
