 Madam Speaker, today, the House of  Representatives will consider the Families First Coronavirus Response  Act, critical legislation to expand paid emergency leave for American  workers, to ensure free coronavirus testing, to bolster unemployment  insurance for furloughed workers, and to strengthen our safety net for  workers and students experiencing food insecurity due to closures.   Democrats and Republicans must continue to advance this emergency  legislation to protect the health and economic security of the American  people.   The coronavirus does not choose Republican or Democrat, and the  American people are looking to this Chamber for swift and decisive  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I thank our frontline nurses, doctors, physicians,  public health officials, and first responders for their tireless and  courageous efforts to keep Granite Staters safe. They are heroes to all  of us, and they are bringing needed comfort to those who have been  impacted by this public health crisis.                            ____________________
