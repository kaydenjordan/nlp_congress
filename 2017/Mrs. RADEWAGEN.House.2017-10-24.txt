 Mr. Speaker, I rise in care and concern for my people  in American Samoa in a time of need. I am humbled to represent them to  you now.   Over this Thanksgiving, 2,000 of our families are being put out of  work and small businesses will lose commerce as American Samoa's only  large employer closes for a period of 6 weeks.   The Department of Justice Starkist Consent Decree requires payment of  $6.3 million. Unfortunately, this money comes to Washington, D.C. The  workers and their families lose their paychecks. The small businesses  around them absorb losses. That is wrong. These funds should stay on  the island to help them through this time.   In fact, a case won by Attorney General Talauega establishes the  unique economic responsibility the U.S. has to American Samoa through  the Deed of Cession.   American Samoa has high unemployment and low incomes. I ask my  colleagues to join me in recognizing the burden our Federal Government  is placing on American Samoa this Thanksgiving.                            ____________________
