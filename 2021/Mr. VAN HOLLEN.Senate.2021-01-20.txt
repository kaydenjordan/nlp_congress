 Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of  Avril Haines to be the Director of National Intelligence. Ms. Haines is  a historic nominee and would be the first woman to lead our  intelligence community in this critical role. With a background at the  Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Council, she  understands the work of our intelligence professionals and the need to  ensure a frank and nonpartisan process to deliver the information that  underpins national security and foreign policy decisions.   Ms. Haines has applied her keen intellect to a number of pursuits,  even including running a bookstore in Baltimore and serving as a senior  fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. She  has a firm commitment to her country and to encouraging others to  serve, including as a member of the National Commission on Military,  National, and Public Service.   After a tumultuous 4 years and a President who routinely scorned the  work of our intelligence community, it is critical to restore  professional leadership who will work with the administration and  Congress, deliver honest assessments, and speak truth to power. Ms.  Haines is the right woman for the job.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon,  Thursday, January 21; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:08 p.m., adjourned until  12 noon tomorrow.                            ____________________
