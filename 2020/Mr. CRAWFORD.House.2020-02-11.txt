 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  my close friend Billie Sue Hoggard, who passed away on Sunday evening.   Billie Sue was a lifelong public servant, a political pioneer, and a  devout follower of Jesus. She was a nationally board-certified teacher.   Countless students in my hometown of Jonesboro, Arkansas, across five  decades and four schools, were blessed to find themselves in her  classroom.   She was selected for three international teaching exchanges in China,  Japan, and Mexico. Her passion for teaching could not be extinguished,  coming out of a well-deserved retirement just a few years ago to go  back into the classroom.  [[Page H1023]]    Her service to the community extended to public office as well. She  was appointed by Governor Mike Huckabee as justice of the peace on the  Craighead County Quorum Court and as the commissioner for the Arkansas  Educational Television Network.   Under her leadership of the Craighead County GOP, the county flipped  all legislative seats and well over half of countywide offices. In  2017, she was awarded the ``Hi, I'm Frank White'' Award, the highest  distinction given by the Arkansas GOP.   Billie Sue is survived by her four children and seven grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, I ask Congress to join me in offering condolences to  her family and commemorating the life and achievements of an incredible  leader and servant.   God bless Billie Sue Hoggard's memory.                            ____________________
