 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Pallone for  yielding and for his guidance and leadership on the Energy and Commerce  Committee as we advance critical legislation this week to stabilize the  Affordable Care Act and drive down prescription drug costs for all  Americans.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 987, the Strengthening  Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act. I rise hand in  hand with Granite Staters and all Americans who have been denied care  or have been charged more for care because of preexisting conditions.   Asthma, allergies, Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes--you can go right  through the alphabet--having a child, these are preexisting conditions.  And I believe people should not suffer more when they are at their most  vulnerable. Patients should not be discriminated against or treated  unfairly when they need help the most.   I am committed to reversing the Trump administration's continuous,  unrelenting sabotage of the Affordable Care Act that allows and  encourages junk health plans.   H.R. 987 invests in access to quality care while lowering  prescription drug prices. It ensures that generics can come to market  as soon as possible so that seniors are not skipping the medication  they need because they cannot afford it.   I support this legislation because it puts patients first. I thank  Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester for her leadership on this bill,  and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 987.
