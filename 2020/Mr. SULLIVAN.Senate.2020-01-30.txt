 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself, Senators Risch, Blunt, Kennedy, Johnson, and Capito  for the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Sullivan and the other Senators for counsel  for the President:         Given that the Senate is now considering the very       evidentiary record assembled and voted on by the House, which       Chairman Nadler has repeatedly claimed constitutes       overwhelming evidence for impeachment, how can the Senate be       accused of engaging in, what Mr. Nadler described as ``a       coverup,'' if the Senate makes its decision based on the       exact same evidentiary record the House did?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   I think that is exactly right. I think it is rather preposterous to  suggest that this Senate would be engaging in a coverup to rely on the  same record that the House managers have said is overwhelming.   They have said it dozens of times. They have said that, in their  view, they have had enough evidence presented already to establish  their case beyond any doubt, not just beyond a reasonable doubt. And it  is totally incoherent to claim at the same time that it would be  improper for the Senate to rely on that record.   Your judgment may be and should be, we submit, different from the  House managers' assessment of that evidence because it hasn't  established their case at all. But if they are willing to tell you that  it is complete and it has everything they need--it has everything they  need to establish everything they want--I think you should be able to  take them at their word that that is all that is there.   And to switch now to say, ``Well, no, we need more; we need more  witnesses,'' I think just demonstrates that they haven't proved their  case. They don't have the evidence to make their case.   As I went through a minute ago, they have already presented a record  with over 28,000 pages of documents that is here. They have already  presented video clips of 13 witnesses. You have heard all of the key  evidence that they gathered. It was their process. They were the ones  who said what the process was going to be, how it had to be run, who  ought to testify, when to close it, when to decide they had enough, and  you heard all the key highlights from that, and that is sufficient for  this body to make a decision.   In the time I have remaining, I just want to turn to one point in  response to something that was said a couple of minutes ago. We keep  hearing repeatedly today the refrain of the idea that President Trump  was somehow trying to peddle Vladimir Putin's conspiracy theory that it  was Ukraine and not Russia that interfered in the 2016 election. And  the House Democrats tried to present this binary view of the world that  only one country, and one country alone, could have done something to  interfere in the election, and it was Russia. And if you mention any  other country doing something related to election interference, you are  just a pawn of Vladimir Putin, trying to peddle his conspiracy  theories.   That is obviously not true. More than one country and foreign  nationals from more than one country could be doing different things  for different reasons in different ways to try to interfere in the  election, and that is exactly what President Trump was interested in.   In the telephone call, the July 25 transcript, he mentions  CrowdStrike. He mentions the server. But he talks about--he says:         There are a lot of things that went on, the whole       situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of       the same people.    So he is talking about much more than just the DNC server. And he  closes it again, saying--he refers to Robert Mueller's testimony, and  he says: ``They say a lot of it started in Ukraine.'' There are just a  lot of stuff going on. Twice in that exchange he says there is a lot of  stuff--the whole situation.   And what is that referring to, surrounding yourself with the same  people? President Zelensky refers immediately to changing out the  Ambassador because the previous Ambassador, who had been there under  Poroshenko, had written an op-ed criticizing President Trump during the  election.   We also know that there was a POLITICO article in January 2017  cataloging multiple Ukrainian officials who did things either to  criticize President Trump or to assist a DNC operative, Alexandra  Chalupa, in gathering information against the Trump campaign.   And they said: There was no evidence in the record; no one said that  there was anything done by Ukraine.   That is not true. One of their star witnesses, Fiona Hill,  specifically testified in her public hearing, because she said she went  back and checked because she hadn't recalled the POLITICO article. And  then she said that she acknowledged that some Ukrainian officials ``bet  on Hillary Clinton winning the election.'' And so it was quite evident,  in her words, that they were trying to favor the Clinton campaign,  including trying to collect information on people working in the Trump  campaign. That was Fiona Hill. She acknowledged the Ukrainian officials  were doing that.   So this idea that it is a binary world--it is either Russia or  Ukraine; if you mention Ukraine, you are just doing Vladimir Putin's  bidding--is totally false, and you shouldn't be fooled by that.   Ukrainians--various Ukrainians--were doing things to interfere in the  election campaign, and that is what President Trump was referring to.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Vermont.
