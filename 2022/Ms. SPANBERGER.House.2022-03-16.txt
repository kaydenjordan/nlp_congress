 Madam Speaker, I stand here to recognize the  incredible achievement of Midlothian resident Keira D'Amato.   Earlier this year, Keira broke the American record for the women's  marathon, winning the Chevron Houston Marathon with a 2-hour, 19- minute, and 12-second finish. For those of you keeping score, that is  24 seconds faster than the previous record set back in 2006.   This new record demonstrates Keira's remarkable resiliency, it shows  her undeniable passion, and it highlights her proven ability to  overcome injuries and adversity.   As a mother of two, Keira is not just a winner, she is an ambassador  for her  [[Page H3763]]  sport. Her enthusiasm is already inspiring the next generation of  Virginia marathon runners.   Today, on behalf of Virginia's Seventh District, I want to  congratulate Keira for making Chesterfield County, central Virginia,  and our entire Commonwealth proud. We are honored to be the home of a  true American champion.                            ____________________
