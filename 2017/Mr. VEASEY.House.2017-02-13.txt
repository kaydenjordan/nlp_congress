 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 60th birthday  of my good friend, overseer Elvis L. Bowman, the senior pastor of the  Greater Mt. Tabor Christian Center in my hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.   Pastor Bowman was born February 23, 1957, and became a lifelong  member of Greater Mt. Tabor Christian Center and their congregation;  and the church was founded by his father, E.L. Bowman.   Pastor Bowman graduated from the University of Texas in Arlington  with a bachelor's degree in business and a minor in music. He has since  used his education to serve the congregation in so many wonderful ways.   An accomplished musician, Pastor Bowman served as a staff musician  under his father before being appointed minister of music in 1974. He  then served as the Church business manager before he was appointed  pastor in 2002. He was later elevated to full gospel district overseer  of Tarrant County in 2008.   Pastor Bowman, I wish you happy birthday, my friend, on your 60th  birthday. I wish you nothing but health and happiness. Please enjoy  your special day.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, W. E. B. Du Bois is quoted as saying: ``The  cost of liberty is the less than the price of repression.'' And the  cost of liberty has come at a steep price for members of the Black  community. But despite this immense challenge the Black community has  faced, our resiliency is what we celebrate every month during Black  History Month.   Every February, we get together to talk about it, highlight it, and  share with school children, friends, and family the accomplishments of  the men and women who changed the course of American history. We thank  these pioneers for expanding what we believed possible and use them as  an inspiration for the fight that remains.   There have been so many African-American pioneers in every field,  including medicine. Dr. James McCune Smith was the first African  American to earn a medical degree and practice medicine in the U.S.;  Dr. Daniel Hale Williams owned the first Black-owned hospital and is  credited with the first successful heart surgery performed by an  African American; Dr. Charles Drew--many have heard of him--renowned  for his research during World War II which allowed for us to better  understand blood plasma and its storage for transfusions. More  recently, Dr. Regina Benjamin became the first Black woman elected to  the American Medical Association Board of Trustees and was appointed  the 18th surgeon general by President Barack Obama in 2009.   Each of these medical pioneers broke barriers for the betterment of  the community, and each worked to use tools of their profession to  improve the health of each patient they treat and also for future  generations.   The Secretary of Health and Human Services shared similar  responsibilities, but on a much, much wider scale, Mr. Speaker. The  agency, as you know, of HHS is tasked with enhancing and protecting the  health of all American citizens. However, the recent appointment of Dr.  Tom Price as HHS Secretary threatens to roll back the progress  pioneered by Black medical professions and the progress made under  President Barack Obama.   Dr. Price, as many of you know and as has been documented and seen on  television on the cable news shows, was very hostile, extremely  hostile, and openly hostile to the Affordable Care Act during the time  that he was in Congress, despite the law ultimately extending health  insurance for close to 20 million Americans who didn't have it before.  That is what is so amazing that a doctor would take that view.   Because of the ACA, 2.3 million African Americans between the ages of  18 and 64 gained coverage, and the uninsured rate, among African  Americans, fell by nearly 7 percent. In the district that I represent,  47,000 more residents now have coverage thanks to the ACA. And for the  district that I represent, that is pretty significant.   People hear a lot about the Texas miracle and about all the jobs and  the economic growth in the State of Texas. Despite living in Dallas- Fort Worth--one of the most vibrant economies in the entire world,  quite frankly--it had the highest uninsured rate out of any  congressional district in the country. It is a shame that, with that  type of prosperity, we would have such a large group of people--over 1  million people collectively when you include people outside of the  district that I represent--in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex who don't  have insurance. It is really a shame. We cannot let the progress forged  by African-American trailblazers be undermined by a Secretary of Health  and Human Services who does not see how expanding healthcare access can  help better health outcomes for African Americans.   Similarly, in an area of history where we saw historic tenures of  both  [[Page H1118]]  Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch as Attorneys General, the recent  confirmation of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General is very troubling and  really a blatant reminder that we must remain vigilant for those who  would like to turn back the clock on the civil rights progress that  African Americans fought and died for, particularly when you start  talking about voter fraud.   It seems like right now what we are starting to see is the very  beginning of people who are against the gains that have been made. They  are trying to lay the groundwork so they can go in and do some really,  really serious oppression. And that is absolutely scary just because  that was a chapter in our country's history that we don't want to go  back to.   We want to know that the new Attorney General is going to be working  for us and not trying to undermine us when it comes to people being  able to exercise their suffrage. And in the Senate Chamber, a very  esteemed colleague in Congress, Senator Warren, brought much attention  to a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote opposing Senator Session's  consideration for a Federal judgeship.   This Chamber has yet to hear Mrs. King's words in a letter that she  used to highlight the brutal harm Sessions could wreak on voting  rights. And if you look at her letter, it simply states: ``Free  exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to American democracy that  we cannot tolerate any form of infringement of those rights. Of all the  groups who have been disenfranchised in our nation's history, none has  struggled longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than  black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box denied so  persistently and intently.''   And Mrs. King continued: ``The actions taken by Mr. Sessions in  regards to the 1984 voting fraud prosecutions represent just one more  technique used to intimidate black voters and thus deny them this most  precious franchise. The investigations into the absentee voting process  were conducted only in the black belt counties where blacks had finally  achieved political power in local government. Whites had been using the  absentee process to their advantage for years, without incident. Then,  when blacks, realizing its strength, began to use it with success,  criminal investigations were begun.''    Mrs. King went on to state: ``In fact, Mr. Sessions sought to punish  older black civil rights activists, advisers and colleagues of my  husband, who had been key figures in the civil rights movement in the  1960's. These were persons who, realizing the potential of the absentee  vote among blacks, had learned to use the process within the bounds of  legality and had taught others to do the same.''   And that is what I am talking about, Mr. Speaker, is that sort of  attitude, that sort of hostility towards the African-American community  when it comes to the right of suffrage, the right to vote that we hold  so precious--that all of us are worried about.   But Mrs. King went on to describe why she believes Jeff Sessions  would do irreparable harm to her husband's civil rights legacy. ``The  exercise of the franchise,'' she states, ``is an essential means by  which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will be  responsible. My husband called it the number one civil right. The  denial of access to the ballot box ultimately results in the denial of  other fundamental rights. For, it is only when the poor and  disadvantaged are empowered that they are able to participate actively  in the solutions to their own problems.   ``We still have a long way to go before we can say that minorities no  longer need be concerned about discrimination at the polls. Blacks,  Hispanics, Native Americans and Asian Americans are grossly  underrepresented at every level of government in America. If we are  going to make our timeless dream of justice through democracy a  reality, we must take every step possible to ensure that the spirit and  intent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 15th Amendment to the  Constitution is honored.''   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to a Member of this body that is  no stranger when it comes to civil rights, knew Mrs. King, knew many of  the key players and figures, and was a key player and figure himself,  and that is the gentleman from South Carolina. I would like to  recognize our assistant leader, Jim Clyburn, to come and talk on this  topic of Black History Month and some of the things that are so  important to our community this month and why we are going to continue  to talk about these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our assistant leader for his  comments. He has such a plethora of information when it comes to the  civil rights movement. He knew Reverend Abernathy and a lot of figures  that aren't as well known, like A. G. Gaston and James Farmer from my  family's hometown in Marshall, Texas. He is able to bring all of that  in today and tie it into the relevance of what we are working on here  in Congress.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a friend  here on the House floor from Houston. She is a fellow Texan that also  knows about Black history just because so much of great Black history  in our country has been made in Harris County, in Houston, Texas. I  thank her for participating on this very important Special Order hour.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  sharing that great information and talking about some of the highlights  that Black Americans have made toward our story when it comes to  African American History Month this February.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, Stacy  Plaskett, who is here tonight to also talk about contributions from the  part of the world that she represents. I thank her for her efforts here  tonight and for being part of this Special Order hour.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to another distinguished member  of the New York delegation, my colleague, the great Hakeem Jeffries,  who has led this Special Order before and who I look to for guidance on  how to continue the great work that he and Joyce Beatty did previously.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) for offering that to me.   There were several things that I heard that were deeply inspiring,  yet deeply troubling at the same time. It is amazing how when you start  talking about Black history, and you get ready to apply it to present  day, you understand just how important it is that we do bridge those  two things--the history, the future, and where we are at today.   If you look at education, for instance, I know that Brenda Lawrence  talked about the school desert phenomena and how there are some  neighborhoods where there are no neighborhood schools. That is really  sad. Because when you think about Brown v. Board of Education and some  of the things that were brought out about people having to travel great  distances just to be able to get an education, and now you start  looking at today in modern-day America and there still are no  neighborhood schools, there is still segregation in schools, and then  you see a Secretary of Education who wants to try to implement plans  that many say would resegregate the schools, would eliminate  neighborhood schools, that is what brought us here. The neighborhood  school is what brought us here. That is what allowed us to have so many  great inventions when you start talking about the inventions in Black  History Month, when you learn about medicine, when you start talking  about science, almost all of those people mentioned, even during that  time of some of the most awful segregation in our country.  [[Page H1123]]    And I think about that in my own family. I have a high school  invitation from the 1930s in a little town called Henderson in Rusk  County. I think Louie Gohmert is the representative there. When you  open up the high school invitation--it is from my grandmother's first  cousin--and it says Henderson Negro High School, and the graduation  will be held at the Henderson Negro High School auditorium.   I like to bring that up because when people start asking: Well, why  is there Black History Month--    So we don't forget. But before there was a Black History  Month, people started putting those things--Black, Negro, colored,  whatever it may happen to be for that time period--in front of schools.  They didn't put White in front of there. There was no Henderson White  High School. It was the Negro High School.                                time  2030    I think the important thing in our trying to bridge all of that is we  want to make sure that we don't go back. We don't want to take steps  backwards when it comes particularly to education because all of those  people, whether they went to the Henderson Negro High School, whether  it be blood transfusions--whatever it may happen to be--they got there  because of the investment that we made in this country in our public  education system. The fact that someone in a position of importance  would want to roll back those opportunities is absolutely scary.   It is the same with health care, when you start talking about health  care and so many people who don't have adequate health care. It is when  we see the racial discrepancies and the life expectancy amongst African  Americans. An African-American man, in particular, has the lowest life  expectancy.   And you want to remove people--20 million Americans--from having life  insurance?    It is absolutely scary.   I thank the gentlewoman for participating in this very timely  conversation. We needed to have this conversation with the country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
