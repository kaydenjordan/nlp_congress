 Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.   I am pleased to join my long-time friend and colleague from Florida,  Congressman Bill Posey, in supporting amendment No. 11, which we  coauthored.   Our amendment equally increases and decreases NASA's exploration  account by $1,969 to highlight the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11  mission which occurred on July 20, 1969.   This amendment is part of a year-long, bipartisan effort we have  undertaken to commemorate the 50th anniversary and to honor the  incredible women and men who contributed to the mission's success and  empowered the next generation of astronauts and aerospace engineers.   In the 114th Congress, we introduced and secured passage of the  Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act which was signed into  law by President Obama. Proceeds from the sale of the coin will support  aerospace education and scholarships. When one thinks of the most awe- inspiring events of the 20th century, Neil Armstrong taking the  historic first steps on the Moon and declaring: ``That's one small step  for man, one giant leap for mankind,'' certainly comes to mind.   I want to especially acknowledge the work of Miss Katherine Johnson,  a pioneering African American mathematician whose calculations ensured  that the Apollo crew landed on the Moon and returned home safely.   American space exploration continues to inspire our next generation  of pioneers and innovators, through an ambitious array of missions and  destinations and support thousands of jobs in my home State of Florida  and throughout our Nation.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan  amendment and thank Congressman Posey for his leadership on space  issues.
