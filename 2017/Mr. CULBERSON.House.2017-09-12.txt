Page 286, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $500,000)''.

Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Culberson) and the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Serrano) each will control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                time  1415     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Chairman, I wish to address the gentlewoman's  comments, very briefly.   I want to thank the gentlewoman for bringing this matter to the  House's attention. Harmful algal blooms are an important issue,  especially to the State of Florida. We know how dangerous they are and  the terrible effect they have had on our friends in Florida, who are  already suffering the effects of this hurricane. Our prayers and  thoughts are with them. All of us in Houston understand the severity of  the problem they face, and we are praying for them and look forward to  helping them in any way we can.   I will certainly continue to work with the gentlewoman on this issue  that she brings to the House's attention.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Reichert).    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc  amendment. It is made up of noncontroversial items that we have worked  out with the minority, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Lipinski. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my two amendments  included in the en bloc package being considered for Division C of H.R.  3354 I want to thank Chairman Culberson and Ranking Member Serrano for  their leadership on this division, and for including these amendments  in the en bloc package. These bipartisan amendments, cosponsored by me  and my friend Mr. LoBiondo of New Jersey, protect critical functions at  the National Weather Service. The Weather Service is essential to so  much of what we do. From its critical functions like helping us  predict, prepare for, and ride out extreme weather events to its  everyday functions like telling us whether or not to carry an umbrella,  life without up-to-date weather information is hard to imagine.   My first amendment (No. 89) directs the National Weather Service not  to cut $1.2 million from the Climate Prediction Center. one of its  National Centers for Environmental Protection The Service is further  directed not to consolidate the functions of the Climate Prediction  Center into the Weather Prediction Center. Keeping these two centers  separate recognizes the essential and very different services each one  provides. The medium- and long-term predictions offered by the Climate  Prediction Center are used for planning by diverse industries including  transportation, agriculture, energy, and public health. Its global  datasets are used by the Department of Defense and the U.S. Agency for  International Development to understand international phenomena like  flood and drought that could impact food supplies and regional  stability.   My second amendment (No. 88) directs the National Weather Service not  to cut $10.1 million from its budget for Information Technology  Officers, and to maintain an on-site IT Officer at each Weather  Forecast Office. These officers do software maintenance, technical  systems upgrades, and develop software and data products to meet local  office needs. According to the Weather Service's assessment of its  performance during Hurricane Matthew (2016), ``[Weather Forecast  Offices] were unanimous in their support of having a local [IT Officer]  present to address issues before, during, and after hurricane season.''  In addition, a significant number of IT Officers are also trained,  experienced meteorologists who can augment the forecasting staff during  extreme weather.   I think all of my colleagues can agree that supporting the National  Weather Service is more important now than ever and I urge support for  these amendments and for the en bloc package.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman  Frelinghuysen, I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Reichert), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Reichert), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Reichert), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Washington for  his service to the people of Seattle, the people in his State, his  service here, and for his devotion to this program.   I absolutely recognize the importance of the COPS Hiring Program and  what an important impact it has had on the safety of local communities.  We are especially grateful to our first responders in southeast Texas,  southwest Louisiana, and the people of Florida. I don't know what we  would do without our first responders. Our police officers and firemen  have done a magnificent job in the wake of these terrible storms that  we have had.   Given the staffing shortages and the current issues facing our law  enforcement, the COPS program is especially important. As you know, the  Senate has funded the COPS program in its bill, and I look forward to  working with the gentleman to make sure the COPS program is funded in  conference.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 83  printed in House Report 115-297.   It is now in order to consider amendment No. 85 printed in House  Report 115-297.                   Amendment No. 87 Offered by Mrs. Torres    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 87  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I have no particular objection to the  amendment other than I am concerned about the offset. We need to make  sure the Department of Justice has all the resources they need in order  to protect this country. I am concerned about taking it out of General  Administration. However, I am prepared to let the amendment go.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, we have, as you know, an extremely  difficult budget year. Our constituent's hard-earned tax dollars are  being stretched farther and thinner than ever, particularly in light of  the disasters that struck Texas and southwest Louisiana and now  Florida.   We have, in our Commerce, Justice, Science bill, protected America's  investment and basic research through the National Science Foundation  and its main grant account, the Research and Related Activities  account.   We have funded the Research and Related Activities account at $672  million this year. We recognize that America's leadership in the world  is grounded, in large part, on the innovations and discoveries that are  made by unrestrained scientific research.   I am a very strong supporter of the National Science Foundation's  scientific research. And while we would like to see higher levels of  funding for the National Science Foundation for NASA and for other  science-related research in this bill, until the Congress comes to an  overall budget agreement, Mr. Chairman, we simply do not have  additional funds, and we must live within our means.   The proposed offset that is offered by this amendment would seriously  hinder program and financial oversight over the Department of Commerce  and could result in professionals being let go.   Further, with respect to the gentlewoman's statement, I believe it is  important that we defer to the National Science Foundation to  distribute any additional funds according to the highest priority needs  identified by the scientific community and not designate them for a  specific directorate.                                time  1445    Should the gentlewoman's amendment pass, the funds will be added to  the research and related activities account, in general. It will then  be up to NSF to determine how those additional funds are spent  according to the needs of the scientific community, that the offset is  very damaging to the Department of Commerce and the important work they  do, in fact, the constitutionally mandated work that they do, to  provide for the decennial census of the United States.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).   The amendment was rejected.                    Amendment No. 101 Offered by Mr. Cohen    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 101  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), my good friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman withdrawing  the amendment. I want to express my support for the work the Legal  Services Corporation does.   When we reach a budget agreement throughout the Congress for Legal  Services, we will work with you in conference to help make sure they  have the funds that they need to do their vital work to defend abused  women, veterans, and members of the military who need assistance. They  do important work. As soon as we find some extra room, I will work with  you in conference to find them some extra support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment, remembering that, first and foremost, the appropriations  annual operating budget of the United States represents only 30 cents  out of every dollar spent by the Federal Government.  [[Page H7260]]    I am keenly aware of how precious and hard-earned and scarce every  dollar earned by our constituents is. We need to focus on the 70  percent: the automatic pilot programs, the looming insolvency of Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That is how we can really get our  budget balanced.   We have done our part on the Appropriations Committee to bring down  annual spending every year, and the ATF, in particular, plays an  important role in protecting America's Second Amendment rights. You  must remember that the ATF is now under the direction of Attorney  General Jeff Sessions, who shares with us a passion for protecting  Americans' Second Amendment rights.   This amendment would cause serious damage to ATF's ability to end the  backlogs. The ATF would not be able to speed up the processing of the  National Firearms Act applications. The ATF would not be able to beef  up the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, which is so  vital to help police officers identify the source of the bullet used in  a crime.   This amendment would injure an agency that is doing good work today  under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff Sessions to protect our  Second Amendment rights. Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Serrano), my colleague, the ranking member on the  Commerce-Justice-Science Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment.   ATF is doing a good job of protecting our Second Amendment rights,  and this amendment would injure them severely.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would cut the Bureau of  Prisons' operations by $10 million. This is a serious cut. The Bureau  of Prisons performs an essential function in keeping our streets safe  and protecting the people of America.   We have already funded the youth mentoring programs in our bill today  at $75 million. It is 25 percent above the request, because of the  value of these programs.   I certainly agree with the gentleman that these programs are  successful, they are effective, but the Department of Justice is not  even finished awarding the grants from fiscal year 2017, and this  program is very healthy.   This program would also, Mr. Chairman, eliminate a longstanding  authority the Bureau of Prisons has had for  [[Page H7262]]  contract flexibility that enables the Bureau of Prisons to manage its  contracts in a way that benefits both the agency and the taxpayer. This  includes contracts for halfway houses, reentry facilities, and juvenile  detention.   This burden would strap the Bureau of Prisons, putting pressure on  them and putting inmates in more danger, putting officers and staff in  greater danger. If we want prisoners to get healthcare and  rehabilitation, Mr. Chairman, and prisoners and staff to be safe, we  have to adequately fund the Bureau of Prisons.   Mr. Chair, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I  have no objection to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chair, I share my colleagues' support for law  enforcement and have no objection to this amendment; and I will work  with the gentlemen to ensure that the COPS program is funded when we  get to conference, we have a budget agreement across the Congress, and  additional funds are made available. The COPS program is an essential  one that will be at the top of the list.   My support for law enforcement is reflected in the $100 million  increase seen in the Byrne JAG Program, which is a  [[Page H7264]]  very flexible grant program for local law enforcement to use for a  variety of reasons, including hiring police officers, including  forensic work, lab work, and eliminating the backlog of rape kits,  which is so important to getting dangerous criminals off the streets.   The Byrne JAG Grant Program is one that is increasingly popular and  successful among the men and women of law enforcement, and that is why  we have increased it by $100 million in this year's Commerce, Justice,  Science bill to keep the men and women of America safe, to support our  law enforcement officers of whom we could not be prouder.   We are immensely grateful for the work of our first responders and  law enforcement. The people of Houston, the people of southwest  Louisiana, the people of Florida have all relied on them in this time  of crisis with these terrible floods in Houston, the hurricane in  Florida. I don't know what we would do without our first responders and  men and women in uniform in the law enforcement community protecting us  every day.   Mr. Chair, I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).   The amendment was agreed to.               Amendment No. 112 Offered by Mr. Smith of Texas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 112  printed in House Report 115-297.    Chairman Smith, I support your amendment to increase  the physical and biological sciences and will fight for it in  conference.    Chairman Smith, I support your amendment to increase  the physical and biological sciences and will fight for it in  conference.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I can. It is fully consistent with the  authorization.    Mr. Chairman, I join the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Harris) in opposing this amendment because the EEOC, under the previous  administration, has created this monstrosity of a burden on small  businesses, and they did such a poor job of it that the Office of  Management and Budget actually put the requirement under review and  suspended it.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment. I join the gentleman in  seeking to protect small businesses from this unnecessary and  burdensome requirement. EEOC already has a huge backlog of cases  involving actual complaints of discrimination that need to be resolved,  people who need to be protected, and EEOC should focus on doing their  job, clearing up the backlog, protecting people from discrimination  where they actually already have a real complaint, not looking for  needles in haystacks.    Mr. Chair, I urge Members to join us in opposing this amendment, and  I recommend a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment. I understand his concern. I appreciate him bringing it to  our attention. I understand similar language has already passed the  House. I have no objection to him, and I urge Members to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is entirely appropriate to  make inmates help pay for some of the cost of their time in a halfway  house. This program helps make inmate reentry into the community as  seamless as possible. It has been a successful one. We want to reduce  obstacles to make that transition without unnecessary burdens. However,  this proposal would cut the Bureau of Prisons' operations by about $20  million. It would be forced to be absorbed by the Bureau of Prisons,  that money that they are now receiving in reimbursement from  transitioning inmates.   The Bureau of Prisons' resources are already stretched very thin, Mr.  Chairman, and this money would come out of other programs such as  reentry services, antirecidivism, counseling, and inmate health and  safety that are needed for inmate welfare and a successful transition  into society.   While I appreciate the intent of the gentlewoman's amendment, if the  Bureau of Prisons were to have a cut of $30 million, then prison safety  and prison services would be severely compromised, and that won't help  inmates or officers.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to join me in opposing this amendment. I  urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this  amendment. Within 2 months of my becoming chairman of the subcommittee,  the ATF did, indeed, attempt to ban this commonly used ammunition. Mr.  Latta is exactly right.   I met, at the time, with the Director of the ATF. I am grateful that  the ATF withdrew the proposed ban. The Director of the ATF, Tom  Brandon, is doing a good job of protecting America's Second Amendment  rights. I want to ensure Mr. Latta that I will continue to work to make  sure that this rule is not put back into place.   As long as I am chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, I will always zealously protect the  unambiguous Second Amendment rights of every American to keep and bear  arms.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the gentleman's amendment and I urge  its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Griffith). The gentleman from Texas is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I understand my colleague is offering  this on behalf of another Member who could not be here today, but I  rise in strong opposition to this amendment.   Let me make sure that we read it so the people understand what we are  talking about. None of the funds made available by this act may be used  for the operation of a correctional facility by a private party or  contractor, period.   This would shut down every privately operated prison and halfway  house in the United States. Where are those 34,000 criminals going to  go? Well, you would have to just turn them loose on the streets or pack  them in like sardines in existing prison cells or spend billions of  dollars over the next few years to house them.   This amendment is dangerous, irresponsible, and risks the safety of  the public. By cutting off immediately all funding to private prisons,  these 34,000 inmates would have to be released onto the streets of  America. I can't imagine what kind of disaster that would result in.   Furthermore, I have always believed in the Yellow Pages test. If you  can find a government service in the Yellow Pages, you ought to try to  privatize it. As a general rule, the private sector is going to find a  way to do it more efficiently, less expensively, and in a way that is  going to save taxpayer money.   My experience with the private prisons that have operated in the  State of Texas quite successfully throughout the Bureau of Prisons is  that they are providing better security, better food, better  healthcare, better transportation, better housing, better facilities  for both the inmate and the staff. They have been very successful  across the country. These 34,000 inmates will have nowhere else to go.   This amendment is extremely dangerous, destructive, and  irresponsible. I urge Members to join me in opposing this amendment not  only for the risk to public safety, but for the damages it will do to  the hardworking people of America.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to join me in voting ``no,'' and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to join me in opposing  this amendment to protect the public safety of the people of the United  States, to ensure that our tax dollars are efficiently used, but, above  all, to make sure these 34,000 inmates are not released onto the  streets of America.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano).   The amendment was rejected.                   Amendment No. 124 Offered by Mr. Flores    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 124  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have no objection to the gentleman's  amendment, and I support it. We have had it in previous bills. I hope  the House will adopt it in this bill as well.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will  be postponed.                    Amendment No. 125 Offered by Mr. Buck    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 125  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the  gentleman from Colorado's amendment.   When Kate Steinle was murdered, I was the new chairman of this  subcommittee, and I swore that I would find a way to cut off Federal  funding to these sanctuary cities. That young lady's murder could have  been prevented had the city of San Francisco simply cooperated with  Federal immigration authorities and handed that criminal over to be  deported immediately. That is all we are talking about here.    With the previous administration, Attorney General Lynch, I met with  her as the CFO, so to speak, of the DOJ. I used the power of the purse  that the Congress was entrusted with by the Founders of our  constituents to persuade the previous Attorney General to adopt  precisely the policy that Mr. Buck is attempting to make sure that we  continue to follow.   I know, under Attorney General Sessions' leadership, sanctuary cities  are not going to receive Federal money. That policy was first put in  place last summer. At my insistence, current guidelines in the  Department of Justice grant policies are that a local law enforcement  agency has to certify that they are cooperating 100 percent of the time  with Federal immigration authorities about individuals in local jails  or State prisons. That is all this is.   If a State prison or local jail is housing someone who was in the  country illegally when they committed the crime and were sentenced,  before they are released, current Department of Justice policy adopted  last summer, being enforced today by Attorney General Sessions, says  you have to tell Federal authorities you are about to release this  person so they can be immediately deported. That is common sense. It  protects public safety, and it is a wise use of our tax dollars.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, the days of sanctuary cities accepting  Federal money and ignoring Federal law are over. The policy under this  administration, the policy I insisted be adopted last summer, is, if  you want Federal money, follow Federal law, or don't ask.   I support the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the amendment. I will  work with Mr. Roskam as the CFO of the DOJ and do whatever is necessary  to help make sure they review these cases rapidly and return people's  money to their rightful owners.   Once again, Mr. Roskam has brought a great amendment to the House  floor. I look forward to working with him to ensure that his intent is  implemented as quickly as possible.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
