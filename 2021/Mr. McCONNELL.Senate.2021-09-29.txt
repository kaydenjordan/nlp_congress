 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the American people continue to hear  about a steady stream of really bad ideas that Washington Democrats are  packing into their next reckless taxing-and-spending spree.   There is one clear thread that sort of ties it all together--pain for  American families and profit for our adversaries, hurting families and  helping China. It is a perfect policy storm that would stick working  Americans with higher prices, higher taxes, fewer jobs, and less  freedom, while also putting America at a global disadvantage.   That is true about the radical environmental policies, as I explained  yesterday. It is true about the Big Government healthcare provisions  that would leave us with fewer new drugs and fewer cures. It was true  about the Democrats' efforts to stuff a big amnesty for illegal  immigrants into the bill. And it is especially true about the tidal  wave of huge tax hikes and IRS snooping that Democrats are putting  together behind closed doors: taxes on small businesses, taxes on  family farms, double taxes on the ones who pass the reins to the next  generation, new taxes that would make America one of the least  hospitable places in the world to invest, grow a business, or create  jobs.   Nonpartisan analysis has confirmed there would be new taxes for big  chunks--big chunks--of the 98 percent of Americans who make less than  $400,000 a year, shattering President Biden's pledge to leave their  wallets alone.   And then there is the bizarre, unpopular new plan to give the IRS big  new power to snoop into all of America's personal financial  transactions in excess of a few hundred dollars.   Currently, the government has special authorities to demand  information on citizens' transactions in excess of $10,000. In theory,  this is a targeted tool for sniffing out things like money laundering,  terrorism, or massive tax fraud.   Now, the Democrats want to create a new reporting requirement, not  for $10,000 transactions but for anything over a few hundred bucks. If  American families are sending or receiving $600 from their checking  accounts, Democrats want the IRS to snoop through it--a massive new  dragnet that would sweep up all kinds of ordinary transactions that  normal, law-abiding Americans make all the time. In effect, Democrats  want to let the IRS systematically snoop through normal families'  checking accounts as though they were all potential financial criminals  until proven otherwise.   And then there was the latest fascinating statement from the authors  of this awful plan. President Biden recently tried to suggest that,  because they want to pair their reckless spending with their biggest  tax hike in half a century, that somehow makes the entire package free.  The President says it is free? Democrats want to jack up Americans' tax  rates, drain money from people's pockets, spend it on socialism, and  then say the whole thing nets out to zero dollars?   This might be the best encapsulation of Washington-Democrat thinking  I have ever heard. They want to print and borrow trillions of dollars  and then set it on fire. But as long as they send your taxes  skyrocketing at the same time, it is all a wash. Heads, they win.  Tails, you lose. Heads, Democrats waste your money. Tails, they hike  your taxes.   This silly magical thinking rightly earned our President multiple-- multiple--Pinocchios from fact-checkers. And Democrats' reckless  taxing-and-spending spree will earn it zero votes from Senate  Republicans.  [[Page S6751]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, now on a completely different matter,  yesterday, under oath, General McKenzie and General Milley both  confirmed they also agreed with the commander on the ground. They  agreed we should keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. These top generals  gave President Biden exactly the advice the President told the American  people he had not received.   To be very clear, the Commander in Chief gets to make the final  decision, no matter what the advisers suggest. But he needs to own his  decision.   The President publicly misstating what advice he got from his top  generals is corrosive to the civil-military dynamic that keeps America  safe.   The military did their job. They gave their best military advice. It  was rejected. So they saluted and executed the order of the Commander  in Chief. That is the way it is supposed to work. But having rejected  their advice, the President doesn't get to claim he never received it,  nor does he get to claim, as he has since tried to pretend, that the  only alternative to his botched retreat was sending 10,000 soldiers  back to Afghanistan.   That is a false choice. We have heard directly from the two senior  military officers in the chain of command, as well as the President's  principal military adviser, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.   Everyone with an ounce of common sense knows President Biden's  botched retreat was not the extraordinary success the President  claimed. As General Milley acknowledged, it is more accurate to  describe the withdrawal as a strategic failure.   We have now heard confirmation from our top military officers that  the terrorist threat in Afghanistan is already growing. And relying on  over-the-horizon counterterrorism leaves us with much less ability to  do anything at all about it.   What a debacle. We face a greater terrorist threat from Afghanistan  than we did before we withdrew, we have less intelligence about that  growing threat, and we have fewer tools with which to combat it. This  administration gave our enemies in Afghanistan everything they wanted  and got less than nothing in return.   So, Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues want to unilaterally  declare an end to the War on Terrorism. Ah, if only it were that easy.  But the terrorists aren't through with us.   I hope my Democratic colleagues will think twice before they compound  the failures in Afghanistan by trying to narrow or repeal the 2001  authorization for the use of military force. I, for one, will  strenuously oppose any further efforts by the Democratic administration  or this Democratic Congress to take away any more tools or authorities  that our military servicemembers and intelligence professionals need to  keep our country safe from our enemies.   At some point we will have a different administration that will  better understand how to protect America for the long term. At this  rate, they will need all the tools they can possibly get.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
