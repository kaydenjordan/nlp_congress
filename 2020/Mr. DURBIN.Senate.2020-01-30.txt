 Mr. Chief Justice, now I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Durbin to the House  managers:         Would you please respond to the answer that was given by       President's counsel to Senator Sinema's question?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, Mr. Chief Justice, in answer to that  question, we heard a rather breathtaking admission by the President's  lawyer, and it was said in an understated way, so you might have missed  it. But what the President's counsel said was that no foreign policy  was being conducted by a private party here; that is, Rudy Giuliani was  not conducting U.S. foreign policy. Rudy Giuliani was not conducting  policy.   That is a remarkable admission because, to the degree that they have  attempted to suggest or claim or insinuate that this is a policy  difference, that a concern over burden-sharing or some big corruption  was a policy issue, they have now acknowledged that the person in  charge of this was not conducting policy. That is a startling  admission.    So the investigations that Giuliani was charged with trying to get  Ukraine to announce into Joe Biden, into this Russia propaganda theory,  they have just admitted were not part of policy. They were not policy  conducted by Mr. Giuliani.   So what were they? They were, in the words of Dr. Hill, ``a domestic  political errand,'' not to be confused with policy. They have just  undermined their entire argument--even as to mixed motives--because the  man in charge of it was undergoing a domestic errand.   You heard a suggestion that he was only doing this because he was  asked by Andriy Yermak. That is laughable. Giuliani tried to get the  meeting with Zelensky, remember? And he couldn't get in the door, and  then he announced that there were enemies around President Zelensky.  And then they go into the phone call on July 25, and the Ukrainians try  to persuade the President: You don't have enemies in Ukraine; we are  only friends. And what was the President's response? I want you to  ``talk to Rudy.'' That is not policy being conducted; that is a  personal, political errand. They just undermined their entire argument.   Now the President's counsel also essentially argues, in terms of  witnesses, if their case is as strong as Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nadler and  others say, then why do they need witnesses? You know, you can imagine  a scene in any courtroom in America where, before the trial begins,  defense counsel for the defendant stands up and says: Your  [[Page S710]]  Honor, if the prosecution's case is so strong, let them prove it  without witnesses. That is essentially what is being argued here.   Well, I will make an offer to opposing counsel, who have said that  this will stretch on indefinitely if you decide to have a single  witness: Let's cabin the depositions to 1 week.   In the Clinton trial, it was 1 week of depositions, and do you know  what the Senate did during that week? They did the business of the  Senate. The Senate went back to its ordinary legislative business while  the depositions were being conducted. If you want the Clinton model,  let's use the Clinton model. Let's take a week.   Let's take a week to have a fair trial. You can continue your  business. We can get the business of the country done. Is that too much  to ask in the name of fairness, that we follow the Clinton model, that  we take 1 week?   I mean, are we really driven by the timing of the State of the Union?  Should that be our guiding principle?   Can't we take 1 week to hear from these witnesses? I think we can. I  think we should. I think we must.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Durbin is to both  parties.         Emails between DOD and OMB officials reveal that by August       12 the Pentagon could no longer guarantee that all of the       $250 million in DOD aid to Ukraine could be spent before it       expired. Deputy Secretary of Defense Norquist drafted a       letter and stated that the Pentagon had ``repeatedly advised       OMB officials that pauses beyond August 19 jeopardize the       Department's ability to obligate USAI funding prudently and       fully.'' Why did the President persist in withholding the       funds when DOD officials were sounding the alarm that the       hold would violate the law and short-change our ally of       needed military aid?     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S716, January 30, 2020, first column, the following  appears: Emails between DOD and OMB officials reveal that by  August 12 the Pentagon could no longer guarantee that all of the  $250 million in DOD aid to Ukraine could be spent before it  expired. Deputy Secretary of Defense Norquist drafted a letter and  stated that the Pentagon had ``repeatedly advised OMB officials  that pauses beyond August 19 jeopardize the Department's ability  to obligate USAI funding prudently and fully.'' Why did the  President persist in withholding the funds when DOD officials were  sounding the alarm that the hold would violate the law and short- change an ally of needed military aid?      The online Record has been corrected to read: Emails between DOD  and OMB officials reveal that by August 12 the Pentagon could no  longer guarantee that all of the $250 million in DOD aid to  Ukraine could be spent before it expired. Deputy Secretary of  Defense Norquist drafted a letter and stated that the Pentagon had  ``repeatedly advised OMB officials that pauses beyond August 19  jeopardize the Department's ability to obligate USAI funding  prudently and fully.'' Why did the President persist in  withholding the funds when DOD officials were sounding the alarm  that the hold would violate the law and short-change our ally of  needed military aid?    ========================= END NOTE =========================      It is the turn of the White House counsel to go first.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senator, thank you for  that question.   I think the thing to understand is, there was a series of  communications reflected, I believe, in the letter that OMB has sent to  the JAO and in some of the testimony in the proceeding below that the  Office of Management and Budget was encouraging DOD to take what steps  it could to get everything lined up, have everything ready to obligate  the funds so everything would be able to move quickly when the pause  was lifted.   The email you mentioned suggests--was saying: We are running out of  time. We are running out of time. We are going to have difficulty doing  it.   But the fact was that the deadline for obligating the funds was not  going to be until the end of the fiscal year. And as it turned out, as  I explained earlier in response to Senator Lankford's question, the  funds were released on September 11, and the vast majority of them were  obligated by the end of the fiscal year, so that the procedures that  had been used to try to get everything preplanned were mostly  successful.   Yes, there were some funds--I believe it was $35 million--that did  not get out of the door by the end of the fiscal year--slightly more  than in past years. But in every year--in fiscal year 2017, fiscal year  2018--there were funds in the security assistance program that didn't  make it out of the door by the end of the year. Each of those years,  there was also a little fix in either the appropriations bill or CR to  allow those funds to carry over.   So the planning had been to try to ensure that when the decision was  made to release the funds, it would be done by the end of the fiscal  year. Not quite all of that got out of the door, that is true, but  there is always some that doesn't get out of the door by the end of the  fiscal year.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, thank you  for that question.   As we go further and further down this rabbit hole, I think we need  to make it very clear that, you know, of the 17 witnesses that the  House interviewed, nobody had an explanation. Yet again, like last  night, Mr. Philbin seems to know more than anybody else in the  government, more than anyone in the Department of Defense, more than  anybody in the Department of State, more than anybody in OMB who had  come forward with information about how exactly this happened.   But, again, here are the facts. OMB interviewed about an interagency  process that they supposedly said was going on long after the  interagency process had already ended. In fact, as OMB was doing those  footnotes that we talked about last week--those footnotes that had  never been done before, that Mr. Sandy said he had never seen in his 12  years of time working this process--as that was going on, DOD was  asking the question about why we are doing this. They had no idea.   Then when the release was finally getting ready to be finally  lifted--the hold, rather--OMB emailed DOD, saying: Listen, as we have  been saying all along, under the Impoundment Control Act, there are no  problems here, and if there is a problem, it is your fault. To which  DOD replied back, as you may recall: You have got to be kidding me.  ``I'm speechless.'' Because they did not know. Nobody had told them  anything. None of the other 17 witnesses knew about it.   So I do want to address, before I finish one other point, this idea  that the delay didn't matter. Listen, it doesn't matter if it was a 4- day delay, a 40-day delay, or a 400-day delay; every delay in combat  matters. Every delay in combat matters.   And I will say--they talked about delays in the past. Well, in past  years, there was about 3 to 6 percent of the funds unobligated because  of unforeseen and legitimate reasons following the policy process. In  2019, 14 percent of the funds went unobligated for foreseeable and  avoidable reasons--because the President could have held them. And to  this day, $16 million is unspent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager. Your time has expired.   The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Durbin for the House managers:         Would you please respond to the answer that was just given       by the President's counsel?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, it has been a long couple of days, so  let me be blunt about where I think we are. I think we all know what  happened here. I think we all understand what the President did here. I  don't think there is really much question at this point about why the  military aid was withheld or why President Zelensky couldn't get in the  door of the Oval Office. I don't think there is any confusion about why  he wanted Joe Biden investigated or why he was pushing the CrowdStrike  conspiracy theory. I don't think there is really much question about  that. I don't think there is any question about what we could expect if  and when John Bolton testifies, although the details of which we  certainly don't know. I don't think there is really much question about  that. But what is extraordinary is, although they can claim that this  was a radical mistake or notion of Professor Dershowitz that they seem  to be distancing themselves from right now, I guess they think they are  accusing Dershowitz now of some maladministration in his argument of  the defense--they are still embracing that idea.   What they just told you admittedly in outline of A, B, and C, what  they just told you is: accept everything the House said, accept the  President withheld the military aid to coerce Ukraine into helping him  cheat in the election, accept that these investigations are a sham,  accept that he obstructed all subpoenas and witnesses, accept all of  that. Too bad. There is nothing you can do. That is not impeachable.   A President of the United States--this is now where we have come to  in this moment of our history, the President of the United States can  withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that we appropriated,  can do so in violation of the law, can do so to coerce an ally, in  order to help him cheat in an election, and you can't do anything about  it, except hold up a nomination. That is not impeachable.   They can abuse their power all they want--the President, this  President, the next President can abuse their power all they want in  the furtherance of their reelection as long as--here is the limiting  principle--as long as they think their reelection is in the national  interest. Well, that is quite a constraint. That is where we have come  now after 2\1/2\ centuries of our history.   I think our Founders would be aghast that anyone would make that  argument on the floor of the Senate. I think they would be aghast,  having come out of a monarchy, having literally risked their lives,  having taken this great gamble that people could be entrusted to run  their own government and choose their own leaders, recognizing that we  are not angels, setting up a system that would have ambition,  counterambition, that we would so willingly abdicate that  responsibility and say that a Chief Executive now has the full power to  coerce our ally--a foreign power to intervene in our election--because  they think it is in the national interest that they get reelected.   Is that really what we think the Founders would have condoned or do  we think that this is precisely the kind of character of conduct that  they provided a remedy for? I think we know the answer to that.   They wrote a beautiful Constitution. They understood a lot about  human nature. They understood, as we do, that absolute power corrupts  absolutely. And they provided a constraint, but it will only be as good  and as strong as the men and women of this institution's willingness to  uphold it, to not look away from the truth.   The truth is staring us in the eyes. We know why they don't want John  Bolton to testify. It is not because we don't really know what happened  here. They just don't want the American people to hear it in all of its  ugly, graphic detail. They don't want the President's National Security  Advisor on live TV or even a nonlive deposition to say: I talked with  the President, and he told me in no uncertain terms: John--   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. To be continued.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Georgia.
