 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  RELIEVE Act. I introduced this bill after a veteran from Spokane  reached out for my help. She had recently retired from service and was  days away from her first VA appointment when she had a heart attack.   She was rushed to the ER, where she made a full recovery, but the VA  refused to pay for her care.   Why? Because she hadn't seen a VA doctor in the last 24 months.   It didn't matter that she had just enrolled or that many VA  facilities have 30- to 60-day delays. They denied her the coverage she  needed, and her bills were piling up.   The RELIEVE Act would make this right. It waives the 24-month rule  for 60 days, giving veterans time to establish care and ensure that  they qualify for outside emergency coverage.   I am grateful to the leadership of the committee, as well as my  colleagues, Jack Bergman and Chris Pappas, for helping lead this bill  to help eliminate the emergency coverage gap. I urge my colleagues to  join in giving veterans the treatment that they have earned.
