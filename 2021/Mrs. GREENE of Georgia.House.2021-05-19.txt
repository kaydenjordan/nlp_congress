 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary life of Captain Michael D'Angelo Garigan, a dedicated law  enforcement officer from my district, who passed away earlier this  year.   Officer Garigan was born in Gordon County to a well-known and highly  respected family. A Calhoun resident all his life, Captain Garigan  invested in his community and bettered the lives of everyone around  him.   Captain Garigan served the people of Gordon County for over three  decades as a deputy, detective, and coordinator for the Gordon County  Sheriff's Office. In fact, Captain Garigan was decorated over a dozen  times for exemplary police work.   Outside the office, Captain Garigan was an active member of his  community, serving his church as a deacon, broadcasting high school  football games on the radio, and umpiring baseball and football games  for local youth leagues.   Captain Garigan's exemplary contribution to the people of Gordon  County should be honored and remembered. That is why I have introduced  House Resolution 301, commending Captain Garigan for his devotion to  his family, community, church, and the Nation.   My thoughts and prayers are with Captain Garigan's family and the  people of Gordon County.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bill and to the January 6 commission. I do so as a Member of Congress  because I believe this institution's duty is to serve the people of  this country and not itself.   In this past year, we have witnessed violent riots in American cities  all over this country. We have witnessed tremendous damage. Minneapolis  city officials estimate 700 buildings were damaged, burned, or  destroyed, including 360 local businesses. There has not been a  commission launched to study the reasons why that happened.   There has not been an investigation to stop the BLM and antifa riots  that have hurt innocent people and attacked government buildings and  Federal courthouses, taken over police precincts, created autonomous  zones in the city of Portland, and done so much damage to people all  over the country.   Studies show 570 protests in 220 different U.S. locations turned  violent over the summer. The $1 billion-plus riot damage is estimated  to be the most expensive in insurance history. It resulted in up to $2  billion of damages in 20 cities across the U.S., mostly concentrated in  L.A., Detroit, Miami, D.C., and New York.                                time  1700    As a person who was a victim of the January 6 Capitol attack, I can  tell you that I am against the violence that happened that day, but I  do not believe a January 6 commission will achieve any resolution  because we have already had our Department of Justice arrest 445  people, with 100 more to be arrested soon.   There are also reports of people being held for 23 hours in solitary  confinement. That should not be happening. These people haven't even  had a court date yet.   What is going to happen with the January 6 commission is the media is  going to use this to smear Trump supporters and President Trump for the  next few years and cover up the real damage that is happening to the  people of this country, which is tearing down our economy, ripping our  borders wide open, and hurting this country.
