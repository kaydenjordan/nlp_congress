 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge swift reauthorization  of the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Community Health  Center Program. CHIP keeps kids covered by providing basic healthcare  to about 9 million children and pregnant mothers, including thousands  of Oregonians.   The providers and families in our States deserve certainty that that  funding for these programs will be there when they need it. The lapse  of these programs is already hurting our constituents and our  communities.   At Virginia Garcia, a teaching health center in my district, payments  for their residency program stopped abruptly. The clinic's executive  director said that they cannot, in good conscience, stop these  residencies, but they are very nervous about spending precious reserves  when they had anticipated these grants would be fully funded.   There is no excuse for delay when it comes to the health of our  children and families. We must continue commonsense investments in our  Nation's health by reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance  Program and the Community Health Center Program immediately.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today I rise for Eva, an Oregon doctor  who is one of the compassionate providers women turn to when facing an  unintended or dangerous pregnancy.   Oregon has rejected restrictions on abortions, but because of bans or  restrictions in other States, Dr. Eva provides healthcare services,  including abortion, to women from around the country.                                time  1700    One patient was a high school senior who could not get an abortion in  her home State. She spent weeks saving every penny she could to buy a  plane ticket and pay for the procedure.   Instead of making women fly across the country, instead of debating  this bill, and instead of cutting programs like the Teen Pregnancy  Prevention Program, which my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have done, we should be focused on preventing unintended pregnancies,  and we should be expanding access to comprehensive reproductive care,  something the Oregon Legislature did when they passed the landmark  Reproductive Health Equity Act.   Madam Speaker, when abortion is banned, it does not go away. It  drives women to unsafe back alleys and to dangerous self-induced  abortions. We must stop efforts to stand between women and their  healthcare providers. Please vote ``no'' on H.R. 36.
