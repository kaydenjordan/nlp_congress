 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise to urge the censure and the removal from  committees of Mr. Gosar for portraying the murder of a fellow colleague  and promoting violence against immigrants. We know that promoting  visions of violence and spreading false, hateful rhetoric foments  actual violence. January 6 taught us that. And surely, we cannot use  taxpayers' own money to promote violent images and conduct directed at  other Members.   I still see bedside visions of my friend, Gabby Giffords, fighting  for her life after being shot at a district event, her aide already  dead. I shudder to recall our own colleague, Mr. Scalise, limping to  this very Chamber on a cane because someone tried to assassinate him.  Explosive residue still clings to a stairwell outside my district  office where a pipe bomb, sent by a deranged Trump supporter and  handled by my staff later, had to be safely detonated.   The history of violence aimed at women and people of color and those  who defend them are among humankind's worst chapters.   Madam Speaker, it is ironic that Mr. Gosar compares himself to  Alexander Hamilton and another Member condones the stylized violence  portrayed by Mr. Gosar, because Hamilton was actually killed by  accepted high-class violence in his day in a duel.   Madam Speaker, promoting and glorifying such conduct cannot be  condoned or ignored by this body. Voting to censure Mr. Gosar today  firmly denounces it unequivocally.                                time  1530
