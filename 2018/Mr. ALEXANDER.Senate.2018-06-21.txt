 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators on both sides  of the aisle and staff members for working together to have a good  process this week on our first appropriations bills.   We have three of them that we made progress on. We had six recorded  votes in the last couple of days. We have about 20 other amendments-- most of them bipartisan--which we believe we could adopt by a voice  vote, but we have one or two recorded votes that we are going to need  to take this afternoon unless we have agreements otherwise.                   Amendment No. 2983 to Amendment No. 2910    Mr. President, based on that, I ask unanimous consent to call up the  Bennet-Gardner amendment No. 2983. I further ask consent that at 2  p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the Bennet amendment, and that no  second-degree amendments be in order to the amendment prior to the  vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    What that means in plain English is that we will have  a vote at 2 p.m. If we secure agreement, we could quickly wrap up this  afternoon. If we don't, we will have further votes this afternoon.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes to inform Senators where we are.    I thank Senators on both sides of the aisle for  working well this week on the appropriations process. We are off to a  very good start.   We have voted on six amendments in the last couple of days. We have  about 20 others that we are close to agreement on and probably can  adopt by voice vote.   We have one amendment we are going to have to deal with. If it were  not offered, then this would be the last vote for the day. If it needs  to be dealt with, then we are going to have to deal with it following  this vote. So I wanted Members to know, unless we get agreement, we  will be having at least one more vote following this vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2983     Mr. President, for the information of the Senators, we  are about to move to the consideration of the amendment by the Senator  from Utah. I want to take about 1 minute to talk about it. The leader  will speak, and then I will move to table the amendment. Depending on  the outcome of the amendment, there may be other votes this afternoon.   I thank Senators for working well together. We have had six votes. We  have had 20 that we think we can work out, more or less, in a managers'  package. The Senator from Utah, by the way, has been very helpful in  getting us to that point. Yet I am going to move to table his  amendment, and I want to explain why.  [[Page S4329]]    This is an authorizing amendment. It belongs on the authorizing bill.  This is an appropriations bill. We have worked very hard over the last  few weeks, under Chairman Shelby's leadership and Senator Leahy's  leadership, to try to keep such amendments off of our appropriations  bill so that we can get to a result.   It has been a long time since this body has done what it is supposed  to do under the appropriations process. This is the first week of that  process. If we table the amendment that is about to come up, we will be  able to complete our work, I believe, today or Monday and be off to a  good start with about two dozen amendments in a process that is of the  kind that we have been saying for weeks we want to see.   So, while I totally agree with the Senator's amendment and have voted  for it many, many times, this is not the place for it.    Let me finish, if I may, because we are trying to get  to the vote. Well, yes, I yields.    I thank the Senator for his support.   Mr. President, in addition to this, for those on this side of the  aisle who oppose the waters of the United States, remember that the  courts have enjoined it, and President Trump has rescinded it.  President Trump's EPA rewrote the rule and sent it to the OMB last  week. So there will be a new rule, but it is not now in effect.   Finally, a small part of the bill is dealt with in the Interior  appropriations bill.   I thank the Members for being here. I respect the Senator from Utah,  but following the leader's remarks, I am going to move to table his  amendment. I urge all Senators to do that. We want an appropriations  process. We do not want an Omnibus appropriations bill, and that is  what we will get if we offer amendments like this during the  appropriations process.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I move to table Lee amendment No. 3021,  and ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2  minutes equally divided prior to the vote.    I yield back.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
