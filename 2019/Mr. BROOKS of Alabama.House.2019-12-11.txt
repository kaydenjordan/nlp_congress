 Mr. Speaker, 106--nearly half--of House  Democrats have cosponsored the socialists' Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   I will not mince words: Socialized medicine causes worse healthcare  at higher costs with longer waits and more dead Americans.   America must learn from countries that have experimented with  socialized medicine. Per Britain's Royal College of Surgeons, almost a  quarter of a million people must wait more than 6 months--6 months--to  receive planned medical treatment from the National Health Service.  Worse yet, more than 3,600 Britons wait more than 9 months for medical  care.   The photo next to me was taken by a British mother outraged by the  healthcare her ill son received. As this photo shows, her son was  treated on a hospital floor.   Do we want newborn babies kept in cardboard boxes like they are in  socialist Venezuela? Is that really what we want in America?   I say no. But that is exactly what America will get if socialists  have their way in this healthcare debate.   Canada's socialized medicine is no better. A 2016 survey by Canada's  Fraser Institute found a median wait of 20  [[Page H10027]]  weeks, almost 5 months, for ``medically necessary'' treatments and  procedures.   Britain's National Health Service data reveals that almost 25 percent  of cancer patients don't start treatment on time, despite urgent  referrals from their primary care doctors. Britain's politicians  whitewash this deadly statistic by claiming treatment is ``on time,''  if it is given within 62 days of referral--2 months of referral.   Such long wait periods for cancer treatment can be, and are, deadly.  For example, 81 percent of British breast cancer patients live 5 years  after diagnosis compared to 89 percent for American breast cancer  patients. Stated differently, 8 of every 100 breast cancer patients who  live in America would die in Britain's socialized medicine system.   Americans with prostate cancer have a 97 percent 5-year survival  rate. In Britain, it drops to 83 percent. Stated differently, 14 of  every 100 prostate cancer patients who live in America would die in  Britain's socialized medicine system.   It is irresponsible and dangerous for America to copy socialized  medicine, yet that is exactly what socialist Democrats wants us to do.   The House soon votes on a socialist drug cost plan that gives the  government control over drug pricing while suppressing the invention of  lifesaving drugs. For example, the Congressional Budget Office warns  this legislation results in 15 fewer drugs in the next 10 years. That  is 15 drugs that help Americans live longer or more comfortably, gone,  because of socialist Democrat wishful thinking.                                time  1115    Mr. Speaker, socialized medicine is not the answer. Government price  controls are not the answer.   The answer is more free enterprise competition that forces healthcare  providers and drug companies to provide their best products at their  lowest prices or go out of business.   I urge the American people to not fall prey to socialists who promise  taxpayer-funded government healthcare.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this socialist drug pricing  scheme.   Most importantly, I urge America to be wary of propaganda that claims  socialized medicine lowers healthcare costs or saves lives. Socialized  medicine does neither.   Remember that promise that ObamaCare will cut your health insurance  premiums by $2,500 per year? That was false propaganda.   Remember the promise that, under ObamaCare you can keep your doctor  and health insurance plans if you want them? That was more false  propaganda.   America, do your homework. Don't fall for the lies again. Demand  solutions that both lower costs and save lives.   Why? Because your very life is at risk.                            ____________________
