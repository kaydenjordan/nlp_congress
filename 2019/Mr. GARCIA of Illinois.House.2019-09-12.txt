 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, we lost my  dear friend, Marca Bristo, an inspiring civil rights activist from  Chicago.   Marca had a diving accident when she was young that left her  paralyzed from the chest down. She never allowed her disability to  define her. Instead, her disability became her superpower.   Marca dedicated her life to changing laws and bringing attention to  the disparities faced by people with disabilities in the most basic  services. She was instrumental in bringing wheelchair ramps to Chicago  public buses.   She didn't do this by just writing letters or holding meetings. Marca  went as far as chaining herself to a bus to force the Chicago Transit  Authority to make mass transit more accessible.   She worked with the broader civil rights communities to pass key  legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act. The organization  she founded, Access Living of Metropolitan Chicago, will carry on with  her legacy.   I send our heartfelt thoughts to her son and her daughter.   Rest in power, Marca Bristol.                            ____________________
