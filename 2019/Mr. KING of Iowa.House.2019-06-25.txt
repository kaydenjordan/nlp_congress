 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being recognized to  address you here on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives.   I rise today to honor Jaci Hermstad. She has given me so much  inspiration.   I want to start, though, with the early, sad part of this story. This  is a sad story with a happy part in the middle of it right now, Mr.  Speaker.   Jaci's identical twin sister, Alex, was diagnosed with a very severe  and aggressive form of ALS. That took place in 2005. Then, by 2010 and  2011, my staff and, especially, Sandy Hanlon in our Sioux City office,  were working with the Hermstads to do those things we could do, in a  limited fashion, admittedly.   On St. Valentine's Day of 2011, sadly, Jaci's identical twin sister,  Alex, passed away at age 17. Now, that is 8 years ago. About 2015 or  so, Jaci and her mother, Lori, came to my office to talk with me about  ALS, this dreaded Lou Gehrig's disease, that always ends up fatal. It  always ends up in a sad, tragic ending. They had experienced that with  Jaci's identical twin sister.   Even more sadly, there was news that symptoms showed up in Jaci late  last fall, around the holiday time. By Christmas she couldn't get up  the stairs any longer, and again, on St. Valentine's Day of this year,  Jaci was diagnosed with the aggressive form of ALS that her identical  twin sister had passed away from.  [[Page H5082]]    Now, they had donated some of her sister's tissue to science, and two  significant companies, Columbia University, and Dr. Neil Shneider began  doing DNA work on that preparing a treatment for Jaci. This treatment  wasn't available for Jaci soon enough in her view, her family's view,  or in my view. The FDA had to work through their regulations. As we  worked through that, it looked like Jaci couldn't get this potentially  miraculous treatment before perhaps September or October. At the rate  of the digression of her condition, it didn't look like she was going  to be with us long enough to receive the treatment.   Some of us went to work to step up and help Jaci. I got involved on  April 13 of this year when my wonderful district staff person, Andrea  Easter, who had been working with the family all along, brought me up  and we did a fundraiser there at the Spencer AG Center on April 13, a  Saturday.    It was a cold and chilly day when we arrived there. There were  pickups parked on either side of the road to the Spencer AG Center. It  looked like we were going to a farm sale there were so many vehicles  there.   They had only expected maybe 100 people, and the Clay County  Cattlemen were there to flip maybe 100 burgers and put out a basket for  people to put a check in. They thought they could raise $3,000 to  $5,000 just as a token, as a way to help.   The story about that day is, it turned out that there were over 1,000  people who came. And they raised in the end, the last report I got, was  over $200,000.   I sat with Jaci that day and talked about her dreams to build a  riding arena and train horses for therapy for others and to be able to  help people.   She is a cowgirl, Mr. Speaker. I committed that I will come up and  grade that arena on the house, and I will be on the machine to do it. I  look forward to that day.   But we had more work to do. So that story that day got us all  energized. We kept her in our prayers every day. By May 2 we had a  meeting with Dr. Woodcock and the FDA.   We moved along even further. By May 20 I introduced a private bill. I  tried to convince my Senators to do the same. They thought there would  be an objection to a UC in the Senate.   I brought this to Speaker Pelosi. She was terrific to work with. We  had several meetings all together, with Steny Hoyer and with her staff.  Before that bill could come to the floor for a unanimous consent  request, the FDA opened the door and Jaci went wheels up January 5 to  go to Columbia.   She received her first treatment on June 11, and today, starting 5  minutes from now, Mr. Speaker, she will receive her second treatment.  There has been no noticeable digression in her condition. I am hopeful  and prayerful that it will improve. We have a chance here at a miracle.   So many people worked so well together to get this done, including  the press people around the Spencer, Iowa, area. I want to especially  mention Stella ``With the Good Heart'' Daskalakis. I always call her  Stella ``With the Good Heart.'' She has done so much, along with KICD  Radio, KTIV, KUOO, and KSFY in Sioux Falls.   Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful for everyone who has formed a link in  this chain of miracles. We are on our way to an extraordinary miracle.  We will keep Jaci in our prayers this day as she receives her second  treatment for ALS.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I offer amendment No. 3, according to  the rule.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my King amendment No.  3, and what it does is it strikes section 126 in the underlying bill.   Section 126 is notwithstanding language that prohibits the executive  branch from using any of the funds in the Department of the Treasury's  forfeiture fund, the Civil Assets Forfeiture Fund, to be used for  anything, to build a wall or a road that might support a wall on our  southern border.   The language is very expansive in the bill. It says none of the funds  ``may be obligated, expended, or used to plan, design, construct, or  carry out a project to construct a wall, barrier, fence, or road along  the southern border of the United States, or a road to provide access  to a wall, barrier, or fence constructed along the southern border of  the United States.''   Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes that language, and it does so with  the idea in mind that we have a President who was elected with a  mandate to secure our border. This has been an ongoing battle for the  last 2\1/2\ years, and still the resources are short.   I think we should have done a better job in the previous Congress to  get that money into this project, but the President is going where he  can to find the resources to keep his campaign promises. So I certainly  want to support that by striking that language and allowing the  President to then have access to what amounts to $601 million that  would be generated, be freed up by my amendment.   And it recognizes this, that the U.S. Treasury has about $13.6  billion that is allocated to it under this underlying bill; and this  small piece of money here is not a lot of money, but it does send a  message that it is going to get harder and harder for the President to  build a wall if we don't strike this language. And I want to support  the President's mission to do that.   It is ironic, I think, that we are spending today--and I am the only  one in Congress that I know of who tracks this spending, but we are  spending at least $6.7 million a mile for every mile of the 2,000 miles  of our southern border to secure that border.   Just doing the math in my head, quickly, that turns out to be about  $13.4 billion. Almost the exact same amount that is freed up to the  Treasury, we are spending to secure the border for something probably  less than 50 percent efficiency. When you build a wall, it is 99-point- something percent efficiency.   We need to let the President be the President. He has declared a  national emergency, and we need to strike this language from the bill  so the President has the latitude to do that which the people have  elected him to do.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chair, just some concluding thoughts on this.   This underlying bill is an increase of $793.9 million more than last  year, and it is $484.4 million more than requested by the  administration. There are plenty of resources in this underlying bill  to take care of the obligations that this Congress has to the people of  this country, but they also have an obligation to secure our border and  restore the respect for the rule of law.   The chaos that we have on the border is not just something that is  reflecting back on us in the United States. I am hearing many laments  about the individual tragedies, though we are counting them on one  hand, for the most part. I asked the Secretary of Homeland Security  under oath just late last year, Kirstjen Nielsen at the time, whom I  respect and appreciate, how many died on the way to our southern  border.   She said: I don't have the data for that. I will get it to you.   I said: It will be too long for that. I want your best estimate. How  many died on the way from Central America to the southern border?   Her answer finally came: Congressman, it would be thousands and  thousands.   That is the history of what we are trying to shut off here. They will  keep coming until we end up deciding that we are not going to accept  them anymore. We must secure our border if we are going to be a  sovereign nation. This is a piece of it.   I support the President. I urge adoption of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
