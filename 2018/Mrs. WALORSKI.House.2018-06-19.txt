Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6110, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6110, the Dr. Todd  Graham Pain Management, Treatment, and Recovery Act.   Solving the opioid epidemic requires everyone to work together at all  levels, from the Federal Government down to those on the front lines of  this fight.   My legislation focuses on increasing access to pain management  alternatives that do not involve opioids and improving recovery  treatment options for those suffering from opioid use disorder.   Additionally, my legislation contains the following provisions that  will also be vital in overcoming this crisis: H.R. 5778, the Promoting  Outpatient Access to Non-Opioid Treatments Act introduced by  Representative  Kenny Marchant and Health Subcommittee Ranking Member  Sander Levin, which requires the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, or HHS, to require payments made to hospital outpatient  departments and ambulatory surgery centers to ensure there are no  financial incentives to use opioids over nonopioid alternatives; H.R.  5769, the Expanding Access to Treatment Act introduced by  Representatives Keith Rothfus and  Danny Davis, which provides payments  to federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics to  offset the cost of their providers receiving training so they are able  to provide medication-assisted treatment that will help individuals  recover from opioid use disorder; H.R. 5725, the Benefit Evaluation of  Safe Treatment Act introduced by Health Subcommittee Chairman Peter  Roskam and Representatives Linda Sanchez, John Shimkus, and Raul Ruiz,  which directs the Secretary of HHS to evaluate the extent to which MA  plans offer medication-assisted treatments and cover nonopioid  alternative treatments not otherwise covered under a Medicare fee for  service as part of a supplemental benefit; and H.R. 5790, the Medicare  Nurse Hotline Act introduced by Representatives Kristi Noem and Judy  Chu, which directs the Secretary of HHS to educate patients on the  availability of psychologist services and explore the use of hotlines  to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and Medicare.   The bill is named after my friend Dr. Todd Graham. He was a double  board certified physician in both physical medicine and rehabilitation  and pain medicine who lived and worked in my district in northern  Indiana.   Last year, he was senselessly murdered after refusing to prescribe an  opioid to a patient.   Dr. Graham prided himself on serving his patients in a friendly and  caring fashion. He treated each person individually, taking the time to  offer specific steps to treat their issues.   One day last year, he had an interaction with a patient demanding  opioids, a situation that has become disturbingly all too common. He  stood firm in refusing to write a prescription for her, but her  husband, who was also there, became increasingly angry throughout that  visit. Two hours after they left his office, the husband returned and  murdered him in cold blood.   Dr. Graham's loss has been a heavy blow, but his legacy of compassion  and enthusiasm lives on through his wife, Julie; their two daughters;  and their son, who plans to follow in his father's footsteps.   We are lucky to have the Graham family with us here today to witness  the passage of this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding several       opioid bills the Committee on Ways and Means ordered       favorably reported to address the opioid epidemic. The       following bills were also referred to the Committee on Energy       and Commerce.        I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce waive       formal consideration of the following bills so that they may       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bills, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       the following bills, which were also referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action       on these bills so that they may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I appreciate your acknowledgment that by forgoing formal       consideration of these bills, the Committee on Energy and       Commerce is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in those provisions of the bills       that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also appreciate       your offer to support the Committee's request for the       appointment of conferees in the event of a House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.  [[Page H5253]]         Thank you for your assistance on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this epidemic knows no boundaries. Opioid abuse  continues to devastate families and communities all over this country.  As we continue to work toward commonsense solutions to the opioid  epidemic, this bipartisan legislation will help break down barriers to  nonopioid treatments and give healthcare providers better tools to  prevent addiction and to assist in recovery.   I want to thank Chairman Brady for all of his hard work, as well as  my friend Ms. Judy Chu of California, who helped develop and introduce  this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5774) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to develop guidance on pain management and opioid use disorder  prevention for hospitals receiving payment under part A of the Medicare  program, provide for opioid quality measures development, and provide  for a technical expert panel on reducing surgical setting opioid use  and data collection on perioperative opioid use, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5774         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(C) Health care consumers or groups representing such       consumers.        (D) Other entities determined appropriate by the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5744, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5774, the  Combating Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals Act of 2018, or COACH Act.  We have learned that, across the continuum of care, screening for  opioid abuse disorder and education for patients and providers is  necessary to help eradicate this epidemic.   This legislation includes efforts to develop quality measures related  to the treatment of individuals with opioid use disorder, to improve  and publicize guidance on opioid prescribing, and to develop expert  recommendations on reducing the use of opioids in the surgical setting.  These provisions, championed by Representatives Paulsen, Danny Davis,  Higgins, Buchanan, Lamb, and Jason Smith, will help improve education  for providers and patients to better ensure prevention and care of  individuals with opioid use disorder.   The COACH Act also includes H.R. 5699, the Hospital Opioid Solutions  Toolkit, which Representative Curbelo introduced with Congresswoman  Kuster. The toolkit, to be made available by the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services, or CMS, in consultation with relevant  stakeholders, will contain resources that hospitals can use to ensure  the best practices are being utilized for educating patients and  providers about treatment for pain management, including the  development of a notification template for hospital staff to better  inform patients prescribed opioids of potential risks.   I am thankful for all the hard work on this legislation by Members of  both sides of the aisle, especially Representatives Curbelo, DelBene,  Budd, and Kuster.   I would also like to thank Chairman Brady for his leadership, as well  as the House Committee on Ways and Means' staff for their efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of  H.R. 5774, the Combating Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals Act of  2018. This is an issue that affects every congressional district. It is  imperative that we find solutions that get people into treatment and  prevent opioid abuse on the front end.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bills, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       the following bills, which were also referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action       on these bills so that they may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I appreciate your acknowledgment that by forgoing formal       consideration of these bills, the Committee on Energy and       Commerce is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in those provisions of the bills       that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also appreciate       your offer to support the Committee's request for the       appointment of conferees in the event of a House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        Thank you for your assistance on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to remind my colleagues why it is so  important that we continue working to solve this crisis.   Thousands of lives have already been lost because of opioid-related  drug overdoses. Tragically, Indiana has been hit especially hard by  this crisis. This is a public health emergency, and our response must  be comprehensive and swift.   I am proud of the COACH Act, bipartisan legislation that would help  prevent opioid misuse and reduced dependence on opioids for pain  management.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
