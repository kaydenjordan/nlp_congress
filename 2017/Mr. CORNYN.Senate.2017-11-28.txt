 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week we are engaged in what is  perhaps the most momentous subject that we haven't dealt with in recent  times, and that is, after 30 years, updating and reforming our Nation's  convoluted, complex, and self-destructive Tax Code.   Those who are interested in getting to yes and who will cast a  ``yes'' vote, I believe, will be casting a vote for growing the  economy, voting for more jobs, voting for higher wages, and voting for  more take-home pay. Those who vote against this endeavor are really  saying yes to stagnant wages, less jobs, and a lower standard of  living. They are willing to accept the reality that American jobs are  going overseas because our country has the highest Tax Code in the  civilized world, and bringing the money earned overseas back home  basically means having to pay double taxes. So what people do is they  do what you would logically do, and they spend the money overseas and  hire foreign workers in foreign countries rather than Americans and  make things stamped ``Made in America.''    Simply stated, this bill is about the dreamers and the doers, the  small businesses and the hard-working American families who need tax  cuts and tax reform. This is about helping the middle class.   Actually, what this bill does--the Senate version of the bill--is it  reduces the tax burden on every tax-paying cohort. In other words, all  of the tax rates come down. In order to do that, both on the personal  side and the business side, we had to eliminate a lot of what I call  the underbrush, which are the tax deductions, the tax credits, and the  other subsidies that have made our Tax Code so incomprehensible to  everybody other than accountants and lawyers. That is one reason people  are so frustrated with our Tax Code--it costs them so much money just  to comply with their legal obligations.   It has been a long time since we took up this important topic, and I  know the reaction is, well, this is just another going-through-the- motions effort, but I assure you that is not the case. These reforms  are not only possible, they are very important because they will  positively impact real people's lives.   Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute has said that  ``some believe that taxation is a dry topic  [[Page S7347]]  with no moral significance, but nothing could be further from the  truth.'' For example, by doubling the standard deduction, we will limit  the number of people who have to itemize their tax deductions in order  to claim the full legal deduction. That means that now only 1 out of  every 10 taxpayers will have to itemize and 9 out of 10 will just claim  the standard deduction, which will now be doubled.   We are also going to double the child tax credit, which will help  working families provide the things they need in order to take care of  their growing families. It will mean that more people will have more  money left over after paying Uncle Sam to spend on their own families,  to invest in their children's education, maybe to even take the first  vacation they have taken in 10 years or more.   Mr. President, $2,200 is what a median family of four will save in  taxes under our proposal. Maybe they want to get their pickup truck  fixed. Maybe they want to build a little financial cushion because they  have been living paycheck to paycheck. I can't remember the precise  statistic, but the number of people in America who could not meet their  financial needs if they experienced an unexpected $400 cost--maybe your  car broke down, or maybe your house flooded, whatever the case may be.  We need people to be able to keep more of what they earn and build a  cushion so they don't have to live with the anxiety of living paycheck  to paycheck, knowing that if the unexpected happens, it could put them  in deep trouble. That $2,200 a year could mean a couple hundred dollars  each month to put toward your mortgage, to pay down your mortgage, or  to provide a little breathing room.   This plan is also designed to increase wages, and it is estimated  that the combined benefit of this bill, together with the economic  growth we are anticipating, could mean as much as $4,000 in additional  income. So it not only lowers the tax burden, but it raises the income  levels. Frankly, as I mentioned a moment ago, our Tax Code incentivizes  American businesses to send jobs overseas. Why in the world wouldn't we  want to incentivize them to bring those jobs back home and invest here?   Not only can we make this Tax Code better, but I want to emphasize  why we should. We have a historic opportunity, and we shouldn't  squander our chances to take a bit of the pressure off of frustrated  workers and struggling families who are trying to make ends meet.   This country has long been a leader in the world, with the strongest  economy and the strongest people, but the reality is, our Tax Code is  no longer a world leader. As I indicated earlier, we have one of the  highest tax rates in the world, particularly for businesses. So what  happens when countries like Ireland or the United Kingdom lower their  tax rates for businesses? Well, those businesses move to those  countries. People who want to start a new business say: Well, if I have  a choice where to start that business, why should I start that business  in a country that punishes us with the highest tax rate in the world?   The current tax system penalizes success by taxing American ingenuity  and hard work at rates that are uncompetitive, and it discourages our  free enterprise system. What I mean is that it sends messages to  Americans like, don't work so hard because, you know what, you are not  working for yourself, you are working for the government. We ought to  be sending the message that by working harder, you can keep more of  what you earn and spend it the way you see fit.   Companies, of course, have no particular loyalty to our country, so  they don't really have a need to stick around because they are going to  go to countries where they can make the most profit, where they can  keep more of what they earn.   My basic point is that the messages our convoluted and archaic Tax  Code is sending are counterproductive. They are counterproductive to  workers who are looking for jobs, they are counterproductive to workers  who are looking for a little more in their paychecks, and they are  counterproductive to families who want to save and provide for their  own future.   In 2016, the Tax Policy Center projected that almost 44 percent of  Americans will pay no or negative individual income tax for 2017 under  current law, and some smaller number even get more money back from the  government in the form of refundable tax credits than they pay in  taxes. We need to make sure that everybody participates in our  government.   One thing I have heard a lot during this tax debate is that America  is horribly in debt. Sadly, that is true. But it is not because of our  Tax Code. It is not because Americans aren't taxed enough. It is not  because we spend too much money defending our country against threats  here at home and abroad. It is because we have a spending problem.    Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues, who suddenly got religion  when it comes to deficits and debt after doubling the national debt  during the Obama administration, want to use this as a reason not to  cut the taxes for hard-working American families, and I think it is  terribly misplaced.   Is the deficit important? Is debt important? Yes, it is, and we know  what we need to do to fix that. But denying the American people and  hard-working American families the tax relief they need and deserve and  failing to get the economy growing again is the wrong way to do it.   Let me quote from Arthur Brooks again. He said: ``If income tax rates  are 100 percent, income tax revenue will be zero. Why? Because with a  100-percent tax rate, nobody will bother to work. And companies won't  produce'' either.   On corporate taxes, we are seeing a lot of hypocrisy from our friends  across the aisle who had previously championed some of the very  provisions we have included in this legislation. For example, the  ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, our Democratic friend  from Oregon, had previously championed a 24-percent corporate rate  because he recognized that a 35-percent corporate rate chased  companies, businesses, and jobs overseas. Now he calls our reduction in  corporate taxes a giveaway to corporations. You could consider the  statements made by President Barack Obama in 2011 when he said to a  joint session of Congress--he said that one of the things Republicans  and Democrats need to do together is to work on lowering the corporate  tax rate because he, too, recognized that this was self-destructive,  that it was chasing jobs overseas, that it was preventing the U.S.  Treasury from collecting its taxes, and frankly that it was hurting the  bottom line for American families who maybe couldn't find work or whose  work was not rewarded with fatter paychecks and more take-home pay.   For corporate taxes, economists have said that actually lowering the  corporate tax rate will bring more investment and more jobs back home.  If it were lowered, expanded production and investment would increase  domestically.   Even though it might seem a little counterintuitive, Barack Obama;  the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden; and the minority leader, Senator  Schumer from New York, were correct when they called for lowering the  corporate rate, and it is unseemly to now try to demagogue this issue  by calling it a giveaway when it is not. We are doing what they said we  should do years ago.   When it comes to these corporate rates, some of my colleagues have  raised concerns about passthrough businesses. It is true that a number  of businesses operate here in America not as corporations but as  passthrough entities, meaning that they pay their business income on an  individual tax return. These concerns are legitimate, and we have  worked hard to try to address them.   Earlier, we were working with the National Federation of Independent  Business, which is one of the largest trade associations in the country  representing small- and medium-sized passthrough businesses. We were  able to come up with a solution which addressed their concerns and  which benefits those passthrough businesses. We still have some more  work to do, but that demonstrates what we can do when working together  to try to answer the concerns people have raised along the way during  this legislative process.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent  Business, which I mentioned a moment ago, and nearly all major small  business advocacy groups support this legislation. We had a press  conference  [[Page S7348]]  here in the Senate, just off the floor, earlier this morning, and it  was uniform--everybody said this is good for small businesses. And  small businesses are what create the vast majority of jobs in America.   I know that those who have continued questions or issues about the  legislation have had productive discussions with all of us and today  with the President, who came to visit us. I am confident that if we  keep working at it in good faith, we can come up with a way to address  the remaining issues so that we are all satisfied as much as possible.   There is an expression: Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the  good. If you are waiting around for perfection, particularly here in  the legislative process, you are never going to get anything done. That  is not an excuse for not making it as good as it can possibly be, I  believe, working together, preferably on a bipartisan basis. But if our  Democratic colleagues refuse to participate, as they have done so far,  then we have no choice but to do it ourselves.   So in the end, a vote against tax reform is a vote for economic  stagnation. It is allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good. The  Wall Street Journal, as they said yesterday--the question we need to  ask ourselves is not whether the tax bill is perfect but whether it is  a net benefit to the United States. I think it clearly is, and I think  that, with the policies embodied in this bill, we can restore America's  economic vigor.   America must continue to prosper if it is to remain the economic  beacon of the world, and we need to remain a strong country  economically so we can defend ourselves and our friends and allies  abroad. The rest of the world--it is true--is just waiting for a sign  that America's best days are ahead, and passing this important tax  legislation is an indication that it is the case that America's best  days still lie ahead.   It is time to awaken the slumbering giant of the American economy. By  lightening the load on workers and companies alike, we can make sure  new opportunities abound for those just coming into the workforce. We  will make everyday drivers of the economy excited once again about our  country's future. The President noted today, when he was with us at  lunch, that consumer confidence is literally at an alltime high. People  have seen the stock market go up and their retirement funds that are  invested in pension funds or in their IRA or elsewhere skyrocket since  the Trump administration came into office. I think that is because  people are sensing we are on the verge of a great economic recovery.    Accepting a stagnant, anemic recovery is not something we have to do.  We know what we need to do to rev up the engine of the American economy  and get it moving again to benefit all of us. Through tax reform, let's  show that the American dream of allowing men and women to work hard and  earn success isn't just a bygone notion, and it is not just a figment  of our imagination. We can do it if we pass this tax reform bill this  week, which we intend to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr.  McCain).   The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 283 Ex.]                                  YEAS--50       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Lankford      Lee      Manchin      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--48       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Hirono      Kaine      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--2       Corker      McCain           The nomination was confirmed.
