 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the residents  of Maryland's Fourth Congressional District to say that the Affordable  Care Act works. It has improved the health of thousands of men, women,  and children in my district, and it has also reduced the level of  uncompensated care in our community hospitals.   Repealing the Affordable Care Act will result in more uninsured  patients, and more uninsured people will drive up costs for everyone.  Community hospitals, such as MedStar Health and Anne Arundel Medical  Center, will be forced to lay off doctors and nurses. Major medical  centers, like John Hopkins and the University of Maryland, will be  forced to cut back investments in research that we so desperately need  to fight cancer, to treat diabetes, and to reduce infant mortality.   In the Fourth Congressional District, we are on the verge of  establishing a new regional medical center that will both improve the  quality of care throughout the National Capital Region and will create  thousands of healthcare-related jobs in my district.   Mr. Speaker, repealing the Affordable Care Act is simply wrong.  Hospital services will be reduced, local economies will be weakened,  and job losses will follow. Let's protect our care and protect our  jobs.                            ____________________
