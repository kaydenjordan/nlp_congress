 Mr. President, earlier today, in the normal course of the  day, I get the tragic news that my good friend, one of the first  persons I met when I was exploring the idea of becoming a Senator,  Jackie Walorski, was tragically killed in a car accident.   All of us are on the road a lot, and you spend those hours--endless,  sometimes--and you never imagine that one day that could happen. When I  heard that, it is like the ultimate gut punch.   Emma Thomson, Zach Potts, died along with her--three Hoosiers whom we  will miss. It is hard to come up with the words to say: How did that  happen and how do you get through it?   But for most of us, and especially in my case with Jackie, she was  one of the first great Hoosiers I got to know on my own journey. She  will be missed and our condolences to all of the families.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the  victims of a senseless act of violence in Greenwood, IN, a southern  suburb of Indianapolis.   The lives taken that day were enjoying what should have been a fun  July day with family and friends. In a moment's notice, lives were  changed forever when a deranged killer tragically took the lives of  three people. This is happening far too often, and so often it seems to  have something to do with mental illness. This is just another example  of how it plays out in the real world.   They will never be forgotten.   This resolution also expresses hope for the full recovery of those  injured in the attack as well.   I want to mention the victims by name. I think that is important:  Pedro Pineda, Rosa Mirian, Rivera de Pineda, and Victor Gomez. You have  to remember the people, their names, because this happens far too  often.   Within a mere 15 seconds of the shooter opening fire, a citizen by  the name of Elisjsha Dicken, a 22-year-old from Seymour, IN, down in my  part of the State, rose and stopped the rampage. Thank goodness for  him. If not for his courageous action, the violence surely would have  been much worse. I am proud to acknowledge the man, the young man, for  defending himself and others in a valiant act of bravery in the face of  unimaginable danger.   Hoosiers are united in mourning for those lost in this senseless  attack, and we pray for their families to find peace in the memory of  their loved ones.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of S. Res. 740, which is at the desk. I further  ask that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.
