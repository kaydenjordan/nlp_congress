 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I rise today with deep concern regarding  the Kremlin's increased aggression toward our ally, Ukraine.   Currently, Russia is amassing troops in and close to Ukraine.  Ukrainian officials estimate about 80,000 Russian troops are amassed on  its border.   U.S. European Command General Tod Wolters said, the current Russian  force mirrors the size of the infiltration of forces that occurred back  in 2014 when Russia illegally invaded Ukrainian territory.   This aggression serves one purpose: Russia's hybrid warfare to  threaten the security of the Transatlantic Alliance.   I am so grateful to President Biden for his exceptional leadership  and support for Ukraine, and I agree completely that there must be  serious consequences should Russia escalate further. I am also thankful  for the administration's latest round of punitive sanctions on Russia  given its malign behavior.   To strengthen Ukraine's deterrence capabilities, our caucus  spearheaded efforts to increase Ukraine's defense assistance funding by  $25 million, up to $275 million in fiscal year 2021, and to place  mandatory sanctions on Nord Stream 2.   Our caucus stands ready to support NATO and the Transatlantic  Alliance to ensure the protection of Ukraine's sovereignty.                            ____________________
