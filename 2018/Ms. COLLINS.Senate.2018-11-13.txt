 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 300th  anniversary of the town of Falmouth, ME. As one of the oldest  communities in Maine, Falmouth holds a very special place in our  State's history and one that exemplifies the determination and  resiliency of our people.   While this landmark anniversary marks Falmouth's incorporation, the  year 1718 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. It is a  journey that began thousands of years earlier with Native American  villages on the shores of Casco Bay. In 1623, just 3 years after the  Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Christopher Levett established a  settlement on an island in the Bay and became friends with the  Presumpscot Tribe. During the decades that followed, a robust  settlement of farms, fishing boats, and sawmills developed and thrived.  Due to the abundance of tall white pine trees, Falmouth became a  leading manufacturer of ship masts for the British navy.   Falmouth is a town defined by hard work and a love of freedom. In  1775, the townspeople rose up in protest of colonial rule, and British  forces retaliated by burning Falmouth to the ground. Undaunted,  Falmouth rebuilt and sent a company of patriots to join the fight for  American independence. During the Civil War, more than 100 of  Falmouth's young men fought, and many died, so that all might live in  freedom. The new Falmouth Veterans Memorial, made possible by  widespread community support, honors all who have served our country.   Today, Falmouth is a place of thriving commerce, quiet neighborhoods,  and beautiful scenery. Its schools are among the best in our State,  providing opportunity to its young people. At the same time, Falmouth  is home to an active and engaged senior community.   This anniversary is not just about something that is measured in  calendar years. It is a celebration of people who for more than three  centuries have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a  great community that is a wonderful place to live, work, and raise  families. Thanks to those who came before, Falmouth has a wonderful  history. Thanks to those who are here today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________
