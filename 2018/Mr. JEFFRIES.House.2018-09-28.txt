 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 1088, a  resolution recognizing September 29 as National Urban Wildlife Refuge  Day, authored by Representative Wittman.   Earlier this year, my bill, Keep America's Refuges Operational Act,  became law. That bipartisan bill reauthorized a volunteer, community  partnership, and education program for our National Wildlife Refuge  System.  [[Page H9395]]    We believe in the importance of maintaining a system of wildlands  throughout this great country. That is why I am proud to join my  colleague, Representative Wittman, in sponsoring this resolution to  recognize our Nation's 101 national urban wildlife refuges.   People visit refuges to experience America's natural beauty. They  help to mold the next generation of conservationists and outdoor  enthusiasts by providing learning experiences and cherished memories  for America's families.   Refuges have a tremendous impact for communities all over America,  even in my hometown of Brooklyn. We must remain vigilant in protecting  the breathtaking wildlife and beautiful environment God has given  America. Urban refuges are essential in achieving that goal.                            ____________________
