 Madam President, today we are going to be voting on the  first of what will be many resolutions of disapproval under the  Congressional Review Act to roll back the avalanche of Federal  regulations that the Obama administration placed on the U.S. economy  and, most importantly, the working men and women of this great country.   Nowhere have these regulations been more of a burden than on the  energy industry of America, which employs millions, millions of  Americans--Democrats, Republicans, good, hard-working Americans, and  thousands of hard-working Alaskans, my constituents. So I am  particularly pleased that the first of these actions--and we are going  to be using the Congressional Review Act a lot because the economy and  families in America need relief--in the Senate is to nullify the so- called stream buffer rule of the Department of Interior.   My colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Alaska, Ms.  Murkowski, was down on the floor a little bit about ago. She described  just how sweeping this rule was in scope and how despite the Federal  law called SMACRA, which requires cooperative Federalism, working  closely with the States, the Obama administration did not give the  States any input--certainly not my State.   But what I wanted to talk about on this rule in particular and why it  is so important to have not just Republicans but Democrats--and I am  going to encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  please support this resolution of disapproval--why it so important we  vote for this resolution of disapproval today is because of the coal  miners in America--the coal miners in America, who have been under  incredible strain and their families.   The vote we take today is going to offer them the first signs of  relief in years. Now, there were projections by the Department of  Interior's own contractors--as my colleague, Senator Murkowski,  mentioned a little bit ago--that thousands of coal miners would lose  their jobs because of this rule--thousands.   A study showed that estimates would be one-third of coal miners,  coal-mining jobs in the country were at risk because of this rule. That  is a big deal. That is a big deal. One-third. Studies are showing that  by the Department of Interior's own contractor. But not to worry, the  Obama administration issued the rule anyway. Again, as my colleague  Senator Murkowski mentioned, there were concerns--very legitimate  concerns in my State--that this rule could literally kill every coal- mining job in Alaska, at the Usibelli coal mine in interior Alaska.   So what was the so-called stream buffer rule really about? What was  it? Well, I think we all know. It was the last salvo in the Obama  administration's arsenal in the war on coal miners, a war that has left  thousands of hard-working Americans out of work, injured, in despair in  its wake. That is what happened. Just look at what happened. Look at  our own Federal Government going to war against hard-working Americans.  That is what happened for 8 years--disgraceful in my view.   Now it is time to fight back. Now it is time to fight back. Now it is  time for this body to show coal miners in America that we are actually  on their side and not against them and not trying to ruin them and  their families. I want to recount a recent colloquy by a bunch of my  colleagues from the other side of the aisle from last December--right  before recess.   Many of my colleagues--all of whom I respect highly--on the other  side of the aisle, my Democratic colleagues, came down to the floor.  They were saying how coal miners of America were under siege, how they  needed help. They were talking about my good friend and colleague  Senator Manchin's bill with regard to protecting coal miner pensions,  which, by the way, I am a cosponsor of.   So I agree about protecting our coal miners, but I watched a lot of  those remarks. My colleagues were down on the floor for several hours,  but what I found very ironic was that I looked at a lot of these  Senators and asked: Where were you during this 8-year war against coal  miners? What were you doing? I hate to say it, but a lot of them were  allies in the Obama administration's assault on hard-working families  and coal miners.   I am not saying that about my good friend from West Virginia, Joe  Manchin, but there were a lot who were. Heck, some were even leading  the charge, but, nevertheless, several were down here on the floor  right before the holidays lamenting about what has happened to the coal  miners in America. So to my colleagues who were down here shedding  tears for America's coal miners in December, I want to offer a  challenge to you. Here is your chance. Here is your chance. This is a  rule that our own Federal Government has said will put thousands of  coal miners out of work. If you really care about the coal miners of  America, whether in West Virginia or Alaska, come down on the Senate  floor this afternoon when we have this vote and vote for this  resolution of disapproval, if you want to help the coal miners, if you  want to turn this around so there is no war against them, led by the  Federal Government. Its own studies said: Yep. Sorry. You and your  families are going to be out of work. If you really care like you were  saying in December, then come down to the floor today and vote for this  resolution.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, I want to begin by complimenting my  colleague, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman. He has been the leader  in the U.S. Senate on addressing this issue that literally is impacting  every single one of our States--whether it is Ohio or Alaska or Indiana  where the Presiding Officer is from--and it is a killer.   The opioid epidemic that is happening is something we all have to  work together on, but we have hope, as Senator Portman said. I believe  we have hope because of communities, because of brave Americans like  those he is talking about.   We also have hope because of guys like Rob Portman, and we would be a  lot less further along in this country in turning around this epidemic  and highlighting it for Americans if it weren't for him. I really want  to commend my colleague from Ohio. He has done such a great job and is  so passionate about this issue.                           Tribute to Andrew Kurka    Mr. President, in the last few weeks I have come to the floor to  recognize an exceptional Alaskan--someone who spends time giving back  to our community by sharing their time and talents up north. There are  thousands of these people, of course, in my great State, and I would  love to recognize every single one of them. They do so much for all of  us.   We Senators are not humble about our States. I certainly believe my  State is the most beautiful place in America. It is probably the most  beautiful place in the world. I ask anyone who is watching to come  visit us, you will love it--guaranteed.   It is the people that make my State so special--kind, generous  people, full of rugged determination, full of patriotism, full of  compassion. Many of them are willing to go the extra mile, literally,  in some of the most difficult terrain and extreme conditions of the  world to help friends and neighbors and use their strength and skills  to inspire us all.   I wish to tell you a little bit about Andrew Kurka, an extraordinary  Alaskan from Palmer, which is a beautiful community about 45 miles  outside of Anchorage. In his younger years, Andrew was a wrestler. He  put his heart into it. For his efforts, he was very successful. He was  a six-time Alaska State champion in freestyle and Greco-Roman  wrestling.   When he was 13, he suffered a spinal cord injury in a four-wheeler  accident. His physical therapist urged him to keep going, to keep  trying, to stay active, and actually paid for his first skiing lesson  with a group called Challenge Alaska, a nonprofit Paralympic sports  club.   According to an article in the Alaska Dispatch News, Andrew is  ``willing to give just about anything a try--bodybuilding, water- skiing, ultra-marathon, handcycling.'' He even raced in the Arctic Man  ski and snow machine race in Alaska--a race that is not for the faint  of heart. It is one tough race.   It is in sit skiing where he truly excels. He has been a longtime  member of the U.S. Paralympic team and has won numerous medals. Just  last month, he won three medals, including the Gold for the men's  downhill race at the World Para Alpine Championships in Italy--the Gold  for the whole world.   His accomplishments are amazing enough, but his willingness to serve  and be a role model for others is what makes him a true Alaska  treasure. He is involved in numerous organizations for great causes,  and he travels all across Alaska and the country, visiting with  children with medical problems and urging them to dream big the way he  has.   ``I have spent my life hoping to be an example to others,'' Andrew  said. ``Having the chance and being put in a position where I can make  a difference means the world to me.'' That is Andrew.   For his determination against all odds, for his accomplishments, for  his compassion, and for making the United States and Alaska proud last  month in Italy at the World Para Alpine Championships, Andrew Kurka is  this week's Alaskan of the Week.   Congratulations, Andrew, from all of your supporters. You are a great  inspiration to all of us.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.
