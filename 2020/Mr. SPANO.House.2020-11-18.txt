 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the legacy of  Marine Corporal Ronald R. Payne, Jr., a local hero who proudly served  our country in the U.S. Marine Corps and was killed in combat on May 7,  2004.   Payne graduated from Mulberry High School as a star football and  basketball player.   As a marine, Payne had been part of the initial force that invaded  Iraq and entered Baghdad. He then volunteered to return for a second  overseas tour. He was initially sent to Afghanistan to help with  elections but was then sent into combat.   Corporal Payne will be remembered as the first marine killed serving  in Afghanistan.   He will also be remembered as a man of faith. A late journal entry  reads, ``The fear is starting to turn into excitement. Besides, what do  I have to be afraid of really? I have God on my side, and He said He  will never leave us nor forsake us. Having Him is better than any type  of support or weapon that man can give.''   To his family, our district still mourns Ron's loss. I salute you for  raising such a hero who was also such a servant.                Remembering Staff Sergeant John Allen Reiners     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Staff Sergeant John  Allen Reiners, a local hero from Florida's 15th District who served our  country in the Armed Forces and who was sadly killed in combat in the  Afghan theater.   After participating in Junior ROTC for 4 years and graduating from  Haines City High School, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and then began  with the Army Rangers.   He served at Fort Drum, New York, and Fort Carson, Colorado, and,  during this time, also did two tours in Iraq, where he received his  first Purple Heart.   In 2001, Staff Sergeant Reiners died of wounds sustained when enemy  forces attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device in  Afghanistan's Zhari Province.   He was awarded his second Purple Heart and the Bronze Star Medal  posthumously for his valiant service and dedication to his team.   At home, Reiners was also a devoted husband to Casey and father to  Lex.   To the entire Reiners family, our district and community still mourn  John's loss. He was truly the epitome of a great American soldier, and  his sacrifices will not be forgotten.                  Remembering Specialist Ryan Michael Lumley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and legacy  of Specialist Ryan Lumley, a devoted husband and son who served this  country in the Armed Forces and was killed in combat in Wardak  Province, Afghanistan, on December 3, 2011.   Ryan graduated from Cedar Key High School in 2008, joined the U.S.  Army in 2009, and soon thereafter reported to Fort Bliss in El Paso,  Texas, where he excelled with the 2nd Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment,  3rd Brigade Combat Team.   Unfortunately, at the young age of 21, Ryan lost his life to an  improvised explosive device.   Due to his outstanding service and dedication to our country, Ryan  was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on  Terrorism Service Medal, and several other badges and ribbons.   Ryan is survived by his wife, Kimber, a loving family, and many  hometown friends who remember him fondly for his strong character and  patriotism.   While some time has passed since his departure, may his legacy  continue to uplift his loved ones and encourage a grateful Nation.                  Remembering Sergeant Daniel McKinnon Angus     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Sergeant Daniel  McKinnon Angus, a local hero of Florida's 15th District who was killed  in action in Afghanistan on January 24, 2010.   Daniel graduated from Armwood High School in 2000 and, in 2003,  joined the U.S. Marine Corps, where he knew he belonged and hoped to  make a career of serving his community and his country.   Daniel stood out among his peers and received a Combat Action Ribbon,  two Good Conduct Medals, the Afghanistan and Iraq Campaign Medals, the  Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and a number of service  decorations.   He loved spending time with his wife, Bonnie, and his 1-year-old  daughter, now 11 years old. May she always know and treasure the  knowledge of her father's heroism.   You see, men and women like Daniel, who are willing to lay down their  lives in defense of our country and in support of others many miles  away, are what makes our Nation the greatest on Earth.   Let us never take their sacrifice or that of their surviving families  in vain.                            ____________________
