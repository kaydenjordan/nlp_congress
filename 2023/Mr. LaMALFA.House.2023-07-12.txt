 Madam Speaker, as the country deals with distractions,  the truth of which is very difficult to get out of the White House or  other sources, such as the missing Titanic submarine--when did it  actually implode? We couldn't get the truth on that.   Where is the packet of cocaine that came in the White House? Who is  responsible for that? Why can't they track that with their massive  security systems?   Also, it is silly that males compete in women's sports and are being  allowed in women's places like their locker rooms. These are important  issues in and of themselves, but they distract from some really  important issues that don't get a lot of press or coverage these days.   Madam Speaker, look at the situation with Iran and its development of  nuclear weapons. Iran is a very unstable country and one that is a very  well-known sponsor of terror around the world in many areas. Let's  hearken back a little ways here.   Under the Obama administration, everybody remembers that first pallet  of cash that was flown into Iran of about $400 million, basically of  other currencies because there were still sanctions at the time that we  couldn't send U.S. dollars in there. It was mainly Swiss francs and  euros that were sent in for a total of about $1.7 billion to help  sponsor terror that Iran is so good at.   How are we supposed to ask our partners around the world to continue  sanctions against Iran--whatever is left in place after the JCPOA was  put in in 2015--to help stop the major sponsor of terror in the world?  How are we supposed to continue that?   Indeed, the Biden administration has a plan or an idea of sending $17  billion more over there to help prop up their treasury. What in the  world are we doing that for?   With all the things we need to spend money on in our own country  here, why would we want to help prop up the treasury of the major state  sponsor of terror that Iran is?   JCPOA, agreed to under the Obama administration, has been a complete  failure in trying to limit the amount of uranium that they would be  refining through their centrifuges. Our understanding is that they have  23 times the stockpiles of these uranium materials provided for in the  2015 JCPOA. We are really adhering to that agreement and enforcing that  agreement it sounds like. Yet, we are talking about this administration  sending $17 billion more to help prop up their economy and help them do  more terror activity.   At the point that Iran reaches 90 percent enrichment on its uranium,  Israel is going to have some very important decisions to make because  Israel is already surrounded by a lot of people that don't like them in  the Middle East, including Iran.   If they get the weapons they need and the ability to deliver them,  Israel is going to have some very, very tough decisions to make on  preserving themselves. Israel is not getting much of a good signal  coming from the current administration in the White House that the  United States is going to be there to back them up like they need to  be. What will that force them to do?   Who knows? It will probably force them to do some very extreme  things. I don't blame them. The International Atomic Energy Agency can  verify that they have reached already 83.7 percent of enrichment levels  of a certain amount of stockpile that Iran has. They are not far from  having nuclear-weapon capable materials. When they reach that 90  percent point, that is generally accepted as nuclear bomb ready.   Is Iran a stable enough country that we can trust them with nuclear  bombs?   That was what supposedly the whole JCPOA was about--to keep them from  getting nuclear weapons. This isn't the Iran of old where the United  States at least used to have a relationship with them, and they had a  lot more of a westernized culture with free movement, free activities  for women or for many Iranians. This was pre-1979 when the Ayatollah  was taking over there. It is still a very unstable country and causes  much instability in the world.   The idea of them gaining nuclear weapons very soon, when they reach  that 90 percent mark, puts us all in a pretty perilous position. We are  across an entire ocean from the situation. We are across the Atlantic  and such. Our great ally, Israel, as well as part of Europe, what are  they going to be facing with a nuclear Iran?   We better get serious on not sending them $17 billion or more, but  putting the sanctions back in place that will bring Iran to its knees  and stop this nuclear proliferation and their ability to sponsor  terror.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we know from the Bible, under John 15:13,  the phrase, ``There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for  one's friends,'' which is very applicable to our military willing to  enlist and serve in that way to defend our country.   So, what is the reward? When the COVID farce hit, they were told  initially by the President that we are not going to require injections,  but that turned to: If you don't take this injection for COVID-19, you  are going to be removed from the military.   That is what, indeed, happened to many servicemembers who said: I  don't really wish, in this free country, to take an untested injection.   So, provisions we are making in the NDAA having to do with the COVID- 19 vaccine so-called discharges continue the prohibition on adverse  action for any servicemember that refused to take it but also gives  them a path back to service.   We want to invite them to come back to serve. Recruitments are  actually down during the summer season, but usually there is an uptick  in people coming into the military. We need to do everything we can to  provide an incentive and a welcoming atmosphere to come back to our  military.    We need to treat time away from service for anybody that  had to be kicked out and then reinstated as just a career intermission  so it does not impact their future promotions negatively.    It prohibits the DOD from requiring cadets to repay  tuition if they had to miss a period of time.
