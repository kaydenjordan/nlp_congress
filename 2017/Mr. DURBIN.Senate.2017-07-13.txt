A bill to repeal the Jones Act restrictions on coastwise  trade, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the  Open America's Waters Act of 2017. This bill would repeal the Merchant  Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act, an archaic and  burdensome law that hinders free trade, stifles the economy and  ultimately hurts consumers, largely for the benefit of labor unions. If  this legislation becomes law, U.S. shippers will no longer be required  to patronize market inefficiency but rather, effectively leverage the  global shipping market.   As many of my colleagues know, the Jones Act is one of many of laws  passed over time that addresses port-to-port coastal shipping, drafted  in order to protect the U.S. domestic shipping industry. While the  Jones Act may have had some rationale back in the 1920s when it was  enacted, today it serves only to raise shipping costs, making U.S.  farmers and businesses less competitive in the global marketplace and  increasing costs for American consumers. This protectionist mentality  directly contradicts the lessons our nation has learned about the many  benefits of a free and open market. Repeatedly, it has been proven that  trade liberalization has created  [[Page S4001]]  jobs, expanded economic growth and provided consumers with access to  lower cost goods and services.   The forced purchase of American vessels combined with the immense  cost associated with U.S. shipbuilding has forced U.S. shippers to act  against their best interests to the detriment of their businesses.  While foreign-built coastal-sized ships typically cost between $25-30  million, a U.S.-made ship of the same size can cost anywhere between  $190-250 million. A repeal of the Jones Act, over time, would have  broad impact. According to a 2002 U.S. International Trade Commission  study, repealing the Jones Act would lower shipping costs by about 22  percent. The Commission also found that repealing the Jones Act would  have an annual positive effect of $656 million on the overall U.S.  economy. Though this decade-and-a-half-old study provides some of the  most recent statistics available, it is not hard to imagine the modern  affect that maritime deregulation would contribute to this industry.   Congress must take action to repeal laws that have outlived their  usefulness and are no longer relevant to modern commerce. It is  unacceptable that millions of dollars in the U.S. economy are lost  every year to an antiquated policy, and unacceptable that this body is  unable to disengage from special interests in order to participate in a  productive debate on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to reflect  on our responsibility as lawmakers and see the Jones Act for what it  really is: an outdated and protectionist policy that only serves to  harm the American economy and consumer.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
