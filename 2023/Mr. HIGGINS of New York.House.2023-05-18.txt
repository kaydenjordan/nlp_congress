 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize today's  guest chaplain, my friend, Pastor Craig Pridgen.   Pastor Pridgen serves as the senior servant at True Bethel Baptist  Church in Niagara Falls.   Through his ministry and community service, he is an energetic and  effective advocate for those who have none, who have been doubted,  underappreciated, and forgotten.   Buffalo born and raised, Pastor Pridgen has led efforts to promote  opportunity through a church-led workforce program, as well as  understanding and equality through his position on the board of the  National Federation of Just Communities.   He has also supported community-building and wellness initiatives as  president of the Niagara Falls Ministerial Council and a senior adviser  for Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo.   We are grateful to have Pastor Craig Pridgen in the House Chamber for  today's opening prayer, and so very fortunate to have him leading by  example in all of western New York.                            ____________________
