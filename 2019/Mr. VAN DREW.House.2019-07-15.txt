 Mr. Speaker, 18 years ago, Isabelle Mosca's son was  diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. At the time, she was struck by  how little information and support was available for families affected  by ASD, so Isabelle began a support group for a few parents to meet  over coffee and talk.   Eventually, Isabelle's meeting grew into a nonprofit organization  called FACES 4 Autism, which helps over 750 families with five active  and expanding support groups throughout South Jersey.   In addition to these support groups, Isabelle created a program  called Massi's Mission, which focuses on water safety and survival for  those with ASD.   Now that her son is close to 21 years old, Isabelle is exploring  employment opportunities for him and all of the FACES' participants.  They are aging out of their schools.   She never stops thinking, planning, and creating opportunities to  make our community of South Jersey be the best that it can be.   Mr. Speaker, Isabelle's community thanks her every day for everything  she does. South Jersey thanks her every day for all that she does. She  is the best.                            ____________________
