 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res.  798.   On October 7, Hamas carried out the largest attack on the Jewish  people since the Holocaust. Women were brutally raped and murdered;  babies brutally murdered and decapitated; and innocent civilians  abducted, tortured, and murdered.   In the aftermath, we have seen despicable acts of anti-Semitism and  support for the terrorists across college campuses in this country.  Students organized protests calling for ``armed confrontation with  oppressors'' and using imagery reflecting the Hamas terrorists  paragliding into the music festival in Israel. There are vile chants  calling for the elimination of Jewish people in the State of Israel.  There are professors asking Jewish students to identify themselves and  stand in the corner of a classroom. There are projections on a campus  building saying, ``Glory to our martyrs,'' referring to the Hamas  terrorists.                                time  1600    These are despicable actions, and they have created a hostile  environment for many Jewish students across our country. This is wholly  unacceptable, and this is not free speech.   Jewish students deserve to know they are safe on campus, and colleges  and universities have a legal and moral obligation to foster an  environment free from vile anti-Semitic discrimination.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution.
