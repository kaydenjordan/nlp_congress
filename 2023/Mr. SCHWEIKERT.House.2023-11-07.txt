 Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck), I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, as a traditional courtesy, I am offering  this for Mr. Buck, who has been very kind to us.   This is an amendment I think we have all seen versions of. It is  structurally very simple. It moves the appropriation amount back to the  2019 fiscal year.   You all know the reasons. We have all had this discussion and debate  here. It is before the pandemic plus-ups, reaching back to a year where  the economy was good and the mechanics were good. Apparently the agency  seemed to be able to do its work. Here we are a couple fiscal years  later, but we keep plugging back in the plus-ups that were supposed to  be the pandemic emergency. This actually rolls it back to 2019.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the appropriations process. I  have some sense of how difficult it has been for both sides.   This is the 2019 fiscal budget. Was that really, really that  difficult, that draconian?   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this is one of those amendments I just  felt I needed to make a point here. It is a brutal amendment, but we  did some calculations.   Fifty-seven percent of this appropriation within this piece of this  budget goes to entities that have their own taxing authority.   Why do we care about that?   Do you realize every dime we are appropriating here, every dime we  get to vote on, lives on borrowed money? We borrow every dime of  defense and every dime of discretionary if you look at the 2023 budget.  It looks like we are going to do the same thing in the 2024 that we are  working on right now. We borrowed $300 billion to $400 billion of  functionally what is Medicare.   I know that no one really wants to go near this because it is  radioactive and uncomfortable, but it is math. This is from a couple  hours ago, Bloomberg's headline, Bloomberg Analytics. It is behind the  paywall, so if you have a Bloomberg terminal, go look it up, ``U.S.  Debt Interest Bill Rockets Past a Cool $1 Trillion a Year.'' They are  estimating that our interest bill for this fiscal year, total gross  interest, is $1 trillion.                                time  1700    Stop and think about that. That means Social Security is the number  one spend, interest just became number two, Medicare just became number  three, and defense is now number four. These are numbers we were not  supposed to hit for a decade. It is here.   Sometimes I feel like an absolute idiot because I come behind this  microphone--and I have done this for years--and we walk through numbers  like this. People just stare at you and say, well, that is not  interesting, that is math. The math will always win.   Our amendment here is tough, but it makes a point. Is it moral, is it  ethical, is it rational to borrow money and give it to entities that  have their own taxing authority?   Trust me, I have been the treasurer of the fourth most populous  county in the United States. I know how hard it is to be the tax  collector. I was the tax collector in Maricopa County. It makes you  really popular when that is your title.   Understand what we are doing here. We are going to borrow money to  send it to entities that ultimately do have the ability to raise the  receipts and revenues.   The last comment I will make on this for my brothers and sisters on  the left, how often do they scream at us: We should raise revenues.  Okay. Guess what? Talk to your locals. Let them raise the revenues.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I actually give the ranking member  kudos for being intellectually honest. That is actually part of my  point. The numbers now are brutally uglier than even Simpson-Bowles.   It is one of the things we don't like to say because it doesn't look  good on a campaign brochure, but functionally every dime of future debt  from today into the future is actually demographics. It is healthcare.  In 9 years, do we backfill Social Security?   It is intellectually honest to say: We are borrowing every dime we  get to vote on as Members of Congress. I keep wanting to say that over  and over and over. Every dime of military, every dime of nondefense  discretionary is now borrowed, plus, probably my math is about $4  billion to $5 billion of mandatory. Now we will live on borrowed money.   Until that starts to hit our intellectual lexicon of what we say and  how we think, it makes it very hard to try to  [[Page H5510]]  make the argument that if we don't step up and do this, the bond market  is going to do it for us.   Remember, we borrowed 8.4 percent of GDP last year. To my brothers  and sisters who say the solution is often to raise taxes on the  wealthy, the best model says that we can only get about 1\1/2\ percent  of GDP by maximizing every tax on $400,000 and up.   Mr. Chairman, 1\1/2\ percent isn't anywhere close when you just  borrowed 8.4 percent.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
