 Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and  friend, my colleague from the Rules Committee, the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Ross).   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the rule in favor of the  ALLIES Act.   This bill would protect our Afghan partners who risked their lives as  translators and navigators to U.S. military personnel by expediting the  Afghan Special Immigrant Visa process and approving an additional 8,000  visas so that they can come to America as soon as possible.   The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan has placed thousands  of these allies and their families at risk of retribution.   If not for the contributions of these Afghan partners, the United  States military losses could have been greater than already endured  during this prolonged conflict.   For 20 years, their courage and sacrifice protected our troops, and  they were an invaluable asset to our forces in Afghanistan. We have a  duty to ensure both they and their families are safe from retaliation  from the Taliban and other terrorist organizations.   In my district of Rochester, New York, my office hears multiple times  per week from SIV advocates, like Keeping Our Promise and the  Association of Wartime Allies. The stories they share are  heartbreaking: brave men and women stuck in bureaucratic limbo, waiting  for the visas they were promised so they can start a new life in  America.   We need to pass this bill and honor the promise we made to our  allies. If we leave these people behind, who will ever be willing to  assist U.S. forces around the world, knowing that we lacked the moral  resolve to protect our allies?   That is not what we stand for. The United States leads from the  front. Now is the time to take charge of the situation and ensure we  keep our promise and leave no one behind.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and pass H.R.  3985.
