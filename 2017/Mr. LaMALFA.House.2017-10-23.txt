 Mr. Speaker, California, northern California, where I am  from, has been suffering, as so many people know, from devastating  fires these last few weeks. I think it is very appropriate to point out  the incredible efforts of our first responders and our firefighters in  saving so much valuable property and the lives that have been saved, as  well as citizens pulling together to help each other.   We see the best in Americans during these times of crisis, and that  has not gone unnoticed in northern California as well. Our hearts are  with those folks who have suffered losses and more loss of life than  could be imagined in modern-day America with all the firefighting  apparatus and prevention we have. Still, it shows you have to have  preparedness; you have to have defensible space; and you have to be  ready, at any given time, during this type of fire season.   Again, our hats are off to our first responders and our firefighters  for the amount of property and lives they have been able to save under  these conditions. God bless them.                            ____________________
