 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise Sergeant Steven Rhodes  for his dedication to public safety in my district.   Sergeant Rhodes is a 20-year veteran of the Bayonne Police Department  in Bayonne, New Jersey. He has worked in the Patrol Division, Community  Oriented Policing Unit, Detective Bureau, and the Juvenile Aid Bureau.  He has earned a Departmental Valor Award, six commendations, four  Excellent Police Service Awards, and two Meritorious Police Service  Awards.   Yesterday, he was presented the 2019 Freedom Fund Award by the  Bayonne branch of the NAACP. He has earned this award as much as all of  the others, and I am proud to call him a resident of the 10th  Congressional District.   He has continued to look out for his community through law  enforcement, but with a community edge, and that is what we need in our  communities.                            ____________________
