 Mr. President, I wish to honor and recognize a  true hero from Phillipsburg, KS, Deputy Sheriff John Miner. On November  4, 2020, Deputy Miner responded to an accident caused by a semi-truck  colliding with multiple vehicles in Long Island, KS. What was already a  scary situation on its own turned worse when fuel from the semi began  leaking and ignited shortly after.   A raging fire quickly started, and suddenly, bystanders realized two  toddlers--a 4-year-old and 2-year-old--were stuck in one of the cars  caught in the accident. Without a second thought, Deputy Miner  performed his duty to protect and serve by leaping straight into the  whipping fire to rescue those two children. With just a pocketknife, he  was able to cut through the seatbelts trapping them and pulled them out  miraculously unharmed. Deputy Miner, however, suffered second- and  third-degree burns which required skin grafts. Thankfully, he has since  recovered from his injuries.   This valiant story caught the attention of many in Kansas and, now,  around the Nation, as Deputy Miner has been awarded the Carnegie medal  for an extraordinary act of heroism. This award is bestowed on a select  few each year for showing true bravery and courage in the face of  danger. Deputy Miner is absolutely deserving of this award after  rescuing those two children last year from certain death.   I want to thank this brave officer for being so courageous to dive  headfirst into peril. As the son of a police chief, I know the risks  our men and women in blue take on each day, and they are the most  admirable citizens for continually working to ensure our safety. Deputy  Miner has shown what true valor looks like, and Phillipsburg is safer  because of him. I ask now that my colleagues show this same admiration  and recognition for Deputy Miner and that he may stay safe protecting  his community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following interns in my office be granted floor privileges until  October 21, 2021: Dominique Rupp, Mason Witzke, and Francis Prosser.    Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today with a  warning for Kansans and all Americans that the inflation we are seeing,  Bidenflation, as I call it, is here to stay so long as those on the  left continue to jam through reckless tax-and-spend bills.   Unfortunately, the inflation we are seeing is a double whammy. You  have less money to spend, and the things you want to buy cost more. It  is hurting every hard-working American but none more than our seniors  and young families living paycheck to paycheck. No, President Biden,  inflation is not a problem of just the high class. Indeed, there is no  equity in Bidenflation.   Make no mistake, inflation and all of its lingering effects rest  squarely on the shoulders of President Biden's failed social policies.  It is yet another crisis created by this administration.   Having personally lived through the seventies and eighties, I have  seen inflation happen firsthand. I have seen it bring so many  businesses down. And to put it in simpler terms, inflation is a vicious  cycle, like a dog chasing its own tail and the tail is on fire. And, of  course, the Biden administration has been throwing gasoline on this  fire since the moment they took office.   Today's inflation crisis began with Joe Biden's boondoggle stimulus  bill and the proceeding labor shortages. For months now, we are seeing  ``Help Wanted'' signs everywhere, from the small mom-and-pop shops on  Main Street to big hotel chains and fast-food restaurants. Employers  are struggling to fill the open jobs they have despite raising wages  and offering return-to-work bonuses.   This labor shortage is having a rippling effect across our economy,  from slowing down the supply and logistics chains to putting an unfair  burden on employees who choose to show up. This ripple has turned into  a tidal wave of inflation and now a full-blown tsunami.   But the storm waves don't stop there. The cost of living has  increased as a result of production delays caused by labor shortages.  Higher costs at home, such as the cost of gasoline, vehicles,  groceries, and energy costs caused workers to go on strike asking for  higher wages just to make ends meet.   Folks, I have got news for you: Wages never keep up with inflation.  All this, in turn, drives up the cost of goods and services even more.  You get the point.  [[Page S7134]]  Inflation is a vicious cycle. This is the dog chasing its own tail.   But Bidenflation doesn't stop there now. Why? Because President Biden  is throwing more gasoline on the fire with his unconstitutional vaccine  mandate. I, too, have seen this firsthand. Just last week, I was in  Kansas to meet with union members who are facing the difficult choice  of keeping their jobs or getting the COVID vaccine.   These folks aren't just mad; they are panicked. And it is literally  job or jab for them. In fact, the unions I spoke with estimate they  will lose 30 to 50 percent of their workforce due to Joe Biden's  vaccine mandate. This will make both our supply chain shortages as well  as inflation even worse.   Mr. President, while I support the COVID vaccine and encourage folks  to talk to their doctor about whether to get it, there is no doubt that  President Biden's vaccination decree is an all-out assault on our  private businesses, our civil liberties, and our entire constitutional  system of limited government.   And it is a slap in the face to so many people who stood on the  frontlines of the COVID battle last year and never stopped working:  nurses, doctors, first responders, and those union workers I met with  last week. Trust me, I have heard loud and clear these few weeks from  Kansans about what they want, and it is not an unconstitutional vaccine  mandate. It is not the socialism that is born out of trillions of  dollars' worth of spending and taxing that has led to reckless  inflation, hampered our economy, and killed our jobs.   The question is, Do Americans want Big Government socialism or do we  want economic freedom and prosperity? Kansans agree that if you want  strong roads, bridges, high-speed internet, good schools, and a strong  military, we need a strong economy. That should be our focus right now,  not continuing down this administration's socialist economic policies.   Pre-COVID, we had the greatest economy in my lifetime. That came  about because we lowered people's taxes; we lowered regulations; and we  lowered energy prices. We need smart, targeted investments, not radical  spending that leaves the country at a disadvantage.   Unfortunately, in the meantime, everyone better buckle up and grab  your wallets. Bidenflation is here to stay as long as this  administration continues its reckless taxing, reckless borrowing, and  reckless spending agenda.                            ____________________     Mr. President, before I wrap up, I want to voice my  support for Kansas City's bid to serve as host city for the 2026 FIFA  World Cup prior to tomorrow's highly anticipated venue visit by FIFA  representatives.   Kansas is home to some of the most devoted, fanatic soccer fans in  the world that are ready to cheer on Team USA, and what better place to  do it than in America's heartland. The Kansas City community, alongside  Sporting KC, has shown unwavering commitment to make this dream a  reality, and Kansas City is no stranger to hosting major sporting  events, from the Big 12 Men's Basketball Conference Championships, NCAA  March Madness, and plans to host the NFL Football Draft in 2023.   We have great, fan-friendly facilities and something for everyone in  the family to do. We have the lodging, public transportation, shopping  and dining options needed to make the 2026 World Cup a great success.  The FIFA World Cup is the largest and most prestigious single-sport  event in the world, and there is no better place for it to be held than  Kansas City.   Thank you.   I yield back.
