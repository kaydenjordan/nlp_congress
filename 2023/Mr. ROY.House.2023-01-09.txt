 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for  yielding.   I am delighted to be down here on the floor of the House of  Representatives in a Republican majority, and I am delighted to be  talking about a rules package crafted by that Republican majority and  that reflects what I think is a fundamental transformation of this  House to ensure that the people can be represented by their  Representatives. That is the point.   There is a reason that I have had great conversations with some of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle about why having 72 hours to  read a bill, or why having a bill that isn't littered with Christmas  tree additional subjects rather than single subjects, as my friend from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith) articulated so well, or whether having germane  amendments and being able to open up the floor by virtue of changing  the rules or restoring the Holman rule so we can have an impact on  agencies that are out of control and not responding to the people's  House, there is a reason why those rules are so fundamentally  important: to restore this body and to restore the people's House.   That is why we are here. Everybody keeps running around in classic  swamp speak talking about secret deals, a secret addendum.   What we are talking about is how people come to an agreement in this  town to ensure that we are going to carry out what we have said we are  going to do.   The rules package is on full display. The rules package has been on  full display and publicly available since Friday or earlier last week.   The text of that rules package has been something we can look at. My  friends are right. A good chunk of that text is the agreement reached a  while back, a couple of weeks ago, 1 week or 2 weeks ago, with one  significant change: the single-person motion to vacate which is in the  spirit of that which goes all the way back to Jefferson. In fact, we  are currently now operating not under any rules. That is why we are  having a debate. We are about to debate on adopting the rules.   I can walk down right there into the well and file a motion to vacate  a single person right now because that is the precedent. That is what  we are operating under, because that goes back to Jefferson.   The whole point here is trying to ensure that we are continuing the  great history of the people's House.   Yes, we have had conversations and agreements as individuals are  supposed to do, looking each other in the eye and saying that we are  going to bring balanced budgets to the floor of the House.   You bet that we have agreements that we are going to do that. You bet  we have had agreements that we are going to bring the Texas border plan  to make sure that we secure the border rather than perpetuating the  fraud that the President of the United States continues to perpetuate  endangering the American people. You bet that we are bringing forward a  promise to have legislation that will set term limits because the  American people are tired of a House that doesn't represent them. You  bet that we have got agreements to do those things.   You bet that we have been talking about making sure that we can bring  amendments to the floor of this House--open debate amendments on  appropriations bills--that that was a part of the package that we were  talking about; and you bet that a part of our agreement was ensuring  that a Church-style committee under the leadership of my good friend,  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan) of the Judiciary Committee, will  target weaponization of government against the American people. You bet  that those agreements were reached.    I will not back away from that or shy away from it.   But this rules package is a rules package that reflects this body and  the entirety of the Republican Party on making sure that we restore the  people's House.   We are united to do that. We are coming out of last week strong and  united to make sure that we stand up for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage everybody to vote for this rules package.    Mr. Speaker, I guess the President of the United States was  able to find the southern border on a map.   It took him 2 years to finally get down to the southern border, and  what happens?   Everybody just goes around and cleans up everything that is going on  in El Paso.   Let me tell you something: The people of Texas know the truth. In  Texas we are dealing every single day with 6,000, 7,000, or 8,000  people crossing the border every day.   Now, with a House majority, we have got the will and we have got the  power to do something about it. It is time we do something because the  people of Texas are taking the brunt every single day.   There are still migrants that are being sold into the sex trafficking  trade. There are still Americans who are dying from fentanyl  poisonings.   No camera presence down in El Paso, no going down there for a show  trip is going change the fact that Texans are struggling.   It is time right now for the House majority to do our job. We are  going to have to stop funding a Department of Homeland Security that  refuses to secure the border of the United States. We are going to do  that this year.                                time  2140                               ADJOURNMENT
