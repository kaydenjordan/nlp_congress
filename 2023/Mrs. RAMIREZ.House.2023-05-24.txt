 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I know that many of our folks back home have been seeing  or hearing the news nonstop about the debt ceiling and how much the  health of our economy is counting on getting to a resolution.   Well, it is May 24 at 6:59 p.m., and because of Republicans, we don't  have a deal because they refuse to put people over politics.   Republicans have made this all about political games. Quite frankly,  it seems like they are happier to play under the guise of bipartisan  negotiating to cut government spending, but there are real-life  repercussions to the theater.   Let me be absolutely clear. Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his extreme  MAGA Republicans aren't going to be the ones who aren't able to afford  housing or keep food on the table if they get their way on massive cuts  to essential domestic programs.   It is actually going to be everyday people across the country,  including in the Third Congressional District of Illinois, which sent  me to Congress to protect them from these cruel Republican cuts and an  attack on our economy with bad deals.   It is going to be everyday people like Estela, a constituent of mine.  Estela arrived in Chicago 13 years ago from  [[Page H2589]]  Guatemala, fleeing life-threatening violence and seeking security.   Since then, she has called Chicago home and has dedicated her time to  ensure that others can also call it home, providing key information to  protect renters' rights.   Like many of the families that she helps and like many of our  constituents on both sides of the aisle, Estela's family depended on  Federal housing funding to keep her home during the pandemic.   Now, as the cost of living keeps rising, she finds herself  confronting the same exact problem as many other families: How do we  pay rent? How to keep a place to live?   She says, ``It is very difficult to see so many people be displaced  from their homes because of the rising costs of rent. The cost of  living is a problem that is affecting many families like mine. I have  four children, and it is very difficult to afford extremely high rent  and also afford our other necessities.''   Now, you see, part of what makes Estela's experience so powerful is  that this is the experience of so many everyday people.   People are already struggling. They are already trying to spread  their paycheck for enough to cover the mortgage, the rent, feeding  their children, utilities, the essential basics we all need and  deserve.   Estela's story of struggling with housing costs while still working  to help others in her community keeps me rooted in why we do everything  in our power to protect our constituents from the Republican-made debt  limit crisis.   What Republicans are doing right now is reckless, and it is  irresponsible, and it is all to guarantee their ability to try to win  politically in 2024.   They are willing to gamble with working people's livelihoods and the  global economy. Republicans would rather default on the debt than come  to an agreement that protects critical investments in our community  across Social Security, SNAP benefits, veteran healthcare, housing,  Medicaid, and more.   Republicans want to stick it to working people to bear the burden of  terrible cuts instead of making billionaires and big corporations pay  their fair share.   The question for me continues to be why?   Why is it that they are far more interested in protecting  billionaires and corporations than the constituents they represent?   The Republican Party has a Republican-made problem, and Progressives  are clear. We are not going to sell out our communities for a bad deal.   Tonight, I will be joined by fellow Progressive colleagues who will  share stories from their own constituents because we have too much at  stake to give in to cruel Republican demands.   I am pleased to yield to my colleagues who will share their personal  testimonies from their own constituents and why we need to protect our  communities from Republican cuts and bad deals.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, (Mr. Deluzio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Goldman).  [[Page H2590]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressmen Goldman and Deluzio  for the work they are doing in their districts, the work that they do  here in Congress, and for their commitment to our country, to our  communities before the politics that we are seeing before us today.   I keep hearing Speaker McCarthy say in one of his many interviews he  does a day--he spends a lot more time, I think, on interviews than  actually negotiating or working with us. I hear: We don't want an  increase to the debt limit.   Well, let me break down what Republicans want. Republicans insist  that we spend less, but that actually equates into spending less on  public housing, on food assistance, on Medicaid, on other fundamental  programs like veterans' healthcare, like supporting our kids, our  families, our communities.   There are no cuts to the multibillion-dollar defense weapons  contractors, though. However, everyday constituents that sent us here,  they should get those cuts.   The Republicans' framework imposes drastic cuts that would result in  a 33 percent cut in 2024 to what I said, like housing, healthcare,  education, and so much more. They would put 780,000 people out of work  and cost more than 1 million jobs.                                time  1915    It would strip up to 21 million Americans of Medicaid coverage.   It would deny access to affordable college to 60,000 people.   It would kick 200,000 children off of Head Start.   It would force 100,000 families to lose access to childcare.   It would rob 1.2 million women, infants, and children of nutrition  assistance.   It would remove rental assistance from 640,000 families and evict  430,000 more from public housing.   Republicans are willing to put the lives and livelihoods of the  American people at risk. This is not just counterproductive; it is  cruel.   This plan would pull hundreds of billions of dollars out of the  economy, and it could contribute to a recession, increasing the deficit  that they so desperately want to address--or it is what they say.   These are the choices that they are presenting: Default on America or  a debt ceiling increase under their terms. That is it.   Here is the thing: The American people know that those are not the  only options. Those two are not the only two choices. There are other  choices, from making the wealthy pay their fair share to getting a  discharge petition to the floor with the help of just one, two, three,  four, five sensible, reasonable Republicans. That is it. Five  Republicans. They could be from New York; they could be from  California; they could be from Texas. Five people from the other side  of the aisle could end this hostage experience of the American people  and stop punishing their own constituents by signing onto the discharge  petition or we can utilize the 14th Amendment.   From day one, progressives have been the most responsible and loudest  voices in defending working families from Republican extreme behavior.  That is why the CPC publicly called for raising the debt ceiling last  fall. That is why CPC members were the first to sign the discharge  petition to force a vote on the clean debt ceiling, and it is why we  will continue to call out Republican games and hostage-taking.   That is why we convened this Special Order hour for the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, and I thank my colleagues who have joined me today  and many others who are wrapped up in picking up calls from  constituents who are calling and asking, what does this mean for my  healthcare come June 1? What does this mean for my ability to get  nutritional benefits come June 2?   In conclusion, the looming debt ceiling crisis has been significantly  exacerbated by the Republicans' approach and their steadfast commitment  to place party politics above the well-being of everyday people across  our Nation.   As the June 1 deadline rapidly approaches, we all must recognize the  gravity of the situation, and we have to demand immediate action that  protects people over politics. The Republicans are holding the  livelihood of Americans as prisoners.   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the  Republicans' default on America act would cost States and local  communities an astonishing $1.3 trillion. This would be disastrous for  food access, for housing support, and for the overall well-being of our  society.   I am profoundly grateful and humbled by the courage of constituents  of mine, such as Rachel from Mount Prospect, Illinois, who took the  time to reach out and express her concerns, reaffirming my commitment  to effectively representing their best interests in this negotiation.   Rachel shared: ``I am really worried about the debt ceiling increase  not being passed, or if it is passed that Democrats will have to give  in to extortion and agree to cut Medicaid, veteran programs, and  climate provisions.   ``Congresswoman, please do not let Democrats and President Biden cave  to House Republican extortion on the debt limit.   ``If Democrats betray us by doing so, Republicans will simply do this  every single time. Don't give in. Please vote only for a clean debt  ceiling.''   I say thank you to Rachel. Our shared call to action is clear. It is  about 7:20 p.m. For my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if  they are watching, hearing, complaining about me talking about  essential programs that might be cut, if you are hearing from your  constituents who are just saying to you: We are tired of Washington  politics, do your job.   Well, I invite you to do your job, to join us, to actually negotiate  and compromise to make sure that the American people are our priority,  and not just politics of who can get over the other or a Congressman  from Florida talking about you don't negotiate with a hostage.  [[Page H2591]]    The American people refuse to be hostages of politics in this country  anymore, and this is why I call every one of my colleagues: Have the  courage, have the ability, and put your constituents above the  politics. Join us. All we need is five of you.   Let's be reasonable. Let's refuse to play into extremism. Let's put  people over politics. Sign the discharge petition. All we need is five  more patriots. Who will these courageous patriots be? Who will these  servants be? That is the question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
