 Mr. Speaker, in the early morning hours of August 5, five  Senegalese immigrants, including an infant and a toddler, died in an  arson fire in their Denver home. The victims deserve to be recognized.   Djibril Diol, who was 30 years old, immigrated to the United States  from Senegal 10 years ago to make a better life for himself and his  family. He graduated from Colorado State University with a degree in  civil engineering and was an outstanding student with a bright future  ahead of him.   He was well loved by his family and friends. His brother described  him as ``a good person, a good worker, and a good Muslim.'' A coworker  said that Djibril ``was a way better man than I will ever be.''   Djibril's wife, Adja, and 2-year-old daughter, Khadija, also died in  the fire, as did Coumba Diol Hassan, Djibril's sister, and Hawa Beye,  her 10-month-old son.   We don't know what motivated this attack, but it has deeply shaken  our African immigrant community and left them feeling unsafe. While  this was a tragic incident, and we mourn for the family, I want to  emphasize the strength and resilience of our African immigrant  community.   As a case in point, the African Leadership Group, ALG, a local  nonprofit that provides a wide variety of vital services to our  immigrant neighbors, has consoled and supported the Diol family and  kept pressure on law enforcement to solve this horrific crime. Led by  Papa Dia, who is a native of Senegal himself, I thank them for their  service.                       Recognizing Stanley Marketplace     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  accomplishments of Stanley Marketplace, a community-focused urban  market in Aurora, Colorado.   Located in northwest Aurora on the border of Denver's Central Park  neighborhood, Stanley Marketplace is a community of businesses and  people who believe in doing things differently--sustainably,  creatively, and with more than the bottom line in mind.   The marketplace's 22-acre site was once the site of the Stanley  Aviation factory. It is now a community gathering place, home to 50  independently owned Colorado businesses.   Today, the same innovative spirit that once filled Stanley's building  has been harnessed to offer our community an urban marketplace  featuring goods and services from local independent businesses.   The property includes a 30,000-square-foot sustainable greenhouse and  an urban farm. Under construction is an inclusive playground where  children of all abilities can play.

Stanley Marketplace is guided by a document they call the Stanifesto,  which includes these lines:         We believe the best rules are simple and clear: Love your       neighbor. Leave each place better than you found it. Be good       and do good.    I congratulate the Stanley team on their ongoing work to support our  neighbors and locally owned small businesses.       Honoring the Tireless Workers in Colorado During the 2020 Census     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  accomplishments of organizations in my district that have worked  tirelessly to promote and ensure their communities are counted in the  2020 Census.   With over 800,000 citizens and 160 languages spoken in my district,  making sure that every single resident is counted is difficult work.  With the help of many hardworking organizations, Colorado's Sixth  District has a self-response rate of 76.5 percent, surpassing its 2010  rate and surpassing the State average of 69.5 percent. In fact, it  holds the highest response rate of any Colorado congressional district.   I would particularly like to acknowledge the following 11  organizations for their help in spreading awareness: Together We Count,  the Asian Pacific Development Center, the Oromo Community of Colorado,  The ARC of Aurora, the Aurora Economic Opportunity Coalition, the  Mosaic Church of Aurora, the African Chamber of Commerce in Colorado,  the Village Exchange Center, the City of Aurora, Arapahoe County, and  Mi Pueblo Market.   These organizations truly make a difference in my district for their  tireless work in the 2020 Census.                    Honoring Mary Hodge on Her Retirement     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  accomplishments of Mrs. Mary Hodge, a former State legislator and  current Adams County commissioner, and congratulate her on her upcoming  retirement.   Commissioner Hodge is a Colorado native, who has dedicated her career  to making an impact in her home State. Mary, among many things, is a  former State representative in the Sixth District of Colorado and a  county commissioner. Mary has also taught first grade in Greeley and  preschool in Glenwood Springs.   Mary went on to own and operate a motel in Wyoming and worked for  several businesses. Her public service began in 2000, when she was  elected as a Colorado State representative.   As a servant leader, Commissioner Hodge is a tireless champion for  education and small businesses. I commend Mary for her support for the  Colorado Air and Space Port. Her steadfast advocacy was integral in  bringing that project to fruition.   Commissioner Hodge's diverse professional background and leadership  experience has benefited our community for many years.   I congratulate Commissioner Mary Hodge on her retirement and thank  her for her service to our community and to Adams County.                            ____________________
