 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                      Korea-AGM-114R Hellfire Missiles         The Republic of Korea (ROK) has requested to buy two       hundred eighty-eight (288) AGM-114R Hellfire missiles. Also       included are AGM-114R spare parts; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support       services; repair and return; storage; and other related       elements of logistical and program support. The estimated       total cost is $36 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by meeting       the legitimate security and defense needs of one of the       closest allies in the INDOPACOM Theater. The ROK is one of       the major political and economic powers in East Asia and the       Western Pacific and a key partner of the United States in       ensuring peace and stability in that region. It is vital to       U.S. national interests to assist the ROK in developing and       maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability.        The ROK intends to use these Hellfire missiles to       supplement its existing missile capability and current weapon       inventory for its AH-64E aircraft. The proposed sale will       improve the ROK's capability to meet current and future       threats and ensure interoperability with other AGM-114R       Hellfire missile users in the region. The Republic of Korea       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Orlando, FL. The purchaser typically requests       offsets. Any offset agreements will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the Republic of Korea.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 21-31       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AGM-114R is used against heavy and light armored       targets, thin skinned vehicles, urban structures, bunkers,       caves and personnel. The missile is Inertial Measurement Unit       (IMU) based, with a variable delay fuse, improved safety and       reliability.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware or software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the Republic of Korea       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of       the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives       outlined in the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Republic of Korea.                            ____________________
