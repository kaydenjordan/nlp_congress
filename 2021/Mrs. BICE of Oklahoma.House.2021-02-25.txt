 Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank  Representative Cammack for bringing this idea of honoring our hometown  heroes to the floor. It is long overdue.   There are so many who have made an impact in our communities over the  last year. When I think of the countless hours our healthcare workers  have dedicated, their time spent away from family to take care of  others, the doctors, nurses, and first responders, we can never fully  thank them for their dedication to our country during this difficult  time.   But as my team and I discussed who from Oklahoma's Fifth District has  helped this community survive the pandemic, who worked on the ground  with people in need, one name was mentioned over and over, and that was  Pastor Derrick Scobey of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Oklahoma City.   He and his band of volunteers have worked countless hours to make  sure Oklahomans everywhere were fed, not just in the surrounding  community but in towns and cities across the great State of Oklahoma.  In partnership with the World Vision Organization, Pastor Scobey  distributed more than 91,000 boxes of fresh food in the past year. That  is 2.3 million pounds of food hand-delivered by Ebenezer Baptist Church  and his countless volunteers throughout the State.                                time  2030    My team and I had the pleasure of assisting Pastor Scobey with a few  of his distribution events in Oklahoma City. I was overwhelmed with the  gratitude on the faces of those who were receiving these food boxes.   This man right here is truly making a difference to those in need. He  has been on the ground day in and day out making sure that more than  150,000 Oklahomans did not go hungry during this pandemic.   In addition to food, he made sure that those needing furnishings did  not go without. His group distributed 2,300 pallets of furniture to the  underserved as well. It is a monumental task that Pastor Scobey took  on, but he saw the need in his community. He heard from pastors and  communities from across the State with similar needs, rolled up his  sleeves, and he got to work.   This Nation needs more pastors like Derrick Scobey, who aren't afraid  of the hard work of feeding our communities not just with the word of  God on Sunday morning, but with hours of heavy lifting, sweating in the  heat of the summer, or trying to stay warm in the subzero temperatures,  all to make sure those who were hungry have something to eat.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Pastor Scobey for being a hero to Oklahomans  from every corner of the great State of Oklahoma.
