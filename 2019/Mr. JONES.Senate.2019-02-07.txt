 Mr. President, first, I would like to thank my colleague  from Wyoming for his work today and for his work on this very, very  important issue of chronic wasting disease and prevention. This is an  issue of great importance not only to Alabama but to 26 other States-- from Wyoming to Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. This is an issue  which, if we fail to act, will result in an environmental and economic  crisis.   Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, is truly a terrible, contagious  neurological illness that affects all deer, elk, and moose populations  nationwide. It is a disease that is as bad as it sounds. It functions  much like mad cow disease.   Senator Barrasso gave all of the scientific words. He has a little  bit more training in that than I do. So I will just call it what it  is--mad cow disease and neurological disorders.   It attacks an animal's nervous system and, over time, renders the  animal weak and emaciated, with little control over its body. The  disease has a fatality rate of 100 percent. Every single animal that  contracts this disease dies. It is highly communicable, spreading not  only through physical contact but also through contaminated  environments where infected animals have been.   The jury is still out on whether chronic wasting disease may be  transmitted to humans, but the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention recommend against consuming animals contaminated with the  disease. In 2017, a Canadian study documented transmission through  consumption of contaminated meat to a nonhuman primate. Clearly, this  is something to be very concerned and cautious about because of the  clear and concrete evidence that it could be transmitted to humans.   The fact is, the disease is spreading, and it is spreading fast. Even  if it does not pose an immediate health threat to humans or at least a  documented health threat right now, it poses a serious significant  financial threat to Alabama and many other States.   The total annual economic contribution of deer hunting to the U.S.  economy is close to $40 billion. In fact, as a hunting company, if it  were a publicly-traded company, it would fall in the top 100 on the  Fortune 500 list.   The hunting industry in Alabama generates $2.6 billion every year for  the State's economy, and according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, deer hunting alone generates nearly $2 billion or roughly 80  percent of that amount. Obviously, this makes deer hunting sound like a  very big business, and it is. It is a big business in Alabama, and it  is a big business across the country.   But make no mistake. It is more than just that. It is more than just  an economy. It is more than money that comes into our community. Any  hunter in Alabama will tell you that hunting is not only a time-honored  tradition and a recreational pastime. It is in our State and in so many  others a way of life.   Hunters in Alabama will also tell you about the devastating effect  that CWD can have in the State of Alabama. They use the word  ``disaster,'' and they are not exaggerating.   Chronic wasting disease is spreading throughout the country, and it  is closing in on Alabama. Cases have already been confirmed in southern  Tennessee and northeastern Mississippi. A study out of the University  of Tennessee in Knoxville on the projected impacts of chronic wasting  disease in Tennessee has predicted a nearly $100 million total loss to  that State alone.   We are thankful currently that no deer in Alabama have yet tested  positive for CWD, which is a testament to the hard work being done by  groups like the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural  Resources, but State agencies alone cannot address this problem. Their  budgets are already strained by the activities that they currently  undertake to monitor and manage the disease as well as the many other  fine programs they manage in my State and elsewhere.   Adequate resources must be devoted to studying the transmission of  this disease and developing strategies for its containment. If it  doesn't happen, then CWD, or chronic wasting disease, in Alabama and in  other States not yet affected becomes not a question of if but when.   That is why today, along with Senator Barrasso from Wyoming and  Senator Bennet from Colorado, we are proud to introduce the Chronic  Wasting Disease Transmission in Cervidae Study Act.   Once again, I want to commend Senator Barrasso, in particular, as the  chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee for his  leadership in this space. I know he cares deeply about Wyoming's  wildlife population, but clearly he cares about the population and  conservation efforts throughout the country.   Despite its widespread prevalence, very little is known about CWD and  how it is transmitted. Our bipartisan  [[Page S1137]]  legislation tasks the USDA and the Department of the Interior to work  with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a review of the  existing science, how it is spread, and current best-management  practices in order to get a better handle on what we already know about  the disease and its transmission.   More specifically, this legislation will allow us to identify the  most effective techniques for prevention, surveillance, and management  of the disease. It will also enable us to get a better understanding of  the total economic cost of CWD to our State economies, to wildlife  agencies, to landowners, and to hunters.   A review conducted under this legislation will allow us to gather  essential data that will enable us to conduct better research into the  future and to better formulate our policy goals in order to mitigate  and manage this devastating disease.   Like many Alabamians, I love spending time outdoors, taking in the  breathtaking nature and wildlife of my State. Alabama is a gorgeous  State with an incredibly diverse array of fauna and wildlife. It is an  amazing place. I am also a pretty avid hunter, and, in fact, this  weekend is the last weekend for deer season in my State, and I am  hoping to get out there this Sunday, the very last day, for the last  deer hunt of the season as this season comes to a close. This has  really been a cherished pastime for me and my youngest child, my son  Christopher, for many, many years.   Taking action to find a solution to stop the spread of CWD will help  to ensure that countless other outdoors men and women--because women  are a big part of the hunting population in the State of Alabama--can  continue to enjoy this tradition.   We have to do everything we can to combat what is truly an  existential threat to the deer hunting industry in my State and around  the country. Our legislation is an essential step forward in protecting  the health of our wildlife, protecting the health of our environment,  and, ultimately, protecting the way of life for millions of hunting  Americans.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Van Hollen):   S. 416.
