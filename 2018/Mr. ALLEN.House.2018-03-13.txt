 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting the Right to Try Act.   When those we hold dearest are diagnosed as terminally ill, the last  thing we want to hear is that all treatment options have been  exhausted. This is why I have been a longtime supporter of the Right to  Try Act. Currently, 38 States have already passed right-to-try  legislation to assist vulnerable patients, including my home State of  Georgia.   By allowing terminally ill patients the access to unapproved drugs  and therapies, we are giving them a fighting chance for their God-given  right to life. Although these drugs cannot guarantee a road to  recovery, they can provide a better alternative in many hopeless  situations and pave the way for more scientific breakthroughs.   Congress should keep breaking down regulatory barriers. Like the  bill's name says, patients have a right to try. All Americans should  have the right to choose.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for passing  this important legislation out of committee, and I urge my colleagues  to join me in supporting this bill on the House floor.   How in the world could anyone oppose the right to choose life?
