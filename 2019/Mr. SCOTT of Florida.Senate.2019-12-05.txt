 Mr. President, Florida is the Nation's greatest  melting pot, with people from all over the Nation choosing to make  Florida their permanent home. Our State has the best colleges and  universities in the Nation, including many Historically Black Colleges  and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions. As Governor of  Florida, I made historic investments in higher education and fought to  keep higher education affordable so more students can get a great  education in Florida.   As Senator, I will continue to fight to make sure every child has  access to a quality education at a price they can afford. Our  Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving  Institutions are critical to the success of our State and the future of  our children, and I will always work to support their mission.   The best way to support our colleges and universities is to make sure  our economy is thriving so we have the resources we need to invest in  education. That means we have to be careful about how we are spending  taxpayer dollars. I have concerns any time the government permanently  funds a program, no matter what that program is. Funding anything  permanently means there is little to no accountability or oversight. We  must be careful to regularly review every government-funded program to  make sure taxpayers are always getting the best return on their  investment.                            ____________________
