 Mr. President, I rise today to highlight an important  component of the bipartisan infrastructure legislation that we are now  debating. This legislation includes new investments that will help  communities in Michigan and across the country address the serious risk  posed by severe flooding, shoreline erosion, and other natural  disasters.   As a result of climate change, we are continuing to experience an  increase in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. In  June, Southeast Michigan faced yet another severe flooding event that,  tragically, led to two deaths, damaged small businesses and thousands  of homes, and devastated families.   The Federal Government has spent many billions of dollars to help  respond to and recover from disasters. However, until very recently, we  chronically underinvested in mitigating the effects of disasters before  they occur, despite the fact that it protects lives, safeguards  property, and saves taxpayer dollars. In fact, studies show that every  dollar invested in hazard mitigation or prevention saves as much as $6  for the taxpayers.   This package provides critical investments to a number of mitigation  programs, but I want to highlight just one in particular, the STORM  Act. Last year, I authored bipartisan legislation to create a new  revolving loan program to be overseen by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, or FEMA. In January of this year, that bill was  signed into law, establishing a new program to help our communities  tackle this rising threat.   As the Senate crafted this important bipartisan infrastructure  package over the past few weeks, I was able to work with my colleagues  to secure $500 million in initial funding for this program, the first  Federal investment that will kick-start loans for communities all  across our country to begin addressing this serious problem.   With this downpayment, States will receive funding to create  revolving loan funds to support local government investments in hazard  mitigation projects that will help reduce natural disaster risk. The  low-interest loans provided by this program will offer critical  resources to cash-strapped local communities. Over time, repayment of  those loans at an extremely low interest rate will provide States with  a self-sustaining fund that they can use to continue improving  resilience in other localities.   Because the revolving loan funds are managed at the State level, each  State will have the authority to prioritize funding for the projects  with the greatest need, rather than having the Federal Government make  those decisions. This flexibility will allow States to focus on  protecting vulnerable communities that are particularly hard hit by  extreme weather events.   Additionally, unlike other mitigation programs, the STORM Act is the  first program to allow States to invest in projects to mitigate  shoreline erosion, rising water levels, and severe rainfall that can  wreak havoc on public and private property alike. This is especially  important for my home State of Michigan, where Great Lakes communities  have endured flooded campgrounds, streets, and basements because of  storm water drainage issues; boating problems due to submerged  structures; and the destruction of beaches and homes from high water  levels.  [[Page S5902]]    Funding for the STORM Act, along with other mitigation funds provided  in this legislation, will help transform our country into a more  resilient nation and save us money in the long run. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this critical investment in  mitigation and enacting the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise in support of two nominations to  critical positions within the Department of Homeland Security: Robert  Silvers to be the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy and Plans; and  Jonathan Meyer to be General Counsel.   Both nominees are well qualified for these important roles, and both  of them have strong bipartisan support, including from former national  security officials who served both under Democratic and Republican  Presidents.   Mr. Silver's public service includes several senior roles in the  Department of Homeland Security, including Deputy Chief of Staff and  Assistant Secretary for Cyber Policy during the Obama administration.   As a lawyer in the private sector since 2017, Mr. Silvers has been a  leader on cybersecurity, data privacy, and artificial intelligence  issues. As Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy and Plans, Mr. Silvers  will help the Department to take a strategic and coordinated approach  to address challenging policy areas, including domestic terrorism,  border security, and cybersecurity.   Jonathan Meyers' previous government service spans 17 years and  includes senior roles in the Department of Justice, the U.S. Senate,  and as Deputy General Counsel for DHS during the Obama administration.  Since returning to private practice in 2016, Mr. Meyers' legal work has  continued to focus on cybersecurity, technology, and Homeland Security.   DHS needs qualified Senate-confirmed leaders in place to effectively  carry out its critical mission of safeguarding our Nation, and I urge  my colleagues to confirm these qualified nominees today.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No.  158; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate, that no further motions be in order to the nominations, that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 159; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate, that no further motions be in order to  the nomination, that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination,  Calendar No. 158.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  [[Page S5919]]  vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate, and if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table, all without intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to  the nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume  legislative session.
