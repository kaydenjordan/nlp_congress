 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of  Master Trooper James Bailey. He was killed in the line of duty 1 week  ago today.   Trooper Bailey, a native of Auburn, Indiana, was a decorated, 16-year  veteran of the Indiana State police.   He was a warrior. He beat cancer three times.   In 2010, Trooper Bailey was off-duty and leaving lunch with his wife  when an 87-year-old man collapsed in the parking lot. Trooper Bailey  and his wife Amy, a nurse, began CPR and saved this man's life.   While many people called them heroes, Trooper Bailey simply said: It  is what we do, it is what we are trained to do, and that is why we get  into this profession.   That is who James Bailey was: a humble and dedicated public servant.   But I want to be very clear, especially to his children, Joseph and  Sophia: Your dad was a hero, and that is how he will be remembered. We  will never forget his service and his sacrifice to northeast Indiana.   God bless the Bailey family. God bless all of the law enforcement  officers who risk their lives every single day to keep our families and  our communities safe.                            ____________________
