 Mr. Speaker, on June 21, 2021, the community of  Arvada, Colorado, experienced a tragedy. In a matter of minutes, our  community lost two heroes, with dozens of Arvada residents left stunned  and horrified.   Arvada Police Officer Gordon Beesley was responding to a report of  suspicious activity in Olde Town Arvada when he was ambushed and shot  by a man who had immense hatred toward the police.   Minutes later, a Good Samaritan named Johnny Hurley intervened and  shot the suspect, undoubtedly saving countless other lives. In a  tragedy upon a tragedy, Hurley was then mistaken as the shooter, and he  was killed.   Officer Gordon Beesley joined the Arvada Police Department in 2002  and served in a number of roles for the department. He spent most of  the year working as a school resource officer at local schools in our  community, including Oberon Middle School, Lincoln Academy, and Excel  Academy Charter School. During the summers, he often returned to patrol  work, as he was doing last Monday in Olde Town Arvada.   Officer Beesley was a well-known and well-liked member of our  community. His calm, gentle, and patient demeanor made a big difference  in his day-to-day interactions with students, especially those students  who needed it most.   In 2015, he was named employee of the year by the city of Arvada  after the city learned Officer Beesley was riding his bike to school  multiple times a week with a student who suffered from developmental  delays and was not able to ride by himself.   Countless other stories have surfaced from students, his colleagues,  and community members in the days following his death about the impact  he had on their lives, big and small.   He was an accomplished drummer and singer who played in local Arvada  bands Railbenders and Brethren Fast.   We will remember Officer Beesley's kindness and bravery and the  approach he brought to life each and every day to ``make someone feel  special today.''   Hearing gunshots, another hero stepped up to protect and defend the  community, 40-year-old Denver resident Johnny Hurley. According to  Arvada's chief of police, Johnny's actions were ``decisive, courageous,  and effective in stopping further loss of life.''    Johnny's friends and family remembered him as an idealist and  iconoclast and were not surprised to learn Johnny stepped up to defend  his community in a time of need.   The loss of Johnny Hurley is tragic. I join the Arvada Police  Department and our community at large in honoring his bravery for his  actions that day, which undoubtedly saved lives.   Although we don't know all the facts, our hearts go out to the  officer who mistook Mr. Hurley for the shooter.   This has been a difficult week for our community, including for  members of the Arvada Police Department. Our heroes in uniform are  charged with protecting our communities, and last week's shooting is a  reminder of the dangers our police officers face each and every day  across the country.   Olde Town Arvada is a close-knit community at the heart of Arvada. On  a typical day, it is a busy, vibrant, cheerful part of town. Mr.  Speaker, June 21, 2021, was a dark day for our community, and it is  difficult for many of us to process it.   My deepest and heartfelt condolences go out to the families of  Officer Beesley and Johnny Hurley and the entire Arvada community.  Arvadans are resilient and strong. Together, we will get through this.  [[Page H3245]]                                ____________________
