 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Jackson  Lee, and I look forward to having her vote in support of this  continuing resolution because she is committed, as I am, and everyone  in Texas is committed to making sure the money continues to flow to the  victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   As Congresswoman Jackson Lee knows, if this continuing resolution is  defeated, if she votes against it, she is voting to stop the flow of  money to the hurricane victims in Houston, and I know she doesn't want  that to happen.   That is one of many reasons I rise today in support of this  continuing resolution, because we want to ensure that the military has  the funds it needs to operate.   As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies, I want to be sure that the FBI and the  Department of Justice has the funds that they need to continue to  protect the people of America against terrorism, to protect women and  children against violence, to stop the scourge of human trafficking and  sex trafficking, to stop the scourge of opioid trafficking and abuse,  and to stop the international drug cartels from pouring their poison  into this country.   I am proud of the work that this full committee has done, and the  hard work of my subcommittee--the Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee--to ensure that the law enforcement  agencies in this country have the funds they need; to ensure the  [[Page H9736]]  Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation, and NASA have  the funds they need to make sure America continues to be the world  leader in scientific and space exploration.   My colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, working along with the  Houston delegation, including Ms. Jackson Lee, we are working together  arm in arm with the Florida delegation to create a hurricane relief  package that will ensure that the people of Texas and Florida and  Puerto Rico are adequately compensated for their losses, that we repair  the damage to our flood control infrastructure.   But this is going to take time, Mr. Speaker. The Senate has not  passed any appropriations bills, while the House has passed all 12 of  them. We do not yet have an overall spending agreement on what level of  funding is necessary for the military and for domestic purposes, and we  have got to finish that hurricane relief package that Ms. Jackson Lee  and all of us have been such strong advocates for.   So I urge Ms. Jackson Lee and the entire House to vote in support of  the CR to make sure our hurricane victims are taken care of and the  government continues to function.                                time  1500
