 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Judiciary Committee and one of only 5 members and one of three  Democrats to serve on that House Judiciary Committee during the  impeachment of 1998, I rise in strong support of the Rule governing  debate for H. Res. 660, as well as the underlying legislation--a  resolution directing committees to continue their ongoing  investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry  into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives  to exercise the constitutional power, solely vested in the House of  Representatives, to impeach Donald John Trump, the current President of  the United States of America.   This is a somber and solemn time.   Today we choose our beloved nation over individual self-interest and  a political party.   We choose due process, regular order and fairness.   And as the founding fathers crafted a document, which 230 years  later, from 1789 to 2019, we can abide by, we choose the Constitution.   When the Framers of our Constitution designed our government, they  bifurcated power between the federal and state governments, and divided  power among the branches.   Indeed as the Framers debated ratification of the Constitution, they  knew of the need to remove an individual who breached the public trust.   James Madison of Virginia argued in favor of impeachment stating that  some provision was ``indispensable'' to defend the community against  ``the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate.''   With a single executive, Madison argued, unlike a legislature whose  collective nature provided security, ``loss of capacity or corruption  was more within the compass of probable events, and either of them  might be fatal to the Republic.''   They wrote Article I and vested in the Congress the capacity to make  the laws.   They wrote Article II, and in the Executive vested the power to  faithfully execute those laws.   Because the House enjoyed a natural superiority, as most  representative of the passions of the populace, the Framers vested in  the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment, and made  the Senate the judges.   In Article II, they specified the standard by which a president or  any constitutional officer is to be removed from office: for High  Crimes and Misdemeanors.   It is against that backdrop that we debate this resolution.   In support this resolution because it protects our interests, holds  us responsible, protects the American people and gives the president  ample opportunity to try to justify his conduct.   In September, members of the House of Representatives learned of a  complaint filed by a whistleblower within the Intelligence Community.   The whistleblower alleged that on July 25, 2019, in a telephone  conversation with the President of Ukraine, the American President  sought to withhold foreign military aid from the besieged and  beleaguered nation of Ukraine unless and until the Government of  Ukraine produced or manufactured produced political dirt against a  person he deemed his most formidable political rival.   The allegation suggests an effort and intent to extort the assistance  of a foreign power to help the current president retain his office.   This is similar to the allegations surrounding his 2016 election  victory, which were at the heart of the Special Counsel's Report  regarding Russian election interference.   After the whistleblower's details were made public, the White House  engaged in a series of untenable defenses, all designed to discredit  the courageous whistleblower's account, which the Intelligence  Community Inspector General found credible.   First, the White House indicated that the whistleblower should not be  trusted because it referenced secondhand information, forgetting that  much of the information in the Whistleblower's complaint was  corroborated by the White House itself.   Next, the White House claimed, without proof, that the whistleblower  was a liar.  [[Page H8696]]    Then, the White House spread a lie that it was a ``perfect'' call  between the two leaders.   Outrageously, the White House then claimed that Chairman Adam Schiff  is lying and had helped the Whistleblower draft his complaint.   That was before the President said that the whistleblower's complaint  is a lie made up by the ``Deep State.''   And that was before the President said that he made the call at Rick  Perry's urging and that the phone conversations with the Vice President  are more problematic than his.   The President and his last defenders are now trying to denigrate the  life and accomplishments of Ambassador Bill Taylor, a graduate of the  United States Military Academy at West Point, and decorated soldier,  and dismissing him as a Never Trumper, as if that is a demerit.   This past Tuesday, Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman, a member of the  National Security Council who immigrated from Ukraine when he was  three-years old and was dismissed by the President as insufficiently  loyal to him, before one of the President's acolytes suggested Lt. Col.  Vindman held a greater loyalty for Ukraine over the United States.   Lt. Col. Vindman has loyally served our country and our Constitution.  He was injured in the war in Iraq, for which he was awarded the Purple  Heart.   It is thus fitting that when Lt. Col. Vindman appeared to testify in  this impeachment inquiry, he did so wearing his Army class A uniform,  and had inside his leg shrapnel from the attack that wounded him, and  won him the commendation of his superior officers in the Army.   And when he began his testimony, he indicated just what service to  this nation meant.   He stated:         I have dedicated my entire professional life to the United       States of America. For more than two decades, it has been my       honor to serve as an officer in the United States Army. As an       infantry officer, I served multiple overseas tours, including       South Korea and Germany, and a deployment to Iraq for combat       operations. In Iraq, I was wounded in an IED attack and       awarded a Purple Heart.    An immigrant to this country, Lt. Col. Vindman stated:         The privilege of serving my country is not only rooted in       my military service, but also in my personal history. I sit       here, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, an       immigrant. My family fled the Soviet Union when I was three       and a half years old. Upon arriving in New York City in 1979,       my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while       learning English at night. He stressed to us the importance       of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many       years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging       beginnings, my family worked to build its own American dream.       I have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and       the power of freedom. I am a patriot, and it is my sacred       duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country,       irrespective of party or politics.    When Lt. Col. Vindman testified, he spoke of the horror he felt when  he realized that our country's national security apparatus was being  manipulated for the president's personal and political gain.   He stated in his testimony:         On July 21, 2019, President Zelensky's party won       Parliamentary elections in a landslide victory. The NSC       proposed that President Trump call President Zelensky to       congratulate him. On July 25, 2019, the call occurred. I       listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues       from the NSC and the office of the Vice President. As the       transcript is in the public record, we are all aware of what       was said. I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was       proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S.       citizen, and I was worried about the implications for 6 the       U.S. government's support of Ukraine. I realized that if       Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma,       it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would       undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support       it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S.       national security. Following the call, I again reported my       concerns to NSC's lead counsel.   Throughout the last five weeks, Congressional Republicans have  presented a series of strawman arguments designed to deflect but not  delve into the very serious charges against the President.   Congressional Republicans' claims that the whistleblower complaint  was hearsay are specious because its contents have been independently  and repeatedly confirmed.   Similarly, there is no merit to the claim that there was no quid pro  quo when the evidence adduced to date confirms there was.   In their perverse logic, Congressional Republicans decried the lack  of due process for a man who once suggested that the Central Park Five  should be summarily executed for a crime for which they were later  exonerated, and could shoot someone in broad daylight with impunity.   Despite these specious arguments, it is likely that these process  arguments are only made because the substance of the president's  allegations are utterly indefensible.   The American people and their elected representatives cannot be  distracted; they are paying close attention to the substantial  wrongdoing emanating from this White House.   They know what the President, which is why a clear majority support  impeachment and removal of this President.   As the House of Representatives continues its impeachment inquiry, H.  Res. 660 is an especially timely piece of legislation, which squarely  addresses the concerns of the President's most fervent supporters.   Specifically, this legislation reaffirms that the six investigating  committees--including the House Judiciary Committee, of which I am a  senior member and which has exclusive jurisdiction to draft Articles of  Impeachment--announced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been engaged in an  impeachment inquiry and directs them to continue their vital work.   That we have been engaged in an ongoing impeachment inquiry was  ratified by the Article III branch when Judge Beryl Howell, the Chief  Judge for the United States District court for the District of  Columbia, recently held that the House is conducting an impeachment  inquiry, which does not require a formal floor vote.   Second, H. Res. 660 authorizes the House Permanent Select Committee  on Intelligence (HPSCI) to make public transcripts of recent  depositions with appropriate redactions made for classified or other  sensitive information.   This legislation, too, establishes procedures for all investigating  committees to transmit their evidence to the Committee on the Judiciary  for use in their proceedings.   The resolution is also prospective, as it relates to these hearings  moving from secure intelligence facilities to public view. H. Res. 660  also serves to enable effective public hearings as it permits staff  counsels to question witnesses for up to 45 minutes.   This is consistent with precedent established in 1998 of having staff  counsel conduct initial questioning, followed by Member questions, by  Republicans used to question Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in 1998.   The resolution also continues the precedent of giving the minority  the same rights to question witnesses that was afforded the majority.  This has been true at every step of the inquiry.   Additionally, H. Res. 660 also permits the President opportunities to  participate in this inquiry, in a manner consistent with past  participation by Presidents.   The resolution establishes opportunities for the President or his  counsel to participate in impeachment proceedings held by the Committee  on the Judiciary, including to present his case and respond to  evidence.   The President can submit written requests for additional testimony or  other evidence.   The President can attend hearings, including those held in executive  session, raise an objection to testimony given and cross-examine  witnesses.   But, if the President unlawfully refuses to cooperate with  Congressional requests, the Chair shall have the discretion to impose  sanctions to enforce appropriate remedies, including by denying  specific requests by the President or his counsel.   H. Res. 660 explicates the procedure that applies after testimony is  adduced in the HPSCI.   H. Res. 660 directs the Committee on the Judiciary to review the  evidence and, if necessary, to report Articles of Impeachment to the  House.   Following the precedent of every modern impeachment inquiry, the  Committee on the Judiciary will decide whether Articles shall be  reported to the House.   H. Res. 660 is important legislation that specifies the parameters  and the terms this body will follow as it undergoes its solemn and  constitutional task.   It affords equal time to the Chairman and Ranking Member to question  witnesses and it treats the President and his counsel fairly.   And, importantly, it lays out for the American people the manner in  which this inquiry will proceed to the House Judiciary Committee--the  committee of jurisdiction for impeachment and where I will bring to  bear my decades of experience on Capitol Hill, including the lessons  learned in the impeachment of 1998.   Unlike that occasion, the allegations at the heart of this matter are  serious, and damning of the president's conduct and fitness to serve  and his ability to safeguard our national security.   These allegations represent a violation of his oath, a betrayal of  our national interests, a repudiation of Americans' cherished  Democratic Values, and a violation of federal campaign finance laws.   When the President stated that Article II permits him to do whatever  he wants, he was invoking a fear of Thomas Jefferson, the author of the  Declaration of Independence.   As the author of one of our nation's enduring documents, Jefferson  was well-versed with  [[Page H8697]]  what troubles would merit the erosion of public trust in its leaders.   After all, the Declaration of Independence was a list of grievances  of a lawless King, who felt impunity.   But, almost 50 years after the adoption of the Declaration of  Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote to another of our nation's  founders: Nathaniel Macon.   In 1821, Jefferson wrote: ``Our government is now taking so steady a  course, as to shew by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit, by  consolidation first; and then corruption, it's necessary consequence.''   It is clear that the consolidation that Jefferson feared--and the  corruption which he said would be its necessary consequence--has now  been realized in the actions of this President.   We will not permit this to continue and we will put a stop to it.   The President will be held to account. H. Res. 660 is the first step  towards that accountability, and I am proud to support it.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                   Amendment to H. Res. 660, as Reported                            Offered by Mr. Cole         In section 2, strike paragraph (5) and insert the       following:        (5) Not later than 15 days after the Permanent Select       Committee conducts a deposition or an interview in       furtherance of the investigation described in the first       section of this resolution, the chair shall make publicly       available in electronic form the transcript of such       deposition or interview, with appropriate redactions for       classified and other sensitive information.        In section 3, strike ``is authorized'' and insert       ``shall''.        In section 3, strike ``to transfer'' and insert       ``transfer''.        In section 3, insert after ``records or materials'' the       following: ``, including exculpatory records or materials,       with appropriate redactions for classified or other sensitive       information,''.        In section 4, strike subsection (d) and insert the       following:        (d) In the case that the Committee on the Judiciary       proceeds to consideration of a resolution, article of       impeachment, or other recommendation, the chair shall, at       least 72 hours prior to committee consideration, make       available to the public, the report received from the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and any and all       records or materials, including exculpatory records or       materials, with appropriate redactions for classified or       other sensitive information, that were transferred from the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence or any other       committee involved in the inquiry referenced in the first       section of this resolution.     Madam Speaker, this is a somber and solemn time.   I rise in support of H. Res. 660, a resolution establishing  procedures for the impeachment of the President. I do it with a heavy  heart.   But today we choose our beloved Nation over individual self-interest  and political party. We choose due process, regular order, and  fairness. We choose this little document called the Constitution,  lasting for over 200 years.   We are reminded of the words of James Madison who argued in favor of  impeachment, stating that some provision was indispensable to defend  the community against the incapacity or negligence of the chief  magistrate.   We do not do this in a rush, and we do not do it eagerly.   We are reminded of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman who came here at 3  years old. He said he had dedicated his entire professional life to the  United States of America. And he said about the call that he was on: I  realized that this was troubling, that if Ukraine pursued an  investigation into the Bidens, it would be heavy and wrong. I do not  think it is proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a  U.S. citizen.   Again, we stand on the Constitution. We must do it right and do it  fairly.   This is a somber and solemn time.   Today we choose our beloved nation over individual self-interest and  a political party.   We choose due process, regular order and fairness.   And as the founding fathers crafted a document, which 230 years  later, from 1789 to 2019, we can abide by, we choose the Constitution.   When the Framers of our Constitution designed our government, they  bifurcated power between the federal and state governments, and divided  power among the branches.
