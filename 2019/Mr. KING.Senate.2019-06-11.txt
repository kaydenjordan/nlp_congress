 Madam President, today I wish to recognize the 25th  anniversary of the Salmon Habitat and River Enhancement Program, known  as Project SHARE. SHARE has spent the last quarter of a century focused  on river habitat restoration in Downeast Maine, specifically for  Atlantic salmon. Thanks to SHARE and its many partners, hundreds of  restoration projects have been completed, improving Maine's waterways  for marine life.   Founded in 1994, SHARE was built on the recognition that, without  direct action, Atlantic salmon would go extinct from habitat  destruction and overfishing. SHARE's work has focused on improving  Maine's streams and rivers, a crucial habitat for salmon, as they  require freshwater to breed. The organization uses a diverse range of  methods during their projects, from the addition of clamshells to the  stream or river in order to balance pH levels, to adding open bottom  arch culverts and bridges to more effectively spread nutrients and ease  passage in the waterways. While the goal of these projects is to help  Atlantic salmon, the rest of Maine's marine life benefit from the  improved living conditions in our fresh-water streams and rivers.   A hallmark of SHARE's success has been its emphasis on building  partnerships in order to achieve its goals. SHARE has valued these  partners since the beginning, when a wide range of State agencies, land  owners, research and conservation groups, and more signed on as charter  members. Their focus on cooperation between public and private entities  has clearly paid off, as they have completed more than 250 restoration  projects in just the last 15 years. A key part of these partnerships is  the work SHARE does with Maine's students. Including students from  local schools and universities in their restoration projects has  allowed SHARE to pass on the methods used to improve the safety and  habitability of our waterways and the importance of Atlantic salmon to  Maine and the rest of the country.   I would like to thank Project SHARE for their 25 years of commitment  to improving Maine's waterways for Atlantic salmon and other marine  life. Thanks to their hard work, 2,800 habitat units have been  improved, with many more projects planned in the years to come. SHARE's  dedication to protecting and restoring outdoor habitats ensures that  Maine's wildlife will continue to thrive. Congratulations Project SHARE  on reaching this impressive milestone, I look forward to seeing your  work over the next 25 years.                            ____________________
