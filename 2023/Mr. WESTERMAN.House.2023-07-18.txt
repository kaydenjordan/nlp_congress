 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Lalit  Verma on his retirement from the University of Arkansas Biological and  Agricultural Engineering Department.   As a proud alumnus of this department myself, it is my pleasure today  to honor Dr. Verma for his distinguished career at the University of  Arkansas and everywhere he has studied and taught.   He started in India and continued his academic career at Montana  State University and the University of Nebraska. He spent time teaching  in Bangkok, in South Dakota, and even made his way down to Louisiana  where he spent time at LSU. Thankfully, he made it to Arkansas, where  for 23 years, he has left his most significant mark on academia.   Dr. Verma has done an incredible job leading the department and has  served in various other organizations, such as ASABE.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dr. Verma for his distinguished career  and wish Dr. Verma and his wife Aruna well in their future endeavors  and as they spend more time with their two grandchildren.                      Food Animal Veterinarian Shortage     Mr. Speaker, as a top-ranking State in livestock  production, Arkansas is in need of food animal veterinarians like many  other places around the country.   In 2022, 25 counties within my district applied for designated  shortage area status. Of the 25 counties that applied, only 13 were  awarded the status. Food animal veterinarians who practice in these  areas are eligible to apply for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment  Program, or VMLRP.   Food animal veterinarians are on the decline, and this program is  essential to encourage young Americans to consider practicing food  animal veterinary.   With the 2018 Farm Bill set to expire in September of this year, I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider the  importance of the VMLRP Program in addressing the food animal  veterinarian shortage that poses a concern to my constituents and many  of my colleagues' constituents, and also it is critical to the food  supply for our Nation.                            ____________________
