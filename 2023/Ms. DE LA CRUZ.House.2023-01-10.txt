 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share my priorities for south  Texas.   It is an honor to stand in the people's House. Being here as a single  mother and the granddaughter of a Mexican farmworker shows that all  things are possible in America through faith and hard work.   That is why I am proud that my first vote is to protect small  businesses in south Texas from IRS overreach, which disproportionately  hurts low-income Americans and communities like mine. The last thing we  need is 87,000 IRS agents harassing south Texans.   Families are struggling. Single moms are struggling. Our Border  Patrol lacks resources. After a century of one-party control in my  district, we still have entire counties without doctors.   I pledge to work in a bipartisan manner to address these challenges  during my time here; to promote prosperity for all Americans,  regardless of their race, gender, or creed; and to keep the American  Dream alive for the next generation, so help me God.                            ____________________
