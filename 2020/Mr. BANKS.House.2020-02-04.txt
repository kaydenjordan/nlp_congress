 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Police  Officer Jason Dobbins.   Sixteen years ago, Officer Dobbins began working in law enforcement.  In 2012, he transferred to the Warsaw Police Department, where he  followed in the footsteps of his father, Ted, who also served as a  police officer in the City of Warsaw for 20 years.   In the wake of his tragic passing last Saturday, Officer Dobbins is  mourned by the Warsaw Police Department, and by the whole of Warsaw,  who remember him as a great leader, father, and friend.   And as Warsaw Mayor Joe Thallemer told me just earlier today in a  text message, he said, ``The overwhelming, immediate outpouring of  support is testimony to his commitment to the well-being of the Warsaw  community. His legacy of service lives on.''   It is people like Jason Dobbins who embody the very best of what our  Nation has to offer.  [[Page H757]]    I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, his son, his three  daughters, and his stepson in this sad time, and I pray that they may  find peace.                            ____________________
