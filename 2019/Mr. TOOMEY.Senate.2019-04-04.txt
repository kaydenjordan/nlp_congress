 Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate invoked cloture  on the nomination for the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance  Agency. The nominee is named Mark Calabria, and I just want to say he  is an extraordinarily qualified and capable man. I hope this body will  overwhelmingly confirm him.   He is a Ph.D. economist. He has tremendous work experience in the  field of housing finance, which of course is the domain of the Federal  Housing Agency. He has worked at HUD, the Banking Committee, and now he  is the chief economist to Vice President Pence.   I am certainly looking forward to working with Dr. Calabria on  housing finance reform, the great unfinished work of the financial  crisis, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him later today.                           Unrealized Gain Proposal    Mr. President, I also wanted to say a few words about an idea that  has been floated by one of our colleagues. The idea has been floated by  my friend--he is my friend, and he is a good man--Senator Wyden from  Oregon. He is the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and  he is a very good man with a very bad idea, and I want to explain why I  believe the idea that he has floated is so mistaken.   Fundamentally, his proposal is that we change our Tax Code so that we  would impose taxes on unrealized investment gains every year.   Currently, we impose taxes on investments only when the asset is  sold. If an asset is purchased, it is later sold at a higher price. The  difference is the gain, and we impose what we call a capital gains tax  on that gain--but only when the gain is actually realized.   Under Senator Wyden's proposal, if an asset goes up in value, even  though it hasn't been sold, the fact that it has gone up in value would  require that increase in value to be taxed. The investor would have to  pay a tax.   There is another element of his proposal, which is that these taxes  that he wants to impose on these phantom gains would not be at the  capital gains tax rate that is currently enforced but rather at  personal income tax rates instead.   The current capital gains rate is 23.8 percent. That is the top. That  is the  [[Page S2255]]  highest capital gains rate that is paid. The highest personal income  tax rate in our Tax Code is 37 percent. So in some circumstances, this  would be a huge tax increase.   Let me explain why I think both of these are very bad ideas--taxing  unrealized gains and taxing all gains at ordinary income rates.   First of all, let's take the idea of taxes on unrealized gains. These  are the paper gains. This is a market-to-market appreciation that is  unrealized if the investor doesn't actually sell the asset. Well, there  is a good reason that our system has never imposed taxes on unrealized  gains; there are several, but one is the value of the asset could go  back down.   One very widely held asset in America is stocks--stocks that you can  buy on an exchange, a share of a company--and stocks famously go up and  down. So I think it strikes most people as unreasonable to force people  to pay a tax on this notional gain on a stock without having sold it  when that stock could go back down. The gain could be completely lost,  but you would still pay the tax.   There is another problem with this; that is, the tax would be imposed  without a liquidity event for the investor. In other words, the  investor hasn't sold the asset, doesn't have the cash. What if the  investor doesn't have enough cash to pay the tax bill on it? This risk  alone would have a chilling effect on investment. It would discourage  people from making the investment in the first place because they would  have to wonder and worry about what kind of tax bill they will incur  even if they don't sell the asset.   Yet another problem with this is the complexity and difficulty of  actually implementing this. It is pretty easy to determine the value of  a stock, but there are other categories of investment that are much  more difficult to value, like real estate or a small business.   So imagine an entrepreneur buys a small building and builds it out  and creates a restaurant, and that is his business. He is operating a  restaurant. It may be profitable; it may not be. But what if real  estate values in that neighborhood happen to go up? Well, here you  might have a struggling entrepreneur trying to make ends meet in his  restaurant, and the IRS is going to come along and say: Oh, you owe us  a whole lot of money because we think the land on which you are  operating has gone up in value.   What good does that do for the restaurant operator or the people  working for him, the jobs being created? It is not a good idea at all.   There is another aspect to Senator Wyden's proposal, and that is that  he would use a higher rate. He would like the top rate of 37 percent to  be imposed, at least in some cases, on these capital gains, whether or  not realized.   So the question is, Why do we have a lower tax rate on capital gains  than we have on ordinary income, other sources of incomes? Well, there  are several reasons for that, as well--good reasons. One is we don't  exclude from our calculation of an investor's gain the component of  that gain that is attributable only to inflation. Think about it. If  you make an investment in something and the inflation rate is just 2  percent a year, well, 10 years later, that is going to nominally be  worth like 25 percent more than it was when you bought it, but you  don't have any real gain; that is just a reflection of the fact that  dollars are worth less.   So as a sort of rough justice for the fact that you nevertheless get  taxed on the full gain, even the nominal gain, the gain that is not  real, the gain that is just inflation, at least it is taxed at a lower  rate to make up for that.   There is another factor, and that is most investments are in an asset  that itself generates income, and that income is taxed. So, for  instance, a stock--a stock is a share of a company; a company has to  pay tax. So imagine an investor who invests in a company and that  company makes $100 of income. That is the profit for the business.  Well, the first thing that business has to do is pay 21 percent of that  to Uncle Sam. That is the tax on corporate income. Well, that leaves  $79 left over for the investors, and the investor has to pay 23.8  percent on that. That works out to about $19. So at the end of the day,  on a $100 hundred gain, the investor is able to go home with only $60.  That is a 40-percent effective tax rate to the investor, despite the  fact that the nominal rate applied on the investor's gain is only 23.8  percent. The combination--and that is what you really have to look at-- is more like 40 percent. That is higher than any individual income tax  rate that we have in our entire code.   Of course, a gain on such an asset occurs only when investors  generally believe that the after-tax value has gone up.   So I think it would be a big mistake to go down this road. I think it  would be a big mistake to tax unrealized gains. As it is now, gains are  taxed. They are taxed at the time in which they are actually earned-- they are actually realized--and it would be a mistake to raise the tax  on this. Both of these ideas, and certainly in combination, would  absolutely, certainly have a chilling effect on investment. They would  diminish the willingness of people to invest in new businesses, in  growing business, in startup business, and a chilling effect on  investment means a chilling effect on economic growth.   So this proposal, I think, is misguided. It comes at a time when the  tax reform that we have recently passed, which actually encourages  investment, is clearly working. Our tax reform has generated a  tremendous surge in investment in equipment, in technology, in new  business. We have seen tremendous growth in our overall economy as a  result.   In 2018, our economy grew at 3 percent--the best since 2005. With a  strong, growing economy, we have seen terrific results for the people  we all represent. Unemployment is at its lowest rate in 50 years.  African-American unemployment is the lowest that has ever been  recorded; Hispanic unemployment, the lowest ever recorded; youth  unemployment, the lowest rate in many decades. Wages are now growing  more rapidly than they have in over 10 years, and they are  accelerating, and the wage growth is strongest among lower income  workers.   Clearly, the reforms we implemented have been an incentive for more  investment, and that has led to more growth. I sure wouldn't want to  see us do anything that would disrupt the fact that we have created an  environment where there is now so much opportunity and where work is  paying so much more than it has before.   As I said, Senator Wyden is a good man, but this is a bad idea. I  certainly hope we don't move in this direction.   I yield the floor.
