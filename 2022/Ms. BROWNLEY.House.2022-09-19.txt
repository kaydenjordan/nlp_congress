 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee  and the ranking member for being so supportive of this bill. I also  thank Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer, and every member of the  California delegation, for their support.   As the chair and ranking member mentioned, my bill, H.R. 7698, will  name the new VA outpatient clinic in Ventura County after Captain  Rosemary Bryant Mariner.   This new VA clinic has been a long time in the making. Since I was  elected to Congress, I have been working to expand VA services in  Ventura County to ensure that our veterans have access to the timely  and quality care that they have earned and deserve.   When I first came to Congress, it was clear that Ventura County  veterans were being deeply underserved by the undersized and  understaffed local VA clinic, so I immediately set out to work to  correct the situation.   While I was able to secure improvements to the facility that existed,  it  [[Page H7942]]  was clear that the large veteran population in our region needed a much  larger facility and one run by VA personnel, personnel that understood  them and understood their experiences. That was critically important.   Although the road to passing legislation to authorize a new facility  was long, in 2017, my legislation was signed into law. This new clinic  will be better equipped to deliver high-quality healthcare to a growing  community of veterans living in Ventura County and in the area.   Importantly, the new clinic will have VA personnel and will offer  expanded services and more specialty care, like dental care, physical  therapy, rehabilitation services, optometry, audiology, podiatry,  cardiology, and other services.   Getting the new facility open has been my highest priority in  Congress, and I am very, very excited that it will be opening next  Tuesday, September 27.   I am very grateful for the work of all the dedicated VA personnel in  our region, who have been laser focused on getting this new facility  opened and hiring all the necessary staff it needs.                                time  1830    Already, the reviews from local veterans who have toured the new  facility have been very positive. I am hopeful that as veterans begin  to get care at the facility, it will be truly transformative in their  lives.   As chair of the Women Veterans Task Force, I am also especially  pleased that the new clinic will be one of the first VA clinics in the  country, and the very first in the greater Los Angeles area, with a  women-only entrance.   Since the Revolutionary War, millions of women have served in the  Armed Forces of the United States. However, when they leave the  military, they are often invisible, and far too many women leave  military service with the scars of military sexual trauma. The women- only entrance will ensure that our women veterans can feel safe and  welcomed and, hopefully, never feel discouraged from seeking the care  they need.   While opening this clinic has been my highest priority, I also  believe that naming the clinic will provide us with yet another  opportunity to recognize the service and sacrifice of our women  veterans.   Women comprise the fastest growing and most diverse demographic in  both the military and veteran populations.   Through my work in Congress, I am constantly reminded that women are  the most visible while serving and the most invisible when they return  to civilian life. This is symbolized, sadly, by the lack of VA  facilities named after women veterans. In fact, of the 1,255 VA  healthcare facilities, only two facilities have been named in honor of  women veterans--only two.   To address this, I convened a local citizens advisory panel comprised  of veterans and community leaders to select a woman veteran for whom we  could name the new clinic, and they selected Captain Rosemary Bryant  Mariner.   Captain Mariner, a former resident of Ventura County, joined the Navy  in 1973, where she became a member of the Navy's first flight training  class for women. In 1974, she was one of six women to earn her wings  and, the following year, became the first female naval aviator to fly a  jet attack aircraft.   Captain Mariner was named commander of the Naval Tactical Electronic  Warfare Squadron 34 at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in Ventura County,  California. The unit was 30 percent female and made Captain Mariner the  first woman to command an operational air squadron.   Throughout her career, Captain Mariner was a passionate advocate for  women in the military, leading the Women Military Aviators and working  with Congress and the Department of Defense to lift restrictions  barring women from flying in combat.   I could not be more pleased that the House is taking up my bill to  honor Captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner.   This bill and this clinic send a critically important message to our  women veterans, and that is: We see you.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on the bill.
