 Mr. Speaker, February is Black History Month, as we all  know. Today, I rise to recognize WJBE, Knoxville's only Black-owned  radio station and a media cornerstone in our community.   WJBE was originally founded by the godfather of soul, James Brown,  and WJBE actually stood for, back then, James Brown Enterprises. It was  reorganized in 2013, thanks to the efforts of my good friend and former  colleague in the Tennessee General Assembly, Joe Armstrong, along with  his partner and station manager, Gene Thomas, Jr.   WJBE has grown into a unique home for Knoxville's Black voices. On  WJBE, musicians showcase their talents, business owners promote their  services, and public officials share how the latest policies impact the  people they represent, and that is me included.   Thanks to this station, the successes and stories of the local Black  community are heard year-round, not just during Black History Month.   WJBE is an invaluable part of east Tennessee's culture, Mr. Speaker,  and I am proud to share the station's story here on the floor of the  House of Representatives.                            ____________________
