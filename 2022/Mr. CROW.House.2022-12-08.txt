 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8404, the  Respect for Marriage Act, a bill to ensure critical protections for  same-sex and interracial marriages.   Madam Speaker, 19 days ago, Coloradans woke up to the news of yet  another mass shooting impacting our community. This violence was the  direct result of intolerance and discrimination. It was the direct  result of efforts by some elected officials to seize on hate and  villainize the LGBTQ+ community.   Today, we have the opportunity to reject the ugly vitriol and stand  with the LGBTQ+ community in Colorado and nationwide. Today, we have  the opportunity to protect all Americans, regardless of how they  identify or whom they love.   The Respect for Marriage Act will uphold marriage equality under  Federal law, repealing the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act. This  bill ensures that the Federal Government won't stand in the way of a  person's right to marry whom they love.   I thank Chairman Nadler for leading this effort and the Congressional  Equality Caucus for their ongoing work to promote equality for all,  regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill.
