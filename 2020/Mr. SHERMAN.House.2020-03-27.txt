 Mr. Speaker, this virus is a machine gun machine-gunning  America. This bill provides $2 trillion to bandage some of the wounds.  We must stop the machine gun.   Less than 1 percent of this bill goes for medical research. Our  economic system provides significant incentives to the private sector  to research patented drugs, but we should do more.   The next bill should provide $5 billion to the NIH to evaluate every  reasonable research alternative, particularly those compounds that the  private sector will not investigate.
