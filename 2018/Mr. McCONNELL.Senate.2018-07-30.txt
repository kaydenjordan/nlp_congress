 Mr. President, we will finish up the set of  appropriations measures we have been considering for several days and  take four more big steps toward our goal of completing a regular  appropriations process and funding the government in a timely and  orderly manner.   We will authorize vital resources for our Nation's Armed Forces. We  will attend to several other priorities as well, including an extension  of flood insurance and sending the bipartisan farm bill to a conference  with the House.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, later today, the Senate will  vote to advance the nomination of Britt Cagle Grant, the President's  selection to serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.   This Stanford Law graduate has served the people of Georgia for 6  years, most recently as a justice on the State's supreme court. All  eight of her fellow justices had this to say about Justice Grant in a  letter to Chairman Grassley and Senator Feinstein:         She is highly intelligent, [with] a breadth and depth of       legal experience. . . . Her first focus is always to get the       law right.    They go on to write:         Justice Grant's character and integrity is unquestioned.       She has an excellent reputation in the legal community [and]       a well-balanced judicial temperament.    In sum, they write:         Justice Grant displays all the qualities of an excellent       judge. . . . Our loss would be the Eleventh Circuit's gain.    Justice Grant's colleagues on the Georgia Supreme Court include  appointees of Republican Governors and Democratic Governors. They have  seen her work up close. They have seen her legal expertise and her  commitment to the rule of law. They have seen her conviction that--in  her own words--``the role of judges is to interpret the law rather than  make it.''   Her reputation reaches beyond State lines. In another letter to our  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, current and former State  solicitors general from across the country testify to her  ``congeniality,'' ``integrity and work ethic,'' and say that Justice  Grant ``has treated colleagues, opposing counsel, and the litigants  appearing before her with respect.''   The understanding of a judge's role and the temperament to execute it  is precisely the approach our constitutional order requires of our  judges. I look forward to voting to advance Justice Grant's nomination  later today, and I urge each of my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a final matter, on Friday, the  Commerce Department reported some outstanding news. In the second  quarter of 2018, the real gross domestic product of the United States  grew by 4.1 percent. This number is just the latest point in a long  series of evidence that shows the American economy is thriving.  [[Page S5442]]    As I have pointed out, it is a mistake to view this growth--and the  new prosperity for American families that it entails--primarily as an  achievement of government. It is the American worker, the American job  creator, and the American entrepreneur who has grown our economy faster  than 4 percent this quarter, who has driven the number of Americans  filing for unemployment benefits to its lowest level in over 48 years  and created 3.7 million jobs since the 2016 election, and who has  repatriated more than $300 billion from overseas in the first quarter  of this year alone, according to the Commerce Department, bringing that  money home to our country.   This is what free enterprise can achieve when Washington, DC, stops  raising taxes, stops micromanaging the economy through the sprawling  regulatory State, and stops presuming it is better to funnel money and  power to bureaucrats than to trust hard-working families and small  business owners to live their own lives. So it is the American people  who deserve the credit for the successes of their economy.   Here is what this united Republican government is doing: cutting  their taxes, rolling back the redtape, and mowing down one hurdle after  another that has held our country back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I am proud to recognize Fort  Knox, an important asset of our national defense infrastructure in my  home State, as it celebrates its centennial anniversary. Located in  Bullitt, Hardin, and Meade Counties, the installation was established  by Congress in 1918 and has taken an active role in the defense of our  Nation ever since. Today Fort Knox is a source of pride for the  community and our Commonwealth, and I would like to take a look back at  its century of accomplishment.   Named in honor of the Revolutionary War major general and the first  U.S. Secretary of War, Henry Knox, the site began as a field artillery  training range for Camp Zachary Taylor in Louisville. Congress  purchased 40,000 acres of land in Kentucky to accommodate approximately  60,000 soldiers. Construction began in July 1918 under the supervision  of quartermaster W. H. Radcliffe, and Camp Knox served as a facility to  support troops returning home at the conclusion of the Great War.   In subsequent years, Camp Knox became a training facility for  thousands of troops from the National Guard, Reserve Officers Training  Corps, and Citizens Military Training Camps. One of the citizens who  trained there was author Robert Penn Warren of Guthrie, KY. Before he  gained enduring fame for writing ``All the King's Men,'' Warren's first  published poem ``Prophecy'' appeared in the ``Camp Knox Mess Kit'' in  1922.   In 1931, the Army revolutionized our Nation's Armed Forces and formed  a mechanized cavalry regiment at the facility. The next year, Congress  gave the installation the name we call it today. Fort Knox was at the  center of the mechanization of the cavalry, and it can proudly take  credit for developing many of the tactics that helped win World War II.   As a vital contributor to our national security, Fort Knox has served  wide-ranging roles throughout its 100 years. For instance, in 1937, it  became the home of the U.S. bullion depository and the guardian of our  Nation's most valuable assets and, at times, some of the world's most  precious possessions. During the darkest days of the Second World War,  the depository guarded the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the  Constitution.   Fort Knox is also the proud home of the General George Patton Museum  and Center of Leadership, a tourist destination honoring one of the  giants of American military history.   While we celebrate the installation's remarkable history, we also  recognize that Fort Knox continues to play a dynamic and integral role  in our conventional force structure and our State's economy. In 2009,  the Army Human Resources Command relocated to Fort Knox and led to the  construction of the Army Human Resources Center, the largest project in  the base's history. It's also the home to the Army's Recruiting Command  and Cadet Command, which hosts thousands of Army cadets each year for  Cadet Summer Training. Most recently, the First Theater Sustainment  Command moved to Fort Knox in 2017. These units add an indispensable  benefit to our national security, and I am proud to have each one of  them in Kentucky. Further, the installation has been recognized on  numerous occasions in the Army's Communities of Excellence program and  has developed a highly recognized energy savings program. At the same  time, the surrounding community has established a number of supportive  initiatives to help military families and transitioning Army personnel  pursue regional employment opportunities.   From its origin as a camp with 40,000 acres, this multifunctional  military installation has grown to cover approximately 109,000 acres  and is the sixth largest urban area in Kentucky. The centennial  celebration is bigger than the Army, involving a passionate community  that supports the installation and the men and women serving there. It  is my utmost privilege to join each of them in sending my  congratulations to Fort Knox and to all of the Army personnel there for  reaching this milestone. During the many events planned to mark the  occasion, I wish them all the very best and would like to once again  thank them for all they do to keep our nation safe. I urge all of my  Senate colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S.
