 Madam Speaker, Americans are seething over the price of gas  every time they visit the pump.   Yesterday the national average for a gallon of gas reached $3.39.  That is more than a $1.24 jump since last year.   Americans have not seen gas prices this high since the Obama-Biden  administration. Do we see a pattern here?   Not to mention that in some parts of the country, the price for  regular gas is over $7.50 a gallon.   Madam Speaker, this is yet another crisis that President Biden can  tack on to his growing list.   Since his first day in office, President Biden's actions, and  especially his policies, have brought America a first-class ticket to  economic ruin.                            ____________________
