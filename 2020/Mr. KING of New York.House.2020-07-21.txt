 Madam Speaker, it is really a privilege to be  here today to welcome Chris Jacobs to the House of Representatives.   As Congresswoman Lowey said, he has a long career both in government  and being active in his community, especially setting up an inner city  scholarship fund for the City of Buffalo, serving as Secretary of State  for the State of New York, then being elected Erie County Clerk, and  then being elected New York State senator.   It is a very perilous time to be coming to Congress. The country is  going through extreme tension and conflict. The fact is, Chris has the  credentials, he has the qualifications, and he has the ability to make  sure that he will do  [[Page H3596]]  the best for his constituents, for the entire Congress, and also for  the country.   So with that, Chris, I am really proud to welcome you here today.   And, again, sometimes you hear about all of the partisanship. Believe  me, we in New York do try to work together. Nita and I, we don't always  agree on everything, but we always find a way to work together. This is  true of most of the members of the delegation. I have no doubt that you  will do an outstanding, excellent job. I look forward to working with  you over the next several months.
