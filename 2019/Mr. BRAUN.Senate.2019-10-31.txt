 Mr. President, today I voted against amendment No. 1141. I  would like to take an opportunity to explain my position.   In September 2019, the Treasury Department reported, in accordance  with Federal laws, that the highway trust fund's mass transit account  had an unfunded authorization of $27 billion but only estimated $26  billion in revenue to be collected over the next 4 years. In other  words, the account was expected to take on more than $1 billion in  obligations than it would be able to collect in revenue.   Instead of correcting the problem, the Jones amendment ignored it,  preventing Treasury from implementing the law to bring the mass transit  account back into balance.   Since I joined this body in January, I have repeatedly noted my  concern for our nearly $1 trillion annual budget deficit and our more  than $22 trillion  [[Page S6328]]  Federal debt. Washington is broken. We do not have the money to finance  even the most basic functions of our government: infrastructure and our  national defense.   Today's vote was an example of the consequences we may face when  Congress lets these serious financial issues languish. We cannot  continue to ignore these problems. We cannot continue to pretend our  fiscal problems are solved by waving away protections placed by prior  Congresses.   I believe that Congress must fix this problem and bring our trust  funds into long-term solvency. When the Environment and Public Works  Committee approved our highway bill in July, I ensured the bill  contained language stating our intent to do just that.   Today, Congress was lucky--we could push our spending problem off to  another day. One day soon, we will not be so lucky.                            ____________________
