 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and congratulate Carter Smith of Cresson, Pennsylvania.  Carter has accepted a fully qualified appointment to the United States  Military Academy at West Point. Carter is the son of Gary and Holly  Lynne Smith.   As a student at Penn Cambria High School, Carter was heavily involved  in the speech club, theater, and the National Honor Society, as well as  both the football and basketball teams.   In addition to having a long resume of extracurricular activities,  Carter has excelled in the classroom as well, maintaining a 4.0 GPA.   April Gergely, Carter's English teacher, had nothing but positive  things to say about him in her letter of recommendation.   She said: ``Carter stood out as an extremely hardworking,  intelligent, perceptive, detail-oriented, honest, reliable, and mature  student.''   I am confident Carter's experience in and out of the classroom will  serve him well as he looks forward to this exciting new phase of life.   I thank Carter for his commitment to our Nation, and I wish him the  best of luck at West Point.                            ____________________
