 Mr. Chair, I think what we are seeing here today  is the Republican Party's attempt to take some of the most heinous  legislation that we are seeing passed on the State level to attack our  trans and LGBT, as well as people from marginalized communities' right  to exist in schools.   This flowery language of ``parental rights and freedom'' hides the  sinister fact of this legislative text. If you notice in these  arguments, they are not really discussing what is actually in this  legislation.   It includes two provisions that require schools to out trans,  nonbinary, and LGBT youth even if it would put said youth in harm's  way.   One of the highest rates of youth homelessness is in the LGBT  community, from parents who want to kick their children out in  households that may be unstable or abusive. For so many children of  abuse, school is their only safe place to be.   Before they claim that this is not about banning books and not about  harming the LGBT community, let's just look at the impacts of similar  Republican legislation that has already passed on the State level.   Look at these books that have already been banned due to Republican  measures: ``The Life of Rosa Parks''; this apparently is too woke by  the Republican Party. ``Song of Solomon'' is unacceptable to Republican  politics. Forty percent of banned books reported are significantly  addressing and specifically addressing LGBT issues.   To say and talk about government reach and freedom, this Republican  bill is asking the government to force the outing of LGBT people before  they are ready.   Talking about the rights of parents, the National Parents Union is  here in this gallery today saying: Don't do this.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter where the National  Parents Union is asking the Republican Party to: ``Keep culture wars  out of classrooms. Our children need urgent and aggressive educational  solutions. . . .''  The National Parents Union Issues Statement Concerning the Introduction    of the Parents Bill of Rights By Chair Foxx, Speaker McCarthy, and                                 House GOP         March 1, 2023--Boston, MA--The National Parents Union,       released a statement following a press conference spearheaded       by the Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, Speaker Kevin       McCarthy, and members of the House Republican Conference:        Today, Chairwoman Foxx, of the House of Representatives       Education and Workforce Committee, released a new bill that       claims to be a Parents Bill of Rights. A true Parents Bill of       Rights can only be developed following an extensive process       that includes bringing together a broad spectrum of parents       representing every intersectionality of the modern American       family.        Nowhere in this Parents Bill of Rights does it guarantee       parents that their student will have access to a high quality       education that prepares them for a life of opportunity. In       fact, this faux Bill of Rights glosses over the issues       identified as the most important issues facing our children:       school safety, the mental health crisis impacting students,       and aggressively focusing on addressing the academic       challenges that have the potential to hinder our children       from achieving economic mobility and competing for the jobs       of the future.        This bill has nothing to do with parent rights and       everything to do with the radical culture wars that serve as       a distraction from what our students' really need to recover       from the pandemic. This bill would lead to more education       bans, which takes books off classroom shelves and will       therefore limit access to education for millions of kids       across the country. From national polling we know that the       top priorities identified by the vast majority of families       are the safety of their children while at school and the       urgent need for mental health supports. This bill fails to       address either issue and therefore is clearly not intended       for the millions of families who have been demanding       leadership from federal, state and local lawmakers.        There are ways to write a Parents Bill of Rights in a way       that guarantees student progress and addresses the crises       that our schools and families face across the country. This       is not that.     Mr. Chair, I also include in the Record a letter  from the American Library Association coming out against this  Republican proposal.                                    American Library Association,                                                     March 16, 2023.      Re H.R. 5, ``Parents Bill of Rights Act''--OPPOSE.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy and Leader Jeffries: The American       Library Association (``ALA'') writes to express our       opposition to certain provisions of H.R. 5 (``Parents Bill of       Rights Act'') and to urge a NO vote on H.R. 5.        Unquestionably, parents should have a voice in their       child's education. However, we must oppose H.R. S's school       library provisions, which ironically would lead to more  [[Page H1356]]       government interference in family decisions regarding       voluntary reading. These provisions:        Are unnecessary and unwarranted;        Would create a catalyst for more book banning and       censorship; and        Would create unfunded federal mandates and regulation where       none are needed, at the cost of educating students.        This letter explains each of these concerns below and       provides background information about school libraries and an       analysis of the bill's school library provisions.          School Libraries are Essential to Educational Achievement         According to the National Center for Education Statistics,       88 percent of all public schools had a school library in       2020-21. School libraries and librarians play essential roles       in promoting educational achievement, including by fostering       a love of reading which encourages students' development of       key literacy skills. School libraries offer a variety of age-      appropriate materials for voluntary reading, which is central       to helping students discover the joy of reading. School       library collections are typically overseen by school       librarians who hold a Master's in Library Science or       comparable degree from an ALA-accredited graduate program,       and who in many states are required to hold a state       certification. Library collections are developed in       accordance with professional standards, the school's       collection development and reconsideration policies, and the       requirements of applicable law, including the U.S.       Constitution.                Analysis of H.R. 5's School Library Provisions         The following provisions, as contained in Rules Committee       Print 118-2, would impose new federal requirements on local       school libraries.        Section 104 would require local educational agencies that       receive funding under federal Education Department programs       to notify parents that they have the right to a ``list of the       books and other reading materials contained in the library of       their child's school'' and to ``inspect such books or other       reading materials,'' and to provide parents with such list       and opportunity to inspect such materials at the beginning of       each school year.        Section 202 would require local educational agencies that       receive funding under federal Education Department programs       to make available for inspection by parents ``any books or       other reading materials made available to students in such       school or through the school library of such school,'' and to       adopt a policy providing for such inspection upon the request       of the parent.        Section 202 also contains reporting provisions, which would       require:        Local educational agencies that receive funding under       federal Education Department programs to annually ``report to       the State educational agency any enforcement actions or       investigations carried out for the preceding school year to       ensure compliance with this section'' and to ``publish such       information on its website;''        State educational agencies, in turn, to annually report       information received from local educational agencies to the       federal Education Department, as well as ``a description of       the enforcement actions the State educational agency took to       ensure parents' rights were protected;'' and        The federal Secretary of Education to annually report       information received from states to Congress, along with ``a       description of the enforcement actions taken by the Secretary       [. . .] to ensure full compliance.''        Finally, Section 202 directs the Secretary to ``take such       action as the Secretary determines appropriate to enforce       this section;'' including the authority to terminate federal       funding ``if the Secretary determines that there has been a       failure to comply with such section, and compliance with such       section cannot be secured by voluntary means.''        The bill would not provide funding to implement these       requirements.     The Bill's School Library Provisions Are Unnecessary and Unwarranted         The bill's school library provisions appear to be a       solution in search of a problem. We are not aware of any       situations where parents were not allowed access to the       school library's catalog or materials. It is standard       practice in today's school libraries to maintain online       catalogs of their library materials and make such catalogs       available to parents and students. School librarians welcome       the opportunity to engage with parents in support of the       student's education and fostering a love of reading. That is       precisely why school libraries exist, and why school       librarians have chosen their profession.        Furthermore, these provisions are unwarranted. As described       above, school libraries provide access to a variety of age-      appropriate materials. Notably, these are not mandatory       instructional materials, but voluntary choices for student-      directed reading. If a student isn't interested in a       particular book, they can simply choose another book.    The Bill's School Library Provisions Would Create a Catalyst for More                        Book Banning and Censorship         We are very concerned about the potential negative       unintended consequences of book banning and censorship of       viewpoints if these federal requirements are imposed on local       schools.        The federal government should not dictate which materials       local school libraries can or cannot offer. Indeed, current       federal law prohibits the Education Department from       exercising ``any direction, supervision, or control [. . .]       over the selection or content of library resources'' by local       schools (20 U.S.C. 3403(b)). However, the school library       provisions of H.R. 5 would expand federal involvement in that       quintessentially local decision and invite more attempts to       censor information and ban books.        Imposing new federal regulation--including a federal       mandate for local schools to adopt new policies--would be       weaponized by a small minority who seek to censor what other       parents' children can read. The sad reality is that an       increasing number of state and local politicians in recent       years have acquiesced to extreme demands to censor reading       choices, and we fear that censorship may become even more       prevalent if these provisions are enacted.        We have already seen how destructive censorship can be with       the banning of books in many communities. Book bans now       include many shocking examples, including the banning of       children's books regarding the contributions to society by       individuals like Condoleezza Rice, Rosa Parks, and Malala       Yousafzai. We cannot support provisions that will, even if       unintentionally, lead to greater censorship and the banning       of children's books that contain subjects such as the       contributions of these historic figures.     The Bill's School Library Provisions Would Create Unfunded Federal  Mandates and Regulation Where None Are Needed, At the Cost of Educating                                  Students         As described above, the bill's requirements for school       libraries are essentially duplicative of standard local       practice. Nonetheless, by imposing new federal regulation on       local schools, the bill would create new paperwork       requirements, compliance burdens, and administrative costs,       including for rural and small schools that can least afford       them. These unfunded mandates would be another distraction       from schools' fundamental work to educate students. These       same provisions would hand the federal Education Department       new, broad authority to defund schools deemed to have       inadequately complied with these new federal regulations. If       enacted, these provisions would take dollars that should be       used to pay for books, librarians, and teachers, and require       that they instead be spent on administrators, bureaucrats,       and paperwork--to the detriment of the students our schools       should be focused on serving.                                  Conclusion         We believe that parents should be partners in their       children's education. However, H.R. 5's school library       provisions do nothing to advance that goal. Instead, they       would create unnecessary and unfunded federal mandates on       local school libraries that likely would result in more       government censorship of reading choices.        Congress should support freedom for parents and students to       choose what they want to read. Inspired by the wisdom of our       country's Founders, the First Amendment must be our guide       star. If anyone is to tell a child that they can't read a       book, it should be the child's parent, not a politician.       Congress should support students by strengthening school       libraries and protecting the freedom to read--not imposing       more bureaucratic burdens and invitations to censorship.        We are confident that parents want more books, not fewer,       in their children's school libraries.        Thank you for your consideration.

Inouye, Ph.D.,        Senior Director, Public Policy & Government Relations and       Interim Associate Executive Director American Library       Association.     Mr. Chair, when we talk about progressive values,  I can say what my progressive value is, and that is freedom over  fascism.
