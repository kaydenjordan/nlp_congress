 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  American people, our Republic, my colleagues, congressional staff,  Capitol Police officers, and the late Officer Brian Sicknick, in  support of H.R. 3233, the National Commission to Investigate the  January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act.   Let me be very clear: What took place on January 6 in the United  States Capitol Building was an act of domestic terrorism. To witness  this hallowed place, the seat of our democracy, being breached and  invaded by a mob of incensed blood-thirsty individuals, sycophants, all  as we barricaded ourselves in our offices and on this floor, fearing  for our lives, was devastating beyond belief. It was an attack on our  democracy. Full stop.   This commission is necessary to ensure all parties involved are  brought to justice and the American people are made aware of the facts  and causes that led to this heinous act of domestic terrorism.
