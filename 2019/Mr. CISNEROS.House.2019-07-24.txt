 Mr. Speaker, this week marks 200 days into my first  term as a Member of Congress. It has been an incredible honor to serve  the residents of the 39th Congressional District in California.   I am very proud of what we have accomplished so far in Congress, from  the passage of three of my pieces of bipartisan legislation this week,  which will expand access to benefits for veterans, servicemembers, and  their families; to the 32 amendments my colleagues and I have offered  that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis; and the three bipartisan  bills that I had the honor of supporting that have been signed into law  by the President.   I am most proud of our constituent services in the district. In just  200 days in office, we have retrieved over $190,000 from Federal  agencies for our constituents and worked on over 250 cases.   I work for the people of my district. It is why I have attended  hundreds of local events and met with thousands of my constituents.   I look forward to the next 100 days and beyond, working for the  people; bringing change to Washington, DC; and ensuring I give my  constituents the representation they deserve.                            ____________________
