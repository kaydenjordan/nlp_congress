 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize  Christian Braun of Burlington, KS.   Christian was one of the outstanding University of Kansas--KU-- players who helped lead the team to their National Championship game  victory. He is a fan favorite who was nominated for Academic All- American and an American All-Big 12 First Team honoree in 2020, 2021,  and 2022. Braun's former coach Ed Fritz said that what makes him stand  out is his honesty. He is not afraid to be quick to praise or hold  teammates accountable. I think this quality is what helped KU get to  the National Championship and is a great reflection of Kansas values as  a whole. His performance in the championship was nothing short of  spectacular. He showed great leadership and dedication in getting the  team to this win.   I want to congratulate and thank Mr. Braun for all the hours he put  into practicing and helping form this outstanding team. It takes great  dedication and determination to get where he is. The hours spent  practicing and perfecting his game helped KU get to this National  Championship. This victory will not be forgotten by Kansans--or at the  very least in Overland Park where Christian has his own day now after  winning this championship. Thank you for all you have done to represent  the great State of Kansas. We all thoroughly enjoyed watching Christian  play and can't wait to see what he does next. It is my honor to  congratulate him, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing  this wonderful win and wish him nothing but the best in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize Zach  Clemence, one of the outstanding University of Kansas--KU--players who  helped lead the team to their National Championship game victory. Zach,  who plays forward for the team, was a highly touted prospect for the  Jayhawks coming out of Sunrise Christian Academy in Bel Aire, KS. This  is Zach's first year with the Jayhawks, and he ends the season as a  National Champion.   I want to congratulate and thank Mr. Clemence for all the hours he  put into practicing and helping form this outstanding team. It takes  great dedication and determination to get to where he is. No doubt, his  effort and energy during games or in practice played a major factor in  the KU winning the National Championship. This victory will not be  forgotten by Kansans and will go down in history. We thank Zach for all  he has done to represent the great State of Kansas. We all thoroughly  enjoyed watching KU play this season and certainly can't wait to see  what Zach accomplishes in the future. It is my honor to congratulate  Zach, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this wonderful  victory and in wishing Zach nothing but the best in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize  Chris Teahan of Leawood, KS.   Chris was one of the outstanding University of Kansas--KU--players  who helped lead the team to KU's fourth NCAA Men's Basketball  Championship. He is a fan favorite who committed to the Jayhawks as a  guard as a walk-on for the team and has made an impact on the program  ever since, even earning a spot on the All-Academic Big 12 Second team  last year. He currently holds a sports management degree and plans to  pursue a graduate degree as he leaves KU basketball as a super-senior  and a national champion.   Chris attributes a lot of his success to his mom for pushing him to  be the best. He said he looks back on the time they spent together in  the gym as special, even if it came in moments he didn't want to be  there. She knew he had it in him; he just needed to see it, too. I want  to congratulate and thank Mr. Teahan for all the hours he put into  practicing and helping form this outstanding team. This victory will  not be forgotten by Kansans. I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing this wonderful success and wish him nothing but the best in  the following years.                            ____________________
