 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 58) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit  a study on the circumstances which may impact the effectiveness and  availability of first responders before, during, or after a terrorist  threat or event, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 58         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``First Responder       Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations'' or       the ``FRIENDS Act''.       SEC. 2. CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY IMPACT FIRST RESPONDERS                     DURING A TERRORIST EVENT.         (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit to the Committees on Homeland       Security and Transportation and Infrastructure of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report that describes       select State and local programs and policies, as appropriate,       related to the preparedness and protection of first       responders. The report may include information on--        (1) the degree to which such programs and policies include       consideration of the presence of a first responder's family       in an area impacted by a terrorist attack;        (2) the availability of personal protective equipment for       first responders;        (3) the availability of home Medkits for first responders       and their families for biological incident response; and        (4) other related factors.        (b) Context.--In preparing the report required under       subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the United States       may, as appropriate, provide information--        (1) in a format that delineates high risk urban areas from       rural communities; and        (2) on the degree to which the selected State and local       programs and policies included in such report were developed       or are being executed with funding from the Department of       Homeland Security, including grant funding from the State       Homeland Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security       Initiative under sections 2002 and 2003, respectively, of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 603 and 604).        (c) Homeland Security Consideration.--After issuance of the       report required under subsection (a), the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall consider such report's findings and       assess its applicability for Federal first responders.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 58, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, I welcome the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) to the  committee. I look forward to working together to do good work for the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, firefighters, police, EMS, and other first responders  are critical to our Nation's emergency management system. First  responders leave their own families, even during disasters, to protect  you and me.   As recently as this past August, we saw devastating flooding in Baton  Rouge and southeast Louisiana. The flooding touched every home,  including the homes of firefighters, police, hospital workers, and  other first responders. First responders focused on rescuing flood  victims, while they knew their own homes were flooded and their own  families were homeless.   This legislation would require a report on the State and local  programs and policies in place to prepare and protect first responders  and their families in times of disaster. Taking care of first  responders and their families gives our firefighters, police, and other  critical emergency personnel the peace of mind to focus on the task at  hand, rather than worrying whether their family is safe and taken care  of.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on H.R. 58, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. King of New York for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the Fusion Center  Enhancement Act of 2017. I thank Mr. King of New York and Chairman  McCaul for working with me to introduce this legislation.   The purpose of my bill is to clarify and enhance the partnership  between the Department of Homeland Security and the National Network of  Fusion Centers. The bill amends the existing statute to update the  Department's responsibilities for sharing information with State and  local law enforcement and other emergency personnel within the National  Network of Fusion Centers.   After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, State and local governments created  fusion centers as a way to communicate Federal homeland security  information to State and local law enforcement officials, as well as  fuse State and locally collected information with Federal intelligence.   Congress supported this partnership by mandating that the Office of  Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security  coordinate and share information with fusion centers. There are now 78  State and locally owned fusion centers across the country.   I would especially like to recognize the work of the Pennsylvania  Criminal Intelligence Center, PaCIC, which is run by the Pennsylvania  State Police. In 2015, our fusion center received the Fusion Center of  the Year Award from the National Fusion Center Association.   I want to congratulate the men and women working at PaCIC for their  commitment to security and public safety. They share vital information  with police departments that keep officers and our citizens safe.   PaCIC provides intelligence and information products to over 1,200  local, State, and Federal criminal justice agencies, while also working  with over 6,000 private and public center partners to also share  information to help protect critical infrastructure and key resources.   Our center has been nationally recognized for their training and  compliance with issues of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.  They produce documents that highlight threats and scams that target  Pennsylvanians, and help make sure that local police departments have  information on public events, ranging from the Little League World  Series to the visit of Pope Francis.   A significant amount of progress has been made by States and fusion  centers within the national network to improve information sharing and  analytic support. Many centers, including PaCIC, provide all crime, all  hazard support. They also maintain a focus on our homeland security  missions, including protecting critical information and sharing  suspicious activity reporting.   H.R. 642 recognizes the progress and focuses on enhancing the  Department of Homeland Security's responsibility to support, share  information, and coordinate with fusion centers. This includes  improving coordination with other Federal departments that provide  better operational intelligence, reduce inefficiencies, and coordinate  nationwide suspicious activity reporting.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former mayor, I  have heard concerns raised by law enforcement in my district and  elsewhere about the lack of information and coordination from several  DHS component agencies, including ICE and CBP. To address this issue, I  included language in this bill to direct the Department to ensure that  each component is providing information and personnel to work with  fusion centers.   To address the need for better accountability, language is included  throughout the bill requiring DHS to coordinate with fusion centers and  State Homeland Security Advisers in carrying out the assigned  responsibilities.   Additionally, there is a requirement for the Department to submit a  report to Congress on their efforts, including the components to  support fusion centers, and specifically report on how they are meeting  the requirements that are set forth in this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill so that we can  add important requirements and accountability in how the Department of  Homeland Security interacts and shares information with key State and  local stakeholders.
