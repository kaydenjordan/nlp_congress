 Madam Speaker, my thanks to my colleague from Texas for  giving me the opportunity to speak on this very important subject.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, though I have to  admit that it is easy to be somewhat pessimistic about its potential  effectiveness. But I am willing to try anything--anything--that might  work in elevating the Nation's debt situation in the minds of the  people we all represent.   The people I represent in Arkansas don't have a choice but to balance  their checkbooks, and if they can't, then they are limited in how much  they can borrow and for what. Sadly, the Federal Government doesn't  play by the same rules.   Madam Speaker, we are $29 trillion in debt. We have budget deficits  as far as the eyes can see. We are mortgaging the futures of our kids  and our grandkids. And it is painfully obvious to me that the governing  majority doesn't really care much about deficits and debt. But Third  District Arkansans do.   I had the honor of co-chairing a joint select committee in 2018 that  tried to address the budget and appropriations process that has tripped  up the Congress every year since I have been here, and to think that we  are only funded through the third day of December, with no assurance of  a full year's appropriation by then, something has to be done.   A fiscal state of the Union is one of the recommendations that came  from our joint select committee, but I will remind everyone that we  need three more--count them, three more--Democrat votes to move those  recommendations. And four, Madam Speaker, four Democrats voted  ``present.''   So forgive me if I don't sound terribly optimistic that Congress will  get its act together. But maybe, just maybe, something like this will  force a rational discussion before we have what is coming: a sovereign  debt crisis.   So, I am willing to try, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.
