 Madam Speaker, I rise today with great honor and pride to  announce that Clarence Cummings, Jr., a 21-year-old constituent of mine  from Beaufort, South Carolina, will be an important part of the 2021  Olympic weightlifting team and their effort to bring home the first  gold in over 60 years for the red, white, and blue.   Mr. Cummings' record is extensive, to say the least. He holds 23  American records in weightlifting. In his weight class, he holds the  Junior World Record in the snatch, clean and jerk, and total.   He is world respected and well regarded for his feat in the clean and  jerk.   He was the IWF Junior World Champion in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.  In 2016 and 2017 he was the IWF Youth World Champion. He is also the  Pan-American Champion for 2019 and 2020. I also  [[Page H2826]]  want to point out that Mr. Cummings accomplished all of these records  before he turned 21.   I am immensely proud, as I know everyone in the Lowcountry is, of Mr.  Cummings for all of the hard work and determination and dedication he  has given to his sport and to his country.   I cannot wait to watch him win the gold medal for the United States  in the Olympic Games in Tokyo. His journey is truly an inspiration to  weightlifters, to athletes of all types, and to all Americans. I cannot  be more proud.   God bless Mr. Cummings, the great State of South Carolina, and the  United States of America.                            ____________________
