 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the work of the  [[Page H4804]]  Troup County Drug Court in LaGrange, Georgia. I had the opportunity to  speak at their commencement ceremony last week while I was back in the  district.   This program holds offenders with substance abuse and mental health  disorders accountable through strict supervision and treatment, and  allows them to get their lives back on track.   As a dentist, I have had the opportunity to work with those suffering  from substance abuse problems through my work with Hope Harbor, a  Christian recovery center in my district. I have seen firsthand that,  for every addiction, there is a real human being behind the statistic.  These men and women have the potential to live long, productive lives  serving their families and communities, and programs like this help  them do just that.   The success rate of these programs speaks volumes about their value  to the community and those that graduate from the program. Seventy-five  percent of drug court graduates never reoffend. This is almost 2\1/2\  times higher than the 30 percent success rate of those who serve a  prison sentence and receive no treatment.   I commend the hard work of the men and women of the Troup County Drug  Court.                            ____________________     I thank Mr. Smucker for yielding to me.   I, too, would like to express my appreciation for Representative  Thompson for taking the lead on this on our side of aisle. He did a  great job. I also appreciate Representative Krishnamoorthi from  Illinois, who worked tirelessly to make this a real solid bill. So  thanks to both of them. Thank you for taking time to lead these Special  Orders tonight.    In my district and throughout Georgia, our school systems, technical  colleges, and communities are creating innovative career tech  opportunities to help transition students into a workforce through dual  enrollment with the Technical College System of Georgia, work-based  learning apprenticeships, and Career Academies like the THINC Academy  in LaGrange, the Central Education Center in Newnan, and 12 for Life in  Carrollton, Georgia.   These programs are helping our young people make the transition from  high school directly into the workforce, and they are also helping  adult learners transition into new careers.   I visited these centers and learned about these education programs,  and they provide a meaningful transition for these students. They rely  heavily on the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Eduction Act. This  is a pivotal workforce development tool. It enables our education  leaders to develop tailored programs that reflect the workforce needs,  leveraging small dollars for very large outcomes.   Travelling throughout my district, the number one issue I hear from  business and education leaders is workforce development. I have seen  examples across the Third District of how community stakeholders are  pulling together to do their part to develop career tech education and,  in turn, create opportunities for young people to climb the ladder of  success.   I am so impressed by the emerging partnerships that have naturally  come about as these groups work to close the skills gap that we have in  this country. They know the urgent need we have to educate students and  develop these skills to fill the demands of a 21st century job.   This is a story of so many of our communities across the country and  the reason why I support the effort to move forward and reauthorize the  Perkins CTE. Reauthorizing Perkins CTE will upgrade the law and more  accurately reflect the needs and work being done by States and local  communities, providing flexibility, streamlined application processes,  promoting partnerships, accountability, and a limited Federal role.   It is time to make these reforms, and I proudly support H.R. 2353.
