 Mr. Speaker, Southeastern University is a Christian liberal  arts college located in my hometown of Lakeland, Florida. The  university is known for its commitment to providing students with a  Spirit-empowered, Christ-centered education through integration of  faith, learning, and service.   Today, I rise to recognize a recent proud accomplishment for  Southeastern University. Last Thursday, May 31, 2018, the Southeastern  University Fire men's baseball team defeated Freed-Hardeman University  to win the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics World  Series.   On their road to victory, the team also defeated four former national  champions and had three of their players selected to join the 2018 All- American team: Johnathan Bermudez, Dan Valerio, and Jordan Scott.   The national championship is the first NAIA title by a Fire team  since joining the association in the fall of 2009. I am both proud and  inspired by this young team and their head coach, Adrian Dinkel, for  the determination, commitment, and teamwork they have demonstrated on  their road to victory.   Southeastern University is a tremendous educational institution, led  by Dr. Kent Ingle, and this win is a terrific achievement not only for  the school, but also for our local community.   Go Fire.                            ____________________
