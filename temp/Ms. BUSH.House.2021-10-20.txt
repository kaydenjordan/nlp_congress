 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise because in 2020, four  Black women and girls were murdered per day in our country, and that  kind of violence has continued in St. Louis with many Black women and  girls being shot, some murdered over recent months.   This is personal. I have had bullets fly past my head. I have been  left for dead by a partner. I worry about whether my own daughter will  get home safely.   We rise united under our message: We will break the cycles of  violence that are killing Black women and mothers, our sons and our  daughters, our trans and nonbinary neighbors, and our sex workers.   We urgently need the $5 billion for community-based violence  prevention services in the Build Back Better Act, and we won't stop  until we have all that we need to keep each other safe.                            ____________________
