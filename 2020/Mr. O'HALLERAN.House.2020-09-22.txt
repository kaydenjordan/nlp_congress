 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my  Blackwater Trading Post Land Transfer Act, which passed the House of  Representatives by voice vote yesterday.   I would like to thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop for  moving this bill through regular order. My bill is a commonsense fix  that will bring the Blackwater Trading Post, which the Gila River  Indian Community owns, into trust status. The Blackwater Trading Post  is a culturally and historically significant place.   As Members of Congress, we are able to restore Tribal homelands. I am  honored that we did so yesterday. During these difficult times, I am  glad that we are able to advance legislation that serves our  constituents.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for helping me move  this initiative across the finish line. The Gila River Indian Community  has worked hard to acquire this land, and passing this bill today is a  celebration of their effort.                            ____________________
