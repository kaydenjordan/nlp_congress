 Madam President, I understand there are two bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Madam President, later today, the Senate will vote on  a resolution related to the state of emergency the President has  declared on our southern border. Let me first say, I support the  President's decision. So I will vote today to uphold it and reject this  resolution of disapproval.   I want to begin where this whole discussion should begin--beyond all  the partisan rhetoric and denials of reality we see from our friends  across the aisle, just the facts of the matter, and the facts are not  at all ambiguous. There is a clear border security and humanitarian  crisis on the southern border of the United States of America.   It was only last week that the President's top officials in the  matter--Secretary Nielsen and CBP Commissioner McAleenan--each came  before Congress to once again lay all this out.   The man charged with protecting our Nation's borders didn't mince  words ahead of last week's hearing. This is what he had to say: ``The  system is well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point.''   The system is well beyond capacity and remains at the breaking point.  The Commissioner pointed out to our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee that the 76,000 attempted illegal crossings documented in  February marked an 11-year high for that month, and, based on CBP  projections, by the middle of this month--tomorrow--apprehensions for  fiscal year 2019 will already be twice what they were in all of fiscal  year 2017.   In front of the House Homeland Security Committee, the Secretary of  Homeland Security elaborated by saying the following: ``Our capacity is  already severely strained, but these increases will overwhelm the  system completely.''   This is one of the President's senior advisers--a Cabinet Secretary-- and she is telling Members of Congress that the current situation is  very much a crisis, one that requires immediate action.   Over the past 5 years, CBP has recorded a 620-percent increase in  apprehensions of family units at the U.S.-Mexico border. Last year's  figure marked an alltime high.   Research suggests upward of 30 percent of women apprehended at the  border report experiencing sexual assault during the journeys. Lately,  a daily average of 56 individuals taken into CBP custody have required  emergency medical care.   The men and women of the Border Patrol are great. They are well  trained, they are highly skilled, and they volunteered for a very  challenging job, but today they are facing challenges they are not  fully equipped to overcome.   It is no secret I take the Senate as an institution extremely  seriously. I take the separation of powers extremely seriously. I take  Congress's prerogative over appropriations extremely seriously, but--as  I argued yesterday in the context of the Yemen resolution--the Senate  should not be in the business of misusing specific resolutions to  express opinions on more general matters.   President Trump has not invoked some vague article II authority or  simply swept aside existing law, as President Obama did to establish  his DACA  [[Page S1856]]  policy. He has simply operated within existing law--the National  Emergencies Act of 1976--to invoke a narrow set of authorities to  reprogram a narrow set of funds.   If Congress has grown uneasy with this new law, as many have, then we  should amend it. If the 116th Congress regrets the degree of  flexibility the 94th Congress gave the Executive, the 116th Congress  has the ability to do something about it. I have suggested to the chair  of the Homeland Security Committee that they examine how the law can be  updated to reflect these concerns. I hope they can report bipartisan  solutions through the regular order that the full Senate can actually  take up.   Let's not lose sight of the particular question that is before us  later today, whether the facts tell us there is truly a humanitarian  and security crisis on our southern border and whether the Senate, for  some reason, feels this particular emergency on our own border does not  rise to the level of the 31 other national emergencies which are  currently in effect.   In my own view, these narrow questions are not especially difficult  ones to answer. The President is operating within existing law, and the  crisis on our border is all too real. So I will vote to support the  President's decision later today, and I encourage our colleagues to do  the same.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a completely different matter, few  of us can aspire to the fame and fortune that are signified when a  celebrity is known by just one name.   There is Cher; there was Prince; there is Madonna; and there is  ``Stew.'' Everybody knows Stew--not Don Stewart, certainly not Don,  just Stew.   For more than 12 years, Stew has been the larger-than-life  personality patrolling the Ohio Clock corridor, camping out in the  Press Gallery, and prowling the hallways of the Capitol complex--the  guy who knows everything about policy, procedure, and communications  with the office just off the Senate floor.   Stew is one of the best known staff members in all of Congress. It  has been my great fortune to lean heavily on him every single day for  more than a decade as my communications director and deputy chief of  staff.   So, you can imagine, it is proving difficult to grasp that today is  the very last workday I will have Stew by my side. After serving so  well for so long, he is taking a leave--shall we say--for greener  pastures.   So, this morning, I am exacting a little revenge. I am doing the one  thing I suspect will make my deputy chief of staff's stomach churn more  than anything else. I am actually turning the spotlight on him.   Now, the complete ``Legend of Stew'' is somewhat of a winding tale.  This scrappy son of Riverside, CA, did not stroll a typical path to the  corridors of power.   What came after high school was work, including what I understand was  a spell as a bouncer. I am certain that position offered no useful  preparation at all for wrangling our distinguished friends in the press  corps. Then came Army service, then back to school in Georgia, and then  politics.   Our late colleague Senator Coverdell hired Stew to represent him with  his constituents down in Georgia. Not long after, he asked him to  relocate to Washington.   The way I understand it, the ink was barely dry on Stew's lease, and  the unpacking had just started when his boss tragically passed away,  but Stew landed on his feet. He found his way to a pair of tough  Texans, handling press for Senator Phil Gramm and then Senator Cornyn.  He became famous as the communications director who could outsmart  everybody and outwork everybody in a town where it is very hard to do  either.   That is where Stew caught my eye. As I prepared, in 2006, for the  possibility of becoming Republican leader, I knew we would need the  most sophisticated communications shop a Senate leader had ever  constructed, and it was clear Stew was the guy to build it.   Something else quickly became clear too. Stew was not quite like  anybody else any of us had ever met before. One former colleague  recalls that Stew would end a phone call with a plan already formed in  his mind, then push off his desk with both hands, sending his rolling  chair rocketing backward and slamming into the wall behind him. That  high-octane crash was the official notification that Stew was about to  make something happen. ``It was really endearing,'' this colleague  explained, ``in retrospect.''   Restless energy has always been Stew's calling card. Every news  story, every request from reporters, every shift in public sentiment,  Stew was literally on top of it all. Seven days a week, almost  literally 24 hours a day.   I was recently reminded that, in Stew's early days with me, some  around the Capitol questioned whether he was an actual person or some  kind of automated email system our office had built to blast out memos  and bulletins literally around the clock.   The instant mobile devices started to provide email alerts, Stew's  bat-like sleeping habits and inexhaustible work ethic probably rendered  half the alarm clocks in Washington completely obsolete.   Questions, answers, press clippings, battle plans, they would pour  into inboxes until after midnight, pause for a couple of hours, and  resume before anyone else had even woken up, but circadian rhythms  weren't the only thing Stew's presence reprogrammed. His energy, his  careful foresight, his patriotism, all these things were just as  infectious.   As our chief spokesman, key strategist, close adviser, team leader,  morale-builder, resident dog lover, heavy metal music aficionado, and  happy warrior, Stew helped me in my office through the Iraq war, the  financial crisis, seismic policy battles, nomination debates, three  different Presidents, and two reelection campaigns.   No matter what the day brought, I always knew what my deputy chief of  staff would bring--razor-sharp instincts, a level head, a steady hand,  and a boatload of integrity. For more than 12 years, I entrusted Stew  with my words, my goals, and my reputation, and he has never let me  down. He never flagged. He never slowed. Our watchdog never lost a  step. He is totally trustworthy, completely reliable, and unbelievably  competent--the greatest luxury a leader could have.   With these characteristics, you might think the person I am  describing could be a little stiff, a little stern. Maybe that energy  would occasionally boil over into harsh words or heated moments. But,  remember, Stew is a bit of an unusual guy. That intensity doesn't  overflow into frustration or unkindness or sharp words; instead, it  overflows into generosity, good-heartedness, and compassion.   Stew is famous around Washington for his encyclopedic memory of  birthdays, kids' birthdays, and anniversaries. Like clockwork, notes  and greeting cards arrive, and texts and emails roll in. What I am  saying is that work challenges aren't the only thing Stew is good at  keeping in perspective. I was reminded of that fact a few months back  when Stew brought his mother, Nancy, to visit here in the Senate. For  all the history Stew has helped make, for every victory when he has  allowed himself a brief smile, his colleagues aren't sure they have  ever seen him happier than when he was ushering his mom around the  corridors and showing her all he has built.   For all Stew's own accomplishments, we aren't sure we have ever seen  him prouder than when he brags on his daughter Kylie. Lately, that has  meant her career in software engineering and the apps she has created.  Stew loves his family. He is loyal to his family. It is just our good  luck that he came to see the Senate as part of that family as well.   My former chief of staff reminded me of the day he brought his boys  to work. Stew loves kids, so he made a beeline, but one son felt a  little shy. Instead of shrugging and walking away, it somehow occurred  to Stew to say this: ``Did you know I could do a standing jump right  onto that table right there?'' One more time for good measure--he is  kind of a unique individual. The boy was understandably perplexed, but  then this friendly stranger crouched down and leapt right up onto the  table, with tie, dress shoes, and everything--a total spectacle, just  to put that young man at ease and coax a smile. That is not your  typical Senate moment, but that is the thing--for me and  [[Page S1857]]  for all of Stew's colleagues, that level of good cheer and concern for  others really has been typical for a dozen years.   That is why his departure has triggered an avalanche of tributes from  people all over Washington and beyond, people--many of them junior  people--whom he wrote back with advice, met for coffee, shared some  wisdom; this sprawling family tree of men and women who all feel that,  one way or another, they owe a significant part of their success and  careers to him. On that note, I have to say I know exactly how they  feel.   So today I have to say goodbye to an all-star staff leader who took  his job about as seriously as anybody you will ever meet but who took  himself far less seriously than most people you will ever meet in the  process. Professional excellence and personal humility are rare  virtues. Having a heavy dose of either is impressive, but only the  combination can explain Stew. There are plenty of people in this town  who haven't tackled nearly the challenges or rubbed nearly the elbows  he has, but you better believe their egos dwarf his. His resume looks  like he belongs in fancy cocktail parties in tony neighborhoods, but I  am not positive Stew would even be allowed into a fancy cocktail party.  Regardless, I doubt he would find much time for the elite guests; he  would be too engrossed in conversation with the security guards, valet  parking attendants, hospitality staff, talking Nationals baseball and  everything else under the Sun with the people who actually made the  thing go.   Never before yesterday had I seen a large number of Capitol police  officers gather to surprise a departing Senate staffer and send him off  as if he were one of their own. That is the admiration and love that  Stew has for the men and women who keep us safe--and vice versa. I know  nothing I say today will really compete with that tribute. The only  kind of man who would earn that sort of salute is the kind of man who  would prize it above and beyond any fancy praise offered in a place  like this. Don't get me wrong. Stew reveres this institution, but he  never once seemed to covet the trappings or the power for its own sake;  he just seemed honored to serve.   My colleagues and I are sad to bid farewell to the Senate staffer who  made himself thoroughly famous by trying not to make himself famous. We  are sorry to part with our tough-talking workaholic who can't bypass a  cute puppy without stopping for a good scratch and a photo shoot. We  will sorely miss our true-blue patriot who so loves this country where  a kid can grow up from working odd jobs to counseling Senators and  statesmen and not lose an ounce of his character along the way.   Stew, we can't quite imagine a place without you, but we are so  grateful for what you have made it while you were here.   Happy trails, buddy.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
