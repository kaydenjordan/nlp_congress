 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate General  Stephen E. Osborne for being appointed by Governor Kim Reynolds as the  28th Adjunct General of the Iowa National Guard.   General Osborne is a native of Davenport, Iowa, and enlisted in the  Army in 1984, actually 10 years after my own enlistment in the Army. He  went on to commission as an infantry officer through the University of  Alabama in 1990 before transferring to the Iowa National Guard in 1992.   General Osborne deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1991 during  the Persian Gulf war. He then deployed to Kosovo in 2004 in support of  Operation Joint Guardian and Iraq in 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi  Freedom.   He has served as the Iowa National Guard's deputy adjunct general  since 2018 and will now manage more than 2,000 full-time employees and  nearly 9,000 part-time soldiers and airmen in his new role as adjunct  general.   Iowans can trust the National Guard will be in great hands under the  leadership of General Osborne. I wish him the very best as he  transitions into this important role.              Celebrating Iowa Vietnam Veterans Recognition Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Iowa  Vietnam Veterans Recognition Day, which was held yesterday, May 8, and  to recognize our veterans' service to this great Nation. The  commemorative ceremony is held annually to honor our 115,000 Iowan  Vietnam veterans for their service and remember the 868 Iowans who made  the ultimate sacrifice during the war. This year's ceremony was held at  the Iowa Vietnam Veterans Memorial, dedicated to those who died in  combat or after the war as a result of their service.   The Vietnam war was one of our country's most painful times, and our  veterans were often not welcomed home. My brother was one of those. I  take this chance to thank all of them for their bravery, sacrifice, and  strength.   During last week's recess, I had the privilege of visiting with  veterans across the First District. As an elected official and as chair  of the Subcommittee on Health of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee,  I felt it was my duty to reassure them that the Limit, Save, Grow Act  would not cut veterans' benefits or resources. As long as I am in  Congress, I will always fight to improve and protect our veterans'  benefits.   It is important that we always take the time to recognize the  patriotism, dedication, and willingness of our veterans to fight for  our liberties and our way of life. Our servicemembers dedicate their  lives to protecting our Nation, and it is our duty to honor those  commitments both during and after their service.                            ____________________
