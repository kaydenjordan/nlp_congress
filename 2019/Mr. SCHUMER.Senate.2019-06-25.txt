 Madam President, before I begin, I just heard the leader  conclude his remarks. He didn't mention the fact today that he is  meeting with several constituents of mine from New York, including John  Feal and other 9/11 first responders, to discuss a solution to the  shortfall in the Victim Compensation Fund.   I am glad the leader has agreed to meet with them. It is a good  thing, but it is not enough to have just a meeting. These brave men and  women who selflessly rushed to the towers in the midst of danger, when  no one knew what would come next, deserve a commitment that their bill  will be considered in a timely manner here on the floor.   So, again, I urge Leader McConnell to listen to the 9/11 first  responders. Then give them your commitment, Leader McConnell, that you  will put their bill on the Senate floor as soon as it passes the House  as a standalone bill. It will pass the House; it will certainly pass  the Senate, given the cosponsorship; and the President will sign it.  The families of those who, just like our soldiers, rushed to danger to  protect our safety can breathe a sigh of relief.   Leader McConnell is the one person--this is not a dual  responsibility--I wish it were, at least when we are in the minority,  but Leader McConnell is the one person who controls the calendar on the  Senate floor. He can stand in the way, as he has done before, or he can  do the right thing and commit to give this bill the attention it  deserves. I will be eagerly waiting to hear what the leader says after  he meets with the first responders this afternoon.                                     Iran    Madam President, on Iran and the NDAA, ever since President Trump  unilaterally decided to abandon the Iran nuclear agreement, our two  countries have been on a path toward greater conflict. In the past  month, Iran has heightened its aggressive actions in the region,  prompting responses from the U.S. Government. No one looks at Iran  through rose-colored glasses. That is why Americans, myself included,  are worried about the current course of events. Escalation happens  quickly in the Middle East. Without a steady hand at the helm, without  a coherent plan or strategy--things this President has lacked since the  moment he took office--the danger of bumbling into war is acute.   Democrats have been urging Leader McConnell to allow us a vote on an  amendment to the NDAA concerning a possible conflict with Iran. We have  an amendment, led by Senators Udall, Merkley, Murphy, and Kaine-- cosponsored by Republican Senators Paul and Lee--that would prohibit  any funds authorized by the current NDAA to be used to conduct  hostilities against the Government of Iran.   Again, this is a dangerous situation. Even if the President doesn't  intend war, his erratic, inconsistent, and off-the-cuff policies could  lead us to bumble into war. When we are at war, it doesn't matter how  we got there. The loss of life and the loss of treasure, when we need  so much attention here in America, is very real.   So we have an amendment, and we are urging Leader McConnell to allow  us a simple vote on an amendment to the NDAA concerning a possible  conflict with Iran.  [[Page S4478]]    Let me repeat. The amendment is led by Udall, Merkley, Murphy, and  Kaine, cosponsored by Paul and Lee. So it is bipartisan. It prohibits  any funds authorized by the current NDAA to be used to conduct  hostilities against the Government of Iran.   Contrary to what the leader just said, the Udall amendment would  not--would not--diminish our military's ability to respond to a  provocation or act in self-defense. The way the leader characterized  the amendment is just not true. He deliberately distorted the  amendment. He knows better. The Udall amendment preserves absolutely  our military's ability to act in self-defense, and it would make it  perfectly clear that if President Trump wants to send our Nation to  war, he would need Congress to authorize it first, as stipulated by our  Constitution.   There is no greater power that the Founding Fathers gave to Congress  than the ability to go to war. They were worried about an Executive who  might be overreaching, who might be erratic, who might be  inconsistent--and we have never had an Executive who fits those  categories more than this current President--and they wanted Congress  to be a check. If the President had to explain why he wishes to go to  war, he might be more consistent and certainly less opaque. We should  have this amendment on the merits, but we also should have it because  this is how the Senate should work.                                   S. 1790    Leader McConnell said he would have an open amendment process. Here  is what he said:         [We'll] be turning to the NDAA shortly, that's one of the       most important bills we do every year. It will be open for       amendment.    Leader McConnell's words, not mine.         We expect to have a lot of member participation.    Leader McConnell's words, not mine.   It will be open for amendment, said Leader McConnell. That meaning is  pretty plain, but I must have misheard, and so must have America,  because the NDAA, let me repeat, is not open for amendment--not even  for a serious and timely and relevant debate on our policy with respect  to Iran, not even for a matter of war and peace and the constitutional  prerogative of this body to authorize it or not.   It is not just this amendment that is being excluded. My friend, the  senior Senator from Minnesota, will offer an amendment on election  security important to our national security. My Republican colleague  will block it--no amendments.    There are so many clamoring on both sides of the aisle that the  Senate go back to amending. If we are not going to do it on this bill,  we are not going to do it at all this year. This is too common--no  amendments, no bills, a graveyard in Leader McConnell's Senate.   No Senator has been allowed to vote on their amendments for months.  This is simply not how the Senate is supposed to be. So I urge Leader  McConnell, for the sake of the Senate and for the sake of war and peace  and for the sake of the Constitution, to allow us a vote on our  amendment. The leader should not run the NDAA like he has run the  Senate for much of this year, like a legislative graveyard, where  issues of consequence are buried so the callous political interests of  the President and the leader can march forward atop their graves.                               Border Security    Madam President, on the border, as the Senate moves to consider a  supplemental appropriations bill on the border, I want to turn my  colleagues' attention to what is transpiring there at the border.   Over the past few months, we have read reports and seen images of  deplorable conditions. At the Homestead facility in Florida, the Trump  administration has allowed a for-profit detention company to operate  what amounts to a modern-day internment camp: children ripped away from  their parents, kept in cages, denied nutrition and hygiene, diapers,  toothbrushes. How can our country do this? All because some in the  President's purview think that might deter immigrants: use these poor  little children--2 years old, 4 years old, we read about one 4 months  old--as hostages and cruelly treat them. It is a black mark on our  country. It is a black mark on those who allow it to happen at the  Homestead facility in Florida and in other places.   Think of what law enforcement would do if a parent denied their child  this kind of basic care, toothbrushes and diapers, and put them in  cages. Why on Earth would it be acceptable for our government to do the  same? Along with millions of Americans, I am appalled--appalled--by  these conditions, and I am appalled by the thought that some in the  Trump administration may actually want these deplorable conditions to  continue because they think it will deter future migrants--migrants who  are running away not because they are drug dealers, not because they  are MS-13 members but because their children have been threatened by  gangs: I am going to murder your son unless you do what I want; I am  going to rape your daughter unless you do what I want. Who wouldn't  flee? These are not evil people. To rip kids away from their parents,  to separate families as a policy, to discourage immigrants fleeing  violence, lawlessness, and degradation is sick and twisted. It is  inhumane. The people who are in charge of this mess should be ashamed  of themselves, and I can think of no other President--Democratic,  Republican, liberal, conservative--who would allow this to continue.   Now we are working on a compromise appropriations bill here in the  Senate to try to provide more resources and better conditions for these  kids and their families, but we also have to grapple with the real  challenges at the border and do more to reduce the number of migrants  who feel they need to flee their countries in the first place. That is  why Democrats have proposed to hire more immigration judges at the  border to reduce the backlog of cases and reduce the number of  immigrants who are held in limbo. That is why we have proposed allowing  asylum seekers to apply for asylum within their own countries, not at  our border. It makes sense. That is why we have also proposed  additional security assistance to Central American countries to crack  down on drug cartels, gangs, and human trafficking, to stem the  violence that impels so many to make the journey north that is so  perilous.   These are the kinds of policies we should be talking about. They are  not controversial. They are not partisan. They are simply commonsense-- commonsense solutions to the problems both parties have witnessed. The  President--this President needs to end the inhumanity of his  administration's border management and work instead with us on real  solutions.                               Shelby v. Holder    Madam President, I appreciate my colleagues waiting, but there is a  lot going on here this morning.   Finally, today marks the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Court's  disastrous decision in Shelby v. Holder, where a conservative majority  undercut decades of progress by gutting key provisions of the Voting  Rights Act. It will go down as one of the lowest moments of the Roberts  Court. When Justice Roberts says he is not political and he calls the  balls and strikes, the Shelby decision is an overwhelming and  persuasive argument that that is not the case with this Chief Justice.   Few pieces of legislation have reshaped America for the better quite  like the Voting Rights Act. But 6 years ago, in a narrow 5-to-4  decision, the Court eliminated important safeguards in the law. By the  majority's reckoning, such provisions were no longer needed because  discrimination was no longer a problem. Discrimination was no longer a  problem? Hello. Hello. The Court said it. Justice Roberts signed the  decision. ``Mr. Balls and Strikes'' was saying there is no  discrimination in America anymore. It wasn't a problem.   Well, in the 6 years since Shelby, 19 States have instituted voting  restrictions, including laws in North Carolina that the Fourth Circuit  said ``targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' No  more discrimination? Prior to the Court's decision in Shelby, North  Carolina would have been required to seek approval from the Department  of Justice's Civil Rights Division before enacting these pernicious  laws. This is one of many examples of how State and local officials  have been freed up to implement discriminatory laws while the courts  struggle to keep up.  [[Page S4479]]    Now, in ordinary times, the Senate would debate ways to reinstate the  safeguards that the Court abolished in Shelby. We would debate policies  like automatic voter registration and restrictions on discriminatory  voter ID laws and efforts that we would make to make it easier, safer,  and more reliable for Americans to vote. That is what Senate Democrats  have proposed.   But, of course, once again, Leader McConnell has transformed the  Senate into a legislative graveyard, where inaction is the order of the  day. What a shame that the leader believes something as crucial as  ensuring that Americans can exercise the franchise is unworthy of the  Senate's time.   I yield the floor.
