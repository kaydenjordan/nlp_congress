 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

It is vital to the U.S. national interest       to assist Finland in developing and maintaining a strong and       ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale of F-35s and associated missiles and       munitions will provide Finland with a credible defense       capability to deter aggression in the region and ensure       interoperability with U.S. forces. The proposed sale will       replace Finland's retiring F/A-18s and enhance its air-to-air       and air-to-ground self-defense capability. Finland will have       no difficulty absorbing these aircraft into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractors will be Lockheed Martin Aeronautics       Company, Fort Worth, TX; Pratt & Whitney Military Engines,       East Hartford, CT; The Boeing Company, St. Charles, MO; and       Raytheon Missiles and Defense, Tucson, AZ. This proposal is       being offered in the context of a competition. If the       proposal is accepted, it is expected that offset agreements       will be required. Any offset agreement will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor(s).        Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple       trips to Finland involving U.S. Government and contractor       representatives for technical reviews/support, program       management and training over the life of the program. U.S.       contractor representatives will be required in Finland to       conduct Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) and       Autonomic Logistics and Global Support (ALGS) for after-      aircraft delivery.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-66       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The F-35A Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL)       aircraft is a single-seat, single-engine, all-weather,       stealth, fifth-generation, multirole aircraft. The F-35A CTOL       contains sensitive technology including the low observable       airframe/outer mold line, the Pratt and Whitney Fl35 engine,       AN/ APG-81 radar, an integrated core processor central       computer, a mission systems/electronic warfare suite, a       multiple sensor suite, technical data/documentation, and       associated software. Sensitive elements of the F-35A are also       included in operational flight and maintenance trainers.       Sensitive and classified elements of the F-35A CTOL aircraft       include hardware, accessories, components, and associated       software for the following major subsystems:        a. The Pratt and Whitney F135 engine is a single 40,000-lb       thrust class engine designed for the F-35 and assures highly       reliable, affordable performance. The engine is designed to       be utilized in all F-35 variants, providing unmatched       commonality and supportability throughout the worldwide base       of F-35 users.        b. The AN/ APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array       (AESA) is a high processing power/high transmission power       electronic array capable of detecting air and ground targets       from a greater distance than mechanically scanned array       radars. It also contains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR),       which creates high-resolution ground maps and provides       weather data to the pilot, and provides air and ground tracks       to the mission system, which uses it as a component to fuse       sensor data.        c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provides       long-range detection and tracking as well as an infrared       search and track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared (FLIR)       capability for precision tracking, weapons delivery, and bomb       damage assessment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple separate       internal or podded systems typically found on legacy       aircraft.        d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS)       provides the pilot with full spherical coverage for air-to-      air and air-to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision       enhancements, a fire control capability, and precision       tracking of wingmen/friendly aircraft. The EODAS provides       data directly to the pilot's helmet as well as the mission       system.        e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a reprogrammable,       integrated system that provides radar warning and electronic       support measures (ESM) along with a fully integrated       countermeasures (CM) system. The EW system is the primary       subsystem used to enhance situational awareness, targeting       support and self-defense through the search, intercept,       location and identification of in-band emitters and to       automatically counter IR and RF threats.        f. The Command, Control, Communications, Computers and       Intelligence/Communications, Navigation, and Identification       (C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with unmatched       connectivity to flight members, coalition forces, and the       battlefield. It is an integrated subsystem designed to       provide a broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and       data communications, precision radio navigation and       landing capability, self-identification, beyond visual       range target identification, and connectivity to off-board       sources of information. It also includes an inertial       navigation and global positioning system (GPS) for precise       location information. The functionality is tightly       integrated within the mission system to enhance       efficiency.        g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes two data links, the       Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The       MADL is designed specifically for the F-35 and allows for       stealthy communications between F-35s. Link 16 data link       equipment allows the F-35 to communicate with legacy aircraft       using widely-distributed J-series message protocols.        h. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS)       provides a fully integrated logistics management solution.       ALGS integrates a number of functional areas, including       supply chain management, repair, support equipment, engine       support, and training. The ALGS infrastructure employs a       state-of-the-art information system that provides real-time,       decision-worthy information for sustainment decisions by       flight line personnel. Prognostic health monitoring       technology is integrated with the air system and is crucial       to predictive maintenance of vital components.        i. The F-35 Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN)       provides an intelligent information infrastructure that binds       all the key concepts of ALGS into an effective support       system. ODIN establishes the appropriate interfaces among the       F-35 Air Vehicle, the warfighter, the training system,       government information technology (IT) systems, and       supporting commercial enterprise systems. Additionally, ODIN       provides a comprehensive tool for data collection and       analysis, decision support and action tracking.        j. The F-35 Training System includes several training       devices to provide integrated training for pilots and       maintainers. The pilot training devices include a Full       Mission Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission Rehearsal       Trainer (DMRT). The maintainer training devices include an       Aircraft Systems Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection System       Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer Mold Line (OML) Lab,       Flexible Linear Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, F135 Engine       Module Trainer, and Weapons Loading Trainer (WLT). The F-35       Training System can be integrated, where both pilots and       maintainers learn in the same Integrated Training Center       (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and maintainers can train in       separate facilities (Pilot Training Center and Maintenance       Training Center).        k. Other subsystems, features, and capabilities include the       F-35's low observable air frame, Integrated Core Processor       (ICP) Central Computer, Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS),       Pilot Life Support System (PLSS), Off-Board Mission Support       (OMS) System and publications/maintenance manuals. The HMDS       provides a fully sunlight readable, bi-ocular display       presentation of aircraft information projected onto the       pilot's helmet visor. The use of a night vision camera       integrated into the helmet eliminates the need for separate       Night Vision Goggles. The PLSS provides a measure of Pilot       Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Protection through use       of an On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS); and an       escape system that provides additional protection to the       pilot. OBOGS takes the Power and Thermal Management System       (PTMS) air and enriches it by removing gases (mainly       nitrogen) by adsorption, thereby increasing the concentration       of oxygen in the product gas and supplying breathable air to       the pilot. The OMS provides a mission planning, mission       briefing, and a maintenance/intelligence/tactical debriefing       platform for the F-35.        2. The Reprogramming Center is located in the United States       and provides F-35 customers a means to update F-35 electronic       warfare databases.        3. The AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile       Extended Range (JASSM-ER) is an extended range low-      observable, highly survivable subsonic cruise missile       designed to penetrate next generation air defense systems en-      route to target. It is designed to kill hard, medium-      hardened, soft and area type targets. The extended range over       the baseline was obtained by going from a turbo jet to a       turbo-fan engine and by reconfiguring the fuel tanks for       added capacity. Purchase will include test and training       missiles.        4. The AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) is used by the       Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, and allows aircraft to       attack well-defended targets in day, night, and adverse       weather conditions. The JSOW C and C-1 utilize GPS/INS       guidance and an uncooled imaging infrared (IIR) seeker for       terminal guidance, autonomous acquisition, and provides a       precision targeting, 500-lb-class tandem warhead that is the       Navy's primary standoff weapon against hardened targets. The       JSOW C-1 added the Link 16 data link enabling a robust and       flexible capability against high-value stationary land       targets and moving maritime target capability. JSOW C-1 can       fly via two dimensional and three dimensional waypoints to       the target, offering the optimal path around integrated air       defense systems (IADS).        5. The AIM-9X Block II+ (Plus) SIDEWINDER Missile is a       supersonic, short-range Air-to-Air (A/A) guided missile which       employs a passive Infrared (IR) target acquisition system,       proportional navigational guidance, and a closed-loop       position servo Fin Actuator Unit (FAU). It represents a       substantial increase in missile acquisition and kinematics       performance over the AIM-9M and replaces the AIM-9X Block I       Missile configuration. The missile includes a high off-  [[Page S6064]]       boresight seeker, enhanced countermeasure rejection       capability, low drag/high angle of attack airframe and the       ability to integrate the Helmet Mounted Cueing System. The       software algorithms are the most sensitive portion of the       AIM-9X missile. The software continues to be modified via a       pre-planned product improvement (P3I) program in order to       improve its counter-countermeasure capabilities. No software       source code or algorithms will be released.        a. AIM-9X BLK II Captive Air Training Missile (CATM) is a       flight certified inert mass simulator with a functioning       Guidance Unit (GU). The CATM is the primary aircrew training       device providing all pre-launch functions as well as       realistic aerodynamic performance that equate to carrying a       tactical missile. The CATM provides pilot training in aerial       target acquisition and use of aircraft controls/displays.        b. AIM-9X BLK II+ (Plus) Tactical GU, WGU-57/B, provides       the missile tracking, guidance, and control signals. The GU       provides counter-countermeasures, improved reliability and       maintainability over earlier Sidewinder models. Improvements       include: (1) upgrade/redesign to the Electronics Unit Circuit       Card Assemblies, (2) a redesigned center section harnessing,       and (3) a larger capacity missile battery.        c. AIM-9X BLK II CATM GU, WGU-57/B, is identical to the       tactical GU except the GU and Control Actuation System (CAS)       batteries are inert and the software Captive. The software       switch tells the missile processor that it is attached to a       CATM and to ignore missile launch commands. The switch also       signals software to not enter abort mode because there is no       FAU connected to the GU.        d. AIM-9X BLK II Multi-Purpose Training Missile (MPTM) is a       ground training device used to train ground personnel in       aircraft loading, sectionalization, maintenance,       transportation, storage procedures, and techniques. The       missile replicates external appearance and features of a       tactical AIM-9X-2 missile. The MPTM will physically interface       with loading equipment, maintenance equipment, launchers, and       test equipment. The missile is explosively and electrically       inert and is NOT flight certified.        e.

The GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a 500       pound INS/GPS guided precision air to ground munition. The       GBU-38 consists of a KMU-572 bomb body specific tail kit, and       MK-82 or BLU-111 bomb body.        8. The GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM) is       a 500 pound JDAM which incorporates all the capabilities of       the JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a precision laser       guidance set. The LJDAM gives the weapon system an optional       semi-active laser guidance in addition to INS/GPS guidance.       This provides the optional capability to strike moving       targets. The GBU-54 consists of a DSU-38 laser guidance set,       and a KMU-572 bomb body specific tail kit, and MK-82 or BLU-      111 bomb body.        9. The GBU-53/8 Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II)       is a 250-lb class precision-guided, semi-autonomous,       conventional, air-to-ground munition used to defeat moving       targets through adverse weather from standoff range. The SDB       II has deployable wings and fins and uses GPS/INS guidance,       network-enabled datalink (Link-16 and UHF), and a multi-mode       seeker (millimeter wave radar, imaging infrared, semi-active       laser) to autonomously search, acquire, track, and defeat       targets from a standoff range. The SDB IT employs a multi-      effects warhead (Blast, Fragmentation, and ShapedCharge) for       maximum lethality against armored and soft targets. The SDB       II weapon system consists of the tactical all-up round (AUR)       weapon, a 4-place common carriage system, and mission       planning system munitions application program (MAP). The       carriage system is the BRU-61B/A. Two other operable       configurations and two maintenance training configurations       are described as follows:        a. SDB II Guided Test Vehicle (GTV) is an SDB II       configuration used for land or sea range-based testing of the       SDB TI weapon system. The GTV has common flight       characteristics of an SDB TI AUR, but in place of the multi-      effects warhead is a Flight Termination, Tracking, and       Telemetry (FTTT) subassembly that mirrors the AUR multi-      effects warhead's size and mass properties, but provides safe       flight termination, free flight tracking and telemetry of       encrypted data from the GTV to the data receivers. The SDB II       GTV can have either inert or live fuses. All other flight       control, guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are       representative of the SDB II AUR.        b. SDB II Captive Carry Vehicles (CCV), formerly known as       Captive Carry Reliability Test (CCRT) vehicles, are an SDB II       configuration primarily used for reliability data collection       during carriage. The CCV has common characteristics of an SDB       II AUR but with an inert warhead and fuze. The CCV has an       inert mass in place of the warhead that mimics the warhead's       mass properties.        c. The SDB II Weapon Load Crew Trainer (WLCT) is a mass       mockup of the tactical AUR used for load crew and maintenance       training. It does not contain energetics, a live fuze, any       sensitive components, or hazardous material. It is not flight       certified.        d. The SDB II Practical Explosive Ordnance Disposal Trainer       (PEST) is an EOD training unit with sections and internal       subassemblies which are identical to, or correlate to, the       external hardware, sections and internal subassemblies of the       tactical AUR. The PEST does not contain energetics, a live       fuze, any sensitive components, or hazardous material. It is       not flight certified.        10.

Air-to-Air modes provide the capability       for all-aspect target detection, long-range search and track,       automatic target acquisition, and tracking of multiple       targets. Air-to-Surface attack modes provide high-resolution       ground mapping navigation, weapon delivery, and sensor       cueing.        b. The AN/ALR-67(V)3 Electric Warfare Countermeasures       Receiving Set provides the F/A-18E/F aircrew with radar       threat warnings by detecting and evaluating friendly and       hostile radar frequency threat emitters and providing       identification and status information about the emitters to       on-board Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment and the aircrew.       The Operational Flight Program (OFP) and User Data Files       (UDF) used in the AN/ALR-67(V)3 contain threat parametric       data used to identify and establish priority of detected       radar emitters.        c. The AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System is a       threat-adaptive dispensing system that dispenses chaff,       flares, and expendable jammers for self-protection against       airborne and ground-based Radio Frequency (RF) and Infrared       threats. The Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mission       Data Files (MDF) used in the AN/ALE-47 contain algorithms       used to calculate the best defense against specific threats.        d. The AN/ALQ-214 is an advanced airborne Integrated       Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) programmable       modular automated system capable of intercepting,       identifying, processing received radar signals (pulsed and       continuous) and applying an optimum countermeasures technique       in the direction of the radar signal, thereby improving       individual aircraft probability of survival from a variety of       Surface-to-Air and Air-to-Air Radio Frequency (RF) threats.       The system operates in a standalone or Electronic Warfare       (EW) suite mode. In the EW suite mode, the AN/ALQ-214       operates in a fully coordinated mode with the towed       dispensable decoy, Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), and the on-      board radar in the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in a coordinated,       non-interference manner sharing information for enhanced       information. The AN/ALQ-214 was designed to operate in a       high-density Electromagnetic Hostile Environment with the       ability to identify and counter a wide variety of multiple       threats, including those with Doppler characteristics.        e. The AN/APX-111 Combined Interrogator/Transponder (CIT)       with the Conformal Antenna System (CAS) is a complete MARK-      XII identification system compatible with Identification       Friend or Foe (IFF) Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C and 4 (secure). A       single slide-in module that can be customized to the unique       cryptographic functions for a specific country provides the       systems secure mode capabilities. As a transponder, the CIT       is capable or replying to interrogation modes 1, 2, 3/A C       (altitude) and secure mode 4. The requirement is to upgrade       Finland's Combined Interrogator Transponder (CIT) AN/APX-111       (V) IFF system software to implement Mode Select (Mode S)       capabilities. Beginning in early 2005 EUROCONTROL mandated       the civil community in Europe to transition to a Mode S only       system and for all aircraft to be compliant by 2009. The Mode       S Beacon System is a combined data link and Secondary       Surveillance Radar (SSR) system that was standardized in 1985       by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Mode       S provides air surveillance using a data link with a       permanent unique aircraft address. Selective Interrogation       provides higher data integrity, reduced Radio Frequency (RF)       interference levels, increased air traffic capacity, and adds       air-to-ground data link.        f. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) is a       modified HGU-55/P helmet that incorporates a visor-projected       Heads-Up Display (HUD) to cue weapons and aircraft sensors to       air and ground targets. In close combat, a pilot must       currently align the aircraft to shoot at a target. JHMCS       allows the pilot to simply look at a target to shoot. This       system projects visual targeting and aircraft performance       information on the back of the helmet's visor, enabling the       pilot to monitor this information without interrupting his       field of view through the cockpit canopy, the system uses a       magnetic transmitter unit fixed to the pilot's seat and a       magnetic field probe mounted on the helmet to define helmet       pointing positioning. A Helmet Vehicle Interface (HVI)       interacts with the aircraft system bus to provide signal       generation for the helmet display. This provides significant       improvement for close combat targeting and engagement.        g. The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) will provide       mission planning capability for support of military aviation       operations.

Software provides for initial design and development of       the Electronic Warfare Software suite which encompasses AN/      ALQ-214, AN/ALE-47, ALE-55, ALR-67, as part of the System       Configuration Set (SCS) builds.        hh. Technical Data provides for the F/A-18E/F post-      production of classified test reports and other related       documentation.        ii. Training Aide and Devices provides for upgraded       classified lessons, hardware and installation for the       Tactical Operational Flight Trainers (TOFT), Low Cost       Trainers (LCT), Aircrew courseware and spares for delivery       and installation of Systems Configuration Sets (SCS).        2. The AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder Missile is a supersonic,       short-range Air-to-Air (A/A) guided missile which employs a       passive Infrared (IR) target acquisition system, proportional       navigational guidance, and a closed-loop position servo Fin       Actuator Unit (FAU). It represents a substantial increase in       missile acquisition and kinematics performance over the AIM-      9M and replaces the AIM-9X Block I Missile configuration. The       missile includes a high off-boresight seeker, enhanced       countermeasure rejection capability, low drag/high angle of       attack airframe and the ability to integrate the Helmet       Mounted Cueing System. The software algorithms are the most       sensitive portion of the ATM-9X missile. The software       continues to be modified via a preplanned product improvement       (P3I) program in order to improve its counter-countermeasure       capabilities. No software source code or algorithms will be       released.        a. AIM-9X BLK II Captive Air Training Missile (CATM) is a       flight certified inert mass simulator with a functioning       Guidance Unit (GU). The CATM is the primary aircrew training       device providing all pre-launch functions as well as       realistic aerodynamic performance that equate to carrying a       tactical missile. The CATM provides pilot training in aerial       target acquisition and use of aircraft controls/displays.        b. AIM-9X BLK II Tactical GU, WGU-57/B, provides the       missile tracking, guidance, and control signals. The GU       provides counter-countermeasures, improved reliability and       maintainability over earlier Sidewinder models. Improvements       include: (1) upgrade/redesign to the Electronics Unit Circuit       Card Assemblies, (2) a redesigned center section harnessing,       and (3) a larger capacity missile battery.        c. AIM-9X BLK II CATM GU, WGU-57/B, is identical to the       tactical GU except the GU and Control Actuation System (CAS)       batteries are inert and the software Captive. The software       switch tells the missile processor that it is attached to a       CATM and to ignore missile launch commands. The switch also       signals software to not enter abort mode because there is no       FAU connected to the GU.        d. AIM-9X BLK II Multi-Purpose Training Missile (MPTM) is a       ground training device used to train ground personnel in       aircraft loading, sectionalization,       maintenance, transportation, storage procedures, and       techniques. The missile replicates external appearance and       features of a tactical AIM-9X-2 missile. The MPTM will       physically interface with loading equipment, maintenance       equipment, launchers, and test equipment. The missile is       explosively and electrically inert and is NOT flight       certified.        e. AIM-9X BLK II Dummy Air Training Missile (DATM) is used       to train ground personnel in missile maintenance, loading,       transportation, and storage procedures. All components are       completely inert. The missile contains no programmable       electrical components and is not approved for flight.        f. AIM-9X BLK II Active Optical Target Detector (AOTD) is       newly designed for Block II. The AOTD/Data Link (AOTD/DL)       uses the latest laser technology allowing significant       increases in sensitivity, aerosol performance, low altitude       performance, and Pk (Probability of Kill). The AOTD/DL design       includes a DL for 2-way platform communication. The AOTD/DL       communicates with the GU over a serial interface which allows       the GU to receive and transmit data so that a target position       and status communication with a launching platform is       possible during missile flight.        3. The GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II)       is a 250-lb class precision guided, semi-autonomous,       conventional, air-to-ground munition used to defeat moving       targets through adverse weather from standoff range. The SDB       II has deployable wings and fins and uses GPS/INS guidance,       network-enabled datalink (Link-16 and UHF), and a multi-mode       seeker (millimeter wave radar, imaging infrared, semi-active       laser) to autonomously search, acquire, track, and defeat       targets. The SDB II employs a multi-effects warhead (Blast,       Fragmentation, and Shaped Charge) for maximum lethality       against armored and soft targets. The SDB II weapon system       consists of the tactical all-up round (AUR) weapon, a 4-place       common carriage system, and mission planning system munitions       application program (MAP). The carriage system is the BRU-      61B/A. The BRU and the MAP are not further described here.       Two other operable configurations, two maintenance training       configurations, and two containers of the system are       described as follows:        a. SDB II Guided Test Vehicle (GTV) is an SDB II       configuration used for land or sea range-based testing of the       SDB II weapon system. The GTV has common flight       characteristics of an SDB II AUR, but in place of the multi-      effects warhead is a Flight Termination, Tracking, and       Telemetry (FTTT) subassembly that mirrors the AUR       multieffects warhead's size and mass properties, but provides       safe flight termination, free flight tracking and telemetry       of encrypted data from the GTV to the data receivers. The SDB       II GTV can have either inert or live fuzes. All other flight       control, guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are       representative of the SDB II AUR.        b. SDB II Captive Carry Vehicles (CCVs), formerly known as       Captive Carry Reliability Test (CCRT) vehicles are an SDB II       configuration primarily used for reliability data collection       during carriage. The CCV has common characteristics of an SDB       II AUR but with an inert warhead and fuze. The CCV has an       inert mass in place of the warhead that mimics the warhead's       mass properties. The CCV is a flight capable representative       of the SDB II AUR but has not yet been approved for release       from any aircraft. Since all other flight control, guidance,       data-link, and seeker functions are representative of the SDB       II AUR, with flight release approval, this configuration       could be used for any purpose where an inert round without       telemetry or termination capability would be useful.        c. The SDB II Weapon Load Crew Trainer (WLCT) is a mass       mockup of the tactical AUR used for load crew and maintenance       training. It does not contain energetics, a  [[Page S6069]]       live fuze, or any classified or hazardous material. It is not       flight certified.        d. The SDB II Practical Explosive Ordinance Disposal       Trainer (PEST) is an EOD training unit with sections and       internal subassemblies which are identical to, or correlate       to, the external hardware, sections and internal       subassemblies of the tactical AUR. The PEST does not contain       energetics, a live fuze, classified or hazardous material. It       is not flight certified.        e. The SDB II single round container, nomenclature CNU-714/      U, is airtight sealable and contains a BIT harness assembly       that allows for BIT testing and software reprogramming       without the need for removing the cover assembly. The base       assembly contains a humidity indicator, a breather valve, and       a desiccant port/BIT access cover on the aft side of the       container. There are also two forklift pockets located on the       base assembly. Internally, the CNU-714/U contains separate       upper and lower cradle assemblies. The lower cradle assembly       is attached to the base assembly on top of four wire rope       shock insulators, which provide shock isolation during       transport. The upper cradle assembly provides an interface       with standard Air Force loading equipment. The CNU-714/U       lower cradle assembly contains indexing blocks that allow       multiple lower cradle assemblies to be placed on the ground,       side-by-side, for quick loading of a BRU-61.        f. The SDB II dual round container, nomenclature CNU-715/U,       is airtight sealable and contains two BIT harness assemblies       that allow for BIT testing and software reprogramming without       the need for removing the cover assembly. The base assembly       contains a breather valve and a desiccant port/BIT access       cover on the aft side of the container. The dual container       has two separate lower cradle assemblies. Each lower cradle       assembly is attached to the base assembly on top of four wire       rope shock insulators, which provide shock isolation during       transport. The lower cradles of the CNU-715/U are not       detachable from the base assembly. The cover assembly       contains a humidity indicator and four latch assemblies to       aid in the stacking of CNU-715/U containers on top of each       other. There are also two sets of forklift pockets, laterally       and longitudinally, located on the base assembly.        4. The AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile       Extended Range (JASSM ER) is an extended range low-      observable, highly survivable subsonic cruise missile       designed to penetrate next generation air defense systems en-      route to target. It is designed to kill hard, medium       hardened, soft and area type targets. The extended range over       the baseline was obtained by going from a turbo jet to a       turbo-fan engine and by reconfiguring the fuel tanks for       added capacity. Classification of the technical data and       information on the AGM-158's performance, capabilities,       systems, subsystems, operations, and maintenance will range       from UNCLASSIFIED to SECRET.        a. The AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile       (JASSM) software-in-the-Loop (SIL) testing assets are       required for software development, integration, and test in       the lab environment as well as ground mount operations before       STV or Live Fire assets can be loaded on the aircraft to       execute Airworthiness, Flight Test, and Live Fire events.       These assets are for testing in the contiguous United States       and will not be exported. Software development will be to the       extent necessary to produce Engineering Releases needed to       conduct airworthiness, integration and live fire testing.       Testing equipment is CLASSIFIED.        b. The AGM-158B-2 JASSM Separation Test Vehicle (STV) is       equipped with Intelligent Test Instrumentation Kit (iTIK).       These assets will be used as part of the airworthiness data       collection process to ensure safe separation of the munition       from the aircraft. These missiles will be handled and stored       in custom individual containers. These two (2) missiles are       for testing in the contiguous United States and will not be       exported. Software development will be to the extent       necessary to produce Engineering Releases needed to conduct       airworthiness, integration and live fire testing.        c. The AGM-158B-2 (JASSM) Instrumented Test Vehicle (ITV)       is equipped with iTIK. This asset will be utilized to capture       flight data information in a ``Captive Carry'' configuration.       The information collected will ensure the munition can be       safely carried and is required as part of the airworthiness       process prior to launch of the STV, JTV, and the Live Fire       asset. These missiles will be handled and stored in custom       individual containers. This missile is for testing in the       contiguous United States and will not be exported. Software       development will be to the extent necessary to produce       Engineering Releases needed to conduct airworthiness,       integration and live fire testing.        d. The AGM-158B-2 JASSM Jettison Test Vehicle (JTV) is not       equipped with an iTIK. These assets will be used as part of       the airworthiness data collection process to ensure safe       jettison of the munition from the aircraft. These missiles       will be handled and stored in custom individual containers.       These two (2) missiles are for testing in the contiguous       United States and will not be exported. Software development       will be to the extent necessary to produce Engineering       Releases needed to conduct airworthiness, integration and       live fire testing.        e. The AGM-158B-2 JASSM Maintenance Training Missile (DATM)       is a missile for maintenance (Weapon Load Crew) training with       container.        5. The GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a       2,000-lb Internal Navigation System/Global Positioning System       (INS/GPS) guided precision air-to-ground munition. The GBU-31       consists of a KMU-556 warhead specific tail kit, and MK-84       bomb body.        6. The GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a 500-      lb Internal Navigation System/Global Positioning System (INS/      GPS) guided precision air-to-ground munition. The GBU-38       consists of a KMU-572 warhead specific tail kit, and MK-82       bomb body.        7. The GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM) is       a 500-lb JDAM which incorporates all the capabilities of the       JDAM guidance tail it and adds a precision laser guidance       set. The LJDAM gives the weapon system an optional semi-      active laser guidance in addition to the Internal Navigation       System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) guidance. This       provides the optional capability to strike moving targets.       The GBU-54 consists of a laser guidance set, KMU-572 warhead       specific tail kit, and MK-82 bomb body.        8. The AGM-154 JSOW is used by Navy, Marine Corps, and Air       Force, and allows aircraft to attack well-defended targets in       day, night, and adverse weather conditions. The JSOW C and C-      1 utilize GPS/INS guidance and an uncooled imaging infrared       seeker for terminal guidance, Autonomous Acquisition, and       provides a precision targeting, 500-lb-class tandem warhead       that is the Navy's primary standoff weapon against hardened       targets. The JSOW C-1 added the Link-16 datalink enabling a       robust and flexible capability against high-value stationary       land targets and moving maritime target capability. JSOW C-1       can fly via two dimensional and three dimensional waypoints       to the target, offering the optimal path around Integrated       Air Defense Systems (IADS).        The JSOW incorporates components, software, and technical       design information that are considered sensitive. The       following JSOW-C components being conveyed by the proposed       sale include the GPS/INS, IIR seeker, INS OFP software and       missile operational characteristics and performance data.

All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Finland.                                   ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to Nuclear  Science Week, Oct. 19-23.   Established in 2010, Nuclear Science Week aims to educate the public  on the five pillars of nuclear science: carbon-free energy, global  leadership, transformative healthcare, innovation and technology, and  space exploration.   In Idaho, Nuclear Science Week is especially important because we  host the Nation's lead national laboratory for nuclear energy research  and development: Idaho National Laboratory.   In 2019, INL celebrated its 70th anniversary. The laboratory's rich  research legacy includes 52 test reactors built and deployed in the  eastern Idaho desert, and empowerment of a nuclear energy industry that  today produces nearly 20 percent of our Nation's electricity and more  than half our zero-carbon emitting electricity.   INL research helped develop America's nuclear Navy, which has  contributed to U.S. national security efforts for decades. Research at  INL's Advanced Test Reactor, which has been in operation for more than  a half century, allowed for the modernization of our nuclear Navy,  whose ships and submarines can now operate for decades without costly  and time-consuming refueling.   Nuclear Science Week allows us to focus attention on the training,  education, and empowerment of the future energy workforce, students  across America who will develop the technological breakthroughs of the  future. In the meantime, INL remains at the forefront of our Nation's  effort to develop and deploy advanced nuclear technologies, including  small modular nuclear reactors and microreactors.   As the home of the National Reactor Innovation Center, INL's world- class  [[Page S6070]]  researchers, working with industry, will develop those technologies  that allow us to retain our world leadership role in nuclear energy  while ensuring economic prosperity and environmental protection.   In reference to the fifth pillar of nuclear science, space  exploration, all of us in Idaho are proud to say that INL played an  important role in the recent launch of the 2020 Mars Rover by  assembling and testing the nuclear power system that will allow NASA  scientists to learn more about our universe.   I am honored to represent this important national laboratory, which  embodies the traits that built our Nation: scientific achievement, the  pursuit of knowledge, and curiosity.   By spreading the word about Nuclear Science Week and inspiring our  youth, we will make the world a better place for everyone.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Advanced Ceramic Fibers in Idaho Falls as  the Idaho Small Business of the Month for October 2020.   Prior to founding Advanced Ceramic Fibers, Dr. John Garnier enjoyed 6  successful years as the armor program lead for the National and  Homeland Security Directorate at the Idaho National Lab, INL. As part  of his work, Dr. Garnier co-invented a process for converting carbon  fibers into an alpha silicon carbide for military use and found that  the product could have numerous applications in the infrastructure,  energy, and aerospace industries. Recognizing its potential, Dr.  Garnier retired from INL and teamed up with businessmen Ken Koller,  Shawn Perkins, and David Harrell to commercialize his invention and  establish Advanced Ceramic Fibers. With the help of the INL technology  transfer program, the Idaho Small Business Development Center, and 3  years of self-funding, the startup was able to expand operations, hire  additional employees for research and development, and secure contracts  with several government agencies.   Since its founding, Advanced Ceramic Fibers has become a leading  example of small business driven innovation in Idaho. Its clients,  including the Department of Energy, U.S. Navy, and NASA, have utilized  its production of heat and abrasion resistant fibers in the development  of aerospace and stationary power generation turbines and nuclear  propulsion engines. They have expanded their innovations to include 34  different kinds of novel metallic carbides in both fiber and nano- particle forms. It is no surprise that the company was awarded the  Early Stage Innovation of the Year award for 2015 by the Idaho  Technology Council and the 2016 Excellence in Business Award from the  Idaho Small Business Development Center.   With the slogan ``Transforming the Reinforced Materials  Marketplace,'' Advanced Ceramic Fibers continues to be a catalyst of  innovation in the Gem State. Today, the company employs nearly a dozen  employees and owns the rights to nine different patents. With its  continued growth, the business is now expanding into a larger facility  and expects to provide more than two dozen jobs to the local community.  Advance Ceramic Fiber's ingenuity and cutting-edge product designs  exemplify how Idaho small businesses continue to lead the country in  technological development.   Congratulations to John, Ken, Shawn, Dave, and all of the employees  of Advanced Ceramic Fibers on being selected as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for October 2020. You make our great State proud,  and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
