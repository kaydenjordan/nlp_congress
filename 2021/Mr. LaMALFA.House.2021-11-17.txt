 Madam Speaker, this Friday the Congressional Budget  Office allegedly will release their assessment of President Biden's  Build Back Better agenda under budget reconciliation.   Their assessment will determine whether the Democrats have come up  with enough tax increases and other measures that will actually cover  the cost of the bill over the next 10 years.   But the White House seems to now believe that the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office isn't qualified to provide us with an  objective cost estimate, even though that is the entire point of the  CBO.   As the Congressional Budget Office is forcing the Biden  administration to acknowledge that their Build Back Better agenda will  certainly cost a lot more than the zero dollars he initially claimed,  Biden is still telling Democrats to disregard the report.   Madam Speaker, nothing comes for free; and so far, initial estimates  from the Congressional Budget Office show that the Build Back Better  agenda will increase our national deficit by more than $150 billion  each year.   Had it not been for some Democrats listening to the Republicans'  insistence that we don't vote until we at least have a price tag,  President Biden probably would have been able to sneak this through the  House without having to admit its true cost.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise tonight as we talk about this  issue with our upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, expected, of course, to  be the most expensive meal in the history of that holiday.   This is more proof that the Democrats are driving up inflation with  their spending policies. Spending piles of dollars does not create an  economy, it actually hurts the value of the dollars.   USDA's Turkey Market News Report showed the price of turkey itself is  going to be up 22 percent from last year. Pumpkin pie, potatoes,  cranberries, all up in price.   Inflation, of course, is the most regressive of actual taxes on the  people because it hits those on a fixed income the hardest. Low and  middle-income have tough decisions to make on whether it is going to  be--how they are going to handle their food costs and upcoming heating  oil and gas to stay warm this winter.   Democrats have been touting that they will tax billionaires and the  rich and corporations but, instead, we have seen them advocating for  policies that lead to inflation, directly harming those low and middle- income Americans, as well as making tax breaks for the rich while they  are touting them.   Congress cannot spend its way out of a problem, as some in the  administration have suggested. It would only make the issue worse.   We must stop passing massive spending bills and, instead, work on the  burdensome regulations and get out of businesses way so they can  thrive, expand their businesses, and hire employees.   Indeed, we need to work on the important supply chain issues that are  still clogging our ports, keeping our products from being exported,  from agriculture, all those things that need to be shipped out.  Instead, we aren't cutting very good deals with China when they can  just send their stuff over to us.   So that would insulate our economy from inflation by having a real  economy at home that is not dependent upon borrowed dollars for big  spending.   Indeed, I keep asking, Biden administration, whose side are you on?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and appreciate him  hosting this Special Order for us here tonight.   Madam Speaker, so what do we have? The Biden administration has been  trying to keep their fingerprints off of it for a long time. They have  been trying to let others do their dirty work; the airlines, the  hospitals, forcing these vaccines on people. Why is that? They  [[Page H6364]]  don't want to have their fingerprints on it.   So now they are getting impatient. You can go back and look at clips  where they say, Oh, it is not the role of the Federal Government, by  Jen Psaki, by others in the administration. It is not our job. We are  not supposed to do this. Now they don't care. They are pushing forward.   So the Fifth Circuit came in and said, You are going overboard by  getting OSHA to do the dirty work for you. They said it was  ``staggeringly overbroad,'' and they told them take no steps to  implement or enforce the mandate until further court order. It raises  serious constitutional questions. It likely exceeds the Federal  Government's authority.   So they have stepped out of line and they have been slapped back. It  is amazing, because the people on the front lines this year-and-a-half  our nurses, doctors, and others that are called the essential  employees, have been playing good ball. Now, they are being told, Oh,  that is not good enough anymore. You can't have your job anymore unless  you take this vaccine.   Personal decisions. You can't undo a vaccine once you have had it  taken. And so the aggressiveness of this administration towards  people's personal decisions is just amazingly overbroad. I am really  pleased we are doing this Congressional Review Act to nullify OSHA's  mandate that has been, at least for a while, set aside by the Fifth  Circuit Court and hopefully joined across the street by the Supreme  Court.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.                                time  1900
