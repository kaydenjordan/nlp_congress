 My, my, my. In the spending bill that  most affects our social fabric, MAGA Republicans take an ax to women's  reproductive freedom, public education, and Medicare.   At a time when costs are too high for working people, Republicans  underfund childcare and eldercare. Instead of lifting up American  families, this bill brings us down with culture war garbage.   It is a ``no'' for me. We can and we must do better.
