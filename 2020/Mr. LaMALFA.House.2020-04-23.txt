 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   April 1, Secretary Mnuchin warned us that the PPP has high demand and  will likely need more funding.   April 4, President Trump tweeted out a statement supporting more  funding a day after the program opened up.   April 7, Secretary Mnuchin requests more funding for the program,  warning that we will run out.   April 9, Senate Democrats block replenishing this funding, winning  praise from fellow Democrats.   Members, colleagues, we had ample warning of the funding running out  on numerous occasions during this month of April that we have been  away. How many small restaurants, hairdressers, bookstores, et cetera,  in your districts have suffered and closed because the majority is too  busy looking at the election in November to see today's crisis in  April?   Yet, so after all this time and the travel it took us all to get here  wearing masks, what is the first thing we bring up? A duplicative,  partisan select subcommittee to make a political spectacle of the  virus.   I sit as a member on the Transportation Committee. We can oversee the  oversight of FEMA just fine.   Our Commerce Committee can have oversight of HHS. We don't need  extra, duplicative committees.   We are 22 days behind. We need to get back to work and put the people  back to work and get this done.
