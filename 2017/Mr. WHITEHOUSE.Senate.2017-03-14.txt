 Mr. President, before I get into my ``Time to Wake  Up'' speech, let me say I appreciate the concern of the Senator from  Texas that the Affordable Care Act leaves too many Americans uninsured.  I am not sure the solution to that problem is to throw another 24  million people off of their insurance. I appreciate his concern that  premiums for many are too high. I am not sure the solution is to  dramatically increase premiums on the elderly. I appreciate his concern  that Medicaid can be managed by the States--and I think I used his  words correctly--along with the money to  [[Page S1796]]  pay for it. But when the bill has $800 billion in Medicaid savings but  will not cure or prevent a single illness, you are not reducing those  $800 billion in savings; you are just moving it to the States. You are  just putting that burden on the States. Ask Arizona how that worked  when they tried to do Medicaid as they dealt with the mortgage  meltdown.   The American people do perhaps demand better than ObamaCare, but the  solution to offer them something that is far, far worse does not seem  very sensible. I believe we are willing to work together. Indeed, in  the HELP Committee our chairman has already said that as soon as we  start talking about repair, we can get to work. But the notion that  there is an invitation out to us to work in a bipartisan fashion when  the majority party is jamming this bill through without negotiation,  using reconciliation as an extraordinary process to try to put it  through under arcane budget rules that were never designed for this-- that is not exactly much of a signal. So as soon as we get to regular  order and 60 votes, I think we will be able to actually work and serve  our constituents very well.                                Climate Change    Mr. President, I am here today for my 160th ``Time to Wake Up''  speech, this one focused on the security consequences of our failure to  deal with carbon emissions and climate change.   My remarks at the Munich Security Conference this year pointed out  that climate change presents several orders of security risk to  society. The first order of security risk is just physical damage,  damage that science and our senses are already perceiving and measuring  in our atmosphere, our oceans, and our environment.   This security risk, risks to the Earth's present national state, will  hurt farming communities, coastal communities, fishing communities, and  of course anyone vulnerable to wildfires, droughts, and extreme  weather. Of course, the poorer you are in this world, the more  vulnerable you are to this peril.   The second order of security risk from climate change is the  consequences in human society from that physical, biological, and  chemical damage in our environment. As farms and fisheries fail, people  are impoverished and dislocated. Scarce resources lead to conflicts and  confrontations. Storms and fires can make suffering acute, and people  who are hungry or dislocated or torn from their roots can become  desperate, radicalized, and violent. That is why the U.S. Department of  Defense has for years called climate change a catalyst of conflict.   Drought in Syria, for instance, has been described as a root cause of  the conflict there, a conflict that has killed more than 400,000  people, according to some estimates, and displaced more than 11  million. Researchers from NASA and the University of Arizona have  determined that drought was very likely the worst in a millennium.  Massive crop failures and livestock losses moved farmers into stressed  cities, where popular protests met with brutal violence from the Assad  regime and the tide of refugees from that chaos swamped Europe.   Nigeria, Sudan, and Central America are other areas where violence  and flight are driven by scarce resources. So the second order of  national security risk is the societal damage that cascades from the  natural damage caused by climate change.   The third order of security risk is perhaps the most dangerous for  our country; that is, reputational damage to the keystone institutions  of our present world order: market capitalism and democratic  government. People around the world who have been harmed by the first- order environmental effects of climate change, or people around the  world who get swept up in the second-order societal effects of climate  change will want answers, as will many who are witness to the global  suffering and harm caused by climate change.   When that reckoning comes, as it will, the discredit to institutions  like capitalism and democracy which failed to act, even when loudly and  clearly warned, could be profound. This failure of action by these  institutions is compounded by the moral failure. Fossil fuel companies  are knowingly causing this harm. They are aggressively fighting  solutions to this problem. Their weapons are as disreputable as their  conduct: professionally administered misinformation--climate denial,  after all, is the original fake news--and massive, massive floods of  political money.   As a result, the Congress has shown itself utterly unable to resist  the threats and blandishments of this industry, despite the fact that  we know very clearly of the industry's enormous conflict of interest.  This all stands to be a lasting blot on both democracy and capitalism,  a blot that will worsen as the consequences of our climate failure  worsen. If you believe, as Daniel Webster did, in the power of  America's example, that we are, indeed, a city on a hill, then you  should worry about this terrible example of greed, ignorance, and  corruption triumphant.   It is not like we have not been warned. The National Intelligence  Council has estimated that worldwide demand for food, water, and energy  will grow by approximately 35, 40, and 50 percent respectively in  coming decades. This increased resource demand is on a collision course  with those first-order harms--disrupting fisheries and agriculture  around the globe.   The U.S. Institute for Peace has warned that ``poor responses to  climatic shifts create shortages of resources such as land and water.  Shortages are followed by negative secondary impacts, such as more  sickness, hunger and joblessness. Poor responses to these, in turn,  open the door to conflict.''   For those who discount this as a bunch of peaceniks' prattle, let me  add that in 2013, our National Intelligence Council put climate change  alongside events like nuclear war and a severe pandemic among the eight  events with the greatest potential for global disruption--noting for  climate change that ``dramatic and unforeseen changes are occurring at  a faster rate than expected.'' The Department of Defense 2014  Quadrennial Defense Review described climate change as a ``global  threat multiplier.'' That report warned that ``the pressures caused by  climate change will influence resource competition while placing  additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions  around the world.''   As head of U.S. Pacific Command, ADM Samuel Locklear warned in 2013  that climate change was the biggest long-term security threat in his  area of operation, noting the need to organize the military for ``when  the effects of climate change start to impact these massive  populations.''   Again, I will quote him. ``If it goes bad,'' he said, ``you could  have hundreds of thousands or millions of people displaced and then  security will start to crumble pretty quickly.''   Operation Free, a coalition of national security and veterans  organizations, has continually pointed out the national security threat  posed by climate change, as has the American Security Project,  comprised of retired military flag officers. The Government  Accountability Office, GAO, has warned that climate change is affecting  defense infrastructure around the world, from sea level rise at Naval  Station Norfolk to heavy rain and flooding at Fort Irwin, CA, to  thawing permafrost affecting Air Force radar installations in Alaska,  to faraway effects, even at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.   The Coast Guard, of course, must meet entirely new demands of the  icecap's melt in the Arctic for transportation and shipping, for new  fishing grounds, for resource exploration, and of course the  possibility there of conflict. In 2005, when Defense Secretary Mattis  led Marine Corps Combat Development Command, he called on Navy  researchers to find ways to make the military more energy efficient, to  ``unleash''--to use his words--U.S. military forces from the ``tether  [of] fuel.''   Ask Senator Tammy Duckworth about the casualties sustained among her  comrades in arms defending fuel supply lines if you want to see a  passionate conversation. The military funds research into alternative  energy and studies how climate change affects military capability  because in the real world, where real lives are at risk, they can't  afford to believe the false facts peddled by the fossil fuel industry.   The people we entrust to keep us safe, who have to deal with real  threats in the real world, recognize the danger  [[Page S1797]]  climate change represents. The National Intelligence Council said in  January that ``issues like . . . climate change invoke high stakes and  will require sustained collaboration.'' Instead of that, we get a  Congress and an administration that has deliberately let the fossil  fuel industry occupy and sabotage the orderly operation of the  Government of the United States to deal with this problem.   So I am going to start to push back. When these tools of the fossil  fuel industry, to whom we in the Senate gave advice and consent, go too  egregiously about their dirty business of climate denial, expect that I  may come to the floor and object to consent requests.   Last week, Administrator Pruitt said carbon dioxide does not cause  climate change. That is nonsense. That is somewhere between ignorant  and fraudulent. He gets that one lie for free but no more--not next  time with the stakes this high. It can't be free to have these fossil  fuel tools spouting their fossil fuel nonsense from Senate-confirmed  positions of governmental authority. Starting now, it will not be.   I yield the floor.
