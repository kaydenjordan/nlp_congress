 Mr. Speaker, representing central New York, the issue of  blighted properties and contaminated land that remain from previous  industrial hubs is all too familiar to me.   The brownfields program has been pivotal in the redevelopment and  reuse of previously uninhabitable and unusable properties throughout my  district.   Earlier this year, I worked with Congresswoman Esty to advance  brownfields reauthorization legislation through the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee. I am proud to now see this bipartisan  comprehensive bill advancing through the House.   This measure contains many of the important reforms authored by  Representative Esty and myself, including language clarifying liability  for local governments and lease holders, and expanding eligibility to  assessments and remediation grants.   These provisions are intended to increase the effectiveness of  brownfields grants and will lead to faster cleanups.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Esty, Chairman Shuster of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, his staff, and  Representative McKinley for working to advance this important  legislation to preserve and enhance this critical program.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
