 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize a fallen hero  from New York's 17th District, Yorktown Police Captain Kenneth Sgroi.  Captain Sgroi passed away suddenly on January 2 after fighting a brief  illness.   He was a model police officer and a humble family man. He graduated  from the police academy in 2007, serving as a deputy sheriff in  Dutchess County. He then served as a member of the Yorktown Police  Department with dignity, honor, and a compelling sense of duty for  almost 13 years.   His loss has been a profound one felt by the Yorktown community, his  fellow officers, and his family.   The town of Yorktown recently renamed their police department after  him in honor of his service and sacrifice on behalf of the people of  Yorktown.   Captain Sgroi is survived by his wife, Anne, a classmate of mine at  Manhattan College, and two young children. My prayers are with them as  they grieve his loss, and my office stands ready to assist them in any  way we can.                            ____________________
