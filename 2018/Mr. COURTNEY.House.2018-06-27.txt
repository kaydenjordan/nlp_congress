 Mr. Chairman, I want to first of all state very clearly  that, in my opinion, both the chair and ranking member are strong  supporters of our Navy and of a strong national defense, and any push  in terms of these amendments is not a criticism of them at all in terms  of the great work that they and their staff do putting forward a  Defense Appropriations bill.   Again, very quickly, this amendment really just is an opportunity to  try to take advantage of the savings that my friend, Mr. Wittman,  described.   Block buy purchases have been tremendously successful. The last block  contract for Virginia class, the Block IV, the PEO of submarines, Dave  Johnson, was always very proud of the fact that we got 10 submarines  for the price of 9 because of using the advantages of bulk purchases,  which anyone who shops in Costco knows exactly what he was talking  about.   Again, that is a fact, that we achieved great savings by using the  block buy purchase mechanism. So I certainly strongly support Mr.  Wittman's efforts here.   Again, I note that the $49 million that Mr. Visclosky talked about is  in the amendment that is fast approaching, but it was not to cut the  program; it was talking to the Navy, a recognition that the change  orders that occurred in the last carrier, which is first in class, will  not occur to the same extent. So we are really just talking about  excess change orders, which, again, as the learning curve improves for  carrier production, the Navy and the Armed Services Committee  calculated would produce that kind of savings without inefficiencies  and without doing harm to the carrier program.   So, again, I thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for  supporting Mr. Wittman's amendment. I look forward to working together  in terms of both committees to try to achieve the goals of a strong  355-ship Navy.                                time  1830     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan, straightforward  amendment that funds long-lead materials to boost construction of  Virginia-class submarines to three per year, starting in 2022.   This amendment comes in response to the adamant, persistent warnings  of our combatant commanders in testimony before Congress--Admiral  Harris of the Pacific Command and General Scaparrotti of the European  Command--that submarines are their number one unfilled priority.   This appropriations bill, unlike the NDAA, which passed 351-66,  unfortunately, does not give the Navy the tools to answer that demand  signal.   Here is the reality: Today, the fleet has 52 subs. The two per-year  build rate in this bill will result in a drop to 42 submarines in 2028,  as shown on this chart from official numbers straight from the Navy,  because subs are aging out faster than the two-per-year build rate can  replace.   My amendment does answer the demand signal of the COCOMs, raising the  build rate to three per year at the earliest possible window, based on  Navy analysis of industrial base capacity that was submitted to  Congress last February.   Mr. Chairman, right now, in real time, the next 5-year block contract  is being negotiated, which will determine the Nation's submarine  construction until 2023. If this amendment fails, Members should be  crystal clear that our Nation cannot get that time back to magically  add subs later. It takes 5 years to build an attack sub, and this  year's bill coincides with block negotiations in a make-or-break  moment.   The offsets to pay for this amendment were part of the NDAA that a  bipartisan majority of us just passed on May 24 and do not--I repeat,  do not--cut a single ship or plane from the base bill, despite some of  the claims that are flying around regarding this amendment.   In particular, a last-minute DOD letter out yesterday about out-year  impacts is pure speculation. We will talk about this more later.   I am proud to say that my amendment is supported by some of America's  most distinguished Navy officers, the last two CNOs, Admirals Roughead  and Greenert; the former Fleet Forces Commander, Admiral Robert Natter;  and the former Commander of Sub Forces, Admiral Michael Connor; as well  as the Navy League and the metal trades of the AFL-CIO.   Mr. Chairman, they understood the urgency expressed by other COCOMs.  Now the question is whether Congress will rise to the challenge they  threw down.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Wittman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).  [[Page H5808]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters from  Admiral Greenert, Admiral Roughead, and the two most recent CNOs,  Admiral Natter and Vice Admiral Connor.                                                          June 2018.      Hon. Mac Thornberry,      Chairman, House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Robert Wittman,      Chairman, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.      Hon. Adam Smith,      Ranking Member, House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Joe Courtney.      Ranking Member, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommitee.        Dear Chairmen Thornberry and Wittman, and Ranking Members       Smith and Courtney, Thank you for your leadership in passing       another timely and insightful NDAA for 2019. In my opinion       your respective committees have led the way in Congress in       proposing strategic and coherent defense related legislation.        I want to pass along my belief in the importance of this       bill's provision regarding the expansion of our undersea       capabilities--particularly the submarine fleet.        During my 40-year career, including my tenure as CNO, our       Navy ``owned'' the Undersea domain. Navy's superiority in the       undersea domain has been unchallenged, predominantly due to       the excellence of the submarine force. This is no longer       assured. Real threats are emerging--fast.        Our industrial base builds the finest submarines in the       world. Combatant Commanders consistently request a robust       submarine presence. And, the demand for submarine presence       has grown even more since I retired in 2015. Navy's recent       Force Structure Assessment, embraced by the Executive and       Legislative Branches, validates a need for 66 submarines. The       need is real and urgent. However, without near term       additional legislative action our fleet is on track to reach       41 attack submarines by 2029. This will leave our future       civilian and military leaders woefully short of a key       platform to meet emerging challenges in the undersea (and       surface) domain.        The House 2019 NDAA recognized that sustaining an SSN build       rate of two-per-year would not arrest, and reverse, the       decline in the undersea fleet. Authorizing additional       resources for increased SSN production, specifically       preserving the option to use available industrial capacity in       2022 and 2023 to reach a three-per-year build rate, is       exactly the kind of thoughtful and tangible legislative       action, and messaging, we need. Again, your respective       committees are leading the way. As Congress continues its       work on defense authorization and appropriation in the near       term, I would urge your colleagues to see the opportunity and       flexibility inherent in this option--and support the plan       laid out in the 2019 NDAA passed by the House.        Our undersea superiority is being challenged. The recent       acknowledged loss of intellectual property (Sea Dragon) is a       recent example. I urge the Congress to embrace this unique       opportunity presented by the House 2019 NDAA. Our security       depends on this sort of bold and innovative action.            Sincerely,                                              Jonathan W. Greenert,      Admiral, USN (Retired).                                   ____                                                      June 17, 2018.      Hon. Mac Thornberry,      Chairman, House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Adam Smith,      Ranking Member, House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Robert Wittman,      Chairman, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Ranking Member, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.        Dear Chairmen Thornberry and Wittman and Ranking Members       Smith and Courtney: I appreciate your Committee's and       Subcommittee's support of the U.S. Navy reflected in your       markup of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).        The National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy       and your NDAA address and articulate the realities of once       again confronting peer adversaries. In that regard, our       undersea dominance will be challenged aggressively and       simultaneously in several geographic regions. Whoever       controls the undersea domain and sea lanes vital to us and       our allies will have the upper hand in crisis and conflict       history bears that out and our time is no different.       Investments in capabilities (sensors, communications, weapons       and quiet propulsion, etc.) will matter greatly but submarine       capacity, the number of submarines we have to dominate in       dispersed geographic areas, is vital. In confronting peer  [[Page H5809]]       adversaries at sea we must acknowledge and anticipate high-      end, complex maritime warfare will result in some loss of       capital assets which cannot be replaced quickly. Our       submarines, because of their lethality, will be aggressively       hunted and we must anticipate losses in that force. The       Navy's recent Force Structure Assessment (FSA) validates the       need for 66 attack submarines (I believe that number should       be 72) yet we are on a path to 41 in 2029. The House 2019       NDAA recognizes this shortfall and thoughtfully and prudently       seeks to enable increasing the Virginia Class submarine build       rate to three ships per year in 2022 and 2023 by authorizing       expenditures to that end.        Our peer adversaries are investing in research, technology       and capacity. This is not what we think they will do, it is       what they are doing. Our submarines and the industrial base       that produces them are superior but we will need more of them       and it in the coming years. We must continue to maintain our       dominance and I urge your committee and your colleagues in       the Senate and those on the House and Senate Appropriation       Committees to definitively provide for at least three       submarines in fiscal years 2022 and 2023. The gap in       submarine capacity between the U.S. and our peer competitors       is growing to our disadvantage. Proactive investments must be       made now to arrest that growing disparity in submarine force       structure and avoid the consequences of being. for the first       time in decades, at a disadvantage under the sea.            Sincerely,                                                     Gary Roughead,      Admiral, U.S. Navy (Retired).                                   ____                                                      June 12, 2018.      Hon. Mac Thornberry,      Chairman,      House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Robert Wittman,      Chairman, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.      Hon. Adam Smith,      Ranking Member,      House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Ranking Member, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.        Dear Chairmen Thornberry and Wittman, and Ranking Members       Smith and Courtney: I am Robert J. Natter, Admiral, US Navy       Retired. I am submitting to you my personal views and strong       endorsement in support of one particular 2019 NDAA provision       regarding our nation's submarine fleet. Firstly, I want you       to know that I am not a submariner (I was a surface warfare       officer); I am not a constituent; I do not live in a State       that builds our nation's submarines; and I do not consult for       or represent in any way our two major submarine building       shipyards.        I do address this important issue from my perspective as a       former Seventh Fleet Commander dealing with, among other       challenges, North Korea, China, Freedom of Navigation       operations around Taiwan and in Southeast and East Asia       waters, and the readiness and combat planning associated with       US Navy forces throughout Asia and Indian Ocean waters. I was       also Commander of US Fleet Forces Command for three years and       in that capacity was responsible for training, equipping and       deploying all US-based Navy forces in response to national       tasking.        Since I left the service, threats to our nation and our       potential adversaries' capabilities have increased       significantly. In the meantime our forces, while improving       technologically, have diminished in numbers while being       tasked at a level not seen since Cold War days. The Navy's       recent Force Structure Assessment clearly validates the need       for increased ship and aircraft numbers to meet our defense       needs. It also clearly validated the need for a MINIMUM of 66       attack submarines (SSNs). Having said that, we are now on a       dangerous build slope of having only 41 SSNs by 2029. The       House 2019 NDAA agreed that the current build rate of two       submarines per year would not reverse the decline of our       undersea fleet.        Authorizing additional dollars for increased SSN production       to reach a three-per-year build rate addresses our national       security disadvantage while reducing the unit cost of these       valuable assets. As you and your Committees work with the       Appropriators I encourage all your fellow members to embrace       and support the build plan called for in the 2019 House NDAA       with its increased build rate for our SSN fleet. In my view,       if there is sufficient funding for only one more weapon or       ship system, that ship should be an SSN. This is due to its       inherent survivability, flexibility (anywhere on the globe)       and effectiveness against the highest end threats.        I urge you and your fellow Congressional leaders to       convince your colleagues that this provision is necessary,       cost effective, and the right thing to do for our country.       Thank you for your continuing service to our nation and       strong leadership in Congress on behalf of our defense needs.            Most sincerely,                                                  Robert J. Natter,      Admiral, US Navy Retired.                                   ____                                                      June 12, 2018.      Hon. Mac Thornberry,      Chairman,      House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Robert Wittman,      Chairman, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.      Hon. Adam Smith,      Ranking Member,      House Armed Services Committee.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Ranking Member, Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.        Dear Chairmen Thornberry and Wittman, and Ranking Members       Smith and Courtney: Thank you for passing the National       Defense Authorization bill for FY2019 out of the House,       especially the bill's provisions relating to the needed       expansion of our undersea fleet.        Submarines are critically important to national security.       During my time as Commander of the Submarine Force from 2012       to 2015, I struggled to pace the growing undersea needs of       combatant commanders around the world. Many high priority       missions can only be accomplished by submarines because peer       competitors improved their anti-access technology and long-      range strike capability. Submarine demand continues to grow.       The most recent force structure assessment that increased the       attack submarine requirement from 48 to 66.        Without additional action, our undersea fleet will drop to       41 attack submarines in 2029. This reduced fleet size will       leave our civilian leaders and military commanders without       the tools they need to keep ahead of changing threats and       challenges around the globe. Mitigating this decline in the       undersea fleet should be a top priority for the Navy, the       Congress, and our nation.        The 2019 NDAA as passed by the House last month recognizes       that simply sustaining the two-a-year production rate of       Virginia-class submarines will not arrest the decline in our       undersea fleet. By authorizing additional resources for       increase submarine production, the bill preserves the option       for utilizing available capacity in 2022 and 2023 to achieve       a three-submarine build rate in those years. This will reduce       the looming shortfall we face in the coming decade and help       alleviate the mis-match in submarine demand and resources.        As Congress continues its work on the defense authorization       and funding measures in the weeks ahead, I would urge your       colleagues to support the plan you have laid out in the 2019       NDAA passed by the House. At a time when our nation's leading       edge in the undersea domain is being challenged by       competitors around the world, this is an opportunity that we       cannot afford to miss.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael J. Connor,                                     Vice Admiral (ret), U.S. Navy.     Mr. Chairman, again, I want to thank Mr. Visclosky and  Ms. Granger for the courtesy and, again, having parity in terms of the  time. I realize this is an extraordinary situation. They have a lot of  folks who want to take the opposite position, but this is a really good  comity in terms of the field.    Mr. Chair, having been pretty close to this issue over  the last 12 years, I would like to add just a little bit of perspective  in terms of this initiative which, again, started at the Seapower  Subcommittee.   The last two times block contracts were being negotiated was in 2007  and in 2012. In both instances, the Congress plussed up the budget for  submarine construction exactly the same way we are doing it in this  amendment: by funding long-lead materials; advanced procurement;  purchase of a reactor, which will be built in Ohio, by the way. That  gave the Navy the tools to increase their block buy.   It was done, incidentally, over the objection of the Department of  Defense. I was there with Mr. Murtha and Mr. Young who, again, decided  to override that objection at the time. That is when we went from one- sub-a-year to two-subs-a-year production.   In 2012 we had a similar situation where the White House, the Obama  administration, only requested nine subs in the next block contract,  the block 4. Again, the two committees working together boosted that  block authority in appropriations to get to 10 a year. Again, that was  over the objections of the Department of Defense.   I realize we are going to hear a lot from my colleagues, my good  friends, about Mr. Shanahan's letter that objects to my amendment. I  would just say that that is not the first time we have heard that.  Luckily, we have leadership in Congress which withstood those  arguments. Otherwise, we would be in a worse predicament than we are  today.   Again, follow past precedent. The 23 bipartisan amendment cosponsors  and I strongly urge adoption of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank both the chair and the ranking member for  the time they have allotted.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
