 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Carver Pump of Muscatine, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1938, Carver Pump was founded by brothers Ralph and Roy J. Carver  in Matherville, IL, as a specialty manufacturer of self-priming pumps  that are designed to prevent air pockets from forming while pumping  fluids. Shortly after its founding, Carver Pump began providing pumps  to the U.S. and the Allied navies during World War II. In 1941, Roy  restructured the company and relocated to its current home in  Muscatine, IA. Since World War II, Carver Pump has remained committed  to providing high-quality pumps to the U.S. Navy. Currently, every Navy  ship-building program, which is responsible for the ship construction  of the U.S. Navy fleet, relies on a centrifugal pump from Carver Pump.  Due to their hard work, Carver Pump received certification for their  high-quality management systems by the International Organization for  Standardization. Their pumps are used in a variety of industries,  including mining, agriculture, automotive, and maritime. Roy J. Carver  passed away in 1981, leaving behind a legacy of hard work,  philanthropy, and business excellence. Today, Carver Pump is run by  Carver family member Andrew Carver.   Carver Pump is an exemplary family business. Multiple generations of  the Carver family have worked at the company and been recognized for  their contributions to both the pump industry and philanthropic efforts  in Iowa. In 2019, Roy and his wife Lucille were posthumously awarded  the Muscatine Community College Legends award for their continued  legacy in Iowa. The Roy J. Carver Trust was also posthumously  established and has been involved with the University of Iowa, Iowa  State University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and  Augustana College. At the University of Iowa, the Carver-Hawkeye Arena  and Roy J. and Lucille Carver College of Medicine are named after Roy  J. and Lucille in honor of their continued support of the university's  academic and athletic programs. In 2023, Carver Pump celebrated its  85th business anniversary.   Carver Pump's commitment to producing high-quality pumps in Muscatine  and supplying critical products to help the U.S. military is clear. I  want to congratulate Andrew Carver, the Carver family, and the entire  team at Carver Pump for their continued dedication to providing high- quality pumps throughout the world. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
