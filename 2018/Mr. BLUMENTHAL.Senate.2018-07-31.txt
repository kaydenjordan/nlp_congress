 Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from  Florida for his leadership on this profoundly important and imminently  threatening issue of safety, as well my colleague from New Jersey for  his very important leadership and also Senator Markey from  Massachusetts. We have joined together in this cause to prevent a new  wave of lethal gun violence in our streets and communities resulting  from these plastic, undetectable, and untraceable, weapons. We are  talking about assault rifles, pistols, and shotguns--all of them  homemade. They are ghost guns. They are the new frontier and new face  of gun violence in this country.   Our colleague from Utah raised a First Amendment objection. The fact  is that the courts are dealing with that objection. It is the basis of  a challenge brought by a group who so far has failed in the courts to  stop this public health regulation.   No right is absolute. The First Amendment is not absolute. The idea  of crying fire in a movie house is one example that is given time and  again. Likewise, in the course of our history, we have found that the  First Amendment has to yield to public safety when there is an imminent  and urgent threat. Clearly, there is here.   I have supported companion legislation that would, in fact, stop the  actual making of these kinds of weapons. It involves none of the First  Amendment difficulties the Senator from Utah has raised, and I will be  pursuing it perhaps through the same kind of unanimous consent effort  in the days to come.   Today, the Senator from Florida is absolutely right to seek this  body's unanimous consent in the face of this threat that is self- inflicted by the Trump administration. It has caved to the rightwing  fringe group and the NRA, which are challenging this public safety  regulation, and it has, in effect, snatched defeat from the jaws of  victory because the litigation was on a path to prevailing against  those objections. This litigation should have been permitted to run its  course. It was on a path to success. But now the administration has  created this emergency, beginning at midnight tonight. On August 1,  plans, designs, blueprints can be published without limit on the  internet, making possible the mass homemade manufacture of these ghost  guns. They are a scourge, a potential source of death and injury on our  streets.   Any idea that plastic is less durable or strong as a source of  material for these guns is completely outmoded because we make planes  from plastic. Plastic in some forms is as durable and strong as metal.   The threat here is real and urgent, and I join my colleague from  Florida in asking that there be unanimous consent. I hope we will  pursue this legislative effort together and that we will have  bipartisan support. I stress that we must have bipartisan support.  Senators who fail to step up, speak out, and act in the face of this  emergency should be held accountable.   Mr. President, I yield the floor to our colleague from New Jersey.    Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay  tribute to SFC, Retired, Restituto ``Tuto'' Oyola-Alvarez, a courageous  member of our military and devoted family man. Sadly, Sergeant First  Class Oyola-Alvarez passed away on July 22, 2018, at the age of 101. He  will be remembered for his tireless, dedicated service to our nation.   Sergeant First Class Oyola-Alvarez was born in Arecibo, PR, and he  enlisted in the U.S. Army at Fort Buchanan on January 22, 1941. He went  on to serve in Puerto Rico's 65th Infantry Regiment during the Korean  war. The regiment was referred to as the Borinqueneers, and Sergeant  First Class Oyola-Alvarez and the rest of his Latino-segregated unit  played a valuable role in helping American war efforts.   Unfortunately, despite their remarkable dedication, the  Borinqueneers' contributions went largely overlooked once the war  ended. After 20 years of Active service and many more decades during  which it went unrecognized, Sergeant First Class Oyola-Alvarez was at  last granted the awards his unfailing support of our Nation deserved.  On Veterans Day in 2012, I was honored to present him a number of hard- earned medals at his home in Hartford, CT. Four years later, I was  proud to present him and his fellow Borinqueneers with the  Congressional Gold Medal at the Connecticut State Capitol. At the  ceremony, Sergeant First Class Oyola-Alvarez also received more medals  acknowledging his efforts on behalf of America, including the World War  II Victory Medal and Korean Service Medal, among others.   Honorably discharged in 1961, he gained proper recognition for his  service when he reached his mid-90s. Citations and certificates from  his home State of Connecticut were given by the Connecticut General  Assembly, the secretary of the State of Connecticut, and the mayor of  Hartford. In 2014, Sergeant First Class Oyola-Alvarez's tenacious  defense of our democracy earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award from  the Latino Puerto Rican Affairs Commission in Connecticut.   His sincere devotion to his birth island of Puerto Rico, the United  States, and the U.S. Armed Forces carried into his family life as well.  Sergeant First Class Oyola-Alvarez cherished his wife of 70 years, the  late Sarah Rivera, as well as his only daughter, Sara Victoria, his  son-in-law, Merril, and his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  His years of outstanding leadership, loyalty, and commitment are a  model for all of us and have left a lasting positive impact upon the  country.   My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Restituto's  family during this difficult time. May their many wonderful memories of  him provide them solace and comfort in the days ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Fred  Grimsey, in whose honor a beach in Waterford, CT, will be named Grimsey  Beach on August 11, 2018. I have had the honor of seeing firsthand the  many amazing accomplishments of Fred Grimsey over the past decade.   Mr. Grimsey is the founder and president of Save the River-Save the  Hills, Inc., a nonprofit, grassroots environmental organization focused  on preserving the health of the Niantic River Estuary, its watershed,  and the natural beauty of the Oswegatchie Hills.   In 2003, Mr. Grimsey built a system to use his boat as a pump-out  vessel. Relying on his personal funds for 2 years to keep what became  the Pump-Out Program going, Mr. Grimsey has since secured grants from  the DEEP and the towns of Waterford and East Lyme, CT, to maintain it.  Just this year, over 16,000 gallons of sewerage were pumped from boats  on the Niantic River, preventing a significant amount of pollution from  being dumped in the river.   As director of the Pump-Out Program and president of Save the River- Save the Hills, Mr. Grimsey has worked long hours to improve the  diversity and amount of aquatic life in the estuary, encourage safe  recreation, and enhance economic growth of the Niantic River area. His  determined dedication has helped lead to the designation of the river  and the Long Island Sound as a Federal No Discharge Zone.   Mr. Grimsey's significant environmental efforts has extended  Statewide, including serving on numerous committees centered on  improving waterways in and around Connecticut.   Currently, Mr. Grimsey and Save the River-Save the Hills are working  on a Unified Water Study with the Connecticut Fund for the Environment.  The goal of the study is to encourage collaboration between multiple  monitoring groups in order to measure the ecological health of a local  bay, cove, or harbor.   Mr. Grimsey's positive impact upon the Niantic River has greatly  benefitted our State. In 2008, he received the President's Volunteer  Service Award for the State of Connecticut, and in 2017, I was proud to  recognize his environmental achievements by presenting Mr. Grimsey with  the Aquarion Environmental Champion Award in the adult category.   I applaud his tireless efforts to improve and protect the Niantic  River, and I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Mr.  Grimsey on his well-earned honor.                            ____________________
