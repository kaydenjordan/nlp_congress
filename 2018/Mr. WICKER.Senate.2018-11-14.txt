 Madam President, I wish to say a word or two about the  Coast Guard bill, which is coming up soon. I assure my colleagues that  when the leader comes to the Chamber to make leadership remarks, I will  certainly defer to him.   I cannot tell you how pleased I am that we are finally getting to the  point of passing a Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. We have worked on  this for some time--intensely, actually, for 3 years--and I wish to  commend Senator Sullivan of Alaska and Senator Thune, the chairman of  the Commerce Committee, for doing such great work on this.   The Coast Guard reauthorization bill will allow us to let the Coast  Guard continue to do all of the vital things they do to help the people  of this Nation. It will allow us to rebuild the fleet, strengthen  facilities on shore, and refurbish the aircraft of the Coast Guard, all  while ensuring support for the highly trained 40,000 Active-Duty  members of the Coast Guard and some 46,000 people who serve in either  the Reserve, civilian, or auxiliary force of the Coast Guard.   A lot of Americans really don't have a complete understanding of the  11 statutory functions of the U.S. Coast Guard. I will not go through  all of those, except to say that these are vital to the safety and  security of the United States. I will just mention that in my own State  of Mississippi, after Hurricane Katrina, one of the first groups to  come in and respond was the Coast Guard, living up to their motto of  Semper Paratus--``Always Ready.'' There were an estimated 60,000 people  who needed to be saved from flooded homes, buildings, and rooftops by  the Coast Guard, and they did their job. The lifesaving work continued  in 2017 and in 2018 with historic rescue and recovery efforts for such  disasters as Irma, Florence, Maria, Michael, and the list goes on and  on. Simply put, the Coast Guard is there when coastal communities are  at risk.   They are also there when it comes to organized crime and drug  interdiction--another very important aspect of the Coast Guard. Last  week the Coast Guard made news. The cutter Dauntless returned to  Pensacola, FL, following a $27 million cocaine bust in the eastern  Pacific.   Americans may see the Coast Guard on the news only because of big  drug busts or in the aftermath of a hurricane, but these men and women  also are in every corner of the globe, protecting our natural resources  and our national interests, coordinating search and rescue missions,  and saving lives--saving lives every day.   So our hat is off to the Coast Guard, and my hat is off to the  leaders of this body who have given us an excellent reauthorization  bill.   In a single day, we might see the Coast Guard handling some 45 search  and rescue missions in a single day or saving 10 lives in a single day  or saving more than $1.2 million in property in a single day or  ensuring the proper transport of $8.7 billion in goods and commodities.   As I assured Members when I began these remarks, it is my honor to  yield to the distinguished majority leader for whatever leadership  remarks he might want to make.  [[Page S6938]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, it is my understanding that the  distinguished Democratic leader will be coming in soon to participate  in leadership time, but until such time, I ask unanimous consent to  address the Senate on the Coast Guard bill for 5 minutes.    Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer entered the  Chamber and took the Chair, I was explaining to Members what the Coast  Guard does--all the various vital activities they do to provide for the  safety and security of Americans. Let me tell my colleagues just a few  things this bill does. The distinguished majority leader was discussing  this in his remarks also.   This bill that we are about to vote on takes big steps in  recapitalizing our vessel fleet. I am proud to say that shipbuilders  across the country, including in my State of Mississippi, are  rebuilding our fleet. In Mississippi, we have built six national  security cutters that are currently operational. The seventh and eighth  ships have been built and are scheduled to be commissioned next year.  These ships are some of the most technologically advanced vessels in  the world.   The Coast Guard needs more modern national security cutters to combat  transnational organized crime. These cutters make up the backbone of  this effort, and, as we know, the criminals who undermine our borders  and our Nation's social and political development are not contained by  borders.   In addition, the Coast Guard bill recognizes the importance of  national security cutters by authorizing multiyear contracts that will  lead to procurement of a 10th, 11th, and 12th vessel. So we are making  great progress there. These cutters are highly advanced patrol boats  that could deploy independently for a number of missions along our  ports, waterways, and coasts.   In addition, the bill does not overlook the Coast Guard's shoreline  infrastructure, instead authorizing more than $170 million for these  facilities. This includes steps to repair and replace its aging rotary- wing aircraft.   Other provisions in the bill would clarify the Coast Guard's role in  national security as a member of our Armed Forces, and they are and  should be clarified as a member of the Armed Forces; establish a land- based, unmanned aircraft system program; help modernize the Coast  Guard's healthcare system; enable block-buy contracts for ship  acquisition; and conduct an advanced maintenance program for the Polar  Star, our only  [[Page S6939]]  heavy polar icebreaker. Our sole icebreaker is now 42 years old and 12  years past its intended service life. So this will allow us to pay more  attention to the Arctic.   Finally, let me stress to my colleagues and once again express  appreciation to the leadership of the committee that we are finally  passing the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, known as VIDA, which  provides much needed relief to our commercial vessel industry. This  relief would come through a single, science-based national standard for  ballast water discharge and other vessel discharges. These discharges  must take place; it is just a question of what the regulation is and  how we take care of our economy and our environment.   Currently, commercial vessel owners are obligated to meet standards  from the Coast Guard, standards from the EPA, and standards from 25  individual States. This can mean spending millions of dollars to  install equipment, which may or may not ensure compliance with these  regulations. Such burdens have put a strain on U.S. businesses and U.S.  commerce. This bill will give us one nationwide standard, lifting the  burden off of these businesses and lifting the burden off of people who  would like to actually get out there and create more jobs instead of  comply with a myriad of various regulations.   Under VIDA, the Coast Guard would be the lead agency to enforce these  regulations, but it will also do this in consultation with EPA. In  other words, VIDA uses the expertise of both of these excellent  agencies, the Coast Guard and the EPA, and leverages the expertise of  both agencies. It is quite an achievement.   I see my friend from Florida here. He may want me to yield on this  question. But there has been a bipartisan effort, and the bipartisan  vote yesterday was quite gratifying.   Again, thank you to Chairman Thune, thank you to Senator Sullivan,  and thank you to my friends on the other side of the aisle for making  this bipartisan, long-range effort finally come to fruition this  afternoon.    I would be delighted to yield to my friend.    Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I thank the Senator  from Florida for making those points and for his leadership as ranking  member of the Commerce Committee. In this regard, I suggest the vote  coming up soon will be probably as lopsided as the one on cloture  yesterday. That is a good sign. It took us a while to get there, I  would say to my friend from Florida, but we are there now, and it is a  great achievement for our economy, for the environment, and for the  Coast Guard as a whole.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
