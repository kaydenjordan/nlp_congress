 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's decision to end the DACA  program is wrong. Today's announcement impacts over 22,000 New  Jerseyans and over 800,000 people across the country. The primary  beneficiaries of DACA are young people who were brought here to this  country by no decision of their own.   In New Jersey, most DACA recipients are in the group of 18 to 21  years of age. At that age, they should be focused on college,  developing trades, and overall sharpening their skills that will  ultimately benefit our Nation.   Unfortunately, their future is now at the mercy of Congress. This  issue transcends party, Mr. Speaker. Our decisions in the next 6 months  will determine the future of hundreds of thousands of young people. We  must make the right decision to protect DREAMers.                            ____________________
