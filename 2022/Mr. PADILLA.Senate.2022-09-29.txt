 Mr. President, I submit the following statement  to the record in recognition of the lifelong career of Jaime Jarrin,  the voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers en espanol for over half a  century.   A native of Ecuador, Jaime moved to Los Angeles in 1955 at the age of  19 and worked as a news and sports director for KWKW, a Spanish  language radio station that is now the Spanish radio home for the Los  Angeles Dodgers. Soon after, in 1959, Jarrin called his first Dodger  game, launching what would become an over six-decade career with the  Dodgers that would make him the longest tenured announcer in Major  League Baseball, second only to the legendary Vin Scully, and earning  him the respect of generations of Angelenos whose fandom will forever  be measured by Jarrin's play-by-play and home run calls, ``Se va, se  va, se va, y despidala con un beso. Se fue de cuadrangular!''   Among his long list of accomplishments from a lifetime in baseball,  some of his most impressive include his streak of nearly 4,000  consecutive games called between 1962--84--spanning 22 seasons without  missing a single game. And they include any number of games he has  called that read like headlines straight from baseball's history books:  he has called three perfect games--Sandy Koufax in 1965, Tom Browning  in 1988, and Dennis Martinez in 1991--as well as 22 no-hitters, 30  World Series, and 30 All-Star Games.   In 1998, he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in  Cooperstown, NY, as the recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award for  ``major contributions to baseball,'' becoming only the second Spanish- language announcer to achieve the honor.   And during ``Fernandomania,'' the young Dodger pitcher Fernando  Valenzuela's rise to become the first and only player to win both the  Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in one season, Jarrin was there  side-by-side, introducing Valenzuela to Los Angeles and to the world.  ``Fernandomania'' also helped introduce Jarrin to an English-speaking  audience--not only in Los Angeles, but across the country--helping  bridge communities through a shared love of the game.   Through years of hard work, dedication, and passion for the game he  loves, Jarrin will have gone on to call games for 64 years in the booth  after he retires at the end of this season. Five of those years were  alongside his son, Jorge Jarrin, forming the first father-son duo to  broadcast baseball on MLB Spanish-language radio. Jaime truly brought  Dodger stadium to life inside the homes of Californians each and every  night. He has become a legend in his own right, and the entire baseball  community will miss his voice once he retires this year.   Outside of baseball, it was clear that Jaime was listening to the  community that supported him. With the love and support of his late  wife Blanca Jarrin--who is survived by Jaime's sons Jorge and Mauricio,  three sisters, and three grandchildren--they launched the Jaime and  Blanca Jarrin Foundation committed to serving and supporting  educational and athletic programs in the Los Angeles area.   On behalf of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and the  worldwide baseball community that listened to Jaime's voice for  decades: thank you Jaime, ``y gracias,'' for your lifetime service to  the Dodgers and to the beautiful game of ``beisbol.''

This legislation would ensure that noncitizen service members have  access to the information and resources they need to apply for  citizenship in the United States and avoid deportation from the country  they have promised to protect and fight for.   The Veteran Service Recognition Act of 2022 would implement important  changes to ensure that servicemembers as well as their spouses and  children are not removed from the United States after leaving the  military because they were never provided support and resources to help  them adjust their status.   Specifically, this bill would require the Department of Homeland  Security and the Department of Defense to create a program to help  ensure that servicemembers and their families have a pathway to  naturalization. The program would also include training for JAG  officers and recruiter training on the naturalization process for  servicemembers.   The bill would also create a Military Family Immigration Advisory  Committee that would provide recommendations to DHS on whether a  noncitizen who has served in the military or their family members  should be granted a stay of removal, deferred action, parole, or be  removed from the country.   Finally, the bill would require DHS to establish a program that  allows removed veterans and their family members to be admitted back  into the United States as lawful permanent residents and directs DOJ to  reopen their removal cases.   Our noncitizen servicemembers have risked their lives in service to  our country. For over a century, the United States has recognized the  contributions that noncitizens make in the military. They deserve a  clear path to citizenship for themselves and their spouses and  children.   Over the past several years, programs to help facilitate these  processes have diminished, and this lack of support from Federal  Agencies has made it more difficult for noncitizen servicemembers to  become U.S. citizens. Veterans who are unable to naturalize are at risk  of deportation if they commit certain crimes and are forced to leave  the country they promised to defend. Many believe that they are  citizens already due to their service and are shocked to learn years  later that they are not.   It is imperative that we work to protect our noncitizen veterans from  deportation and that we bring back those veterans who were removed from  the United States. These veterans have shown nothing but loyalty to the  United States, and they deserve to stay here, receive their benefits,  and live fulfilling lives alongside their family members.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED:   S. 5064.
