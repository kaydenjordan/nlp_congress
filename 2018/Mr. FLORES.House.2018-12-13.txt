 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 41st President of  the United States of America, George Herbert Walker Bush of Houston,  Texas, who passed away on November 30, 2018.   President Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts,  to Prescott Sheldon Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. He grew up in  Greenwich, Connecticut, and attended Phillips Academy in Andover,  Massachusetts, where his illustrious career in leadership and public  service began.   On his 18th birthday, President Bush enlisted in the United States  Navy and became a naval aviator. In the middle of World War II, he was  commissioned as an ensign just before his 19th birthday, making him one  of the youngest aviators in the Navy's history.   Stationed in the Pacific theater on the USS San Jacinto, he piloted a  Grumman TBM Avenger. On September 2, 1944, while carrying out a mission  against Japan, his plane was hit by enemy fire and was severely  damaged. President Bush completed the mission and flew out over water,  where he was able to escape from the plane and he was later rescued by  submarine USS Finback.   After recovering from his injuries, he returned to flying as soon as  he was able. He flew a total of 58 combat missions, for which he  received the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Air Medals, and the  Presidential Unit Citation.   Throughout the war, President Bush was encouraged and supported by  letters from his sweetheart, Barbara Pierce. They had met at a  Christmas dance in 1941 and quickly fell in love. They were engaged in  1943 and married on January 6, 1945. Together, they would endure both  difficult and joyous times, grow a large and loving family, and set the  record for the longest-married Presidential couple, with 73 years of an  exemplary commitment to marriage.   After his marriage to Barbara, Mr. Bush enrolled at Yale University.  He graduated in 2\1/2\ years on an accelerated track and was elected to  one of the most prestigious academic societies, Phi Beta Kappa. He also  served as president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and as  captain of the Yale baseball team. He played in the first two college  world series and maintained a love for baseball throughout his life.   Upon graduation, the Bush family moved to Odessa, Texas, where  President Bush pursued a career in the oil industry. He had a  successful business career, founding two companies that eventually  prompted the family to move to Houston in 1959.   In 1966, President Bush ran for and won election to the United States  House of Representatives to represent the Seventh Congressional  District of Texas. During his time in Congress, he supported  influential legislation, including the civil rights bill of 1968 that  outlawed housing discrimination.   After 4 years in the House, in 1971, President Bush was appointed as  United States Ambassador to the United Nations. The Senate unanimously  confirmed his appointment, and he served as Ambassador for 2 years. His  time at the United Nations undoubtedly influenced him, as he became one  of America's greatest diplomats.   In 1973, President Bush became chairman of the Republican National  Committee, where he was tasked with guiding the Republican Party  through the Watergate scandal and the resignation of President Nixon.   In the President Ford administration, President Bush took on the role  as chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China.  Although this was not a diplomat rank, his work greatly benefited U.S.- China relations. The United States had just recently opened relations  with Communist China, and President Bush worked to establish a strong  foundation for that relationship.    In 1976, the Bush family returned to the United States while he  served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. His expansive  knowledge of foreign relations and experience in building morale and  team work made him a strong leader for the CIA during one of their most  tumultuous times.   President Bush worked not only to restore the reputation of the  Agency in the public eye, but also to improve relations with Capitol  Hill. His experience as a legislator gave him the background to  reconcile the CIA with Congress, and in the 357 days that he served as  Director, he testified before them a record-setting 51 times.   With a transition from the Ford administration to the Carter  administration, President Bush returned to Texas and became executive  committee chairman of First International Bank of Houston. He also  entered academia, where he spent a year as a part-time professor at  Rice University and 2 years as director of the Council on Foreign  Relations.   In 1980, President Bush was elected Vice President, serving with  Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989. During his tenure as Vice President,  he took a hard stance against communism and tyranny, while working to  end the Cold War without bloodshed. He worked to  [[Page H10203]]  support President Reagan and was one of the most successful Vice  Presidents in history. His diplomatic finesse, trustworthiness, and  patriotism made him beloved by the American people and a natural choice  to run for President.   In 1988, then-Vice President Bush was elected by our Nation to become  the 41st President. Inaugurated on January 20, 1989, President Bush  became the first serving Vice President to be elected President since  Martin Van Buren in 1836.   Just 293 days into his Presidency, President Bush witnessed a major  success in his almost decade-long fight against communism with the fall  of the Berlin Wall, followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union and  the end of the Cold War.   Afterward, President Bush and his administration played a significant  role in reuniting East and West Germany. Today, Germany is a powerful  nation and one of our country's strongest allies, none of which would  have been possible without the skill, diplomacy, commitment, and  tactfulness of President Bush.   In a continuation of his fight against oppression and tyranny,  President Bush was one of Kuwait's strongest allies and advocates after  its invasion by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On January 17, 1991, the  first Gulf war began in an effort to restore the sovereignty of  Kuwait's Government and the stability of the Persian Gulf. Lasting just  100 hours, the offensive strategy was a great success, causing the  Iraqi military to retreat from Kuwait.   One of the landmarks of President Bush's administration was the  drafting of the North American Free Trade Agreement, more commonly  known as NAFTA. This agreement encouraged better trade with our  Nation's northern and southern neighbors by eliminating tariffs and  streamlining trade. Since NAFTA's implementation, the American economy  has grown by 54 percent and has added 25 million jobs.   President Bush is also credited with signing into law the Americans  with Disabilities Act. This civil rights legislation prohibits  discrimination based on disability and requires reasonable accessible  accommodations.   While serving only one term as President, President Bush's  administration was a success and its impacts went far beyond his  Presidency. Upon retirement, he continued to have influence in  international affairs and American politics.   In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created by President  Bush. Inspired by his ``thousand points of light'' speeches that  encouraged volunteerism and selflessness, the foundation is dedicated  to engaging people to solve the world's challenges through service to  others.   To cement his legacy, the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library  opened in 1997, in conjunction with the Bush School of Government and  Public Service at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas.  Although he was a graduate of Yale University, President Bush chose  Texas A&M to be the site of his library and the adjoining Bush school  because of the school's patriotism, values, military history, and  commitment to public service.   Having lived a life of service to others, President Bush was  committed to educating the next generation who would go on to serve and  to lead the Nation, not only with academic knowledge, but with Texas  Aggie values of respect, excellence, leadership, loyalty, integrity,  and selfless service.   An Aggie at heart, President Bush and Barbara were both beloved by  our Texas A&M and Brazos Valley communities. As Congressman for the  17th District of Texas, I am humbled to represent their adopted home in  College Station, and I am forever grateful for the wisdom and support  President Bush personally shared with me when I started my path in  public service in 2010.   A man of military service, he built a special relationship with the  Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M and was even made an honorary member of  the corps. In 2012, President Bush and I were both inducted into the  Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor.   Also, as an Aggie, I cannot overstate the privilege bestowed upon  Texas A&M University for our campus to have served as President and  Barbara Bush's final resting place, along with their daughter Robin.   Mr. Speaker, President Bush's life was defined by his service to his  family, to our country, and to the world. He will be forever remembered  as a husband, a father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather, a decorated  veteran, a leader, a mentor, a selfless servant, and a friend to  millions.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Bush family. We also lift up the family and friends of President  Bush in our prayers.   Earlier this week, I introduced and the House of Representatives  unanimously passed H. Res. 1172, Honoring the life of President Herbert  Walker Bush. I was humbled to offer this resolution. I have also  requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to honor  his life and legacy.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, for our military men and women who serve us,  and for other first responders who keep us safe here at home.                      Honoring Texas A&M Corps of Cadets     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Texas A&M  University Corps of Cadets for receiving the Guardian of the Human  Spirit Award from the Holocaust Museum Houston on November 14, 2018.   The Holocaust Museum Houston created the Guardian of the Human Spirit  Award in 1997 to recognize and thank those who have enhanced the lives  of others and have worked to better humankind. This year, the museum  decided to honor the Corps of Cadets because of the many contributions  made by Texas Aggies during World War II.   There were 20,229 Aggies who served in World War II, including 14,123  who served as officers, many of whom you will see in this commissioning  photo to my left, including five generals.                                time  1300    This was more than any other school, including the combined totals of  the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy.   Almost all of the Aggies who served during the war had been members  of the Corps of Cadets during their time at Texas A&M, and they  absorbed the Texas A&M values of leadership, service, and integrity.   Since the founding of the university in 1876, tens of thousands of  Texas Aggie Corps of Cadets members have fought to protect the  liberties and safety of our country. From the Spanish-American War in  the late 1800s to the ongoing war on terror, Aggies have served to stop  tyranny and terrorism for freedom-loving persons all over the world.   During World War II, Texas Aggie corps members were involved in the  war from the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, where Aggies  fought and died, to the victory in the Pacific in August of 1945. They  fought and died on every battlefield of the war.   During this period, there were numerous acts of exceptional  sacrifice, including the liberation of German and Japanese  concentration camps and the heroism displayed by Texas A&M's seven  Congressional Medal of Honor recipients.   One of the better known accomplishments occurred on D-day, 6 June  1944, when Lieutenant Colonel James Earl Rudder, Texas A&M class of  1932, commanded the U.S. Army 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions, which  stormed the beach and scaled the 100-foot high cliffs at Pointe du Hoc  in France. The attack saw a casualty rate of over 50 percent, and  Rudder was wounded twice. Despite these casualties, Rudder and his men  established a beachhead for Allied troops to land and begin the  liberation of Nazi-occupied Europe.   The service of the Aggies during World War II was recognized by  numerous civilian and military leaders:   General Omar Bradley wrote about Rudder: ``No soldier in my command  has ever been wished a more difficult task than that which befell the  34-year-old commander of the Provisional Ranger Force.''   General George S. Patton, the famous three-star general who served  during World War II, is reported to have said this about Texas Aggies:  ``Give me an Army of West Point graduates and I'll win a battle. Give  me a handful of Texas Aggies and I'll win a war.''  [[Page H10204]]    General Douglas MacArthur told A&M President T.O. Walton early on  during the war: ``Texas A and M is writing its own military history in  the blood of its graduates, not only in the Philippines Campaign but on  the active fronts of the southwest Pacific.''   In 1946, Dwight D. Eisenhower said: ``No more convincing testimony  could be given to the manner in which the men of Texas A&M lived up to  the ideals and principles inculcated in their days on the campus than  the simple statement that the Congressional Medal of Honor has been  awarded to six former students, that 46 took part in the heroic defense  of Bataan and Corregidor and that nearly 700 are on the list of our  battle dead.''   General Omar Bradley told the graduating class of 1950: ``The men of  Texas A&M can stand up to any men in the world and compare favorably  their education and training for leadership--leadership in the pursuits  of peace, and if it comes to war, leadership in battle.''   The Aggies' presence in the war was invaluable, and their sacrifices  are a reflection of our school's values of respect, leadership,  integrity, loyalty, excellence, and selfless service.   As a former member of Texas A&M Corps of Cadets, I am humbled by and  proud of the service and sacrifice of our cadets during the school's  142-year history.   Cadets at Texas A&M have long been known as the university's keepers  of the spirit, and now the corps will also be known as the guardians of  the human spirit, thanks to the recognition from the Holocaust Museum  Houston.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Holocaust Museum Houston for recognizing the  contributions made by the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets in World War II and  congratulate the corps for receiving the Guardian of the Human Spirit  award.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the legacy, values, sacrifice, and service of Texas A&M  University's Corps of Cadets. As I close today, I urge all Americans to  continue praying for our country, for our veterans, for our military  men and women who serve us, and for our first responders who keep us  safe at home.                       Honoring George Maurice Jackson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor George Maurice Jackson  of Bryan, Texas, who passed away on October 7, 2018.   Maurice was born on November 7, 1953, in Bryan, Texas, to Mary  Jackson Moore and Buddy Rory Williams. Maurice grew up in Bryan and  graduated from Bryan High School in 1972, which was the first class to  be racially integrated.   Maurice sat on the student board, was a member of the National Honor  Society, and lettered in football and tennis. He attended college in  California, obtaining his associate's degree in aerospace studies.   He eventually returned to the Brazos Valley, where he was heavily  involved in our community. A devout Christian, Maurice was a member of  the Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist Church in Bryan. He served as a  member of the adult choir and as an usher at that church.   For over 18 years, Maurice worked at Moore's Printing Company before  becoming an employee with the Texas A&M University library system,  where he worked for 18 years.   In addition to his work and church involvement, he was a dedicated  volunteer at the Brazos Valley African American Museum, where he served  as a member of its board of trustees. He served two terms as board  treasurer and was a member of its many various committees.   Maurice was recognized this year at the museum's Hometown Teams  program, ``How Sports Shape America,'' for his contributions as the  first Black student on Bryan High's tennis team.   In Maurice's life, he was known for his love of two things: the  Dallas Cowboys and his wife, Brenda Jackson.    Mr. Speaker, Maurice's life was defined by his service to those  around him. He was loved by our community, and he certainly left an  endearing legacy. He will be forever remembered as a community leader,  a husband, a father, and a friend to many.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Jackson family. We also lift up the family and friends of Maurice  Jackson in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor his life and legacy. As I close today, I urge all Americans to  continue praying for our country, for our veterans, for our military  men and women who serve us, and for our first responders who keep us  safe at home.                            Honoring W.S. Edmonds     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor W.S. Edmonds of College  Station, Texas, who passed away on November 15, 2018.   W.S. was born on September 22, 1913, in College Station, Texas, to  W.S. ``Bill'' Edmonds and Ima Lilly Boyett.   W.S. spent most of his childhood in Brazos Valley, where he attended  College Station High School and Texas A&M University. He graduated from  Texas A&M as a member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie class of 1938 with a  bachelor's degree in agricultural administration.   After graduation, W.S. became a cotton classifier in Bryan, Texas,  and in New Orleans, Louisiana. He later returned to College Station to  work for the U.S. Postal Service.   After the attack on Pearl Harbor, W.S. volunteered to serve in the  United States Army and went on to work as a courier for the Pentagon.  His work led him to travel around the world and to deliver the maps  used for the invasion of Japan. Once the war was over, W.S. continued  to serve in the Army Reserve and retired as a major.   During the war, W.S. met Marge McDermott on a delivery trip to San  Francisco. Called away on duty, he left one night without warning and  returned to San Francisco more than a year later to find that Marge had  waited for him to come back.   W.S. and Marge were married on January 20, 1947. They settled in  College Station and lived in a house that W.S. built himself.   By 1950, W.S. and Marge had two children, and W.S. continued to work  with the U.S. Postal Service. W.S. was an active member of the American  Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.   He enjoyed duck hunting, fishing, and watching ``Gunsmoke'' episodes.  An avid fan of Texas A&M sports, he spent more than 35 years as a  gatekeeper at Aggie football games and as an usher for Aggie basketball  games.   Even in his senior years, W.S. maintained a sharp mind, loved to tell  stories, and continued to drive his truck until he was 101 years old.  At the time of his passing at age 105, he was the second oldest living  Aggie. He attributed his longevity to cornbread, buttermilk, and a raw  egg during his younger years--and cherry turnovers and V8 juice during  his later years.   Mr. Speaker, W.S.'s life was filled with service to our country. He  will be forever remembered as a selfless servant, a mentor, a husband,  a father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather, and a friend to many.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Edmonds family. We also lift up the family and friends of W.S.  Edmonds in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor his life and legacy. As I close today, I urge all Americans to  continue praying for our country, for our veterans, for our military  men and women who serve us, and for our first responders who keep us  safe at home.                           Honoring John McDermott     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Professor John  McDermott of College Station, Texas, who passed away on September 30,  2018.   John was born on January 5, 1932, to John and Helen Kelly McDermott  in New York City, where he lived for 45 years.   He attended St. Francis College, where he earned a bachelor of arts  in philosophy, and continued his education at Fordham University, where  he earned his master of arts and Ph.D. with great distinction in 1959.   In 1977, John joined the faculty at Texas A&M University to serve as  the department head of philosophy. Over the years, he became a  monumental figure in the university's development. In 1983, he was  instrumental in founding the Faculty Senate and served both as a  faculty senator from 1983 to 1986 and as charter speaker from 1983 to  1984. He also founded the Department of Humanities in Medicine and  organized the Community of Faculty Retirees.  [[Page H10205]]    During his career, he received many awards from Texas A&M for his  research, his teaching, and his service to our university.   John's contributions went far beyond the scope of Texas A&M  University, however. Throughout his career, he served as the president  of, founded, or cofounded many prestigious organizations, including the  Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy, the William James  Society, and the Josiah Royce Society.   John's scholarship and labor in the field of philosophy was  acknowledged in 2016 when he was named as one of the world's 50 most  influential living philosophers.   Among John's many accomplishments was his reputation for nurturing  personal relationships with his five children, six grandchildren,  great-grandchild, extended family, friends, strangers, and students.   John and his wife, Patricia, were known to regularly host students at  their home to learn more about them and to mentor their development.   I was fortunate enough to get an opportunity to meet Professor  McDermott in early 2007 and to serve Texas A&M University with him.  During that year and the next, we served as members of two Texas A&M  administration executive search committees. Even though our ideological  beliefs were widely divergent, we became great friends and were both  passionate about the future of Texas A&M University and its students.    Mr. Speaker, John's life was defined by his service to those around  him. His scholarship and teaching influenced generations of people  across the world. He will be forever remembered as a selfless servant,  an educator, a husband, a father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather,  and a great friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the McDermott family. We also lift up the family and friends of  Professor McDermott in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor his life and legacy. As I close, I urge all Americans to  continue praying for our country, for our veterans, for our military  men and women who serve us, and for our first responders who protect us  here at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
