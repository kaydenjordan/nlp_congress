 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver my first remarks  on the House floor.   Before I became mayor of West Point, I watched my hometown almost  fall completely apart. I saw what happened when bad Washington policies  almost destroyed my hometown by creating the environment for  manufacturing jobs to go overseas. I watched Federal programs that were  failing to meet the needs of my friends and neighbors try to take the  place of good jobs.   The Federal programs weren't fixing the underlying programs in my  hometown. They were simply catching people in the cycle of poverty, and  we surely didn't want a handout. We wanted jobs.   I was faced with a choice of whether or not to move my dental  practice and my family away from my hometown to a more profitable  community or get involved and be part of the solution. I chose to get  involved and work to better the lives of my neighbors and my hometown.   Instead of being satisfied with one-size-fits-all government programs  that simply perpetuated the existing problems, we worked to bring  manufacturing jobs back to West Point, Georgia, by making targeted  investments in economic development and infrastructure.   We attracted a Kia Motors manufacturing plant, and the automotive  industry brought with it suppliers and other related businesses that  produced over 15,000 jobs in just a few years.                                time  1815    The city of West Point and the surrounding area today is revitalized  not because of Federal Government programs or regulations, but because  we worked at the local level to find solutions to meet the needs of our  area.   I ran for Congress so that I could apply these lessons at the Federal  level. We need policies that make America the most competitive place in  the world to do business instead of creating policies that incentivize  companies to take their jobs overseas. We need policies that help get  people out of poverty instead of trapping them in a multigenerational  cycle of property.   I know firsthand that more government programs do not make  communities, schools, or individuals great. In fact, I have lived  through and governed out of the dependence created by bad D.C. policy  and government programs that continue to trap people in poverty.   What we have collectively done to those in poverty with these  policies is morally wrong. There is a better way, and we will do right  by our fellow Americans. I am excited to work with my colleagues to  craft and enact these policies that will improve the lives of our  citizens.   Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Georgia and his passion to serve and be a part of what is going to be  going on here. We are a week away from the inauguration of our new  President-elect, and we are excited about that and moving forward.   As we move across the country, all the way to Arizona, our next  speaker is the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs). I am looking forward  to serving with Andy Biggs on the Judiciary Committee. His background  is working to promote a conservative, small-business agenda, which is  something that is going to be valuable here. He is also an author. For  those of us working in intellectual property and copyright, that is  very important. There is so much job creation that is made by the  intellectual spark that comes from our entrepreneurs. Tonight I am  honored to have the second of our speakers, Andy Biggs from Arizona's  Fifth Congressional District.   I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).
