 Madam Speaker, as I did my very first speech in 2013,  and again in 2017, I rise today to sound a clarion call for the urgent  action by this new Congress to address the senseless gun violence that  continues to claim too many innocent lives across our country.   Sadly, since my first speech 6 years ago, Americans continue to be  gunned down in schools, workplaces, houses of worship, community  gatherings, and even while sitting comfortably in their own homes.   Time and again, Congress pauses for the standard moment of silence  and yet, so far, has failed to take real action.   Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas, Mother Emanuel AME, Tree of Life  synagogue, the Capital Gazette--these names are but a few of the  grotesquely long list of mass shootings and lives cut violently short.  And for every mass shooting that captures the headlines, countless  other victims are killed or maimed in shootings across our country each  and every day.   But as we turn the page on this new Congress, I have hope, hope that  this year we will finally take action to make our community safer:  actions such as passing universal background checks, banning high  capacity magazines, and making trafficking of weapons across State  lines a Federal crime.   We have the power to save lives. Let us now find the courage to act  and build a safer future for our children.                            ____________________
