 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak after my friend from  Texas. He is absolutely right. We have an incredibly vibrant fabric of  folks across this country. My district looks very much like his  district. I appreciate him recognizing those things that unite us and  bring us together.   You know, it hasn't been much over a week, Mr. Speaker, since we  committed ourselves to changing the discourse here, and just in the  last 5 minutes of listening to speakers on this floor, I have heard  sinister accusations of what our healthcare bill will do, of mean bills  and meaner bills, of cruel bills.   Mr. Speaker, there is not a man or woman in this Chamber who doesn't  work every day to serve their constituents better than they did  yesterday. There is not a man or woman in this Chamber who doesn't want  to do better for America tomorrow than we did yesterday. And I promise  you that that pathway is not paved with accusations of ``sinister,''  ``cruel,'' and ``mean.'' It is paved with confessions of common ground,  common goals, and common opportunity. I urge my colleagues to remember  our commitment that we made to one another last week.                            ____________________
