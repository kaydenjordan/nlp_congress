 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for his  exemplary leadership, Representative Thornberry for his career service  to our men and women in uniform, and my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for their hard work on this year's National Defense Authorization  Act.   This bill strengthens our military, makes our country safer, and  provides for our servicemembers and their families.   National security isn't simply defined by the planes and ships we  buy, but in the values we promote within the military and for our  Nation.   This legislation is a significant step forward for diversity,  inclusion, and justice in our Armed Forces, core American values that  our military must promote.   Today's military is the most diverse in our history, with people of  color making up more than 40 percent of Active-Duty servicemembers. And  as our country reckons with systemic racism, so, too, does our  military.   By affirming our founding values, this NDAA enhances military  readiness and taps into the diverse talents and skills of our country.   We elevate the chief diversity officer to report directly to the  Secretary of Defense and service secretaries.   We provide for better accountability, transparency, and reporting on  our diversity efforts.   We ensure equity in promotion boards by removing pictures and other  identifying information that could bias these processes. Officers will  instead be judged solely on what matters: their performance.   We foster new leaders in our military to reflect the diversity of our  country and support their career development, from Junior ROTC to  service academies and historically Black colleges and universities, to  our elite units.   We correct racial inequities in our military justice system by  appointing a deputy inspector general to investigate racial  disparities.   And after years of delay, we finally rename bases and property  honoring the Confederacy.   With support from Congress, barrier-breaking leaders in our military,  and the American people, we will lead with our values.   Mr. Speaker, for a more equitable country and military, I urge all of  my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, let me just start by saying,  John, I always believed that you can tell a lot about a person by the  children they raise. If I knew nothing else about your father than what  I see in you, I know your father is a great man because you yourself  are a great man. While you may think that you will never match your  father's accomplishments, he believed and already knew that you have.   I was in many public events in the presence of you and your father,  and I would watch him as he was watching you. It was so clear and  obvious the pride that he took in you, as I know he did in his other  children, knowing that you were stepping in his footsteps, continuing  his legacy and his work for the people of Maryland.   So, John, you have more than matched the matchless efforts of your  father.   I want to recognize Leader Hoyer for hosting this Special Order hour  this evening. I want to, again, thank my friend and colleague,  Representative John Sarbanes, and his entire family, who have  experienced a great loss.   Over his extraordinary life, Paul Sarbanes held many titles: husband  and father, Maryland delegate, Congressman, Senator, chairman.   Throughout his decades on Capitol Hill, Paul Sarbanes never lost  sight that he was a family man first. Second only to that, he was a  true and dedicated public servant.   Senator Sarbanes worked for Maryland. He was a tireless advocate for  our State and the many families who call Maryland home. They knew Paul  Sarbanes had their backs. Upon news of his death, so many of his  constituents fondly remembered how he was there for him and provided a  helping hand.   Paul Sarbanes didn't approach service with bravado and bombast. He  didn't crave the spotlight because he understood the people he served  were in his spotlight because they were his priority.   He was a master legislator and deft committee questioner. Senator  Sarbanes actively shaped legislation that still affects Marylanders and  Americans today.   He championed the restoration of our beloved Chesapeake Bay. He put  consumer protections front and center in his work, cracking down on  corporate fraud. He held Presidents accountable during the Watergate  hearings and throughout his career. His work and relationships on the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee helped create a safer world.   The example he set continues to inspire so many leaders and public  servants in Maryland to put the work and the people first.   I first met Paul Sarbanes when I moved to Maryland in 1992. I  attended one of his townhalls he had at Prince George's Community  College. I knew nothing of the Senator at the time, and I listened to  him address the concerns and the issues of my neighbors, his  constituents.   While Paul Sarbanes was not necessarily known for or recognized among  his many accomplishments for leading in the areas of national security  and military issues--although he was on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee and very effective--what I saw in him was a profound  appreciation for the men and women who served in uniform. He had great  respect for those men and women who took that uniform off and continued  as veterans to make a contribution to our community.   That was my first impression and the most lasting impression that I  had of Paul Sarbanes. He loved the men and women who served this  country, and he deeply respected their service, even when they took off  the uniform.   Senator Sarbanes was understated, and that was by design. But his  work, life, and legacy speak for themselves.   To John, Michael, Janet, and the entire Sarbanes family, I send my  deepest condolences for your loss. My prayers are with you, as we  remember your father, this remarkable man and public servant, Senator  Paul Sarbanes.                                time  1945
