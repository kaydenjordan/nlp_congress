 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my concerns with the  far-left tax hikes proposed by the majority.   To help pay for their partisan spending sprees, the President and  Democrats in Congress have proposed to double the tax on investment and  raise our business tax rate to the highest in the developed world.   On top of this, they wish to repeal the stepped-up basis, a move that  will disproportionately hurt family-owned farms and businesses.   The radical tax agenda will stifle investment and slow down our  economic recovery at a time when communities  [[Page H3769]]  across our country continue to feel the effects of the pandemic and  government lockdowns.   It will also hurt American competitiveness abroad and force even more  businesses and jobs overseas. Increasing taxes on Americans while  prices are rising faster than they have in more than a decade isn't  just irresponsible; it is dangerous.   The Democrat tax plan will hurt workers and small businesses,  diminish our position as a global business leader, and set our economy  back for decades to come.                            ____________________
