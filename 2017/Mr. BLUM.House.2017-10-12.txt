(D) Steps the Secretary will take, including plans to issue       new regulations, as necessary, to ensure that an employee of       the Department may not access the medical records of another       employee of the Department for the purpose of retrieving       demographic information if that demographic information is       available to the employee in another location or through       another format.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum) and the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 585, currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Iowa?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 585, currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Iowa?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of S. 585, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick  Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.   This bill addresses problems that were exposed in the tragic case of  whistleblower retaliation at the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was a doctor employed on a probationary basis  by  [[Page H8000]]  Veterans Affairs, who committed suicide hours after he was fired for  questioning overmedication of the veterans he cared for.   This bill would, for the first time, create minimum disciplinary  standards to require that managers who retaliate against whistleblowers  are punished. First offenders would receive at least 3 days of  suspension, and repeat offenders would face mandatory termination.   The Kirkpatrick Act also adds whistleblower protections to Federal  employees hired on a probationary basis, like Dr. Kirkpatrick. Agencies  will be required to grant priority to requests for transfer from  probationary period whistleblowers.   The bill would create a number of other whistleblower protections,  many of which are overdue. For example, accessing the medical file of a  whistleblower for the purpose of retaliation would be declared a  prohibited personnel action. The Department of Veterans Affairs would  also be required to devise a plan to prevent that sort of unauthorized  medical file access.   The bill also requires apparent suicides by whistleblowers to be  referred to the Office of Special Counsel for further investigation.  Agencies would be required to initiate training programs for  supervisors and information disclosures for employees regarding  whistleblower protection.   The Senate passed this bill by voice vote earlier this year, and  passage through the House would send the bill to the President's desk  for signature and enactment.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill to honor the memory of Dr.  Chris Kirkpatrick and to protect future whistleblowers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Iowa is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion to recommit.   This bill addresses critical flaws in how the Federal Government  addresses whistleblower retaliation.   The consequences for whistleblower retaliation are very real. There  is a chilling effect of whistleblower reports or unjust termination. In  some cases, like that of Dr. Kirkpatrick in the Department of Veterans  Affairs, the consequences are literally life and death.   We have the opportunity to send this bill to the President for a  signature today and fix this now. Why wait? And at what cost to Federal  employees, veterans, and taxpayers?   I support the gentleman from Maryland's effort to pass this provision  which I previously cosponsored myself, but let's not let one good bill  get in the way of another.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit  and support the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.
