 Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate today  because we are poised to begin consideration of a really important  piece of legislation. It is a plan to make America more competitive  with China and a plan to bring good jobs back to America. I am talking  about the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which includes reshoring semiconductor  manufacturing to America and giving American workers and American  companies the tools they need to compete and win.   Let me give some background on why this legislation is so badly  needed. U.S. dominance in what is called semiconductor manufacturing  has dwindled for decades, and it is an economic and a national security  concern. The U.S. has always led the world in chip design. We  [[Page S3351]]  came up with this technology, but our share of the global chip  manufacturing capacity over the past 30 years has gone from about 37  percent down to less than 12 percent today.   As a result, we rely more and more on foreign countries for these  essential chips; and in the past few years, the supply chain has not  been reliable. You know that if you tried to buy a car recently--maybe  even a washing machine--that you had to wait forever. Why? Because of  the lack of semiconductors. These chips are just not available.   We have all come to learn in recent years that semiconductors are the  building blocks of everything--automobiles, cell phones, computers,  household appliances, medical equipment, but also military systems and  weaponry like the F-35. And in a more digital economy, by the way, that  demand for these semiconductors, these chips, will only continue to  grow.   Last year, this lack of semiconductors caused an estimated loss of  $240 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product. So a $250-billion hit  to our economy, according to the Department of Commerce, last year just  because of these supply chain issues with semiconductors.   This is more complicated by the key role that our adversaries play in  the production of these semiconductors and the fact that we rely on  some very vulnerable nations for critical components of the supply  chain. Neon gas, which is critical for the laser imprinting of the  chips, comes largely from Ukraine. Taiwan is the No. 1 semiconductor  fabricator in the world. By the way, 90 percent of the high-end chips  are made in Taiwan; none are made here in America anymore--90 percent.  Of course, Taiwan's proximity to China and the constant threat of  invasion by China adds to the urgency of diversifying the semiconductor  supply chain.   By incentivizing companies to make these critical components here in  America, we can make our supply chains more resilient; we can protect  our national security; and we can boost economies all across the  country. That is why the CHIPS Act is so important and why we have been  working in a bipartisan fashion in Congress through legislation like  this and the broader USICA legislation.   This legislation would work to improve our Nation's competitiveness,  generally, in technology, foreign relations and national security,  domestic manufacturing, education, trade, and other matters. The CHIPS  Act specifically would bring $52 billion in Federal investments for  domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing.   This broader bill, the so-called USICA bill, last June passed this  Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. We had hoped that the  House would simply pass the Senate approved bill because it was already  bipartisan. It had been worked out with Democrats and Republicans here  in the Senate. Nineteen Republicans supported it; all 50 Democrat  Senators supported it; the White House supported it.   Instead, the House sat on it. It took them almost a year--11 months-- to pass their bill. But when they passed it, it was filled with all  sorts of unrelated items that no Republican could support. That is why  this has gone so slowly.   So earlier this summer, we began conferencing the House- and the  Senate-passed bills, trying to find that common ground between the two  bills. We made some progress, but both Chambers have yet to agree on a  final product.   Meanwhile, there is an urgency to get this done because it is  critical to the decisions that employers are making right now to create  and bring semiconductor manufacturing factories and jobs to America or  to some other country.   In January, Intel announced its plan to build a $20 billion site  consisting of two semiconductor fabs in the United States and in my  home State of Ohio. This is the largest investment in Ohio's history,  by far. It comes with a grand total of, again, $20 billion, two fabs;  and we hope that is just a start.   Intel has said time and time again that if the CHIPS Act funding is  enacted, this will move forward and move forward quickly. They have  also said that if the CHIPS Act moves forward, it could be extended-- the $20 billion--to an up to $100-billion investment in Ohio. Remember,  the $20 billion is hardly historic. That is because it would continue  to build fabs--not just 2, but up to 10. This 3,000-acre site in Ohio  could be home to up to eight additional fabs and make central Ohio the  silicon heartland. This would be great for my State, great for our  region, and great for our country.    This initial investment, by the way, would create about 10,000 good- paying jobs--3,000 on-site eventually, all good-paying, high-paying  jobs, good benefits; but also 7,000 good-paying construction jobs in  putting it together, tens of thousands of additional electrical,  engineering, supplier, restaurant, housing, healthcare, and  entertainment jobs to support the region as it expands thanks to this  investment. The suppliers alone will be tens of thousands of new jobs.   Ohio has already projected that this investment will add $2.8 billion  to the State's GDP, and that is just a start. Investments, like what is  in front of us in Ohio, by the way--as well as similar efforts in  Arizona where the Presiding Officer is from, Texas where my colleague  Senator Cornyn is from who is here on the floor with us today--are all  perfect demonstrations of what this investment in semiconductors  incentives can mean to American workers and American companies.   China has committed a lot more than we are talking about as have, by  the way, a lot of other countries. This is not a free market situation.  One of my colleagues today asked me about, Shouldn't we just let the  market decide? Well, if the market decides and China is offering $150  billion--which they are, over the next 10 years--when Europe has its  own equivalent legislation to ours and is offering tens of billions of  euros, or when South Korea or when Japan or when Taiwan are offering  these huge incentives, it is very difficult to see us being able to  bring these chips back to America--where costs are a little higher--and  be able to be competitive. And we need that to happen for our domestic  economy, but also our national security.   If we fail to act, we are going to miss a key opportunity here to  boost our competitive edge as a nation because these fabs will go  elsewhere.   I would also like to see us include some of the other key pieces of  the broader Senate passed USICA bill that was passed on a bipartisan  basis--again, 19 of us supported that here on the Republican side. That  includes critical new investments in research but also key protections  to be sure that that research is not stolen by foreign governments,  such as China.   We have got to remember that the overall goal of this effort is to  improve our country's competitiveness, especially with regard to China.  To do that, we must not only invest in research and innovation, which I  strongly support, but we must protect that taxpayer-funded research and  intellectual property from being taken by our competitors like China  and used against us. I believe, given current realities, without such  protections, any bill with significant increased levels of Federal  funding for research would be a huge giveaway to Beijing. Why do I say  that? Because I have worked on this issue for the past 4 years. We have  investigated it; we have held hearings; we have passed legislation.   Recently, FBI Director Wray said it well:         The biggest threat we face as a country from a       counterintelligence perspective is from the People's Republic       of China and, especially, the Chinese Communist Party. They       are targeting our innovation, our trade secrets, our       intellectual property on a scale that is unprecedented in       history.    That is the Director of the FBI.   Senator Carper on the other side of the aisle and I introduced what  is called the Safeguarding American Innovation Act and insisted that it  be included in the USICA legislation in order for us to support it.  That was my condition for supporting the broader USICA bill. This came  after we did a yearlong study with the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations that found, shockingly, how China had used what are  called talent programs for two decades--two decades--to target the most  promising taxpayer paid research and researchers and to take that  technology, that intellectual property, back to China.   We found that the American taxpayers had been unwittingly funding  [[Page S3352]]  the rise of China's military and economy over the past two decades,  while the Federal Government had done very little to nothing to stop  it. In fact, when the FBI testified at our hearing, they acknowledged  that. They said, We haven't been focused on this in the past couple of  decades like we should have been; we are going to now.   And they started to. They started to make arrests--and you probably  heard about some of these--arresting scientists all over the country,  who are abusing our lax attitude toward protecting research by  taking research back to China and using it, often, against us.    This legislation goes directly to the root of the problem. It makes  it punishable by law to knowingly fail to disclose foreign funding on  Federal grant applications. That is not a law now. The FBI has asked us  for that law. It requires the executive branch to streamline and  coordinate grant-making between the Federal agencies so there is  continuity, accountability, and coordination. That does not happen now.  It is too wide open. It is not coordinated.   It allows the State Department to deny visas to foreign researchers  who are coming to the United States to exploit the openness of our  research enterprise, and it requires research institutions and  universities to do much more, including telling the State Department  whether a foreign researcher will have access to export-controlled  technologies.   We have worked on this legislation, again, for the past few years. We  have made lots of compromises and concessions with people who had  potential concerns about it. We have come up with legislation that is  bipartisan and makes sense. It has already passed, again, with an  overwhelming margin here in the U.S. Senate. I want to be sure, before  we spend billions of dollars more in Federal research, which is being  proposed, including to the National Science Foundation, that that  research can be protected. Who could be against that? Who could be for  China being able to have better access to this information? Nobody.   Again, a vital component of any competitiveness bill is this  commonsense, extensively negotiated bipartisan bill, which is already  included in the Homeland Security title of USICA.   I can't express enough the importance of passing this legislation,  and it should be done on a bipartisan basis because it has been done  before. It just makes sense.   The broader USICA bill and the chips bill are both important. To pass  the chips legislation is critical right now; it is urgent. And then  what we can pass in terms of USICA is also important. Again, if we are  putting more money into research, which is being proposed and which I  support, it has to be protected. That is pretty simple and common  sense. There is no perfect bill, but this bill will help keep America's  economy competitive. It will help keep American jobs here and grow new  jobs, good-paying jobs with good benefits. We should pass this  legislation, get it through the House, and take it to the President's  desk for signature. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting its  passage.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to once again  talk about Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Before I do, though, I  want to pause for a minute and honor the lives lost in the downing of  Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine, knocked down by Russian  and Russian-backed separatists. This week marks the eighth anniversary  of that tragedy. All 238 passengers and 15 crew were killed.   This eighth anniversary is a reminder that Russia's war of aggression  [[Page S3363]]  on Ukraine didn't just start this spring. Eight years ago, the people  of Ukraine made a courageous choice. They said that they were going to  stand up to a corrupt Russian-backed regime. And when they did that,  Russia responded by invading their country, taking Ukraine's Crimea  Peninsula but also territory here in what is called the Donbas. So this  is not new. For almost 9 years, the people of Ukraine have been  fighting this war with Russia. More recently, of course, the invasion  was even more devastating.   So I join Bridget Brink, who is our new U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine,  who said:         [We] honor the memories of those killed eight years ago--      even as missiles continue to fall on Mykolaiv, Dnipro, and       other Ukrainian cities, killing civilians and demonstrating       the Kremlin's disregard for international law and human       life.''    She is right. Ambassador Brink said it right. The civilian toll in  this war is devastating. Ukraine's Prosecutor General recently said  that since late February of this year, 353 children have died in this  war and more than 1,000 have been wounded.   The Associated Press painted a vivid picture of this with a story  about the killing of a 4-year-old girl named Liza, Liza Dmytrieva. Liza  had Down syndrome and was on her way to see a speech therapist last  Thursday when her mother and she were attacked by Russian missiles. She  was in a town called Vinnytsia. At least 24 people were killed that  day, including Liza and two boys who were 7 and 8 years old. Almost 200  were wounded. Liza's mother is still in intensive care.   It is important to know that when the war started, Liza's family fled  Kyiv but stayed in Ukraine, fleeing to this town, Vinnytsia, about 167  miles southwest of Kyiv.   They thought they could be safe there. It is well behind enemy lines.  It is well behind the frontlines of the battle. Yet this is the reality  of President Putin's war on Ukraine. It is targeting civilians. But it  won't just stop in Ukraine.   This is why Finland and Sweden, in a move that just a few years ago  would have seemed impossible, left a history of neutrality behind and  joined NATO. Their application is currently in place. They see  President Putin's brutal war, and they know that they could be next.   Last week, I mentioned on the floor that as recently as 2016,  President Putin said ``The borders of Russia never end.'' It bears  repeating because he and other Kremlin leaders seem intent on restoring  the Russian empire, even if it means rolling over other free and  independent countries.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee took a momentous step today by  voting to ratify the NATO applications for these two allies of the  United States: Sweden and Finland. I was proud to vote to ratify and  speak in committee about why this expansion is so good for our national  security to have these two countries with strong militaries and strong  economies join our NATO alliance. I hope that the leadership of the  Senate will put this legislation on the floor as soon as possible so  that we can show the world that we are enthusiastically supporting the  joining of these two countries to the NATO alliance.   We need to continue to demonstrate global solidarity in this war.  President Putin, of course, had hoped to divide NATO and divide Europe  and divide the West, but he underestimated what would happen. He  underestimated the foresight and wisdom of the people of Sweden and  Finland, just as he underestimated the courage and resiliency of the  people of Ukraine.    On the energy front, a significant development that isn't getting  nearly enough attention happened last week. Back in June, Russia cut  gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline by 60 percent because of  ``maintenance problems.'' They claimed they needed gas turbines that  had gone to Canada to be repaired to be able to continue the flow of  the pipeline. Those turbines were prohibited from being returned to  Russia because of the sanctions that are in place with regard to  Russian energy infrastructure.   Of course, what President Putin's government claims to be true is  often not. The reality is Russia was punishing Europe and trying to  poke holes in the Western sanctions regime. Unfortunately, the Russians  succeeded. What happened next was discouraging. Canada gave in to  Russia's demands last week and returned the gas turbines, and then the  State Department applauded this move saying that somehow, it was  standing up to Russia's energy blackmail.   I understand the administration's desire to preserve allied unity in  the face of Russian aggression. That is important, especially in our  effort to stand up against Russia over the long term. But if we are  unified behind a bad policy, then that unity doesn't do us much good.   We saw this with Nord Stream 2, remember, when the Biden  administration sided with Germany to remove sanctions on the pipeline,  even though that decision undermined the security of our allies,  including Ukraine. And I think it sent the wrong message, the wrong  message to Russia, and it is one reason that they felt empowered to  invade Ukraine more recently.   Now we are seeing the same thing here. In the name of preserving  unity with certain allies, we are giving in to Russia's demands. As I  said, unity with our allies is important, I get that. But instead of  settling for weak policy, we should be pushing our allies to adopt  stronger policies against Russia, including with regard to energy.   Unfortunately, Russia knows that by manufacturing a ``maintenance  problem'' with their pipelines, our allies tend to back down on our  sanctions. I wonder when will the next ``maintenance problem'' appear.   President Zelenskyy has called the return of these gas turbines to  Russia ``absolutely unacceptable.'' But the Biden administration  characterizes it as a counter to Russia's attempt to weaponize energy.  This just isn't the case.   It is worth noting that another crisis is looming as a result of this  war and is the direct result of Russia's blockade of Ukraine's ports,  especially the port at Odesa. Here is the Odesa Port. There are other  ports along this area into the Black Sea that are absolutely essential  for Ukraine's exports, and yet Russia is blocking them.   Here, I cannot overstate the importance of this issue as Ukraine  supplies so much of the world's food. And without ports to export, that  food is not making it to the people who need it badly, and it is  causing food shortages around the world. Let me be clear: Food should  never be used as a weapon of war. But that is exactly what President  Putin is doing.   The effects are far-reaching. According to the World Food Programme,  increases in the cost of food and fuel since March have caused 47  million people to experience food insecurity, and of those, some 50  million are living close to famine. And that number grows every single  day.   To be specific, according to the Wall Street Journal:         In Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan,       nearly 900,000 people already face starvation and death. That       is more than 10-fold [the] increase from 2019--and, by some       estimates, could result in more people dying from hunger in       2022 and 2023 than in any year since the 1960s and [the]       China's disastrous Great Leap Forward agricultural policies.    Wow. The World Food Programme provides aid for these countries, but  there are shortages because of Russia's war of choice, and the cost of  that aid has risen tremendously. They report that their costs have  jumped 46 percent compared with 2019. That is about 50 percent over the  last few years. And any organization, let alone one that provides  humanitarian aid, would have immense problems keeping up. There are  increases in everyday items, like vegetable oils and special  nutritional pastes given to children who are in famine or malnourished.   While these problems persist, it is the most vulnerable among us who  truly feel the cost of malnourishment. It is the kids and the children  who are most at risk from the effects of hunger. Their bodies, from the  lack of nutrients from food, are too weak to fight off diseases such as  measles or cholera. Even those who survive these terrible illnesses  will often face long-term health problems that could impact them  forever.    So we are not only facing a brutal invasion of Ukraine. We have  talked about that. War crimes are being committed there every day. But  there is also a humanitarian crisis that is taking its toll around the  world, as we speak, as a result of this war on  [[Page S3364]]  Ukraine and the blockade of these ports. This is a battle on so many  fronts, and we have to face the realities of this head-on.   In a war that was thought to be over within weeks, the fighting has  continued well beyond that and may continue for much longer. It has  already gone on longer than most people expected. And while Ukrainians  continue to show their fortitude and strength, the world feels the  effects of this through the global fallout.   Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska will speak to Congress tomorrow  about the damaging effects of this war, just as her husband, President  Zelenskyy, addressed these Chambers in March. I look forward to hearing  what she has to say. She has been a passionate advocate for the rights  of innocent Ukrainian citizens who have been killed and wounded by  these Russian attacks. She has even started her own initiative to  address the mental health impacts of Russia's terrible war and the  trauma that the people of Ukraine have experienced.   That is the kind of leadership Ukraine needs. Frankly, it is the kind  of leadership the world needs. She and her husband should be commended  for their bravery in the face of tyranny and their steadfastness  through the destruction that Vladimir Putin has caused her beloved  homeland.   In Ukraine, the stakes remain high. The casualties, both civilian and  professional soldiers alike, go into the thousands--thousands. The  damage to Ukraine's infrastructure--their beautiful cities, ports,  schools, hospitals, daycares, and apartment buildings--goes into the  billions.   This is a photograph of an apartment building that was recently  bombed in the eastern part of Ukraine, killing, of course, innocent  civilians. According to the Kyiv School of Economics, Ukraine will need  at least $165 billion for postwar reconstruction. Per their latest  update, almost half of these losses are attributable to housing losses  like this one, civilian targets of Russia's unrelenting bombing  campaign. Neighborhoods, residential areas, homes, and apartments have  been hit by these Russian airstrikes.   These are acts of terror. I am a cosponsor of Senator Graham's  resolution to urge the Biden administration to name Russia a state  sponsor of terror. I urge leadership to bring this to a vote. We voted  it out of committee already. It is on the floor. Let's take it up.   So what happens next? We know that making any territorial concessions  to Russia would only embolden President Putin and other future would-be  conquerors. The lesson they would learn is that, with enough patience,  they can wear down the West and get what they want. We must not let  that happen, and the people of Ukraine and the brave President  certainly know this. We must do more quickly to arm Ukraine and help  them to be able to protect themselves and to be able to win this war.   It is clear that President Putin underestimated the courage, the  effectiveness, and the resiliency of the Ukrainian people and the  Ukrainian military, and now President Putin knows what the Ukrainians  are capable of. And, by the way, the Russian forces also understand  this.   On Monday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian troops  to hit Ukraine's High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS. He  asked them to do so because of the success the Ukrainians have had with  just eight of these HIMARS units. These are systems from the United  States. Many of us have pushed very hard to get these to Ukraine. They  went too late. Many lives were lost and cities were flattened because  they did not have them early on.   These rocket systems are absolutely essential because, before that,  the Russians could sit back and indiscriminately bomb Ukrainian cities  and Ukrainian soldiers and civilians and the Ukrainian artillery could  not reach them. These HIMARS systems have a longer range and are more  accurate, and they have been quite effective.   Only eight systems are there now, also three from the UK and a few  from Germany. They need a lot more. But just this week, because of  these systems, Ukrainian forces killed a Russian commander after a  HIMARS hit a Russian control and command center here in the south of  Ukraine. Last week, HIMARS took out a Russian ammunition warehouse in  the same region. They have now taken out a couple dozen of these ammo  depots, especially here in the south and here in the east.   That is incredibly important because, by reducing the Russian  ammunition stores, it will be much more likely that the Russians will  realize that this war is damaging them, their equipment, their  soldiers, and be more willing to come to the bargaining table.   If this is what the Ukrainians can do with just eight HIMARS, imagine  what they could do with what they have been asking for and what they  really need, which is around 40 or 50 of these units. These weapons are  crucial to the brave Ukrainian fighters as Ukraine continues its effort  to defend itself from these Russian airstrikes and missile strikes.   Finally, Ukrainian forces have missiles with adequate range to reach  these Russian missiles, to reach these ammo depots, to reach these  command posts. Russia will still have the advantage, of course, of more  missiles, more men, and more rockets, and their attacks are relentless.   President Zelenskyy highlighted this when he said on Monday that  Russia has fired thousands of cruise missiles and rockets during this  war--thousands. These often come in the middle of the night and hit  residential areas and city infrastructure in places like Nikopol, a  city that is located here, right near Kherson. Rockets have also hit  apartment complexes, as we saw, and shopping malls.   Here is a shopping mall that Russians attacked a few weeks ago. This  is a shopping mall, much as you would see in the United States of  America. It was full of people who were out shopping on a summer day,  maybe buying clothes, maybe buying some food. Over 20 shoppers were  killed at this shopping center, and over 56 people were wounded.   This shopping center, by the way, was in the central part of Ukraine.  If you look at the map, this is not anywhere near the war zone, more up  in this area, in the middle part of Ukraine. So bombings of shopping  centers, apartments, schools, hospitals--it is really hard to imagine,  but it is happening.   We can help Ukraine fight back. Again, the best way is provide them  with more weapons like the HIMARS that they need. We have hundreds in  our stocks, by the way. It is more critical than ever that the United  States and our allies support Ukraine to try to turn the tide. Only  that will get Russia to the bargaining table.    Meanwhile, we must continue to expose the brutality. Much of the  media attention has gone away while lives continue to be lost and  cities continue to be bombarded. We need to keep letting people know  about these atrocities.   That is why I am here on the floor of the Senate for the 18th  consecutive week to talk about what is happening to the people of  Ukraine, what has happened in the past week, and why they deserve and  need our help.   Ukrainians are fighting because they know what it is like to live  under the thumb of authoritarianism. They have been subject to that  through their history, and, more recently, they broke away from that  and toward democracy in 1991 and again in 2014.   It is important to note that Ukraine is not asking us to fight this  war for them. They just want us to help them, along with our allies, to  be able to have the tools they need to protect themselves. They are  asking us for increased lethal military assistance to help defend  themselves, and they are asking all of us to abide by the commitments  that we have made.   In 1994, after the Berlin Wall came down, Ukraine signed what is  called the Budapest Memorandum. It was a treaty where Ukraine agreed to  give up all of its nuclear weapons--and they had a lot of them--in  exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the United States of  America, and the United Kingdom--guarantees that we would all respect  the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine and refrain from the threat  or use of force against Ukraine. That was in 1994--so much for Russia's  commitment.   I have seen the spirit and perseverance of Ukrainians firsthand when  I have visited the country. I have been  [[Page S3365]]  there seven, eight, nine times. I was there right after the Revolution  of Dignity, as it is called, in 2014, when Ukrainians decided to turn  away from a Russian-backed and corrupt government and stand with us and  Europe to pursue a hopeful future of freedom and democracy.   Now, it is time for us and our allies to stand with them. The world  must know that freedom-loving countries around the globe have Ukraine's  back and we will be there until the bitter end. President Putin must  know that we will not back down as he orders the ruthless slaughter of  more innocents.   At the beginning of my speech, I talked about this 4-year-old girl.  Liza's death occurred because of these rocket attacks. At her funeral,  Orthodox priest Vitalii Holoskevych said this: ``We know that evil  cannot win.''   ``We know that evil cannot win.'' And maybe that is the bottom line  here today. This is a struggle between freedom and democracy and the  right of self-determination on the one hand and evil on the other  hand--the evil of conquest, the evil of authoritarianism, the evil of  tyranny. Now is not the time to be tentative or equivocal. At this  critical juncture, we need to work with our allies to provide Ukraine  what they need to defeat evil, to protect their homeland, and to defend  democracy.   I yield the floor.
