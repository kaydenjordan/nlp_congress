 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the  United States Trade Representative.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                                 September 17, 2019.      Hon. Robert E. Lighthizer,      U.S. Trade Representative,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ambassador Lighthizer: We write to express our concern       regarding the inclusion of Article 20.89 in the United       States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This provision,       entitled ``Legal Remedies and Safe Harbors,'' mirrors Section       512 of Title 17, originally enacted by the Digital Millennium       Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). In certain circumstances,       Section 512 frees online platforms from liability for       infringing content posted by third parties.        The effects of Section 512 and the appropriate role of a       copyright safe harbor have become the subject of much       attention in recent year. Some have called on Congress to       update these very provisions, enacted in the days of a dial-      up Internet. The U.S. Copyright Office is expected to produce       a report on Section 512 around the end of this year, the       result of a multi-year process that started in 2015.       Moreover, the European Union has recently issued a copyright       directive that includes reforms to its analogous safe harbor       for online platforms, which may have an impact on the U.S.       domestic policy debate.        Without taking a position on that debate in this letter, we       find it problematic for the United States to export language       mirroring this provision while such serious policy       discussions are ongoing. For that reason, we do not believe a       provision requiring parties to adopt a Section 512-style safe       harbor system of the type mandated by Article 20.89 should       continue to be included in future trade agreements. Given       that the Judiciary Committee closely oversees Section 512       through its jurisdiction over intellectual property laws, we       also hope that the Office of the United States Trade       Representative will work closely with our Committee in       advance of negotiating copyright issues going forward.        Thank you for your attention to this important matter. We       would be pleased to discuss this issue with you at your       convenience.            Sincerely,      Jerrold Nadler,        Chairman.      Doug Collins,        Ranking Member.     Madam Speaker, the original NAFTA was a failure for  working families, and the NAFTA 2.0 deal that President Trump signed in  2018 was not much better. House Democrats recognized that, and we  rejected it, and we worked until we got an enforceable deal.   As a result, the final revised USMCA is much better than NAFTA 1.0,  and it is even better than NAFTA 2.0. And, I would say, you can't even  call it ``NAFTA Lite'' anymore.   Despite our work, even with the improvements that we have made, I  know that this won't bring back all the jobs that we have lost here in  the United States; but, over time, I hope the new labor standards and  the enhanced enforcement mechanisms we negotiated will help raise wages  in Mexico, reducing U.S. corporations' incentive to outsource jobs.   No trade agreement or legislation is perfect, and I do not endorse  every single provision of USMCA, but I know that it is always easier to  talk about a problem than to fix a problem.   When we proceed on this issue, future trade agreements must recognize  that trade and globalization have pushed wages down and weakened the  negotiation power of workers. This is where our focus must be.   One provision I am proud of is in labor, and that is, specifically, a  new rapid-response mechanism to enforce labor standards.   This has never been written into an American trade agreement. By  ensuring Mexican workers' rights are protected, we prevent a race to  the bottom. For the first time ever, we have an enforceable labor  standard in a trade agreement.   I thank everybody who worked on this and made sure that we are moving  in the right direction.   Madam Speaker, I rise to thank Speaker Pelosi for appointing me to  the Working Group tasked with renegotiating USMCA on behalf of the  Democratic Caucus.   I also thank my colleagues on the Working Group, Representatives  Richard Neal, Earl Blumenauer, Jan Schakowsky, Mike Thompson, Suzanne  Bonamici, John Larson, Terri Sewell, and Rosa Delauro.   Additionally, I wish to recognize the efforts of the Ways and Means  trade staff and personal office staff who contributed. Their names are  Laura Thrift, Osaremen Okolo, Syd Terry, Jack Spasiano, Robert Nuttall,  Allison Smith, Scott Stephanou, Jennifer Goedke, Samuel Negatu, Keigan  Mull, Julia Friedman, Katherine White, Katherine Linton, Alexandra  Whittaker, John Catalfamo, Katherine Monge and Katherine Tai.   Finally, I wish to thank Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, Ambassador  C.J. Mahoney, and the rest of the professional staff at the Office of  the U.S. Trade Representative for their faithful engagement with House  Democrats.                                time  1215
