 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following  my remarks, Senator Lankford and Senator Scott of South Carolina be  recognized to speak and to complete their remarks prior to the vote.    Mr. President, the debate on President Biden's massive  plan to expand social programs has focused primarily on its enormous  cost. Remarkably, little attention has been paid to the content of  those policy changes. Yet the expensive entitlement programs the  administration is proposing would have profound implications for  people's lives and for the values that are among the pillars of our  society, for they would break the connection between work and a  brighter future.   From antiquity to our time, great thinkers have observed that work is  about more than just putting food on the table, important though that  is; it has a profound value that enables people to build lives of self- reliance and meaning.   As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said:         No work is insignificant. All labor that uplifts humanity       has dignity.    Under the President's plan, assistance checks sent from Washington  would have no requirement that a recipient work, or pursue education or  training, or participate in programs to remove barriers that prevent  him or her from working. These unconditioned checks would sever the  link between government assistance and work, education, or other  requirements. No one would help a family identify obstacles to a better  life. In essence, the Biden administration would reverse the pledge and  reality of President Clinton's reforms when he promised to ``end  welfare as we know it.''   Robert Doar, who oversaw assistance programs both for New York  Governor George Pataki and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg,  described what has long been a bipartisan consensus. He said:         . . . the way to help people escape poverty is through a       combination of work and government aid--not work alone and       not government aid alone. But the two together.    Why is that combination so powerful and so successful?   Government assistance provides a hand up and aids families who are  struggling to overcome barriers to a better life. Work not only  provides the economic pathway out of poverty, but--also equally  important--imparts dignity, self-reliance, and confidence. It allows  people to provide for their own families. It instills a sense of  belonging and pride. It strengthens our communities.   Let me give you two examples.   I first met Adais when she was enrolled in the Federal Job Corps  program in Limestone, ME. As a teenager, she had been homeless and  wanted to get as far away as possible from the terrible circumstances  in her life--thus her choice of the Job Corps in northern Maine. After  completing this program in Limestone, Adais earned her degree in  nursing from Husson University in Bangor. Today, due to her own  perseverance, hard work, and government support during a very difficult  time, she has a good life working as a nurse and providing for her  three sons. She can take much pride in the life that she has built for  herself and her family.   The second example involves women I met at the Aroostook County  Community Action Program. They have benefited from a holistic approach  to poverty, one that focuses on the needs of both the children and  their parents--a two-generation-together approach--in order to end  intergenerational poverty.   This two-generation approach identifies obstacles to work and  financial independence, and then provides the necessary coaching and  supports to help parents succeed in their goals while also meeting the  needs of their children.   These mothers recounted to me with great pride their very moving  stories of climbing the economic ladder out of poverty and into the  workforce, providing a much better life for themselves and their  children.   What these stories have in common is the dignity of work. As Stephen  Hawking observed, ``Work gives you meaning and purpose.'' Securing the  skills and support to get good jobs changed the lives of these parents  and the lives of their children.   Now, let me be clear that I have supported providing additional help  to assist low-income working families. For example, I worked with  Senator Rubio to successfully double the child tax credit and expand  its refundable portion as part of the 2017 tax reform act, but this  credit was tied to work until the Biden administration changed the  rules of the American Rescue Plan earlier this year.   Given the pandemic, that may well have been justified as a temporary  measure. But now, the administration wants to jettison the work  requirement permanently, and the House Democrats' bill removes all  means testing for a new childcare entitlement program so even very  wealthy families would qualify.   Shouldn't we look carefully at the consequences of sending checks  from Washington untethered to any work or other requirements? Shouldn't  assistance prioritize those with the greatest needs but in ways that  position them to achieve self-reliance?   There are certainly times when it is appropriate for government to  step in, and no one is arguing that people who cannot work, who may  have disabilities, for example, should not receive government  assistance--of course, they should. And in a time of crisis, certainly,  we should do all we can to help  [[Page S6721]]  those who are in need, through no fault of their own, and that is what  happened during the pandemic.   There were many temporary programs that were instituted to help as  our economy shut down and people were laid off. I, along with three of  my colleagues, authored one of them--the Paycheck Protection Program.  The rationale was to allow employers to receive funding so that they  could continue to pay their employees and keep intact that bond between  employers and employees so that the workers could return to the  workplace once the economy reopened. That program was successful and  temporary.   But that is not what this administration is proposing. Rather, it is  creating entitlement programs untethered to work that would  fundamentally change incentives for our families, our communities, our  society, and our economy, depriving people of their dignity and eroding  their ability to provide for themselves and their families. Absent a  pandemic or other crisis, Washington should not simply write monthly  checks, creating dependency among those who could have a better life.  The Federal Government's obligation is not fulfilled by simply sending  a check, washing its hands of any responsibility to actually help  people achieve self-sufficiency.   It appears that this administration is moving toward the left's  proposal for a guaranteed minimum income, regardless of one's ability  to work. Never forget that the first version of the Green New Deal  included a guaranteed income for those ``unable or unwilling to work.''  We must not go down that path.   We will not build a more prosperous, just, and equitable society,  characterized by opportunity, dignity, and meaning, just by issuing  government checks. The time-tested way to achieve those goals for  American families is by supporting and rewarding work. It is by  recognizing the dignity of work. And that is the tradition that we must  continue to embrace.
