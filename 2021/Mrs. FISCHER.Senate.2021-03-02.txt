 Mr. President, I would thank my colleague from Texas  for sharing the Texas letter with us again this year. It is always  inspiring to hear those words, to remember the sacrifices that were  made in Texas. It reminds us all of the sacrifices that are made daily  across this country by people who love this country and stand for its  unity.   Thank you, Mr. President, to my colleague from Texas.
