 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of my  dear friend Debra Walker, who has recently gained her wings.   Debra was one of the most thoughtful, kindest human beings. She was  an artist, crafter, poet, and spoken word performer.   She founded and led Power in Poetry Experience of Detroit, served as  their treasurer and on the boards of many local nonprofits, and  traveled the world training people on cost reduction methods.   She was a loving mother, grandmother, neighbor, and community member.  My sons have always known her as Gabriel's grandmother.   Debra would always show up for anyone, and she did it with her full,  authentic self.   I am sending her daughters, grandbabies, and family prayers of  strength. We will miss Debra.                            ____________________
