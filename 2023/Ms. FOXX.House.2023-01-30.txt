 Mr. Speaker, thanks to House Republicans, regular order has  been restored in the people's House.   From expedited votes to open, substantive debate on the merits of  legislation that now take place on this very floor, the American people  are seeing meaningful progress occur in real time, and it is so  wonderful to see people in the gallery and in the halls of this  Capitol.   One-party rule in Washington had corrupted the legislative process  for 2 years, and it failed every single American.   Mr. Speaker, as part of House Republicans' Commitment to America, we  highlighted our plan to ensure a government that is accountable.   Every day, we are acting upon that commitment and placing  accountability and transparency at the feet of the American people.  This is exactly what good governance is all about. Our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle should take note.                            ____________________
