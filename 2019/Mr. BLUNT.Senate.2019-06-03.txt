 Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the  work and career of Chancellor Mark Wrighton of Washington University in  St. Louis. On May 31, 2019, Chancellor Wrighton concluded his term as  chancellor after 24 years at Washington University.   In 1995, Chancellor Wrighton began his career at Washington  University in St. Louis. He was brought to St. Louis to serve as the  14th chancellor to one of the top institutions in the United States.  Consistently ranked in the top 20 for best universities and currently  ranked No. 8 for best research and medical schools, Washington  University in St. Louis's reputation has grown; and its academic reach  expanded under the leadership of Chancellor Wrighton. Although it was  already a top school when he arrived, Chancellor Wrighton had a strong  vision for boosting the full-time faculty numbers, making capital  improvements to continue the high-quality learning experience for  students, expanding their reach internationally, and enhancing the  advancements in their medical research.   Under his guidance and leadership, Chancellor Wrighton saw the  construction of 50 new buildings, including a state-of-the-art research  facility, the Debra and George W. Couch III Biomedical Research  Building that is home to top researchers involved in genetics,  genomics, and regenerative biology. In addition, one of his projects  that has arguably made the biggest impact in St. Louis and is playing  an important role in cancer research is the development of the Alvin J.  Siteman Cancer Center. His focus on capital improvements to enhance the  quality of learning and research, as well as hiring the best leadership  to oversee the faculty, doctors, and researchers at the Washington  University School of Medicine, have led to pivotal results in the areas  of treating, researching, and developing new approaches to dealing with  diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's. His comprehensive vision for  the best talent to work in top-quality facilities has pioneered the way  for better approaches to personalized medicine and lifesaving treatment  making a significant contribution to addressing many of the complicated  diseases facing patients and the families that love them.   In addition to medical care and research, Chancellor Wrighton had a  vision for contributing to the entrepreneurial climate in St. Louis and  supporting the St. Louis community. There have been many positive local  impacts made by Washington University, but an important commitment  Chancellor Wrighton supported as an original collaborator was to launch  Cortex. Cortex is the St. Louis home to the region's largest innovation  campus for bioscience and technology startups and companies. Chancellor  Wrighton's early and continued support of enterprises such as Cortex  and other collaborations, like the Donald Danforth Plant Science  Center, demonstrate his commitment to support local economic growth and  enhance job creation.   Over the years Chancellor Wrighton has been an instrumental leader  not just in the St. Louis region but across the country. He is not only  known for being one of the best in the field of chemistry, which is  where he started his career, but for being the best in educating our  next generation of students, researchers, and citizens to be  productive, engaged, and to make a difference.   Chancellor Wrighton has led Washington University in St. Louis with  great integrity. He has been a valuable partner to the St. Louis  community. He has been and I am sure will continue to be an important  adviser to me and to those that will seek his expertise to help address  the many issues facing our region, State, and country. He has laid the  groundwork for his successor to continue to enhance the quality  education Washington University in St. Louis has been recognized for  over the past several decades.   We thank him for his years of commitment to the University and to the  St. Louis region.                            ____________________
