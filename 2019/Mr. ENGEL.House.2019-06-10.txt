 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 372) expressing concern for the United States- Turkey alliance.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 372         Whereas the United States and Turkey have been treaty       allies since 1952, when Turkey became a member of the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);        Whereas the United States and Turkey are treaty bound to       safeguard the principles of democracy, individual liberty,       and the rule of law, as well as to unite their efforts for       collective defense and the preservation of peace and       security;        Whereas Turkey is in a unique geostrategic position on       NATO's southeastern flank, at the confluence of Europe,       Russia, the Middle East, and the Caucasus;        Whereas Turkey is a critical NATO ally and important       military partner for the United States, contributing to key       NATO and United States missions and providing support for       United States military operations and logistics needs;        Whereas Turkey permits United States military access to       Turkish territorial waters, airspace, and base and port       facilities, and hosts over 2,000 members of the United States       Armed Forces, air defense equipment, and other equipment       necessary to conduct global operations and power projection;        Whereas Turkey is a key player in the long-term strategic       competition Western allies face with revisionist powers such       as Russia and China;        Whereas despite the fact that Turkey shares key regional       interests with the United States, its cooperation with Russia       and Iran, its military occupation of northern Cyprus, its       rollback of democratic norms and institutions, including       attacks on the free press, and its continued unjust detention       of United States citizens and locally employed United States       Embassy staff is deeply problematic for the United States-      Turkey relationship;        Whereas the United States recognizes that Turkey perceives       growing regional security  [[Page H4379]]       threats from aircraft and ballistic missiles and sees an       urgent need for a new air and missile defense system;        Whereas Turkey announced an agreement to acquire the S-400       air and missile defense system from Russia in July 2017 and       has publicly stated it could take delivery as early as July       2019;        Whereas section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries       Through Sanctions Act of 2017 (CAATSA) requires the President       to impose sanctions on any individual or entity that engages       in a significant transaction with the Russian defense or       intelligence sector;        Whereas the United States Government has developed an       attractive alternative offer to provide Turkey with a strong,       capable, NATO-interoperable air and missile defense system       that meets Turkey's defense requirements;        Whereas Turkey's planned acquisition of the Russian-made S-      400 undermines the security of the United States and NATO       allies, weakens the United States-Turkey relationship, and is       incompatible with Turkey's plan to operate the F-35 Joint       Strike Fighter and participate in F-35 production;        Whereas the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is the       world's leading 5th generation fighter aircraft program with       more than a trillion dollars in investment among United       States and international partners;        Whereas Turkey has been a critical partner in the F-35       Joint Strike Fighter program since 2002, with significant       industrial participation, including manufacturing of certain       F-35 components, plans to host a maintenance facility for       regional F-35 operators, investments of more than $1.25       billion in the program, and plans to procure 100 F-35As; and        Whereas in addition to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,       Turkish defense acquisition programs that could be affected       by sanctions include the Patriot air and missile defense       system, CH-47F Chinook heavy lift helicopter, UH-60 Black       Hawk utility helicopter, and F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) fully supports the United States Government's January       2019 offer to sell the Patriot air and missile defense       systems to Turkey, with the condition that Turkey not acquire       the S-400 air and missile defense system from Russia;        (2) condemns the Government of Turkey's stated decision to       acquire the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system,       which would endanger the integrity of the United States-      Turkey alliance and undermine NATO;        (3) calls for terminating Turkey's participation in the F-      35 industrial program and delivery of F-35 aircraft to Turkey       if Turkey acquires the Russian S-400 air and missile defense       system;        (4) declares that Turkish acquisition of the Russian S-400       air and missile defense system would constitute a significant       transaction within the meaning of section 231 of the       Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of       2017 (22 U.S.C. 9525);        (5) calls for full implementation of sanctions under the       Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of       2017 if Turkey acquires the Russian S-400 air and missile       defense system; and        (6) calls on the Government of Turkey to cancel the       acquisition of the Russian S-400 air and missile defense       system.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 372.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am pleased to rise in strong support of this measure to address the  developing situation with Turkey. I want to thank my colleagues who  joined me to introduce this legislation; first and foremost, Ranking  Member McCaul, Leader Hoyer, Minority Leader McCarthy, Chairwoman  Lowey, Ranking Member Granger, Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member  Collins.   Madam Speaker, Turkey is a NATO ally and a nation with which we have  had a long history of friendship and partnership. But I am deeply  troubled by the direction that President Erdogan is taking his country.   During his time in office, we have watched as Erdogan has turned  Turkey into an authoritarian state, attacking the democratic values  that our two nations had shared for many years. He has cracked down on  the freedom of the press, thrown innocent people in jail for voicing  opposition, and consolidated his grip on power at the expense of  Turkey's democratic institutions.   And his troubling behavior doesn't stop there. Erdogan is cozying up  to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, putting the security interests of  the United States and the NATO alliance at risk.   Turkey's plan to acquire the Russian S-400 air defense system would  threaten American security and do lasting damage to our historic  bilateral relationship. It simply cannot happen, especially while  Turkey is still a U.S. and NATO ally participating in the F-35 program  and hoping to acquire these planes.   Today's resolution gets at this very issue. If Turkey wants to  continue as a NATO ally and U.S. partner, it must commit to upholding  our shared interests. And if Turkey decides to follow through on its  plan to acquire the Russian S-400, then they must not be able to get  American F-35s; they must not participate in the F-35 program; and they  must face the consequences of their decision.   And it is not that the United States is unable to comprehend Turkey's  need for air defense. In fact, we have offered the Patriot anti- aircraft/anti-missile defense system, the top of the line in our  inventory. That offer remains on the table.   We rarely see it in foreign affairs, but this is simply a black-and- white issue. There is no middle ground. Either Mr. Erdogan cancels the  Russian deal, or he doesn't. And there is no future for Turkey having  both Russian weapons and American F-35s.   There is no third option. There is no path for mitigation that will  allow Turkey to have its cake and eat it too. We cannot risk exposing  our national-security technology to Russia.   There is no partisan divide on this issue. The State Department, the  Defense Department, the Treasury, even Vice President Pence have all  been raising the alarm and urging President Erdogan to cancel the sale.  I hope President Trump listens to his advisers and makes sure Turkey's  leaders understand the consequences of their actions.   And the consequences are serious. If Turkey follows through with the  acquisition of the S-400, it would trigger sanctions that Congress  overwhelmingly, bipartisanly passed 2 years ago. It is critical that  Turkey knows that the United States will use these tools if the  situation arises.   In the meantime, it is important that we pass this measure and send a  clear message: The United States will not sit by as Erdogan turns  Turkey into an authoritarian state aligned with our adversary Russia.   Let me say that again. It is important that we pass this measure and  send a clear message: The United States will not sit idly by as Erdogan  turns Turkey into an authoritarian state aligned with our adversary  Russia.   So I am pleased to support this.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.

Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H. Res.       372, Expressing concern for the United States-Turkey       alliance.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary. I acknowledge that the Committee will not seek a       referral of or formally consider H.

Madam Speaker, I don't have any speakers on this side. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Once again, I am pleased to support this bipartisan measure that  strengthens our security policy in Europe. I thank Ranking Member  McCaul and all of the other chairs and ranking members of important  committees who have stood by us on this bill. It is really a Congress  speaking with one voice in a very bipartisan fashion for something that  is really very important.   Today's resolution reaffirms the historic partnership between the  United States and Turkey, and it lays the groundwork for how Erdogan  can start to put this relationship back on the right track.   We cannot stand by as he turns this NATO ally into an authoritarian  regime aligned with Vladimir Putin. So I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting this measure.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 951) to promote bilateral tourism through cooperation  between the United States and Mexico, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 951         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Mexico Tourism       Improvement Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States and Mexico have benefitted       economically from a bilateral, mutually beneficial       partnership focused on enhancing the tourism industry in both       countries.        (2) In 2016, Mexican tourism to the United States peaked at       18,990,585 visitors, constituting 1 in 4 (24.9 percent) of       all tourists that year.        (3) Additionally, in 2016, spending by Mexican tourists in       the United States totaled $20.3 billion, which represented a       3 percent growth from 2015.        (4) Tourist activity to the United States from Mexico has       declined since 2016, which is in contrast to an overall       international tourism industry increase in the United States.        (5) In 2017, international tourist arrivals totaled       76,900,000, up 0.7 percent from 76,400,000 in 2016.        (6) The same year, 77,000,000 international visitors spent       a record $251.4 billion on hotels, travel, food, and       souvenirs, a 2-percent increase over 2016.        (7) However, also in 2017, there was a 6.1-percent decline       in visitors to the United States from Mexico, comprising a       loss of 1,166,585 Mexican tourists from 2016.        (8) The Department of Commerce has not yet released 2017       spending totals by Mexican tourists in the United States, but       a corresponding monetary decline would be approximately $1.24       billion in lost revenue.        (9) This is a critical economic trend given that Mexico is       the biggest source of international visitors to the United       States after Canada.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--  [[Page H4382]]         (1) to continue deepening bilateral tourism through       governmental cooperation between the United States and       Mexico;        (2) to improve third-party tourism to the United States and       Mexico through joint international promotional efforts; and        (3) to seek to prioritize and expand the tourism industries       in both countries by emphasizing exchanges in various       international economic sectors, including relating to--        (A) hospitality and accommodation;        (B) retail; and        (C) cultural education.       SEC. 4. STRATEGY TO EXPAND BILATERAL TOURISM THROUGH                     COOPERATION WITH MEXICO.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of State shall develop a       strategy through the High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED)       platform to carry out the bilateral tourism policy described       in section 3 and to encourage the Government of Mexico to       take reciprocal action relating to bilateral tourism.        (b) Elements.--The strategy required under subsection (a)       shall--        (1) encourage more joint tourism initiatives between the       United States and Mexico, including collaborations between       governmental and non-governmental entities; and        (2) encourage United States and Mexican nonprofit       institutions and private businesses to assist prospective and       developing entrepreneurs in strengthening their business       skills in the United States and Mexico.        (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to       Congress a report on the strategy required under subsection       (a).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 951, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me start by thanking the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cuellar), the recently-appointed chairman of the U.S.-Mexico  Interparliamentary Group, for authoring this legislation, which sends a  positive message from this Chamber to the Mexican people at a time  when, frankly, it is needed more than ever in view of all the things  that have been talked about with American belligerence toward Mexico  and the unnecessary saber rattling.                                time  1945    I think it is important that we talk about positive things between  our two countries, and tourism certainly is right there. It is one way  to make a positive difference.   In recent years, bilateral tourism between the United States and  Mexico has steadily declined. This is in sharp contrast to a rise in  the broader international tourism industry in the United States.   In 2017 alone, there was a 6 percent decline in visitors to the  United States from Mexico, and this decrease hurts our economy and  American workers, specifically in the States along our southern border  with Mexico where President Trump is still trying to build an ill- advised wall.   The legislation we are now considering would direct the State  Department to expand tourism cooperation with Mexico, including by  close collaboration with nonprofit organizations and the private  sector. It also encourages expanded third-party tourism to the United  States and Mexico through joint international promotional efforts.   But more than anything, this bill is about jobs. It is about creating  American jobs and maintaining a robust partnership with our neighbor to  the south.   Its consideration could not be more timely. Last month, the President  again threatened to punish American workers and consumers for failures  at the border, only to claim victory with a so-called deal that  reverted to the status quo. The President has again managed to cause  further harm to the U.S.-Mexico relationship for no good reason  whatsoever, and tourists are staying home in response.   Today, the House of Representatives is choosing to go in a different  direction. With this bill, we are once again coming to the House floor  to build bridges with our neighbor to the south.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Cuellar for his continued persistence in  promoting the U.S.-Mexico relationship. I urge my colleagues to support  the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the author of this bill, who also happens to be  the chair of the U.S.-Mexico Interparliamentary Group.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, the U.S.-Mexico relationship is too important to be  held hostage to petty politics, and yet here we are again for the last  2 weeks.   We don't want to hurt the U.S.-Mexico relationship. In fact, I was in  Mexico City just a few weeks ago and met with the new Mexican  President, who told us that he really wanted to have good relations and  work closely with us. I was impressed with him because he has a steady  hand.   I think that we should not be alienating our neighbors. We should be  welcoming them, welcoming the partnership with them.   We don't want to undermine tourism; we don't want to hurt Americans;  and we don't want to raise taxes on the working class while doing  nothing to address the humanitarian challenges on the U.S.-Mexico  border.   I am glad that we seem to not be going that way in terms of clashing  with Mexico, but, again, this is a win-win bill: a win for us because  it helps tourism, a win for Mexico as well.   Congress has chosen to pursue a positive agenda with Mexico instead.  This legislation will play an important role in showcasing the mutually  beneficial relationship Congress and most Americans want with Mexico.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Mr. Cuellar for his continued leadership  and for wanting a stronger relationship between the United States and  Mexico. I thank the ranking member, as usual, for working with us on  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2140) to prevent child marriage in United Nations- administered refugee settlements, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2140         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Child Marriage in       Displaced Populations Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to UNICEF, 12 million girls marry before the       age of 18 every year.        (2) Early marriage denies children, especially girls, their       right to make vital decisions about their well-being,       including relating to their health, family, and career. Child       brides are less likely to finish their education, and are at       higher risk for abuse, contracting HIV, and dying while       pregnant or giving birth.        (3) Child marriage also imposes substantial economic costs       to developing countries, impeding development and prosperity       gains.        (4) Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to       child marriage, in communities where poverty, instability,       and displacement put pressure on families to marry children,       particularly young girls, off at a young age.        (5) One United Nations (UN) study found that child marriage       rates were four times higher among displaced Syrian refugees       than among Syrians before the crisis. This indicates that       displacement, instability, and poverty are driving child       marriages.        (6) United Nations agencies, including UNICEF and UNHCR,       have acknowledged the dangers of child marriage and taken       steps to address its risk in the populations they serve.        (7) The UN Joint Program on Child Marriage supports this       work by building the resilience of populations to indirectly       prevent child marriage and by generating new data and       evidence on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian       and fragile settings. For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint       Program on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adolescent girls       strengthen critical skills through school clubs and Go Back       to School campaigns, as well as life-skills and financial       literacy training.        (8) After the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage identified       Yemen as one of its focus countries, 65,000 people, of whom       45,000 are adolescents, were reached with awareness raising       activities on the harms of child marriage in 2018 alone. As a       result, local council representatives, elders, and community       leaders from six districts signed a pledge to support       advocacy efforts to end child marriage.       SEC. 3. PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN DISPLACED POPULATIONS.         (a) In General.--The President shall direct the United       States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use       the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the       United Nations to call for an adoption of an agreed-upon       definition of ``child marriage'' across United Nations       agencies.        (b) Strategy.--The President shall direct the United States       Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the       voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United       Nations to call for the development of a comprehensive       strategy to address child marriage in refugee settlements       administered by the United Nations. Such strategy should       include the following:        (1) A mandate to regularly collect and report data related       to the number of known or suspected child marriages taking       place inside each such settlement.        (2) Protocols for United Nations personnel regarding       prevention and monitoring of child marriages inside each such       settlement.  [[Page H4384]]         (3) A description of United Nations programs administered       at such settlements that include--        (A) physical, mental, and emotional rehabilitation and       support to children who have extricated themselves from child       marriage; and        (B) alternatives to child marriage, such as education       initiatives.        (4) Protocols regarding how United Nations personnel       should--        (A) report adults participating in illegal child marriages       in each such settlement; and        (B) monitor the prosecution of such adults by the       authorities of the country in which the settlement at issue       is located.        (c) Research.--The President shall direct the United States       Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the       voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United       Nations to advocate for the United Nations and its       appropriate agencies to include, as appropriate, in all of       its research into child marriage the relationship between       child marriage and violence against girls, including young       children and infants.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Child marriage.--The term ``child marriage'' means a       formal marriage or informal union involving at least one       person younger than age 18.        (2) Illegal child marriage.--The term ``illegal child       marriage'' means a child marriage that is illegal under the       laws of the country in which the child marriage occurs.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2140, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me start by thanking the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner) for offering this bill and for shining a light on the  problem of illegal child marriage, particularly among vulnerable  refugee populations. I am grateful for Mrs. Wagner's leadership on an  issue that we should all support. It is really important to all get  around it.   Child marriage, Madam Speaker, deprives young people of their futures  and hinders the progress of development work all over the world.   UNICEF reports that 12 million girls marry before the age of 18 every  single year. What does that mean for these girls? It takes away their  right to make vital decisions about their well-being, about their  health, their family, their future.   Child brides are also less likely to finish their education and are  at higher risk for abuse, contracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or  giving birth.   Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to child marriage.  Poverty, instability, and displacement pressure families into marrying  off children, particularly young girls, at an early age.   For example, child marriage among Syrian refugees in Jordan increased  from 15 percent in 2014 to 36 percent in 2018. One survey of Syrian  refugees in Lebanon found that nearly a quarter of girls between 15 and  17 were married.   In Bangladesh, Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Burma have  reported marrying off young girls to protect them from sexual violence.   Stopping this cycle and ending illegal child marriage is critical to  supporting refugees and empowering youth for a better future.   A number of U.N. agencies are doing important work to address child  marriage among the populations they serve. For example, the U.N.'s  Joint Program on Child Marriage, a joint effort between UNICEF and  UNFPA, is gathering new data and evidence on this problem and helping  to build resilience in vulnerable populations, including refugees.                                time  2000    But there is much more we can be doing, and this bill demonstrates  American support for tackling this problem. It would require us to flex  our muscles in the U.N. to come up with a comprehensive definition of  child marriage. It would also require a new strategy to ensure that  displaced populations have the protections and the tools to avoid  illegal child marriage.   We want to empower young people to have a better future, and this  bill will help us get at a problem that threatens far too many futures,  so I am pleased to support this measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, first, I want to thank the author of this  bill for her kind words.   As she pointed out, child marriage is a problem that befalls far too  many young people around the world, especially among desperate families  who, because of poverty or instability, feel they have no choice but to  commit their children to marriage. Of course, when this happens, it  starts another cycle of poverty and instability, of abuse and illness.  It is just a tragedy.  [[Page H4385]]    This is one of those issues where we look at the situation and see a  moral obligation to act. Dealing with this problem in our foreign  policy is a reflection of our country's values, of our commitment to  the rights and dignity of all people. This bill will help make sure our  policy stays aligned with those values and that we are doing more to  end the scourge of child marriage.   I again thank Representative Wagner for her work on this measure. I  urge all Members to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
