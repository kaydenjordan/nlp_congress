 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Engel for  yielding.   I also thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on the sanctions  package. The American people have been waiting some time for the  sanctions package to finally pass.   This bill dials up our current sanctions on North Korea, Iran, and  Russia to hold their governments accountable for their destabilizing  actions.   The Russia piece in this package is particularly necessary. Russia  has flagrantly violated international law by invading Ukraine and  interfering in American and European elections. These sanctions are a  clear signal that the United States will hold President Putin and his  close associates accountable for their actions. They are also a  declaration that Congress can and will act, even when President Trump  refuses to do so.   In addition to these sanctions, Congress must continue to investigate  to determine the scope of Russia's attack on America's democracy and  establish which Americans, if any, aided in those efforts.   Again, I thank Ranking Member Engel, Chairman Royce, and everyone in  this Congress who has supported these sanctions.
