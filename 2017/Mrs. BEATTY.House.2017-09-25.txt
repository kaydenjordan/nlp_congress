 Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to express my  opposition to the newest TrumpCare bill that will result in 21 million  fewer Americans having healthcare insurance.   Once again, Senate Republicans, like House Republicans, are rushing  to pass a hurtful bill that every major healthcare group, from the  American Medical Association to Kaiser, is opposing.   The latest heartless version of TrumpCare is no different than the  previous plans because it still leaves many in the cold. As the old  saying goes, it is like putting lipstick on a pig, as the bill still  allows States to eliminate essential healthcare benefits like ER  visits, preventative screenings, and prescription drug coverage.   This misguided plan also guts Medicaid, at a loss of $4 billion in  Federal funds to Ohio--my State--and allows insurers to charge seniors  and people with preexisting health conditions more money for less  coverage.   Now it is time to stand together and hold strong with Senator John  McCain and the Governors of Ohio, Nevada, and other States. Republicans  should work with Democrats to create a better deal, better jobs, better  healthcare, and a better future for all Americans.                            ____________________
