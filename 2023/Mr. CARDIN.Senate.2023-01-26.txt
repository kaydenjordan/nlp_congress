 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tomorrow, January 27, is the 77th  anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, which is located in German- occupied Poland. January 27 has been designated by the United Nations  as Holocaust Remembrance Day.   At Auschwitz-Birkenau were the most notorious of the atrocities  committed during World War II in concentration, labor, and death camps  run by the Nazis in Germany during World War II. Six million Jews were  murdered during World War II and 5 million others--Romas, Afros,  Germans, gay men and women, people with disabilities, and others--who  were just disliked by the Nazi regime. Eleven million people perished  as a result of these atrocities.   Our responsibility? To remember, to never forget what happened during  World War II--what was committed--and to do everything in our power to  make sure that these types of atrocities never happen again. We owe  that to support the survivors so that their heroism is not forgotten,  and we need to support Holocaust education.   I want to thank my colleagues in the appropriations process. We have  made funds available to help the survivors of the Holocaust and to  provide for Holocaust education.   ``Never again'' is what we need to achieve. We have not achieved it  to date. We can look back at the atrocities committed in Rwanda or we  could take a look at what is happening today with the Uighurs or with  the Rohingyas or with the Yazidis--we see atrocities being committed  around the world--or we could take a look at what is happening in  Ukraine, perpetrated by Russia--the atrocities and war crimes that are  being committed by the Russians.   So, on this day of remembrance, it is important for us to understand  where we are and to take steps to protect us against atrocities.   I serve on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Board as the Senate  representative. That is an institution that is dedicated to compiling  information about the Holocaust, making it available through education  and other opportunities for people to understand what happened, and to  have a mission to prevent atrocities in the future.   I also serve as the Senate Chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission. The  U.S. Helsinki Commission is best known for its commitment to advance  human rights globally. I am proud of the work that we have done in  Holocaust education and in fighting the rise of anti-Semitism.   I also serve as the Special Representative of the Organization for  Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly on Anti- Semitism, Racism and Intolerance.   I mention all of that because I want to share with you the concerns,  the warning bells, that have gone off as to the rise of hate in our own  community and around the world that should be of concern to all of us.   In 2021, there was the highest number of instances of anti-Semitism  in the United States in its history. We broke the record in 2021.  According to the ADL, there was a 60-percent increase in 2021 over 2020  in anti-Semitic activities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security  has issued a warning about the heightened potential for violent  domestic attacks. These anti-Semitic activities are deadly. I need not  remind us all of the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, in 2018,  where 11 people were murdered by anti-Semitic activity. There are 25  percent of Jews who live in America who fear violence caused by anti- Semitism.   I have had a chance to visit a lot of countries as a Member of the  U.S. Senate and as a former Member of the House. I try to visit  synagogues when I travel abroad, and it is understood that there will  be security in front of the synagogue buildings when I attend the  services, but I always felt comfortable in the United States that that  would not be necessary. It is now necessary for synagogues to have  security here in the United States and for mosques and other areas that  are vulnerable to violence caused by hate.   We are also at risk today in our own democratic institutions. Anti- Semitism and hate is fueled by conspiracy  [[Page S113]]  theories, the replacement theory, which is based upon the old-age,  anti-Semitic trope. That leads directly to violence. It is also a  threat to our democratic institutions. Conspiracy theories about  election deniers led up to the January 6 attack on this sacred  building. We fight for the peaceful--we believe in the peaceful  transfer of power, and we saw violence trying to prevent the peaceful  transfer of power, which is critically important to our democratic  institutions.   Mr. Putin's campaign, in part, is based upon anti-Semitism. He says  he wants to denazify Ukraine. Ukraine has a Jewish President, I would  like to remind my colleagues. We all have a responsibility to fight  anti-Semitism and any form of hate in our community.   In 2004, I participated in the Berlin Conference, which was the first  major international conference in recent times to coordinate strategies  to fight anti-Semitism. What came out of that conference was that  leaders have a responsibility to lead. Our words mean something. When  there is violence in our community, we need to speak out against it. If  any minority group is unsafe, we are all unsafe. We need to form  coalitions to fight all forms of intolerance in our community.   On November 29 of last year, I convened a roundtable discussion.   I want to thank Senator Rosen and Senator Blumenthal for joining me  and Congressman Veasey from the House of Representatives.   We brought together representatives from the Department of Homeland  Security, from the Department of Justice, from the White House, and  from the Department of State. We had representatives from the Anti- Defamation League and from the American Jewish Committee.   I want to compliment the Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff, for holding a  similar discussion in the White House.   What came out of those discussions is that we need a whole-of- government approach in order to stop the tide--the rise--of hate and  violence in our community. So I was so pleased that President Biden, on  December 12, established an interagency group, led by the Domestic  Policy Council, to increase and better coordinate U.S. Government  efforts to counter anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of  fear and discrimination.   We need a coordinated strategy. We all need to be part of that  coordinated strategy. This is not 1 day a year; it is every day--365  days a year. We all need to be engaged. We all have a responsibility to  join together in a coordinated strategy so that ``never again'' means  never again.   So, on this day of remembrance, as we acknowledge the liberation of  the Auschwitz death camps, let us also rededicate ourselves to doing  everything in our power so we really can say ``never again.''   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I am proud to reintroduce the  Preventive Health Savings Act. This bipartisan legislation would reform  the Congressional Budget Office's CBO, scoring to better reflect the  savings from preventive health initiatives by expanding the budgetary  window the CBO evaluates.   Currently, the CBO scores the budgetary implications of legislation  over a 10-year period. Oftentimes, however, the cost-savings of  preventive care are not clear within the current 10-year ``scoring''  window. This legislation would direct the CBO to extend its analysis  beyond the existing 10-year budget window to two additional 10-year  periods, which will give a truer picture of the benefits of health  initiatives and better enable Congress to pass effective policies.   Chronic and mental health conditions account for 90 percent of our  Nation's $4.1 trillion in annual medical expenditures. In 2018, more  than half of U.S. adults had 1 of 10 chronic conditions, and 27.2  percent had multiple chronic conditions, and this number is only  expected to grow. Chronic diseases disproportionally affect racial and  ethnic minorities. For example, when compared to non-Hispanic White  adults, Black adults are 1.6 times, Asian American adults are 1.4  times, Hispanic adults are 1.7 times, American Indian and Alaska Native  adults are 2.9 times, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults  are 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. Additionally,  Black adults are 1.4 times, American Indian and Alaska Native adults  are 1.2 times, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults are 1.3  times more likely to have asthma than non-Hispanic Whites.   As more Americans experience chronic conditions, the healthcare costs  in the United States will continue to rise. Not only are these costs a  heavy burden on millions of Americans and their families, but they are  also primary drivers of our annual Federal budget deficits and  accumulated debt. As medical expenditures continue to rise, it is  crucial that we capture the long-term savings that can be achieved by  focusing our efforts on averting, halting, or slowing preventable  diseases. This is why I have long been a champion for expanded access  to affordable, high-quality preventive health care and am proud to have  championed initiatives from coverage for colon screenings to increased  access to oral health care. But we still have progress to make.   I am encouraged by the cutting-edge research that world-class  institutions in my home State of Maryland, such as the National  Institutes of Health, NIH, are doing to address chronic diseases.  Interventions, including screenings, vaccinations, and behavioral  changes, can prevent or delay the onset of new cases and mitigate the  progression of a preventable illness, which can result in large  reductions in the financial, physical, and emotional toll of developing  one or more chronic diseases. By having the data to enable us as  lawmakers to look at cost-benefit analyses, we can most effectively use  our Nation's resources to improve the health of Americans while  reducing medical costs. The first step to altering the trajectory of  chronic diseases and curbing healthcare costs is to have more accurate  information on the cost savings of preventive care.   I thank Senators Crapo, King, and Cramer for joining me in  introducing this legislation and urge my other Senate colleagues to  consider cosponsoring the measure.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 121. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require  the provision of training and information to certain personnel relating  to food allergy identification and response, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
