 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor two  young men who gave their lives in Vietnam 55 years ago.   Marvin E. Galbraith and John Timothy Lane were friends who grew up in  Brewster, Washington, as the Vietnam war broke out. Both graduated from  Brewster High School, and at the age of 20, in the spring of 1968, each  found themselves in combat in Vietnam.   Lance Corporal Galbraith served with K Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th  Marines in the I Corps region of South Vietnam. On March 27, he was  killed by a landmine while on patrol in Quang Nam province. Marvin was  laid to rest in Bridgeport Cemetery with five generations of his  family.   Private First Class Lane deployed in the Mekong Delta with B Company  of the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry ``Manchus'' of the 25th Infantry  Division. On May 4, he was killed in a night battle near Duc Hoa when  he threw himself on an enemy hand grenade in a brave act to save his  fellow soldiers.   In recognition of Tim Lane's courage, he was posthumously awarded the  Distinguished Service Cross, the Nation's second highest award for  valor. He was buried at Locust Grove.   As Memorial Day approaches, I honor the lives of these two young men  from Brewster who heroically sacrificed their lives for our Nation.                   Recognizing WSU Master Gardeners Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Washington State  University celebrating 50 years of their flagship Extension Master  Gardeners Program.   Founded in 1973 by WSU extension agents from King and Pierce  Counties, their very first training session had 200 applicants. The  master gardener concept has been replicated across the United States  and internationally. Today, there are over 85,000 certified extension  master gardeners.   With a mission to engage university-trained volunteers to empower and  sustain diverse communities with relevant, unbiased, research-based  horticulture and environmental stewardship education, they have made  quite the impact not only in my State of Washington but around the  world.   This program makes me proud to be an alumnus of Washington State  University. I thank the hardworking visionaries and volunteers who  believe in the impact that education and engagement can have on the  health of our communities and our neighbors.                            ____________________
