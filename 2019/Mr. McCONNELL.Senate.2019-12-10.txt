 Madam President, as we enter the final weeks of 2019,  two things seem to be true here in Congress. No. 1, our Democratic  colleagues, particularly over in the House, seem eager to pour the vast  majority of their time and energy into their 3-year-long journey to  impeach the President the American people elected. As a consequence,  No. 2, Congress has yet to fulfill a number of its core governing  responsibilities for this year.   At this late date, several crucial, must-pass bills remain undone.  For months, my fellow Republicans and I have been stressing the need  for productive, bipartisan cooperation on these pressing subjects:  funding for the Federal Government, Defense appropriations--the money  for our troops--and the National Defense Authorization Act. Yet, for  months, our calls for the Democrats to join us in serious negotiations  have gone largely unanswered as the Democratic leadership has opted for  a different political playbook--to obsess over impeachment and obstruct  this core business that we must do every year.   Earlier this year, the House Democrats pushed through what we believe  was their first purely party-line NDAA that either Chamber has ever  passed in the 58-year history of the legislation. This is the  legislation that puts forward Congress's priorities for equipping,  training, and maintaining the greatest fighting forces in the world. It  has never been used before as a purely partisan weapon--that is, not  until this year. Reassuringly, the past few days have finally brought  an end to bipartisan talks and produced a compromise NDAA. The end  result should be able to pass both Chambers and earn the President's  signature. Believe me, it will not come a moment too soon.   The NDAA authorizes resources to keep crucial military  installations--like Fort Campbell, Fort Knox, and the Blue Grass Army  Depot in Kentucky--running smoothly. It is similarly important to  facilities in many of our colleagues' home States as well. Nationally,  of course, it directs readiness efforts, prioritizes research and  development programs, and enacts vital reforms at the Pentagon.   I look forward to sending the final, bipartisan product by the  conference committee to the President for his signature soon. In  addition to that authorizing legislation, Congress, of course, needs to  actually appropriate funds for our national defense and for all other  functions of our Federal Government.   Just a few months ago, when leaders on both sides put their names to  a bipartisan-bicameral roadmap for the appropriations process, it  looked as though we might keep partisan disputes out of this process  and finish up the appropriations with time to spare. Unfortunately, our  Democratic colleagues decided that picking fights with the White House  was a higher priority, and we spent the autumn being mired in disputes  over exactly the kinds of poison pills and Presidential authorities the  Speaker and the Democratic leader had previously promised  [[Page S6910]]  would be off limits. Yet, as we speak, Chairman Shelby and  appropriators in both Chambers are trying to bring months of near  stalemate to a close. Last month, a bipartisan-bicameral agreement was  reached on subcommittee allocations, and talks continue this week on  outstanding issues.   Thanks to the months of delay, we have a long way to go and a very  short time in which to do it. I hope that our Democratic colleagues can  finally stick to the terms of the budget agreement and keep partisan  policy fights out of this process. That is the only way both Chambers  will have a chance of being able to vote on funding bills before the  end of this year.   That brings us to the USMCA. For the better part of the past year,  President Trump's landmark agreement to update North American trade  policy has been languishing as Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrats  have indulged further and further in impeachment. There are 176,000 new  Americans jobs that have sat waiting on ice as the Speaker has offered  lukewarm assurances month after month that her caucus is hoping to be  ``on a path to yes.'' This week, at long last, it appears that the  House Democrats may finally be willing to take action for American  workers and job creators and let the House vote on the President's  deal. I was pleased to hear that U.S. negotiators, led by Robert  Lighthizer, were to head to Mexico today to finalize the details on  this important win for the American economy. I hope this forward  momentum continues.   So that is the state of play. There is a lot left to do for the  American families we represent if our Democratic colleagues will simply  allow it, and it will certainly take a great deal of cooperation and  consent right here in the Senate if we intend to consider and pass  these measures before the end of the year.   Obstruction and stalemate have brought us to the eleventh hour. I  hope that, now that we are here, both Chambers will be able to set  aside the Democrats' impeachment parade long enough to get the people's  business finally finished.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10  minutes.    Madam President, it is with great pride that I pay  tribute to a long-standing community institution in southwestern  Kentucky. The Kentucky New Era newspaper recently marked 150 years of  quality journalism and community engagement, and I would like to take a  moment today to review the paper's distinguished history and celebrate  its many achievements.   Prominent Kentucky newsman Chip Hutcheson, whom I am proud to call a  dear friend, spent years working for the New Era, and he summed up the  reason it has thrived for so long. Chip recalled a paper-wide culture  of writing ``columns that cemented readers' relationships to the writer  and the paper.'' I think it is that commitment to readers and to what  matters in their lives and community that has helped make the New Era  the oldest business in Hopkinsville, KY.   Since the paper was launched as a weekly publication in the winter of  1869, the New Era has certainly undergone some change to solidify its  relationship with readers. To meet a demand for local, State, and  national news, the New Era added a daily issue, and delivered the news  and commentary its subscribers wanted to read. Part of that frequent  change during the early years came in the form of different owners, but  in 1873, Hunter Wood took charge, and his family would steer the New  Era as majority owners for the following 130-plus years.   Under their direction, the paper covered a wide range of issues  affecting life in Christian County. From politics to agriculture, mixed  with lighter community-interest pieces and extensive coverage of high  school sports, the New Era has served as a important source of  information for its readers. Its staff  [[Page S6944]]  would attract several award-winning journalists, including my friend  Mary D. Ferguson, who held a high standard on its pages.   Adapting to changing markets, the New Era expanded its operations. To  serve the nearby U.S. Army installation, the paper's media group began  publishing the Fort Campbell Courier. Other respected local papers,  including the Princeton Times Leader, the Providence Journal  Enterprise, and Dawson Springs Progress, joined the New Era's  organization to further stretch the reach of its community journalism.  In whatever form subscribers want to receive their news--in print,  online, or even listening to a podcast--the New Era is committed to  reporting on the stories that must be told.   Just last year, the paper joined another well-respected Kentucky news  institution, the Paxton Media Group. With this partnership, the  Kentucky New Era has the ability to continue thriving into the future.  Through the years, I have enjoyed reading the paper and speaking with  its top-tier professionals, and I look forward to many more  accomplishments to come.   It is a privilege to congratulate the Kentucky New Era on its  celebration of 150 years of journalistic success, and I hope my Senate  colleagues will join me in saluting this community institution on its  anniversary. I would like to extend my best wishes to the reporters,  editors, and staff who have made the New Era a vital resource in west  Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
