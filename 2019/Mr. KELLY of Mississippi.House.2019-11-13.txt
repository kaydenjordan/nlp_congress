 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez  and Ranking Member Chabot for working to bring the VA-SBA Act to the  House floor. I also thank my friend and cosponsor from Colorado (Mr.  Crow) for working on this very important legislation. I thank all of  them for being champions of both our veterans and our small businesses  all across America.   As we have heard in the hearings held in the Committee on Small  Business, the VA proactively verifies service-disabled veteran-owned  small businesses while the SBA allows business owners to self-certify.  This process creates inconsistent outcomes, such as a business  qualifying as a service-disabled veteran business for VA contracts but  not other Federal agency contracts.   While the SBA-certified businesses' awards are subject to scrutiny,  the lack of a front-end verification leaves the door open for fraud and  abuse.   We have already made significant strides in the right direction. The  National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017 instructed the  SBA and VA to unify the definitions for service-disabled veteran-owned  small businesses and began moving regulatory responsibility from the VA  to the SBA. Additionally, this administration has made substantial  improvements in streamlining certifications for small business Federal  procurement programs.   The VA-SBA Act marks the next significant step towards unification of  the two programs under one umbrella at the SBA and reduces red tape and  confusion for veteran small business owners.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill.
