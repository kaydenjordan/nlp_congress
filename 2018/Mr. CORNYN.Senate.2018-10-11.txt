 Mr. President, after the vote was called on the Kavanaugh  nomination--I should say immediately before it--the minority leader,  the Senator from New York, told America that the most important thing  they could do in response to that vote is go to the polls in the  midterm elections. It is true that on November 6, Americans will head  to the polls and select their Members of Congress, including the  Senate, and as Ronald Reagan's famous speech said, it will be ``a time  for choosing.''   Many people are wondering how they should choose, how they should  exercise that most fundamental privilege of American citizenship, and  that is the right to vote. Should they choose to vote for mob rule or  do they choose to vote for the rule of law? Do they choose to endorse  threats, intimidation, and incitement or do they choose to treat  everybody--no matter how much you disagree with them--with dignity and  respect? I believe those are our choices.   I was very disappointed to hear the former Secretary of State Mrs.  Clinton say that you cannot be civil with a political party that wants  to destroy what you stand for and what you care about. She said  civility is only possible if Democrats were to win back the House or  the Senate. In other words, her commitment to civility in our political  discourse is contingent upon political outcomes. Did you notice the  verb she used? She used the word ``destroy,'' which I think is telling.   It is not that people may disagree with her or her party, it is that  people who disagree with her want to destroy what you stand for and  what you care about. In other words, this mindset, I think, is very  disturbing and should be of concern to all of us who want to restore  some civility, and decorum, and bipartisan cooperation.   We are going to have our differences, there is no doubt about it. I  welcome the opportunity to debate those differences. That is what the  Senate is all about, but there is a line we saw crossed last week  during the confirmation hearing. We learned it is our Democratic  colleagues, unfortunately, who have associated themselves with special  interest groups that are willing to go to just about any length to  achieve their desired ends. In other words, the ends justify the means.  That includes climbing statues, disobeying Capitol Police, getting  arrested, chasing Senators and their spouses from restaurants,  screaming at Members in elevators, sending coat hangers to Senators at  their offices, and offering what amounts to a bribe. That doesn't sound  very civil to me.  [[Page S6785]]    Then you have former Attorney General Eric Holder, who was captured  on video saying things that I, frankly, am shocked about. You would  think the former head law enforcement officer for the U.S. Government,  the Attorney General, would understand the need to be careful with your  words and not stoke the ambers of conflict and civil unrest, but  apparently disregarding that, he intentionally poured gasoline on the  fire. He said last week, it is time to ditch the old slogan ``when they  go low, we go high.''   He attributed that to Michelle Obama, and good for her.   He said instead: ``When they go low, we kick them.''   That is what the new Democratic Party is all about. The Washington  Post has said Holder is proposing ``the party pursue a meaner, more  combative approach,'' and noted he was alluding to metaphorical  violence. This is from the former Attorney General of the United  States.   I believe former First Lady Michelle Obama rightfully condemned this  ugly and shameful statement.   Meanwhile, one Democratic Member of the Senate has recommended  activists get up in the face of your Congresspeople. Another one has  justified mob rule as entirely appropriate to our current political  situation.   We had members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the  Kavanaugh hearings, say: I am violating the rules intentionally. I am  releasing committee-confidential information in violation of the rules,  and, apparently, they were proud of it.   I hope the voters are listening. I think they are. They are coming  from some of the most powerful voices of the Democratic Party, voices  that could represent you in the next Congress. That is the choice-- between incitement, intimidation, mob rule, or civility and treating  people you disagree with, with the respect all of us are entitled to in  a democracy.   I don't think the voters will reward a party that is spitting out  this sort of venom about what our politics should be about: sowing  division, alluding to violence, rejecting civility. Is that what  supposedly passes for leadership? Should the voters reward that in this  midterm election? I think our forefathers would be shocked, but this  election is about more than just the rhetoric.   I think the voters also have a choice when it comes to looking at who  is interested in solving the problems that confront our country, who is  willing to work on a bipartisan basis together with the administration  to make the country a better place, more prosperous place, a safer  place. All they need to do is look back at the last 22 months.   Yesterday, for example, we passed a major water infrastructure bill  that will keep our communities safe by maintaining dams and levees and  addressing drinking water and wastewater systems across the country. It  will also expedite, in my part of the world, an important coastal study  and authorize flood mitigation projects back home.   Then the President signed, just 2 days before that--I am sure most of  this was lost in the furor over the Kavanaugh nomination--but just 2  days before that, the President signed another bipartisan bill I  cosponsored called the Justice Served Act that will provide funds to  prosecute cold cases solved by DNA evidence obtained from rape kits.   Then, of course, there was the Supreme Court confirmation last  Saturday.   In the last 6 days, we have accomplished three major things: water  infrastructure, funding cold case prosecutions, and filling Justice  Kennedy's seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I would say that is a pretty good week, but our record of success is  much lengthier than that. Judge Kavanaugh was far from the only Federal  judge we have confirmed. Last year, we confirmed another superb  Justice, Neil Gorsuch. On top of that, we have confirmed 69 judges  under President Trump. That includes three Texas judges on the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals and four that preside over Texas district  courts.   Those numbers begin to show you that since President Trump took  office in January of last year, we haven't taken our foot off the gas  when it comes to doing the people's work. Under this Congress, we have  confirmed the most appellate judges ever during a President's first 2  years. Of course, these nominees, once confirmed, have a lifetime  tenure, so they will be there long beyond this President's term or  maybe our term in the Congress.   Our work extends far beyond filling the courthouses of this country.  What we have done, working together with the entrepreneurs and the  investors and the small businesses of America, is we helped reenergize  the state of the American economy.   This started with tax reform, which has been the biggest game  changer. This is the first major overhaul of the Tax Code in 31 years.  It lowered rates, doubled the child tax credit to help working  families, and made American businesses more internationally  competitive. I am sorry we had to do that all by ourselves without a  single Democratic vote, but we thought it was so important to do that  we stepped up, and we did it. I think the benefits are pretty manifest.   Ms. Pelosi likes to say the savings individual taxpayers got were  merely ``crumbs,'' but I would like to tell her about some of my  constituents and what they told me.   One of them, Kim Ewing from Mesquite, wrote me and talked about how  tax reform was hugely helpful because she hadn't had a raise in 7  years. Now she enjoys a boost in her paycheck each month. She called  tax reform a no-brainer or what she referred to as merely ``common  sense.''    Then there is Claudia Smith, owner of the Aggieland Carpet One in  College Station, who told me earlier this year that she has been able  to reinvest the savings she received under the new tax law to buy new  equipment for her small business, as well as provide healthcare  coverage for her employees. She says she will also have enough left  over to hire more people.   Claudia's story is the same one that is being told all across the  country. More than 700 businesses have used the tax savings to benefit  their employees and customers. They have announced pay raises, 401(k)  match increases, cuts to utility rates, bonuses, and other benefits to  American workers.   These developments are just part of the reason this economy is  growing again and why people have renewed confidence and optimism in  their future.   As the majority leader reported yesterday, unemployment in this  country has now fallen to 3.7 percent, which is the lowest rate since  1969. People are going back to work; they are earning more; they are  keeping more of what they earn; and they are investing. This is what it  looks like when that sleeping giant of the American economy wakes up  and is unleashed from the constraints of high taxation and  overregulation.   It is not just the economy that deserves mention. One of our  accomplishments has been repealing burdensome regulations--I have  mentioned that overregulation--and we have done that through the  Congressional Review Act.   Previously, it had only been used 1 time, but we have used this  device 16 times to eliminate Agency rules which really had been the  ropes that tied down that sleeping giant of the American economy. It  allowed it to come roaring back.   We have repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board under  ObamaCare, which will allow seniors and their families to take greater  control of their healthcare decisions without being subject to the  whims of unelected bureaucrats. We have also eliminated the root of  ObamaCare--the individual mandate. This was literally a coercion by the  Federal Government, forcing people to buy something that, in many  cases, they couldn't afford, and they didn't want.   We literally made ObamaCare voluntary now so people have choices, but  this was essentially a tax on some of the most disadvantaged people in  the country who were coerced into buying healthcare they didn't want or  couldn't afford, and if they were unable to even do that, they were  forced to pay a tax or a penalty.   Recently, we have been accomplishing a lot more for our men and women  in uniform, our intelligence officers, and our veterans. We have helped  restore America's defense with  [[Page S6786]]  the greatest investment in the military in decades, including the  largest troop pay raise in nearly 10 years.   We have reauthorized important intelligence-gathering tools, like  section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--a vital tool  in tracking foreign terrorists abroad who try to hurt us at home.   For our veterans, we passed the VA MISSION Act, which will make  significant reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs by  strengthening healthcare and community care options that are available  to those who have served our Nation in uniform.   Last, but not least, is our series of accomplishments. We have taken  other important steps, like passing the Federal Aviation Administration  Reauthorization Act just last week. It is legislation that modernizes  our airports, improves service for travelers, enhances safety, and  boosts industry innovation.   Then, almost without anybody paying any attention at all, we passed a  huge bipartisan bill to address the opioid crisis. Senator Alexander,  the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee,  ushered this bill through the House and the Senate, along with Senator  Murphy and others. It has contributions from 70 Members of the Senate  and 5 standing committees. That takes a lot of hard bipartisan effort,  but it is important because it combats the nationwide epidemic that has  led to the death of 49,000 Americans in just 2017 alone.   We have done important work in terms of improving public safety by  enacting a bill I sponsored and that was supported by our colleagues  here called Fix NICS; that is, the National Instant Criminal Background  Check System. We also passed a bill sponsored by Senator Hatch called  the STOP School Violence Act.   The Fix NICS bill helped fix our broken background check system and  ensures that criminals aren't able to purchase or possess firearms  after they are convicted.   In the wake of the Texas shootings at Santa Fe and Sutherland  Springs, we know there were a lot of people crying out for Congress to  do something, and this was the one thing we could all agree to, on a  bipartisan basis, across the ideological spectrum. These two bills-- mine and Senator Hatch's--are a part of the way we have answered that  call.   We have tried to protect our young people--especially women--in  another important way as well. We enacted what is known as SESTA, the  Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. This legislation by the junior  Senator from Ohio helps to stop online trafficking and adds to a bill I  sponsored called the Abolish Human Trafficking Act. It strengthens  programs and supports survivors of human trafficking and provides  resources to law enforcement officials on the frontlines of the fight  against modern-day slavery.   I understand why most Americans have not heard of all or many of  these accomplishments, but I think it is important to note what we have  been able to do while we have fought mightily over some things, like  judicial nominations.   We have also worked in a bipartisan way to get the people's work  done. I believe we have done so mainly by treating each other  respectfully and by demonstrating civility, not by yelling at each  other, by making threats, or inciting people to violence. That is not  the American way.   I am hopeful that after the scenes we saw here last week during the  confirmation proceedings for the Supreme Court, that the American  people will reject that sort of conduct and demand that their elected  officials act in a way they can be proud of.   Yes, we put money back into America's pockets. We have rolled back  regulations to make their lives a little bit easier. We have  strengthened our military, given our veterans access to better  healthcare, and protected our communities from harm.   As the minority leader, the Senator from New York, said right before  the confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh, the people need to vote. They  will, I hope, exercise that franchise--that right of every American  citizen to determine the direction of our country and who will  represent them in the Halls of Congress.   It is my sincere hope that they will remember some of these  accomplishments we have made together during this administration and  know we can continue to do more for them in the future.
