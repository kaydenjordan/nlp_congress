 Madam Speaker, as a person of color who has  seen in my own life the dehumanizing effect of stop-and-frisk policing  in New York City, I know firsthand that the Achilles' heel of American  policing is the absence of accountability.   We, as a country, have a choice. We can either choose police  accountability or choose qualified immunity, but we cannot choose both.   The purpose of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is not to  second-guess officers who act in good faith. The objective is to hold  liable officers who repeatedly abuse their power and who rarely, if  ever, face consequences for their repeat abuses.   If you are a good officer, you have nothing to fear. But if you are a  bad officer, you have accountability to fear, and fear accountability,  you should.
