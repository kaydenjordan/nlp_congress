 Madam Speaker, over 34 million people in the  United States have diabetes.   Nearly a quarter require insulin to stay alive, but the cost of  insulin is bankrupting American families, and that must change.   According to research conducted by RAND, Americans pay an average of  $99 for a unit of insulin while Canadians spend just $12.   This study looked at insulin prices in 32 other countries. It found  that the cost of insulin was always higher, often 5 and 10 times more  expensive for people living in the United States versus that of people  living in other countries.   That is why I rise today in support of legislation that would cap the  maximum cost of insulin at $35 a month.   Insulin is necessary and lifesaving. It shouldn't be costing families  their life savings.  [[Page H3983]]                                ____________________
