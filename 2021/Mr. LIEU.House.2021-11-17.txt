 Madam Speaker, I am upset about inflation. As our economy  reopens and demand surges, big corporations have taken advantage. They  have squeezed consumers for profit and raised costs on everyday  Americans.   Corporate greed is a primary reason why costs for American businesses  and families have gone up. I will give you one example.   The cost of refining oil has gone down, yet gas prices went up. Let  me repeat that again. The costs to oil companies have gone down, and  fuel prices went up.   That is why I am joining President Biden in calling on the Federal  Trade Commission to investigate whether oil and gas companies are  engaging in anticompetitive or potentially illegal behavior to jack up  your gas prices.                            ____________________
