 Madam Speaker, I was absent from the House Chamber on  September 27, 2019, due to a dire illness in my immediate family. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yes'' on rollcall No. 553; ``yes''  on rollcall No. 554; and ``yes'' on rollcall No. 555.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
