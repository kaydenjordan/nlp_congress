 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana.   Mr. Speaker, this evening I am here with my colleagues in opposition  to H.R. 3755, a bill that House Democrats are pushing this week that  would eliminate protections for unborn babies and establish a  nationwide system of abortion on demand.   If enacted, this bill would overrule all Federal and State laws that  recognize the sanctity of life. Under this proposal, an abortion could  be performed for any reason at any time up until the baby is born.   Contrary to what some have claimed, this bill is not healthcare. It  is the exact opposite of healthcare, and it prioritizes the profits of  the abortion industry above the sanctity of life.   Washington Democrats' pro-abortion agenda is appalling, and you can  count on me to always fight for life and shield taxpayer dollars from  ever being used for abortions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand for life and support  unborn babies and vote ``no'' on this bill.
