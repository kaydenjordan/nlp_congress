 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service of the  adjutant general of the Wyoming National Guard, MG Luke Reiner, to the  State of Wyoming and our Nation.   In 1982, Major General Reiner enlisted in the Army National Guard. As  a born leader, Luke was commissioned as an officer in 1986 and  subsequently joined the Wyoming Army National Guard in 1987. Coming to  Wyoming was the best decision of his career.   Major General Reiner wore many hats and served at every level of the  Wyoming Army National Guard. From his first job as the counter fire  officer of the 115th Field Artillery Brigade to the executive officer  of the 2-300 Field Artillery Battalion, he rose to take command of the  115th Fires Brigade. Luke's operational experience included a  deployment to Kuwait where he commanded Camp New York in support of  Operation Iraqi Freedom.   Governor Matt Mead appointed Luke Reiner as adjutant general, and he  took command on April 1, 2011. Luke and I got to know each other very  well over years as we worked together to secure funding to modernize  the C-130H fleet. Major General Reiner was the Wyoming Guard's advocate  in Washington at the National Guard Bureau and the Pentagon. He  frequently traveled back to Washington and served on various National  Guard committees and counsels.   Every Thanksgiving, I travel overseas to visit with Wyoming  servicemen and women deployed around the world. Governor Mead, Major  General Reiner, and I spent Thanksgiving with the 133rd Engineering  Company stationed in Bahrain in 2013. It was an honor to eat  Thanksgiving dinner with these young men and women alongside Major  General Reiner.   On March 28, 2019, Luke will officially retire as Wyoming's adjutant  general and hand the colors over to BG Gregory Porter. Major General  Reiner will remain in Wyoming. I look forward to continue working  closely with him in his role as director of the Wyoming Department of  Transportation.   Luke epitomizes the ``Code of the West.'' Live each day with courage.  Take pride in your work. Do what needs to be done. We thank him for all  he has done to keep Wyoming and our Nation safe.   Finally, I want to thank Luke's wife Devonna and his two daughters  Heather and Holly for allowing Luke to serve Wyoming and this great  Nation. We are forever thankful.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize the distinguished  career of Pat Tyrrell. After more than 18 years of service, Pat is  retiring as Wyoming's longest serving State engineer.   A Wyoming native, Pat grew up in Cheyenne. He attended the University  of Wyoming in Laramie where he obtained a B.S. in mechanical  engineering and an M.S. in civil engineering. He began his time in  public service in 2001 when Governor Jim Geringer appointed Pat as  Wyoming's State Engineer. During his tenure, he served under four  Governors and became well known in the State, region, and Nation as an  expert on all matters related to water resources.   Established under Wyoming's Constitution, the State engineer serves  as the chief water official in Wyoming. With Wyoming situated astride  the Continental Divide, the State provides the headwaters for four  major river basins in the Western United States.   Charged with the regulation and administration of the water resources  in Wyoming, Pat's duties as State engineer ranged from overseeing the  permitting and adjudication of water rights, regulation of the use of  water under the doctrine of prior appropriation, and representing the  State on numerous boards, compacts, and commissions. These included  Wyoming's commissioner to the Upper Colorado River Commission, the  North Platte Decree Committee, Western States Water Council, and the  Colorado River Salinity Control Forum. He often served in leadership  roles and worked in cooperation with the other 17 Western States to  manage and develop water resources.   Pat is known for his balanced approach to water resource management,  ensuring compliance with the law while also protecting the interests of  Wyoming water users. His expertise and influence were instrumental in  resolving decades-long problems, such as the Big Horn General  Adjudication.   As State engineer, he waded through thousands of water rights in the  Big Horn Basin to bring clarity and certainty to Federal, Tribal, and  State interests in the area and ultimately saw the end to a 37-year  lawsuit. Pat's reflection on this case was emblematic of his philosophy  to water management: ``If we can move water without any ill effect to  existing users, we can make changes. But we need everybody at the  table.''   Shortly after I joined the U.S. Senate, I experienced this philosophy  firsthand. It was during a critical point in passing the Craig Thomas  Snake Headwaters Legacy Act that Pat met in my office with key players  who were negotiating the final language of the bill. With his calm  demeanor and extraordinary understanding of Western water law, he was  able to provide clarity to the meaning of certain text in the bill and  assuage all in the room of the practicality of what the text said and  what was contemplated. Shortly thereafter, agreement was reached, and  the bill was signed into law. It became clear to me that one of Pat's  greatest skills is he builds trust through his knowledge of the law and  how it is applied and is able to accurately articulate how that  application will or will not impact people's lives.   Pat has used this philosophy in interstate water negotiations. Known  as the senior statesman on the river, Pat has been instrumental in many  of the key decisions related to management of the Colorado River. Time  after time, Pat has sought cooperation and coordination to balance the  various needs and demands on the river. From hydropower production and  ecosystem protection, to water storage and water delivery obligations,  Pat has been instrumental in crafting creative solutions to ensure all  needs are met.   In the face of nearly two decades of drought in the Colorado River  basin, his expertise has been invaluable. He was instrumental in  implementing the river's 2007 Guidelines and has been intimately  engaged in development of the current Colorado River Drought  Contingency Plan, which is currently being debated in Congress. As  Wyoming's representative on the river, Pat focused on ensuring the  needs met by the Colorado River today will be maintained for future  generations.   In the same way Pat has looked out for Wyoming's future water needs,  he has also sought to care for the development of Wyoming's future  leaders. Late last year, he and his wife Barbara established a  scholarship fund at the University of Wyoming to provide future  students an education in engineering. Expertise and education in water  management in States like Wyoming is invaluable, and we can only hope  for more leaders like Pat.   Pat's service has reached every corner of the State. The history  books will note his involvement in the 2001 Modified North Platte  Decree, the Yellowstone River compact, which involved an 11-year  Supreme Court lawsuit with the State of Montana, and many other  [[Page S1933]]  accomplishments, but those who worked with him will remember and  hopefully carry on his gentle nature, deliberate thinking, and  dedication to the law.   I invite all members of the Senate to join me in congratulating Pat  in his retirement, wishing him well and his family much success in the  future.                            ____________________
