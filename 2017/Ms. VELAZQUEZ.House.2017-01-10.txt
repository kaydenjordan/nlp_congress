 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   When we think of a startup business, the early days of Apple or  Google usually come to mind. Their stories are familiar--hardworking  entrepreneurs who beat the odds. Like these companies, most successful  startups have several common ingredients: a new product or service, a  willingness to take risks, and leadership that can navigate the  complexities of today's economy. And successful firms also have a way  of securing capital to both get off the ground and to grow.   This last ingredient can present serious obstacles as startups face  unique financing challenges. Many do not have positive cash flow,  putting traditional bank loans out of reach. While some of these firms  participate in incubator or accelerator programs that provide a small  amount of seed capital, they must find new sources of funding when  their initial capital runs out.   One avenue for securing additional capital is by participating in  demo days or pitch days. At these events, entrepreneurs have an  opportunity to showcase their companies and innovations to potential  investors.   Today's bill will alter SEC rules to exempt the use of general  solicitation for presentations made at demo days. In other words, demo  day organizers will not have to comply with the usual procedures  verifying that the investors they are attracting to the event are  accredited.   Despite the well-intended goal of expanding the use of demo days to  better meet startups' capital needs, it is easy to see how unscrupulous  actors could exploit this exemption to deceive ordinary people that  were drawn to the event by a public advertisement. My amendment makes  improvements to ensure attendees at demo days have an opportunity to be  informed about the nature of these presentations and the risks of  investing in startups.                                time  1500    Typically, demo days are limited to select groups of potential  investors. Let's be clear, these are not science fairs, but they are  sophisticated business presentations designed to raise capital for the  entrepreneurs and their startups.   However, the underlying bill allows colleges and universities and  nonprofits to host these events and advertise them to the public. It is  easy to see how some attendees might not know the true nature of the  presentation.   My amendment will address this by requiring event sponsors to provide  an SEC-created disclosure outlining the nature of the event and  investment risks. By creating a uniform disclosure, the SEC can take  the burden off the sponsors and issuers on what to disclose.   This amendment would also clarify that attendance at a demo day alone  does not constitute a preexisting relationship and does not allow a  stock issuer to sidestep their obligation to verify that an investor is  accredited. Without this clarification, it is possible that issuers  could defraud less-sophisticated retail investors.  [[Page H265]]    Demo days are a great way for our Nation's entrepreneurs to raise  capital, but they should be making presentations to the right  investors, those that understand the risks of investing in risky  startup businesses, not just anyone who saw an advertisement.   My amendment would both expand the ability of small businesses to  raise capital by tapping into demo days while ensuring that the right  kind of investors, those accredited and fully informed, are  participating in the small business capital markets.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how many other  speakers the gentleman has?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First of all, I am the author of the amendment, and in the amendment,  there is no place in which it requires anyone to sign anything. This is  a reasonable, straightforward, simple amendment that provides  transparency and protection to the investors.   The gentleman says that this is not an offering. While some  presentations may not explicitly be offering securities for sale, these  demo days are not a simple science fair. They are sophisticated  business presentations designed to generate hype and investor interest.   If a sponsor wants to advertise such events to the public, it is  reasonable that they also provide information regarding the risk of  investing in startups.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
