 Mr. President, I would like to just begin by acknowledging  and thanking Pastor Bob Thune for his opening prayer this morning.   It should come as no surprise, based on the last name, we are  related. He is my nephew. I have been blessed through the years with a  rich, spiritual heritage, as has he. His father, my big brother, was  the spiritual trailblazer in our family. He went on to pastor churches  in the Midwest, on the West Coast for about 50 years. His son Bob, my  nephew, is carrying on that great tradition.   Bob pastors a church, as was noted, called Coram Deo Church in Omaha,  NE. Coram Deo is Latin for ``the presence of God.'' Bob, on a weekly  basis, proclaims the truth of the gospel from the pulpit. But on a  daily basis, he and his congregation have, at the center of their daily  lives, the presence of God as they seek to have an impact on their  community and their region and on this world.   Bob is, in many respects, as it says in the Book of Acts, fulfilling  God's purpose for his generation. I am grateful for the spiritual  heritage that we share, for the way that he continues that today. I  want to encourage him in his work and just acknowledge how grateful we  are that he was able to join us here in the U.S. Senate and offer that  opening prayer which, on a daily basis, is offered by our Chaplain,  Barry Black, who has been a great inspiration to me on so many levels  and leads us in a weekly Bible study here on Capitol Hill for Senators.   I always try and do an advertisement to get more Senators to come to  that Bible study. It is a rich time where we can have an opportunity to  reflect on the important work that we do and the way that our faith  applies to it on a daily basis.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week's Judiciary Committee hearing  gave Senators the opportunity to hear directly from President Biden's  nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, to help them  decide whether she is an appropriate candidate for the Nation's highest  Court.   My approach to deciding whether or not to vote for a Supreme Court  nominee or any judicial nominee is pretty simple. I look at the  character and qualifications, and most of all, I look at the question  of whether the nominee understands the limited role of the judiciary  and the separation of powers.   Our Federal Government, of course, has three distinct branches: the  legislative branch, which makes the laws; the executive branch--the  President and executive Departments--which executes the laws; and the  judiciary,  [[Page S1814]]  which interprets the laws. Pretty simple, right? Civics 101. Too often,  however, our colleagues on the left look to the judiciary to usurp the  role of the legislative branch. They look for activist judges who will  not just interpret the law but who will go beyond the law to deliver  the policy outcomes that liberals are interested in, whether that is an  aggressive abortion agenda, restraint of the free exercise of religion,  or liberals' preferred approach to immigration.   President Biden, for example, specifically noted that he would only  appoint judges who could be relied on to rule in favor of Roe v. Wade  and a right to abortion. Well, that is a big problem because delivering  specific political outcomes is not the job of the judicial branch. In  our system of government, policy decisions are vested in the  legislative branch and are made there by the people's democratically  elected representatives. Judges have discretion in applying the laws,  but their discretion is to be guided by the plain text of the law and  by the intention of the people's representatives in drafting the  statute. Otherwise, we end up not with government of the people but  with government by an unelected, unaccountable group of judges.   President Biden has unfortunately placed himself squarely in the camp  of those who would like to see the judiciary take an active role in  making policy. ``The people that I would appoint to the Court,''  President Biden said during his campaign for President, ``are people  who have a view of the Constitution as a living document, not as a  staid document.''   Well, let me just talk about that for a minute. What is a  Constitution if not a staid document? If there is no fixed meaning to  the Constitution, if it can be stretched and adjusted and expanded by  judges at their discretion, then why have a Constitution? The whole  point of the Constitution--of written law in general, I would argue--is  that it is fixed, ``staid,'' to quote the President. The rule of law,  equal justice under the law--these concepts rely on the idea that the  law has a fixed meaning, that there is one law that applies equally to  everyone.   If the Constitution does not have a fixed meaning, it cannot be the  supreme law of the land. It cannot be a guide to which we can all  appeal. A living Constitution is a meaningless one. Of course that  doesn't mean that the Constitution will always stay exactly the same.  There is a process, as we all know, for amending the Constitution so  that needed changes can be made. But these changes have to be made  through the amendment process, with the concurrence of three-fourths of  the States.   That is not what the President is talking about. When the President  talks about a living Constitution, he is not talking about periodically  amending the Constitution via the process laid out within the  Constitution itself; what he is talking about is nominating judges who  will take it upon themselves to amend the Constitution through their  rulings by finding new rights and authorities as needed to advance a  particular political agenda. That is deeply concerning, particularly  when we are talking about a lifetime appointment to the highest Court  in the land.   Unfortunately, after watching last week's Judiciary Committee hearing  and examining Judge Jackson's record, I am concerned that her  jurisprudence reflects President Biden's belief in an activist  judiciary.   As has become clear, Judge Jackson has a strong point of view when it  comes to sentencing guidelines in certain cases. That is not in and of  itself a problem, of course. Judges can and do have strong opinions  about any number of issues that come up in the law. What is a problem  is it seems that Judge Jackson has allowed her personal opinions to  shape her judicial decisions.   For example, as a Federal trial judge, she repeatedly chose to reject  sentencing guidelines and the recommendations of prosecutors in favor  of lenient sentences for those who possess and distribute child  pornography. It appears that she had a record of advocating for  leniency with respect to these types of crimes during her time at the  U.S. Sentencing Commission and that she then applied those opinions to  her sentencing practices when she became a Federal judge.   For this reason and more, I am deeply concerned that her record  suggests that she would allow her personal opinions on issues like  sentencing to shape her decisions on the Supreme Court. A Supreme Court  Justice's allegiance must be to the plain words of the law and the  Constitution, not to any personal political opinion, and I am not  convinced that Judge Jackson meets that standard.   My concern has only been heightened by Judge Jackson's inability or  refusal to define her judicial philosophy. It should not be difficult  for a nominee to the Supreme Court to lay out her theory of  constitutional interpretation. Given how often her strong personal  opinions have appeared to influence her decisions as a judge and absent  a clearly expressed judicial philosophy that rejects personal opinion  in favor of the plain meaning of the law and the Constitution, I am  concerned that her judicial approach would follow the ``living  Constitution'' model that President Biden embraces.   Finally, I was deeply concerned by Judge Jackson's refusal to reject  Court packing. Court packing, of course, is a long-discredited idea  that has been revived by members of the far left and increasingly  embraced by the Democratic Party. The idea behind it is simple. If the  Supreme Court isn't delivering the decisions you want, expand the  number of Justices until you can be pretty sure you will get your  preferred outcomes.   The problems with this approach are obvious, starting with the  question, where does it end? It is easy to envision a Democrat-led  Congress packing the Court with additional Democrat-selected Justices  and then a Republican-led Congress coming in and matching those new  Justices with additional Republican-appointed Justices and on and on  and on. Pretty soon, the size of the Supreme Court would be approaching  the size of the U.S. Senate. I can think of no approach more guaranteed  to bring about a complete delegitimization of the Supreme Court.   Do Democrats seriously think that there is any--any--American who  would regard the Supreme Court as a nonpartisan institution after it  had been packed full of Democrat Justices or, if it were Republicans  who were advancing this Court-packing plan, with Republican Justices?  Court packing would instantly turn the Supreme Court into nothing more  than a partisan extension of the legislative branch, which is why it is  so concerning that Judge Jackson has repeatedly--repeatedly--declined  to oppose it.   Both Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer spoke out against Court  packing during their time on the Supreme Court, so this is a subject on  which Judge Jackson can and should have felt free to speak. That she  did not do so only underscored my concern that she is too open to  allowing politics to shape the judiciary.   I enjoyed meeting with Judge Jackson, and I respect her achievements,  but I cannot in good conscience vote for a Supreme Court Justice whose  record indicates that she will allow her personal political opinions to  shape her judicial decisions.   The rule of law depends upon having Justices who decide cases based  on the plain meaning of the law and the Constitution, not on personal  beliefs or political considerations.   I can only vote to confirm a Justice who I believe will respect the  separation of powers and the limited role of a Justice and refuse to  allow her personal opinions to influence her decisions on the Bench.   For these reasons, I cannot support Judge Jackson's confirmation to  the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
