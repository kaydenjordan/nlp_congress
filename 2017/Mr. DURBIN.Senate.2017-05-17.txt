 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, more than 3 million Illinoisans--about 20  percent of the people in my State--currently depend on Medicaid and the  Children's Health Insurance Program for healthcare. That is one out of  five people in my State who need these programs to have basic health  insurance for themselves and their children.   This includes 300,000 Illinois seniors and people with disabilities,  650,000 who were recently added as part of the Affordable Care Act. It  also includes 1.5 million children. Half of all the kids in Illinois  are enrolled in Medicaid and the CHIP program, which in Illinois is  called ALL Kids.   Nationwide, the Medicaid Program helps pay for two out of three  seniors in their nursing homes. It pays for about half of all children  born in this country. It is the primary payer of all mental health and  opioid addiction treatment. It provides healthcare to 25 percent of  people in rural communities. It pays for special education in nearly  half of all school districts and provides critical support for veterans  with chronic conditions.   What does the House of Representatives Affordable Care Act repeal do  to the programs I have just described? It ends the expansion of  Medicaid. It would eliminate coverage for 650,000 people in the State  of Illinois. Think about that. We had seven of our Republican  Congressmen vote for a program that will eliminate health insurance  under Medicaid for 650,000 people in my State and cut $840 billion in  Federal Medicaid funding. Well, if they are going to cut this money for  Medicaid funding, what are they going to do with it? The House knew  exactly what to do with it: They give it back in tax breaks to the  wealthiest people in America. Is there justice in that decision? Is it  too much to ask that those of us who are better off in life pay a  little more in taxes so that those who are struggling have basic  healthcare? I don't think so, but those who voted for the Republican  House plan do. The bill cuts healthcare for struggling families, women,  seniors, and children in order to give a tax break to the wealthiest  people in America.   Illinois would lose $40 billion over the next decade, and 3 million  people would be at risk of losing their care. Absolutely no one  believes Illinois is going to magically come up with $40 billion to  fill this Medicaid shortfall. I doubt many other States will be able to  either. With funding cuts this dramatic, even Illinois's Republican  Governor spoke out against the House action repealing the Affordable  Care Act. He said it is going to force us to make significant changes  in healthcare in Illinois. He would have to decide who gets healthcare  and who doesn't. He would have to decide whether healthcare services  are just too expensive to cover.   Hospitals, too, would be devastated by the proposed Medicaid cuts. I  was born and raised in downstate Illinois. It doesn't look at all like  the city of Chicago. I am proud to represent that city. I enjoyed being  there and being a part of it. I grew up in smalltown America, and the  congressional district I represented basically was smaller cities--no  more than 100,000 population at the time--with a lot of smaller towns.  I can't tell you the pride those communities take in downstate Illinois  in their hospitals. Some of those hospitals are a lifeline--the only  source of healthcare for miles around. They are great employers. They  bring in medical specialists who are paid good salaries by local  standards.   The Illinois Hospital Association is dead-set against what the House  Republicans did in passing their repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  They have told us that Illinois stands to lose up to 60,000 healthcare  jobs because of that vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. Of  course, that means that for many of the people who count on these rural  hospitals, even inner city hospitals in Chicago, those services are  going to be curtailed and denied.   When I sit down with people like Ed Curtis, who is the president of  Memorial Medical Center in Springfield and speaks for Illinois hospital  administrators across the State--he tells me the devastating impact it  will have when Medicaid coverage is eliminated and sick people still  show up for care. They will be taken care of; their expenses will be  shifted to other people. That is the way it used to be before the  Affordable Care Act, before Medicaid expanded and gave these  individuals in low-income situations basic health insurance.   Why would Republicans in the House of Representatives want to have  such a devastating negative impact on Medicaid? So they can give tax  cuts to wealthy people? That, to me, is inexplicable.   The Illinois Hospital Association speaks across our State for those  who really care about those great institutions, but they are not alone  in opposing this bill. The Illinois Nurses Association opposes it, as  do the Illinois pediatricians and the Illinois Medical Society. Why  does every medical advocacy group in Illinois oppose this bill, this  so-called Republican reform of our healthcare system? Because they know  it moves in the wrong direction. It eliminates healthcare coverage  instead of expanding it. It makes healthcare too expensive and out of  reach for people who are not lucky enough to have it at work and not  wealthy enough to buy it on their own. It moves in the wrong direction.  It is not a solution to any problem; it is a new and even worse problem  than the ones we faced in the past.   Remember when Candidate Donald Trump tweeted in May of 2015: ``I was  the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there would be no  cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid''? Then he tweeted in  July of 2015--``The Republicans who want to cut Social Security and  Medicaid are wrong,'' said Candidate Trump. He was right, but now he  supports this bill which dramatically cuts Medicaid coverage across  America.  [[Page S2976]]    What is going to happen to the elderly in nursing homes who, despite  all their Social Security payments and despite all of their Medicaid  reimbursement, still don't have enough resources for the basic care  they need to stay alive? When they cut back on that Medicaid coverage,  what happens to them? What do their families do to make up the  difference? Reach into their savings? Bring mom home from the nursing  home in the hopes that they can take care of her in their own home?  Those are choices no family should face and no family need face.   I hope the Senate will show the courage and leadership on a  bipartisan basis to say no to this terrible bill that passed the U.S.  House of Representatives just 2 weeks ago. We need to put together a  bill that expands the coverage of health insurance, gives people more  peace of mind; a bill that addresses some of the built-in challenges we  had with the Affordable Care Act, which is far from perfect. There are  things we can do to improve it.   We need to do something about the cost of pharmaceutical drugs. The  current law doesn't really affect that. They are out of control at this  point.   Secondly, I think we ought to offer a public option. There ought to  be a Medicare-type program available across the United States for those  who wish it. Medicare enjoys a very positive reputation in America for  good reason. Most Americans would feel honored and happy to be  protected by a Medicare-type program.   We also need to go to those premiums that are too high and ask why.  In many cases, there are individuals who are buying health insurance  from very narrow pools of people who are older and sicker. We need to  expand that pool so it is real insurance, and we can bring those  premiums down. There are ways to do that.   There are many things we can do with reforming the Affordable Care  Act, but what the House of Representatives did, what some want to do,  is just repeal it and walk away. It would be devastating to the women  in America who rely on Medicaid to pay for their delivery expenses, as  well as prenatal and postnatal care. It would be devastating to seniors  who are in nursing homes and are dependent on Medicaid supplements and  for those who are disabled with chronic conditions and have to turn to  Medicaid just to make sure they can maintain their lifestyle and still  be productive, happy, and safe. These are the elements and these are  the costs we would have to charge if we are not careful.   Wouldn't it be great, wouldn't it be terrific, wouldn't it be a  headliner to say that Democrats and Republicans came together in the  U.S. Senate to make the Affordable Care Act better, to make sure there  was more accessible, affordable, quality coverage for more Americans? I  think that is why we were elected, and I hope we can achieve that goal.   Mr. President, before I yield, I ask unanimous consent that the time  during quorum calls until 12 noon today be charged equally to both  sides.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1169         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
