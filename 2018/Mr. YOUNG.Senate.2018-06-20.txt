 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from  Delaware for his naval service and for his concern for veterans. It is  a pleasure to serve with him.                              Amendment No. 2926    Mr. President, as marines, we tend to make interservice jokes when we  are in the company of one another, but I know we share a common  dedication in making sure our veterans receive the sort of care and  support that, of course, they deserve. That is why I rise in support of  amendment No. 2926 to the MILCON-VA bill.   Suicide is one of the most serious problems that face our veterans  today. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, ``after  adjusting for differences in age and sex, risk for suicide was 22  percent higher among Veterans when compared to U.S. non-Veteran  adults.'' That figure is 19 percent higher among male veterans when  compared to U.S. non-veteran adult men and 2\1/2\ times higher among  female veterans.   Our veterans deserve the highest possible quality of care. Mental  health care services are a critical component of that effort and are  essential to preventing veteran suicides. Congress and the Department  of Veterans Affairs has a solemn duty to ensure that programs designed  to protect veterans' emotional and mental health are effective.   The Department of Veterans Affairs launched what is now known as the  [[Page S4272]]  Veterans Crisis Line in 2011. While we applaud the VA for administering  this program, we embrace the fundamental responsibility of Congress to  exercise robust oversight of the Veterans Crisis Line to ensure that  this program is actually effective and properly supporting at-risk  veterans. That is why I joined with Senator Donnelly and Congressman  Banks to introduce a bill to study the effectiveness of the Veterans  Crisis Line and the followup treatment these veterans receive.   Amendment No. 2926 is based on the core elements of the original S.  2174 Veterans Crisis Line Study Act. Studying the Veterans Crisis Line  is vital to ensure that it is successful in its mission to save as many  veterans as we can, and I ask my colleagues for their support.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
