 Mr. President, stories of the past and the  memorabilia and photos that often accompany them serve many important  purposes in our culture. They can entertain us and provoke laughter and  joy. They can reinforce the values that were important to our parents  and grandparents. And they can teach difficult or even painful lessons  from our history. The West Kentucky Veteran and Patriot Museum, now  celebrating its 10th year, is a place where such stories can be  discovered.   Founded by Sandy Hart, whose husband, Ray, served in the U.S. Marine  Corps and then went on to serve others as a pastor and foreign  missionary, the museum houses an eclectic collection of personal  objects, records, photographs, and narrative stories curated by Sandy  and displayed in a red brick building in tiny Wickliffe, KY, which is  located on the Mississippi River in far west Kentucky. While most of  the donated materials are from servicemembers and their families in the  Purchase Region of the Commonwealth, the visitors--the men and women  you are likely to encounter when you stop by--are from all 50 States  and beyond. Sandy loves to sit and talk to them and hear their stories,  memories that are often stirred up as they wander through the displays  in the museum.   The vision for the West Kentucky Veteran and Patriot Museum was born  when Sandy and others in the community helped organize a convoy of over  a dozen buses and 800 people to visit the World War II Memorial here in  our Nation's Capital. This outpouring of interest compelled Sandy to  create a place that honored our veterans year-round--and not just those  who served in the Second World War.   I have visited with Sandy at the museum and watched her at work. She  is tireless in her devotion to our veterans and in capturing and  memorializing their stories so that we can learn from, laugh with, and  be thankful for our men and women in uniform throughout our  history.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Total Equine Services of Falmouth, KY, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   The breeding, training, and of course racing of horses is an integral  component in the history and culture of our beautiful State. Many refer  to Lexington, KY, as the Horse Capital of the World, with their 1,200- acre Kentucky Horse Park in addition to the hundreds of horse farms  operating in the area. Moreover, as of 2019, the Kentucky equine  industry had an economic impact of $3.4 billion and supplied 80,000  direct and indirect jobs. Needless to say it is a leading industry in  our state. For that reason I am delighted to honor a business so  involved in that iconic industry, Total Equine Services, founded by  Steve Thomas and his wife Patti Thomas.   When it comes to raising Quarter Horses, Steve Thomas is a seasoned  veteran. He and his wife founded Total Equine Services 15 years ago,  but he has over 20 years' experience caring for this breed under his  belt. Together, they opened the business which initially offered only  an arena where one could come and ride horses. They quickly expanded to  provide a variety of services ranging from boarding, breeding, and  training horses. In addition to that same arena, the Thomas'  constructed a Foaling Barn and 16 enclosed stalls where owners can  board their horses. The Thomas' also offer nutrition and feed balancing  services as well as a full tack shop where one can satisfy all their  riding equipment needs. When it comes to the care and maintenance of  horses, Total Equine Services offers a full package.   With parents like Steve and Patti, it is no wonder that their son  Jason Thomas grew up with a love for horses. He and his wife Nikki  Thomas have joined the team at Total Equine Services. Nikki was a  natural addition to the team since, just like her in-laws, she has an  extensive background in raising Quarter Horses. Moreover, Nikki is  seasoned in training horses in the art of barrel racing and pole  bending. Pole bending is a timed event where a rider must direct their  horse in a speedy serpentine path around six poles arranged in a line.  Meanwhile, barrel racing is an event where the horse and rider must  attempt to run a cloverleaf pattern around preset barrels in the  fastest time possible. Needless to say, training of this sort requires  meticulous repetition and a keen eye for detail, which Nikki gladly  brings to the arena. And with all the exercise and activity that their  stock see, the Thomas' make sure to keep their horses properly shod,  with Jason being a certified farrier, a blacksmith that creates  horseshoes, who keeps their fleet equipped with the proper horseshoes  they need.   The Thomas' have developed a reputation for covering every need a  horse owner or rider might have, but they are also highly regarded for  their breeding services. Their current stud horse, Redneck Jettin Down,  has not only won several local shows, he has placed at national  competitions held through the American Quarter Horse Association. In  2014, Redneck Jettin Down placed fourth at the All American Quarter  Horse Congress, placed 6th at the AQHA World show in Jr Pole Bending,  and placed fifth at the North American Live Stock Show. It goes without  saying that Redneck Jettin Down is an asset to Total Equine Services.   Whether they grew up in the heart of our big cities or in our  smallest of towns, every Kentucky citizen has heard about the glamour  of Keeneland and Churchill Downs. The equine industry plays an active  part of the Kentucky identity, and it is businesses like Total Equine  Services that retain the respect and renown of that industry by taking  special care of their breeds. Moreover, the Thomas' and families like  them play a vital role in our State's economy, as they support commerce  within our more rural communities.   Congratulations to Steve, Patti, Jason, and Nikki Thomas and the rest  of the team at Total Equine Services. I wish them the best of luck and  look forward to watching their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.  [[Page S2089]]                                ____________________
