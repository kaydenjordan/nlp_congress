 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Freedom  for Health Care Workers Act.   I would like to take a minute to reflect on what one of my colleagues  was talking about across the aisle, and that is about having the  ability to choose when it comes to abortion. Yet, here are mandates  that have been forced on our healthcare workers since the vaccines have  been introduced through the Democrats and through the Biden  administration, and it has been devastating for our healthcare  industry.   It is pretty hypocritical to talk about abortion rights for  healthcare workers in the workplace when they are completely against  the ability of healthcare workers, who I would call the experts-- doctors, nurses, and people who work in the healthcare field. They have  the right to choose when it comes to the vaccines.                                time  1600    Mandates are tyrannical and they need to end. The COVID pandemic is  over, and I am glad Republicans are making sure that we declare that  this week on the House floor.   I would also point out that we have a severe shortage of healthcare  workers, many of whom were heroes who worked on the front lines saving  lives throughout this pandemic who have said they don't want a vaccine,  they do not want to take it, and they want to trust their own natural  immunity. We need to give these healthcare workers the right to choose  their natural immunity and not be forced to take a jab or a vaccine  that they know they do not need and they do not want.   We believe in freedom here in the Republican Conference. We believe  in freedom for Americans. We believe in freedom for the healthcare  workers of this country.
