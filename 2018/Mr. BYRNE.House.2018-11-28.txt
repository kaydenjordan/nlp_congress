 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Bob Grip on his  retirement after 33 years at FOX10 News in Mobile, Alabama, and an even  more impressive 48 years in journalism.   Bob has been a mainstay in television in southwest Alabama and the  Florida Panhandle for over three decades. Through his work at the  anchor desk, Bob helped create a more informed community.   Just as impressive is Bob's contribution away from the TV station. He  has dedicated countless hours to numerous service organizations and  programs, including teaching journalism classes and hosting high school  academic competitions.   One of my fondest memories with Bob was when he tagged along for a  day of my townhall meetings in rural Alabama. At each stop, Bob was the  highlight. In fact, there is no doubt that more people were excited to  see Bob than their Congressman. It was a testament to just how loved  and respected Bob Grip is by so many people in southwest Alabama.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Bob a friend, and I wish him and his  wife, Marie, all of the best in their retirement.                            ____________________
