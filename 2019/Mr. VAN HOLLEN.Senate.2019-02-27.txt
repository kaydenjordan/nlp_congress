 Mr. President, I start by associating myself with the  remarks of my friend, the senior Senator from the State of Maryland,  Mr. Cardin, both with respect to the vital importance of moving forward  on climate change legislation here in the Senate and with respect to my  opposition to the nomination of Mr. Wheeler. I think we need somebody  at the head of the EPA who is going to make the issue of climate change  and other vital environmental issues a priority.
