 Madam President, there is funding in this bill for a  complex program that would lead to very few actual forest projects, and  I fear it will only function as a shell for programs like the Climate  Conservation Corps.   And to be good stewards of our forests, we need to be good stewards  of our limited resources. This amendment does that by redirecting these  funds to higher priority accounts, like Good Neighbor Authority and  post-fire treatment.   Good Neighbor Authority has routinely enjoyed very bipartisan support  in this body and has proven to be one of the most effective forestry  tools. Given recent past and present wildfire seasons, redirecting  funds to post-fire treatment just makes sense.   It is early August, and Montana is on fire. There are nearly 300,000  acres burning across our State. We need to manage our forests before  they manage us. And in order to do so, we need to invest in higher  priority accounts, and my amendment would do just that.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
