 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate.    Madam President, it is an honor to be here today on what  is not my last day, but everybody is acting like it.   A few months ago, I had to announce that after much consideration, to  be able to continue to serve the people of Georgia as best I could in  any way possible and also to keep true to the commitments I made in  every race I have ever won, that when I knew I couldn't do the job, I  was going to quit and let somebody do it who wouldn't be hampered. I am  not hampered yet--I am pretty tough--but it is getting close. So in  August, I decided to tell my wife about it, and we decided to go ahead  and retire at the end of December, which I have announced and said I  was going to do. The Governor of Georgia is making an appointment to  take my place.  [[Page S6802]]    A few days from now, you might look into the history books  somewhere--current history--and they might have an Isakson in the  glossary, but I doubt it. You may never see this name again.   I have been here for 15 years and loved every minute of it. This is  the most enjoyable thing I have ever done in my life, to be a part of  the U.S. Senate. It is not because I like being a Senator but because I  like to be with the people who are in the Senate.   Politicians get a bad rap in this day and time--a real bad rap. A lot  of things are said about them by people they are aware don't matter,  like those in some of the media and other places, but others will take  potshots at people who are politicians and who serve the people in  their communities. I never do that--not because I am one but because I  know, because I am one, what you have to do. It is a tough job, and if  it is not done right, then it is not done and it doesn't get done the  way it should for the people there. So I am making sure that when I  leave, the last thing I do is to leave the people of Georgia in good  hands, given that I am the senior Senator from Georgia who is retiring.   Unfortunately, at lunch today, the Members gave me a luncheon and  stole all of my material. Don't let this paper fool you--I threw it all  away coming in here. They have stolen all of my good jokes, took over  all of the things I was going to say, so I am going to make this very  brief, but in the end, very brief is good.   My dad told me one time--he said: ``Son, your words have more power  by how few you use than how many you use.'' I always remembered that. I  think speeches are really important. I make short speeches. I get to  the point, and I get out. I am going to give you some reasons that  works.   (The Vice President assumed the Chair.)   When I knew I was going to be outshined by the other Members of the  Senate at this luncheon today, I decided that I would do the best I  could to honor Mitch McConnell, who is the greatest leader I have ever  worked for in my 45 years of public life, and people like the Vice  President of the United States, who I am so proud is in the Chair. I  can tell my grandkids--who are all here, by the way--I hope you  remember that time you were there with Mike Pence, the Vice President  of the United States--you could be President by then, Mr. Vice  President--to hear a speech I made.   Everybody, thank you for being here. I am not going to call out names  because I would miss somebody, except Tester. You can't miss Tester.  But everybody else, I would miss. I don't want to miss anybody because  every one of you is important to me--the people who help us in the  lunchroom, the people who help us in stores, the people who help us get  in and out of the cars, the people who help us on bad days, snowy days,  icy days, and everything else--just everybody who helps us. It takes a  lot of people to run the Senate, and only one person to mess it up.   I want to talk about one subject today and one subject alone, and it  is going to be short.   There is something missing in this place. I am given credit sometimes  for being a bipartisan person. In fact, sometimes newspaper people  write that I am known for being bipartisan or being a softy. Some of  them say worse than that, but I am not going to address that. I am a  bipartisan person. I never saw people get things done by not agreeing  with each other. You have to come to an agreement. I made a living  selling houses. You can't ever solve a problem if you have two people  and they will not agree to a price and agree to a time to move. You  have to find common ground. It is the same thing with the law. You  can't pass a law--you can't solve a problem, period, end of sentence.  If you are one of those people who say ``It is my way or the highway,''  then we are all in real trouble.   I want to talk about being bipartisan and what bipartisanship really  is. I don't think most of you really know what bipartisanship is. I  shouldn't say that to an educated group of people like this who have  been down a lot of tough trails like I have. Being bipartisan doesn't  mean a Democrat and Republican talk to each other every once in a  while; it means this: Two people come together who probably have  differences--probably have a lot of differences--but they find a way to  get to the end of the trail, where there is the possibility of a  solution, and then they do the things they have to do to get to that  solution. America today is built on people who found a way to get to  that end of the solution, no question about it.   I hate to ask this question, but I came in the back door. Is John  Lewis here yet? Where is John?   John, you are getting shorter.   John Lewis is one of the finest people I have ever known and a great  friend of mine. I was invited to speak to the Senate a couple of days  ago, and I recognized John, who was there. He introduced me and said  some things that meant more to people than anything anybody has ever  said to me, so I said: I want you to come to my last speech because I  want to say a few things about you. Because, in essence, really, John-- to a much greater extent than me--and I together represent how things  can really change if people want them to change and are willing to do  the things that let them change.   John was born in the 1940s. I was born in the 1940s. John lived in  Alabama. I lived in Georgia for a while. John got his good senses  together, and he came to--Shelby was there, so he came to Alabama. He  is a good guy. John came there, and John lived in a shotgun house. That  is where there is a hole in the back, a hole in the front, and if you  throw something, you don't hit anything. John was a great civil rights  leader in his youth. He was the president of SNCC, the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. John walked the streets of Atlanta,  GA, where I lived. I was part of the people whom Earl Warren--there  were all these signs around Georgia. I thought he was running for  office. They said ``Impeach Earl Warren.'' I never got that figured out  until I got a little older. Anyway, Earl Warren had been a part of the  Brown v. Board of Education decision. The schools' separate but equal  doctrine had been thrown out, and the schools were going to be  integrated. Across society, the only way to prove that you were getting  it done was by the numbers. So they figured how much of a percentage of  how many Black people would constitute a good number to say you were  desegregated and vice versa, solving the problem with statistics.   I was on some of those first buses that rode to Atlanta, GA, taking  Black students to White schools, and I had some good friends who were  Black. That is another thing southerners are blamed for--we always say:  We have some really good friends who were Black. I have some really  good friends who are Black. I still have them, and one of them is John  Lewis.   John Lewis is one of my real heroes in life because I watched what he  went through to help us see the light in the South, in my part of the  South, Georgia. He was a hero. He was a hero to me.   When I got to Congress, one of the things I am most proud of is that  John introduced me to be sworn in. The Speaker of the House swore me  in, and I was down at the podium. Let me tell you what happened that  morning. The clerk said: We will now have Mr. Isakson from Georgia, who  won a special election yesterday in Atlanta, GA, and has been declared  the winner by the secretary of state. We would like to ask Mr. Lewis to  escort him to the front. We will give him 1 minute to make his  acceptance speech, and we will go back to business.   I said, 1 minute? I have been practicing all these years, and I am  only going to get only 1 minute? I can't do anything in 1 minute.   But I wasn't going to argue with the guy on my first day at work. So  I went to the back of the room with John. John walked down the aisle on  the House side. I was not paying a lot of attention. I figured the best  thing to do was to follow John, so I followed John. When John got  through introducing me, I followed him to the well, and I said thank  you to everybody and named three or four people who had helped me get  there and then said: Well, I am going to work, and I am honored to be  here.   What they didn't tell me was, if you were in the House on that  particular day, the mike for people who were Republicans was on the  left, and the Republicans spoke from the right. This  [[Page S6803]]  dummy followed John, who was smart and went to the right, where he was  supposed to go. I went to the left, where I wasn't supposed to go. I  noticed these eyeballs in the front row just going around and around.  And some guy stepped behind me after I gave my 1-minute speech and  said: ``So you are going to start this fast demonstrating what a  liberal guy you are?'' It was one of those voices that came over the  back of my shoulder, just kind of like something hanging over my head.  I turned around and looked, and this other guy--his name was Tom  Latham--came up to me and said ``Don't pay any attention to that,'' and  then he went on about his business.   I asked somebody later that day: What did that guy mean by that?   He said: Well, the problem is, you got labeled when you got elected.   I said: What do you mean?   He said: Well, you got elected in a Republican district, but you said  nice things about Democrats.   I said: Is that wrong to do?   He said: Well, we were trying to get some way to get Boehner not to  appoint you to any committee. We heard you helped write No Child Left  Behind.   That was how I started out in the House of Representatives. I was a  Republican in a majority Democratic House who was unwanted because I  was not--in fact, Newt lost--some of you know this; I see a few faces  over there--Newt lost that race by seven votes in the House. Seven  Members said: We will not vote for Newt as Speaker. Tom knows this.  Newt couldn't get reelected as Speaker, so he resigned.   I didn't know he was going to do that. I was going to speak at the  national realtors' conference in Disneyland at a convention. I got to  the hotel that afternoon, and there were 72 phone messages for me.   A guy came up and said: Boy, I hope nobody died at your house.   That is a great way to arrive at a hotel.   I said: Why is that?   He said: You have 72 messages.   I said: Well, let me see them.   The first 71 were from my wife. I called her, and she said: Have you  heard?   I said: Heard what?   She said: Newt quit.   I said: Quit what?   He quit as Speaker, and he quit as Member of the House, and everybody  is calling on you to run.   I said: What?   Nothing computed. Very quickly I learned a lot about partisan  politics. A lot of people wanted to have somebody take Newt's place.  Newt's body wasn't even cold yet, and they were picking over it. They  wanted to have a person who wasn't squeamish in a war like that.   Anyway, to make a long story short, partisan politics was pretty  rough in those days. It is a lot rougher now, but it was pretty rough  back then. People voted not with their heads but with a hammer--not  with their hearts, either. So I learned in an era where if you were a  Republican, you were a Republican, and if you were a Democrat, you were  a Democrat, and they didn't ever cross. Don't work with anybody. Don't  make it easy. If you have the votes, use them. And we kept getting  beaten or kept getting tricked all the time because the whole game plan  over there was to have enough Republicans beat the Democrats or vice  versa. That is what everybody would try to do, and I thought that was  stupid, but I didn't say that. Four hundred and thirty-five is a lot of  people, so you don't want to get run over.   A few weeks down the line, I made a speech on the floor of the House  about something very important to me and my State. It was a problem we  had in the State where our State was divided, rural and urban--not  Republican and Democrat but rural and urban. Because Republicans were  pretty much rural back then and urban people were Democrats in the  suburbs, at that time, it got divided politically anyway even though it  was an economic issue, an ag issue, a shipping issue, and things like  that. They divided up over parties, so by the time the issue got to the  floor on some kind of compromise vote, we couldn't pass anything. We  couldn't pass a kidney stone, much less anything else, because we  couldn't get anybody to agree on anything. We had the parties cross  each other and everybody else.   So I decided then, if I am going to be in this thing, at that age--I  was about 60, I guess--I am not going to spend the rest of my life down  here arguing about silly and stupid things. And there were some silly  and stupid things said over there. I am not going to say who was saying  them, but you know who they were. They were from both parties. It was  bipartisan. That was the first bipartisan thing I saw--the stupid  statements.   To make a long story short, we had some real battles, but finally I  decided that I was going to be an example of what we really need to be  like. I tried to find every way I could to be bipartisan, which to me  meant that I did what I thought was right. I think that is the way to  do it.   Mark Twain said:         When confronted with a difficult decision, do what is       right. You will surprise a few, but you will amaze the rest.    I tried to start amazing everybody. I voted for some things. They  would send somebody over to see me from the whip side. They would say:  What did you do? Did you get confused?   No, I didn't get confused.   Finally, they realized they had somebody they could deal with, which  is the good part of bipartisanship. The first time the partisan people  figure they have somebody they can deal with, they come deal with you.  The next thing you know, you are sitting at a table with the guys who  were making fun of you, and they are not.   That is the way you go with bipartisanship. That is the way I did it  on my own, going through 6 years in the House of Representatives and 15  years in the U.S. Senate, trying to find that little thing that could  bring two people together, notwithstanding what party they were in. I  never look at the party first. That is the last thing I look at.   Chuck Schumer said some nice things today. One of the nicest things  he said was that he liked the kindness part of it. He said I was a kind  person. My wife might differ with that, and some other people might  differ with that. I try to be a kind person. I try to be someone who  somebody would like to sit down with because you can't get a problem  solved if you can't sit down across the table from somebody you have a  problem with. You can then build everything that way.   I hope this Senate and this Congress--all of us--in the years ahead-- we have some big problems. Let's start having a main goal personally  that we are going to do everything we can to be a part of the solutions  and the decisions that are going to have to be made. If you don't want  to do it, don't do it, but you are going to find out, if you figure it  out, that if you try to do it, others watch you do it, and you start  making decisions and solving problems, you are going to be more popular  than the other people.   This is not a popularity contest. Governing is not a popularity  contest. This is a will of minds. Bipartisanship is a state of being.  It is a state of mind.   There are people in the U.S. Senate whom I work with and I love  working with every day--I am looking at some of them right here in the  eye. They have an attitude that I like. I know I can go sit down and  talk to them. If they say no, I will take it, and I will not stick my  tongue out at them or call them bad names or anything else, but they  know I will be there tomorrow to ask them to do something for me.   The best way to get somebody to do something for you, when you hadn't  done something for them the day before, is, well, maybe if I help them  out, I will get some help on my side. It is a quid pro quo--well, that  is a bad term. I am glad I remembered that joke. But those are the  types of things you have to do, even in levelling the playing field.   My words to you today are these: When you are fortunate enough to see  a   John Lewis from Georgia, or someone like him, step out of his  comfort zone and do what he thinks is right, and somebody tells you  ``He is wrong; don't do that,'' judge your conscience and your heart,  not some TV commentators or somebody who is loyal to hate.   We still have some people in the United States of America who will  play the hate card. We have some politicians who will dance around the  issue of hate. They will not use the buzz words, but they will get  awful close to it. They did it in Charlottesville. I have  [[Page S6804]]  had people in the basement of my house from law enforcement from time  to time because the issues get pretty tough, whether it is college  scholarship admissions or whatever it may be. We have to stand up to  the evils of society today. If we don't do it, nobody will.    I decided I was going to tell you what I really believe, and that is,  America, we have a problem, just like Apollo had. Our problem is we are  not going to repeat ourselves. We are not going to exist much longer.   We live in the greatest country on the face of this Earth. There is  not anybody any better than the United States of America. Everybody is  trying to break in. Nobody is trying to break out.   We are always passing laws, not because they are breaking out; they  are all trying to break in. Why? Because it is the safest, happiest,  richest place in the world. We have the best people to protect that  wealth and that happiness. We have enough people go in the military on  a voluntary basis. Less than 1 percent of our population serves in the  military. It makes us the strongest defender of freedom and opportunity  in the world.   If we ever lose that--if we ever lose the club or the two-by-four  that the mule gets used to, we are going to lose our coverage of  ethics, standby support, and all the other things we love and things we  do. We are that close.   I see things happening--which I am asked about by people--that scare  me. I have heard some people I know say some things that terrify me. We  are better than the hate and the vile statements that some people make.  We have to do better than that. We have to talk not over them or under  them, but we have to talk to them. We have to sit down and say: Why did  you say that? What is your problem? If we have a problem, let's get it  out in the open and talk about it.   This is the best country in the world. The strongest country in the  world cannot succumb to crushing itself inwardly if we look the other  way in the challenges of life. The challenges of life today are  America's changing. It is changing for lots of reasons.   There are a lot of people who are big internet people and all that,  and they have all the solutions. I think the solution is right here. It  is in their heart.   I am telling you from my heart that after 45 years in elected office,  raising three children and eight grandchildren--and my kids have done a  great job of raising them, living in a great community and working,  attending a great church, and doing the things I have done--I see some  of it slipping away. Churches don't have the memberships they used to  have, and it is significant. School curriculum is getting a whole lot  tougher than it used to be. I was chairman of the board of education  for the State for a few years. A lot of the traditional things we all  love and believe in, like God and country, like school curriculum,  religion, Sunday school, and things like that--they have their  challenges.   I am going to roll up my sleeves and do whatever I can with the life  I have left. I said I am going to leave on December 31, but it is not  because I am leaving you. I am not leaving you. I am going to be with  you a lot longer than I thought I would because of what I am doing. I  want to be here for you, and I want to be here when that bell rings to  say: America, we don't have a problem anymore. We solved it. You helped  us do it through our tax policies, through our Federal policies,  through our education policies, and how we treat people. We helped you  do it. Let's not get back in that shape again.   We have the people and the spirit of   John Lewis and other people I  know in this room who are willing to do it. Some think this is all just  a bunch of Sunday school folly that somebody who is leaving believes  in. Don't believe that. I will be back to make a speech again sometime  and give you a progress report. We need some progress.   Now, the last thing I want to talk about--the best thing--the example  to me of what bipartisanship means is a picture taken of   John Lewis  and me last week. Bipartisanship doesn't mean one is Black and one is  White--could be one Black and one White, could be. But John is Black  and I am White, and we are different about other things.   When John and I were addressing the House at a tribute to me,  unfortunately for everybody else, I liked it. We had a great time. When  John's time to speak came, he made a beautiful speech too. It was very  meaningful to me because we know what the buzz words were. We know what  we said to make it sound like we were really liberal or positive. We  knew we really weren't.   John knew. John knew who deserved cover and who didn't, which takes  as much guts as somebody who knows what is right and what is wrong. So  John made this beautiful speech, and I said: You know, this is my time  to pay John back. All these years he has helped me out with so many  things I have done.   I went to his 75th birthday because I am 75, and I wanted to see what  I was going to look like. I looked in the mirror, and I didn't look  like me.   John and I turned out to be really good friends. I went to John and  said: John, I thank you for that speech. That was the best I ever  heard.   I opened my arms and hugged him, not for show and not for display and  not for any purpose except to hug him because I love him. I know what  he has done for me and this country, as well as so many other things.   But John hugged me, and it got pretty long there for a minute, and  that didn't bother me. But the TV people went crazy, so the best  picture you could have seen last week among the popular pictures in  magazines and the like was John hugging me on the floor of the House.     Tom Graves and all the others from the Georgia delegation are here.  I am sorry I haven't called out everybody's name; I haven't been able  to see everybody. But they all came up and said: Thank you for doing  that. I hope everybody back in Georgia sees that.   I said: That is what you are going to tell them. Here in the Senate  at a luncheon next Tuesday, we all need to be seen doing the things  they don't expect us to do. We are doing what is right for a change,  and I just want them to feel good.   Politics doesn't need to be a feel-good business anymore. It needs to  be a do-the-right-thing business. I tell you, I am big on  bipartisanship. Whether you are Black or White, Republican or Democrat,  whatever it might be, find a way to find common ground. Give it a  chance to work, and if it doesn't, be a future friend. That is my  slogan. When I started my business and people wouldn't buy a house from  me, I would shake their hand and say: Thank you for looking for me, and  when you buy your next one, call me, and I will do a better job because  all I have are customers and future customers. I addressed everybody as  a future customer, and I got some.   When I got into politics and I started asking people to vote for me,  I said: All I have out there in Georgia are friends and future friends.  So when we walked away from a Republican meeting somewhere and somebody  had given me their right hand in the face and said, ``We are not going  to vote for you,'' I said, ``I tell you what. I will give you another  chance in 2 years so we can be a future friend, not less of a friend.''   Friends and future friends are what it is all about. If you find  anybody in business who helps you make it through life, you will make  it through life and be treated that way. Life is a win-win proposition  if you do it good. It is not a win-lose proposition. It is win-win. But  you have to demand it, whichever side of the transition you are on.   So on a day in which I have had more nice things said about me than I  deserve, it has brought clarity to me. I am going to tell you how much  this place really means.   I am the happiest guy who could ever be. I am happy because I haven't  cried yet. I am more happy because of all of you. I think you know what  I am talking about. We can do it. We can do anything. We may be called  liberal and may be called a RINO and may be called whatever it is.  Let's solve the problem, and then see what happens.   Most people who call people names and point fingers are people who  don't have a solution themselves but just want to make damn sure you  don't solve it. We have to start doing that, and then bipartisanship  will become a way you accomplish things, a way you live, a state of  being. It will be the end of a bad time and the beginning of a new one,  and I want to live long enough to see both.  [[Page S6805]]    God bless all of you, and thank you for your support and your  friendship. It means more to me than I can ever tell you. I will always  be there for you, whether it is buying dinner, going to church, or just  listening to one of your speeches when I don't have anything else to  do. God bless all of you.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
