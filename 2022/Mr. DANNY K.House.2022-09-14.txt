 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman  for her outstanding leadership of this committee. It has been a  pleasure to serve with you and under you and know that your interests  go far beyond anything that I have heard this evening.   As a matter of fact, the Census is very important for far more  reasons than just apportionment or just for looking at one issue or  looking at immigration. I guess I have been involved in Census-taking  for about 40 years, and every 10 years we go through this angst in my  community, whether or not we are going to get a fair and accurate  count, whether or not the people who are there are going to be counted  so that resources which come as a result will flow back to the area.   Well, that has not happened. And even after the expressions of the  last round, it was determined that there were undercounts, that there  were people missed. And so everything that we can do to try and make  sure that the Census taken is fair, accurate, and comprehensive, we  need to do that.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, as the designee of the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), I rise to offer  amendments en bloc.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support  these  [[Page H7839]]  amendments. Black, Latino, and indigenous communities all were  significantly undercounted in the 2020 Census.   One of the key provisions of this bill is to codify the Bureau's  National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and Other Populations in  order to help reduce these undercounts.   Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment will enhance this objective by ensuring  there is a senior employee within the Census Bureau who is dedicated to  enhancing racial and ethnic equity in the decennial Census.   The Constitution requires an enumeration that is fair and complete,  one in which all people are counted so that all communities obtain the  representation and services that they deserve. This amendment will help  achieve that.   I also support the amendment offered by Representative Case, which  requires the Census Bureau to submit a report to Congress on the  agency's process for consulting and engaging with jurisdictions and  local partners in conducting the decennial Census.   We know that certain communities are traditionally harder to count,  including groups that are mistrustful of the government, students and  transient populations, minority communities, migrant communities, and  communities with unique geographic challenges.   Engaging with local stakeholders is essential to reaching these  communities and ensuring that the Census counts everyone in the United  States, regardless of where they live. This amendment will increase  transparency around the Bureau's process for engaging with  jurisdictions and local partners and ensure that Congress and the  American people can support the Census Bureau in this crucial effort.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the  balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the Hice amendment.  [[Page H7840]]     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment  proposed by Representative Hice of Georgia. His amendment would weaken  the protections in this bill that safeguard the Census Bureau from  partisan manipulation. His amendment eliminates two key provisions from  the bill.   First, the amendment would remove the provision requiring that the  Bureau have a single Deputy Director position, which would be filled by  a career official with relevant knowledge and experience, including  experience in collecting and analyzing data and a demonstrated ability  to manage large organizations. Experts agree that a single, qualified  Deputy Director is important for ensuring smooth operations within the  Bureau, including when there is an absence of a Senate-confirmed Census  Director. Having a single Deputy Director also avoids disruptions that  can be caused when multiple Deputy Directors are appointed with unclear  job descriptions.   That is exactly what happened in the last administration. In August  2020, while the Census count was already underway, former President  Trump appointed his third Deputy Director to the Census Bureau. The  unclear duties and qualifications of these appointees sparked an  internal inquiry by the Commerce Department's Inspector General's  Office.   The amendment would also remove the cap on political appointees at  the Census Bureau. The bill caps that number at four, which is  consistent with historical precedent. During the last administration,  there were an unprecedented eight political appointees at the Census  Bureau. That is far too many political appointees for a nonpartisan  agency like the Census Bureau, and it makes the danger of political  manipulation much greater.   I am committed to protecting the integrity of the Census Bureau and  improving each decennial count. Unfortunately, this amendment would  make these goals harder to achieve.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to oppose Representative Hice's  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I move that the  Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Bourdeaux) having assumed the chair, Mr. Carter of Louisiana, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 8326) to amend title 13, United States Code, to improve the  operations of the Bureau of the Census, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
