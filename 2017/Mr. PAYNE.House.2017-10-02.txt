 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands, Congresswoman Plaskett, for hosting tonight's Special Order  hour on the Federal Government's response to natural disasters. I  believe that Ms. Plaskett and the experience that she has had in her  homeland can open our eyes to the devastation that has taken place in  the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico as well.   It is unthinkable what these American citizens have been through over  the last several weeks and will continue to suffer for months into the  future.   Before I begin, I have a message for the families and the friends of  the 58 innocent people whose lives were taken and the more than 500 who  were injured in Las Vegas overnight: The country's compassion and  thoughts go out to you. Our hearts break with yours.   For those injured, know that the American people are praying for your  recovery.   To the first responders who put their lives on the line daily: Thank  you.   What went down in Las Vegas last night was an act of terrorism. There  is no other name for it. A deranged man with a small arsenal of  firearms in a hotel room shot into a crowd of people at a concert. For  an hour and 12 minutes, people watched the chaos unfold.   All the moments of silence in the world won't change what happened  last night in Las Vegas, last year in Orlando, the year before in  Charleston, and the list goes on.   Moments of silence used to be for showing honor or respect. There is  nothing honorable about keeping silent and doing nothing to prevent gun  violence. There is nothing respectful about rejecting every single  reasonable gun bill proposed in the past decade.   What kind of Nation are we when we sacrifice human lives on the altar  of the gun lobby?   The time to act was yesterday. The Federal Government has a moral  duty to protect the welfare of American citizens before tragedy  strikes. Yet, when the news moves from one disaster to another, we  often suffer a sort of amnesia. We don't seem to remember or learn from  our mistakes. We forget to fix the problems our citizens call us about  every single day, and the problems inevitably repeat themselves.   One issue we seem to have repeated amnesia about is the high cost our  constituents face when evacuating disaster areas, particularly after  hurricanes. We read reports that, due to reduced capacity and high  demand, flights are full or tickets are prohibitively expensive. Even  if the airlines capped flight prices, like they did last week, Federal  taxes and fees can increase the price of an evacuation by 20 percent.   Recently, this hit home for me. One of my district staffers had  family stuck in Puerto Rico. Because Hurricane Maria knocked out power  and the telephone lines, my staffer had no way of knowing whether her  loved ones were alive or dead. Many constituents have contacted our  offices to let us know the difficulty they were having in trying to  find out whether their loved ones were safe or not and how we could  help.   She tried to get in touch with her family for 8 long days before  hearing that they were okay. Then, when my staffer tried to book a  flight for her family to get out of Puerto Rico, the only tickets  available were for first class. First class. That is over $700 on a  flight full of disaster evacuees.   My D.C. staff did a little digging. Here is what they learned. The  American people rely on the goodwill of the airlines to cap the prices  of flights from disaster areas. The airlines decide when to start the  cap and when to end it.                                time  2030    The airlines decide whether to keep selling first class tickets, and  the Federal Government never stops charging taxes on flights from  disaster areas.   American citizens deserve better, Mr. Speaker. That is why, starting  this week, I will be introducing a series of bills to ease the  financial burden Americans face when escaping natural disasters.   The humanitarian flight fairness package will do four things. First,  it will allow the Secretary of Transportation to declare an aviation  humanitarian crisis at specific airports covered by a Presidential  declaration of emergency.   Second, it will allow the Secretary of Transportation to mandate that  airlines charge no more than the median fair price of all seats sold on  that route in the prior calendar year.   Third, the package would require the FAA to waive the $5.60 passenger  facility charge during an aviation humanitarian crisis.   And fourth, the package would require the FAA to waive the U.S.  international transportation tax, which is $18 on a flight from Puerto  Rico and the Virgin Islands.   American citizens, Mr. Speaker. Too often Congress reacts to crisis.  It is time for us to be proactive. It is time for us to legislate  before another disaster strikes. The humanitarian flight fairness  package is a commonsense solution to a problem that directly affects  our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I always try to deal in common sense. As a matter of  fact, I have a constituent back at home who constantly reminds me of  how shallow I am, so I can do nothing but rely on common sense based on  this constituent's feelings about me.  [[Page H7661]]    I want to thank the congresswoman again for hosting this Special  Order hour, and I look forward to continue working with her as she  addresses the issues faced by Americans affected by natural disasters,  whether it is on the mainland or in the territories. They all are  American citizens.   When it benefits this Nation to have Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands be a part of the United States, it does not hesitate. But when  these American citizens are in trouble, they deserve the same rights  that every American citizen benefits from in this great Nation--and it  is great, and we want to continue to make sure that it remains great.   I continue to make the point, Mr. Speaker, that these are American  citizens we are talking about. This is not foreign aid. This is not  mutual aid. This is aiding American citizens in trouble, in disaster,  in peril, no insulin for diabetics, no dialysis for kidney patients in  two or three weeks. That is a death sentence, Mr. Speaker, and we  cannot allow it to continue.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Let me just say in terms of your guilt. It is not a guilt.  It should not be guilt. It is an obligation for you to be here in the  people's House to represent your constituents here, to be their voice.  That is why they sent you here to Washington. So do not be guilty about  doing the job you have been sent to do.
