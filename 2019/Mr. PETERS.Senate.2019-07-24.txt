 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the American Legion. I appreciate the opportunity to  speak about this truly significant milestone in the history of our  veterans and this organization. The centennial celebration is a  historical benchmark for the State of Michigan, as well as the entire  Nation.   Established in 1919 in Paris, France, the American Legion was founded  to bolster the morale of American troops as they awaited their return  home as recently discharged combat veterans following the Great War. In  September of the same year, the American Legion was federally chartered  by Congress. By November 1919, the American Legion had 2,500 paid  members and hosted its first national convention in Indianapolis, which  then became the permanent home of the American Legion National  Headquarters.   With local posts in each State, various territories, and overseas,  the American Legion is our Nation's largest wartime Veterans' service  organization. The Legion embodies its commitment of upholding the  Constitution of the United States of America and promoting peace and  goodwill through its volunteerism in the communities it represents.   The Legion's grassroots involvement has shaped legislation at all  levels of government. Within its inaugural year, Legionnaires across  the country advocated for better conditions for disabled veterans in  Washington, DC. Within a week, Congress passed the Sweet Bill which  included provisions that would more than double the compensation  disabled veterans were receiving at the time. In 1921, The American  Legion claimed another legislative victory with the consolidation of  three Federal agencies into the Veterans Bureau, which would later  become the Veterans Administration.   The American Legion created various organizations to support the  Nation's veterans and youth, including the Veterans and Children  Foundation and Sons of the American Legion. Since its creation in 1924,  the foundation has given over $30 million in financial assistance for  disabled veterans and military families. Through scholarships and  programming, the Legion also invests in the future of our Nation's  youth.   Today, with 386 posts in Michigan and more than 12,000 posts  nationwide with nearly 2 million members, the American Legion continues  to grow to support the needs of today's veterans. Whether it is  drafting the first version of the GI Bill, organizing our flag code, or  donating to the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in  Washington, DC, the Legion has been at the forefront of monumental  changes to our military and veterans policy and overall patriotism.   It is my great pleasure to congratulate the American Legion on the  lasting impact it has made throughout our Nation's history and for the  work it continues to do. As the American Legion celebrates this  centennial milestone, I ask all my colleagues to join  [[Page S5056]]  me in congratulating its members its growth and prosperity in the years  ahead.                            ____________________
