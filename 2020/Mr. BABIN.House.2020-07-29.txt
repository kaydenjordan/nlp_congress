 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Graves and Chairman  DeFazio.   Mr. Speaker, Southeast Texas is the global leader in creating  reliable, affordable energy that powers America and, quite frankly,  much of the world. But we can't do that without modernizing and  improving our water infrastructure, which it is my honor to have  achieved in this bill for the people of the 36th Congressional District  of Texas, and by extension, all American families.   My district has four ports, including the main port terminal of the  Port of Houston. The Houston Ship Channel is the busiest U.S. deep- draft waterway, and it is the top exporting port in the Nation.   This bill turns years of advocacy to dredge, widen, and improve two- way traffic on the Houston Ship Channel into real results. This will  allow for a more efficient, safe, and productive waterway for all. But  I also recognize that there is still much work to be done. It is not an  exaggeration to say that by spending $1 million today on hurricane and  flood prevention infrastructure, we can save a billion dollars in  damages down the road from another storm like Hurricane Harvey, which  dumped 60 inches of rain on my district--a North American rainfall  record, by the way.   Thankfully, this bill contains numerous provisions for me and my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle that work to address these  critical needs. It is a great honor to serve the people of Southeast  Texas in Congress in producing legislation like this bipartisanly--one  of the biggest reasons why.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the bipartisan work of the chairman, the  ranking member, and also the staff and the subcommittee chair.
