 Madam Speaker, each November, we take time to  reflect upon the lasting contributions of Native Americans in our  country. The rich traditions and history of indigenous peoples shaped  our Nation's democracy and cultural fabric long before the writing of  the Constitution.   Today, they continue to impact all facets of American life and have  endured despite centuries of injustices. We must remain mindful of our  past failures while moving forward to build a peaceful, mutually  sustainable relationship between our government and Tribal nations.    At home, in Florida's 26th Congressional District, it is an immense  privilege to work with the Miccosukee Tribe in Florida. The Miccosukee  people are dedicated to the protection of their homeland, the Florida  Everglades, and have been a crucial partner in the fight for clean  water and the restoration of the natural flow of water from the  Kissimmee River to the Florida Bay.   I am proud to have the Miccosukee Tribe in my district, and I am so  grateful for their vital participation in the protection and the  prosperity of south Florida. As our country faces new challenges, we  should strive to include indigenous voices in our national  conversation.   This month, let's commit to honoring the legacy of Native nations and  celebrating the indispensable contributions of the first Americans.
