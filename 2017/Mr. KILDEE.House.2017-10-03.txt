 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and for her  leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, after what has happened in the last couple of days, this  terrible tragedy in Las Vegas, this Congress should be spending every  minute focusing on what we were sent here to do: taking action to enact  commonsense safety measures to reduce gun violence.   But what do we hear on that subject from the leadership on the  Republican side?   Nothing. But what we get is yet another attack on the individual  rights of women in this country to make decisions about their own  healthcare, about their bodies, about themselves.   Those sorts of decisions should be made between a woman and her  doctor. This has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United  States. People in Washington, D.C., sitting in this Congress, should  not be able to interfere in the private health decisions that women can  only make for themselves.
