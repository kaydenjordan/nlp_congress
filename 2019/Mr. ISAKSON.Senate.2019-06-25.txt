 Madam President, today, I am honored to recognize  in the Record the life of James A. 'Bud'' Cody, who selflessly served  Georgians for decades and recently passed away in Ocean Springs, MS.   Bud Cody was born in Willachoochee, GA., on November 27, 1938. From  an early age, he loved being active, finding friends, and making a  difference. He played on the legendary Valdosta High School football  team under his mentor, Coach Wright Bazemore. He was part of the State  winning 4x4 track relay team.   Bud started his career at a young age, working full time at the Boys  Club in Valdosta, GA, at the age of 18. He attended college at night  over the next several years while helping his wife care for their  children.   After graduating and establishing Boys Club facilities from Louisiana  to Texas, Bud was hired by the Georgia Sheriffs' Association as their  first executive director and returned home to Georgia in 1966. His  career with the sheriffs' association also included his becoming  director of the Georgia Sheriffs' Youth Homes located at the Boys Ranch  in Hahira, GA. Bud continued to serve in these roles for the next 46  years. As executive director, he also assumed control of the Sheriffs'  Retirement Fund of Georgia, leading the organization's assets from $9  million in 1982 to more than $97 million to take care of Georgia's  retired sheriffs.   Bud retired in September 2012 with many lasting accomplishments  thanks to his principled leadership and values. He expanded the Georgia  Sheriffs' Youth Homes to provide a safe haven and education  opportunities for thousands of Georgia's abused, abandoned, and  neglected children. He also led the initiative to establish the Georgia  Sheriffs' Youth Homes Foundation, which provides ongoing funds for its  youth homes.   Our public safety officers also have Bud to thank for the excellent  training they receive to help keep them safe while protecting  Georgians. Bud believed that every officer should receive the best  training possible, so he helped found the Georgia Public Safety  Training Center in Forsyth, GA, working with State leaders, criminal  justice practitioners, and sheriffs to establish a world-class public  safety training facility that trains more than 2,000 students daily.  Over the course of his career, nine Georgia Governors routinely sought  his advice and counsel.   Bud's reach went beyond Georgia, too. He helped establish the  National Sheriff's Association Committee of Presidents and Executive  Directors in 1980 to ensure the office of sheriff had a professional  code and standards.   Bud joined his friend and business partner Claude Grizzard to form  the company CFR. In all, they provided assistance to more than 30  States from New York to Texas to California, raising tens of millions  of dollars for the purpose of helping officers and youth homes  nationwide. If you ever see a car tag from a State sheriff's  association, this is thanks to the efforts of Bud and Claude.   Bud was beloved by his family. He was preceded in life by his father,  Homer Cody, mother, Mellie Cody, and daughter, Celena Cody, and  survived by his children, James A. ``Buddy'' Cody, Jr., Derek Marchman,  daughter-in-law Kel Marchman, Camille Hormell, son-in-law Rodger  Hormell, and Amy Asbell. His grandchildren include Wesley Leverett,  Sara Cody, Laura Cody, Bryan Cronan, Austin Hormell, Quaid Hormell,  Cody Kitchens, Seth Kitchens, Sara Marchman, Jamie Cody, Maggie Cody,  and Wyatt Asbell. Great-grandchildren include Abigail Kitchens, Maddox  Kitchens, Lucas Kitchens, and Grayson Kitchens.   Most fittingly, a public memorial will be held at the Public Safety  Training Center in Forsyth, GA, on July 13 before his ashes are spread  by his family on his beloved St. Simons Island. As we remember the life  and work of Bud Cody, we send prayers to his family and all those whose  lives were touched by his mission.                            ____________________
