 Madam Speaker, today the House just passed the Senate  substitute for our bill, the bipartisan H.R. 164, and it now heads to  President Biden's desk. It helps right an injustice.   Historically, land has been held in trust for Tribes by the Federal  Government, as is the case for the Seminole Tribe of Florida. In modern  times, this has become a cumbersome process.   The bill itself was necessary to allow the Seminole Tribe to engage  in certain land transactions that were interpreted as necessary by a  congressional bill, by the Indian Non-Intercourse Act, so this would  allow them to finally engage in those land transactions.   It is critical for the Seminoles and other Tribes to be able to  conduct their affairs without having to go to Congress every time.  Comprehensive reform is needed in the future, and we appreciate the  support in the House today to send this very good bill to President  Biden.                            ____________________
