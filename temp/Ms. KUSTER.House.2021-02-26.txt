 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in strong support of the  American Rescue Plan Act, bold and desperately needed legislation to  crush the COVID-19 pandemic and bolster our economic recovery.   As our Nation mourns over 500,000 Americans who have lost their lives  due to this terrible virus, we must act decisively and with great  purpose to support our families and communities that are struggling.  The American Rescue Plan delivers on this need, providing $1,400 relief  checks to Americans who are hurting financially.   For the nearly 16 million Americans who have lost their jobs during  the pandemic, this bill extends critical unemployment benefits so they  can get back on their feet.   For our children and families who have been practicing distance  learning, this bill provides over $125 billion to safely reopen our  schools and protect our teachers and students.   For businesses who have been hit hard, this bill includes increased  funding for economic injury disaster loans.   For the one in seven Americans who are struggling with food  insecurity, this bill increases monthly SNAP benefits so they do not go  hungry. And for the good of the country, this bill ramps up funding for  the manufacture and distribution of the vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________
