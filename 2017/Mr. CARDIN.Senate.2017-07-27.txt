 Mr. President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day  on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that would strike  any provision that would eliminate, limit access to, or reduce the  affordability of pediatric dental services by repeal all or part of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, ACA, or otherwise  negatively impact children's access to coverage or such services.   I am offering this motion because the Finance Committee should review  the implications of depriving millions of children of access to dental  care. An estimated one of five children aged 5 to 11 years and one of  seven adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in the U.S. have at least one  untreated decayed tooth. Consequently, tooth decay has led to 51  million school hours lost annually, and related dental disease can cost  billions to our healthcare infrastructure. Early childhood cavities and  related oral health complications also disproportionately affect low- income families and minority communities.   The ACA has expanded access to dental services nationwide by  designating pediatric dental services as one of the essential health  benefits. Expanding access to affordable dental benefits is essential  to securing the health and well-being of our children. Many have heard  me speak before about the tragic loss of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old  Prince George's County resident, in 2007. Deamonte's death was  particularly heartbreaking because it was entirely preventable. What  started out as a toothache turned into a severe brain infection that  could have been prevented by an $80 extraction.  [[Page S4381]]    We cannot let what happen to Deamonte happen again.   I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Cardin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would strike any provision that would--        (A) eliminate, limit access to, or reduce the affordability       of pediatric dental services by repealing all or part of the       Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or        (B) otherwise negatively impact children's access to       coverage of such services.     Mr. President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day  on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that would  eliminate or reduce access to affordable preventive services that are  currently offered without copayment or cost-sharing under the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act, ACA, including blood pressure  screening, colorectal screening, breast cancer screening, cervical  cancer screening and domestic and interpersonal violence screening and  counseling.   I am offering this motion because the Finance Committee should review  the implications of reducing access to affordable preventative services  to millions of Americans. A key provision of the ACA is the requirement  that private insurance plans cover recommended preventive services  without any patient cost-sharing. Chronic diseases, such as heart  disease, cancer, and diabetes, are responsible for 7 of every 10 deaths  among Americans each year and account for 75 percent of the Nation's  health spending. Research has shown that evidence-based preventive  services can save lives and improve health by identifying illnesses  earlier, managing them more effectively, and treating them before they  develop into more complicated, debilitating conditions.   I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Cardin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would strike any provisions that would eliminate or       reduce access to affordable preventive services that are       currently offered without copayment or cost-sharing under the       Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including blood       pressure screening, colorectal screening, breast cancer       screening, cervical cancer screening and domestic and       interpersonal violence screening and counseling.     Mr. President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day  on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that would strike  any provision that would eliminate, limit access to, or reduce the  affordability of health services for homeless individuals.   I am offering this motion because the Finance Committee should review  the implications of depriving millions of children of access to dental  care. On any single night, over 500,000 people experience homelessness.  On any single night over 50,000 of these individuals are homeless  veterans. Many individuals experiencing homelessness have significant  healthcare needs and may suffer from mental health conditions,  substance use disorders, and chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma,  and hypertension. Without access to health services, individuals tend  to use hospitals and emergency departments at high rates, driving up  overall healthcare costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act, ACA, has greatly decreased the uninsured rate among homeless  individuals, leading to better health outcomes, and creating stability  in the individual's life. Health centers that treat the poor and  homeless in States that expanded Medicaid report that 80 or 90 percent  of their patients are now covered by insurance.   I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Cardin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would strike any provisions that would eliminate or       reduce access to health services for homeless individuals.     Mr. President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day  on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that would strike  any provisions that would eliminate or reduce access to mental health  services and substance abuse treatments.   I am offering this motion because the Finance Committee should review  the implications of reducing access to mental health services and  substance use treatment to millions of Americans. An estimated 43.6  million Americans ages 18 and up experience some form of mental health  condition, and over 20 million adults have a substance use disorder. Of  these, over 8 million have both a mental health condition and a  substance use disorder. That Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act, ACA, has been vital to giving these individuals access to  affordable treatment options where they had none before.   I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Cardin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would strike any provisions that would eliminate or       reduce access to mental health services and substance abuse       treatments.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.   I first thank Senator Corker, Senator Crapo, Senator Brown, Senator  Schumer, and Senator McConnell for their help in getting us to this  moment. This is an important moment for our country, and I am very  proud of what we were able to accomplish.   The legislation we are about to vote on will give the United States  the strongest possible hand to stand up against the aggression of  Russia. Russia attacked us and our democratic institutions; Russia  invaded the sovereignty of other countries, including Ukraine and  Georgia; Russia is participating in war crimes in Syria, and this  legislation will give the United States the strongest possible hand in  taking action against Russia.   Mandatory sanctions are included in this legislation with regard to  the energy sector, the financial sector, the intelligence and defense  sectors--not only with primary sanctions but with secondary sanctions.  This legislation provides for a democracy fund, working with Europe, to  protect ourselves against Russia's attacks. This legislation provides a  review process so the President, on his own, cannot eliminate  sanctions. He must come to Congress. As President Obama had to in  regard to the Iran sanctions, the President would have to come to  Congress in regard to sanction relief against Russia.   This is a tough bill to stand up to what Russia has done and requires  mandatory action. There are so many people to thank in regard to this.  Of course, we also have the Iran sanctions. I thank Senator Menendez,  on our side, particularly on the Iran sanctions issues. We are taking  actions against Iran for their nonnuclear violations, their support of  terrorists, their ballistic missile violations, their support of the  arms embargo, human rights violations.   What we do here is totally consistent with the JCPOA. The bills are  very consistent with what passed this Chamber 98 to 2. We maintained  the integrity of the Iran and Russia provisions consistent with what  was done in our committees.   In regard to North Korea, I know we all want to take actions against  North Korea. The provisions added by the House are consistent with what  we think are appropriate for North Korea.   This is an important moment for our country. I really do want to  thank all involved. I know Senator Corker, Senator Brown, and Senator  Crapo would agree with me: I really thank our dedicated staff. We could  not have done this without our staff. They worked 24/7 for the last 7  weeks to get this done. As a result of their action, the United States  is going to be in a better position dealing with Russia when this  legislation is enacted, and I am proud to be part of that.   I reserve the remainder of my time.    May I have a moment?   First, I want to join in thanking Senator McCain and Senator Graham  for their work. We started in January on this legislation--their  legislation. How we drafted it is intact here, and I thank Senator  McCain and Senator Graham.   The leader on the Iran sanctions, going back many, many Congresses,  has been Senator Menendez. In introducing him, I want to thank him for  his leadership on Iran and, also, these other bills. I look forward to  his comments.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, I wish to commend Dr. Joseph T. ``Tim''  Arcano, technical director for Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC,  Carderock Division, who is retiring after a lifetime  [[Page S4419]]  of service to the U.S. Navy, our Federal Government, and the scientific  community.   Tim Arcano has dedicated his professional life to serving our  country, first in the military and later as a civil servant. His  knowledge of ships and the oceans they sail and nuclear safety and  capabilities has been developed through his education and in his myriad  positions throughout the Navy and our Federal Government. Two of Dr.  Arcano's academic degrees were earned in my us, home State, where he  attended the U.S. Naval Academy, and later earned his Ph.D. at the  University of Maryland. In addition, he holds an Ocean Engineer degree  and a masters in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, MIT.   Dr. Arcano's first career was in our military, where he served for 30  years in both Active and Reserve service. As technical director and  ship design manager for the Virginia-Class Submarine Program, as  technical authority for advanced submarines at Naval Sea System  Command, NAVSEA, and as a program manager at the Defense Nuclear  Facilities Safety Board, Dr. Arcano developed an understanding and  expertise that few can match. Those skills were further utilized in  five Reserve commands.   Dr. Arcano's dedication to our country continued after his transition  from Active service to the Reserves in 1992 and his later retirement  from the Navy as captain in June of 2008. He served as deputy chief of  Nuclear Safety at the United States Department of Energy and as the  director of the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research at the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During that time, he  returned to the Naval Academy to hold the Corbin A. McNeill Endowed  Chair in Naval Engineering, where he created a course on engineering of  submersible systems.   Dr. Arcano came to NSWC Carderock in May of 2013, bringing his wealth  of experience as he took the helm of a campus of over 3,000 employees.  His impact has been magnified by his commitment to STEM education and  developing the next generation of scientific leaders. Under Dr.  Arcano's leadership, employees at NSWC Carderock have mentored  countless high school and college interns, even reaching to our  youngest developing scientists by leading elementary students in FIRST  Robotics clubs. Dr. Arcano ``walks the walk'' himself, giving greatly  of his own time by taking interns under his wing to offer advice and  helping them chart their path, wherever that might lead.   As part of his encouragement of STEM education, Dr. Arcano and NSWC  Carderock have continued to host the International Human Powered  Submarine Races. Teams from not just corporations and research centers,  but from universities and even high schools come from around the world  to race their independently built one- or two-person submarines through  a course at the historic David Taylor Model Basin at Carderock. For 2  years, these competitors learn about hydrodynamic design, propulsion,  underwater life support, materials science, and other scientific  principles in creating their own designs for these vehicles. The  lessons learned, both in science and engineering and in collaborating  on a team project, help to fuel their enthusiasm for careers in science  and technology.   Dr. Arcano's career reflects his selflessness, his unparalleled  leadership capabilities, and his devotion to our country. He commands  the respect and admiration of all who have had the privilege to know  and work with him. His leadership will be greatly missed, but he has  left a legacy of scientific leadership that will continue to develop  through the principles and practice that he exercised every day. We are  deeply grateful for his devotion to our national security, to naval  science, and to America's future generations.   I offer the thanks of a grateful nation to Dr. Arcano and, by  extension, to his family--his wife, Brenda, their daughter, Heather,  and sons, Greg, Joseph, and Tyler--for as we all know, the support of  family is critical. I am honored and pleased to recognize Dr. Tim  Arcano for his outstanding career in public service and wish him all  the best in his future pursuits.                            ____________________
