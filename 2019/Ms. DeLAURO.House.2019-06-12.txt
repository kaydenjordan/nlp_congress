 Mr. Chair, I rise to speak about the fiscal year 2020  appropriations bill for the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, and Related Agencies.   To start, let me recognize the ranking member,   Tom Cole, for his  work on this bill. We have worked closely together over the years  inasmuch as we have developed a mutual respect for one another. While  we may have differences of opinions, we have the same values about the  scope of these programs and whom they ought to be benefiting.   I want to say thank you to the ranking member of the full committee,  Congresswoman Granger. I believe we have put together very strong and  serious resources in the Labor-H bill.   I want to say a particular thank you to the chair of the full  committee, Congresswoman Nita Lowey, for making the Labor-H bill a high  priority.   The Labor-HHS-Education bill supports some of the Nation's most  critical programs. They touch individuals and families throughout their  lifespan, from Early Head Start to the Social Security Administration.   For 2020, the subcommittee is providing a total of $189.9 billion in  discretionary funding. It is an increase of nearly $12 billion over  last year's enacted levels.   Our mission has been to advance a positive agenda, to look at issues  where programs have been starved, and to reflect the oversight we have  been conducting. I believe we have done so.   To arrive at these figures, we hosted 12 hearings on the budget,  predatory for-profit colleges, Federal student loan servicing, the  unaccompanied children program, wage theft, and the administration's  cost-increasing changes to the Affordable Care Act.   We collected nearly 15,000 requests from Members, and we fulfilled,  in part or in whole, more than 90 percent of them.   With this input, we produced what I believe to be historic  investments in working people, in students, in parents, in children, in  families, and in our future.   We make a historic $4 billion increase over last year for early  childhood programs: $2.4 billion for the childcare and development  block grant, equal to 300,000 new slots for childcare; $1.5 billion for  Head Start; and $100 million for preschool development grants.   We also increased funding for K-12 education by $3.4 billion, $1  billion more for title I, and $1 billion more for IDEA, State grants  for special education. In post-secondary education, we make an  additional investment of $928 million. We increase the maximum Pell  grant award by $150.   In health, we make a net increase of $2 billion in the National  Institutes of Health, enabling a 5 percent increase for all institutes  and centers. We also increased the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention's budget by $938 million.   We held the first appropriations hearing on gun violence prevention  research in 20 years. Experts told us that the CDC and the NIH can do  and must do this research, so we provide $50 million for gun violence  prevention research.   We are investing in women's health. That includes a $114 million  increase for Title X. Title X provides annually more than 4 million  low-income women and men with contraception counseling services and  health screenings. These investments transform lives.   We know this President is highly invested in continuing what we call  a tax on women's health. We know the power of the White House and that  the President will reject a repeal of the Hyde amendment. That is why  this bill maintains current law with regard to the Hyde amendment.   The Hyde amendment is a discriminatory policy that makes access to  basic reproductive healthcare contingent on your income. That is simply  wrong, and I oppose it, as do others. We will continue the long fight,  and we will win that fight in the near term to ensure that women of  color, low-income women, and all women are on equal footing with regard  to reproductive rights.   Finally, we invest in working people whose pay does not keep up with  their rising costs. They struggle to deal with healthcare, prescription  drugs, and childcare.   We invest an additional $1.2 billion to help working people find  good-paying jobs and to protect and empower them in the workplace. That  includes $69 million more for at least 500 new investigators at the  Wage and Hour Division to combat wage theft and to help working people  receive their full pay.   I am also proud of the new initiatives we are introducing. We provide  $150 million for community colleges and other 4-year institutions to  train working people for in-demand industries. For too long, working  people and middle-class families have been shortchanged, and we are  moving ambitiously to make sure that we provide every individual with a  better chance at a better life.    We are moving ambitiously to make sure that we provide  every individual with a better chance at a better life because we  believe that that is our obligation as Members of Congress.   Once again, I want to say thank you to the ranking member, Mr. Cole;  to the chair, Mrs. Lowey; to the ranking member of the full committee,  Ms. Granger; and to all the subcommittee members who worked so hard in  putting this effort together.  [[Page H4458]]    And a thank you to the staff who have worked so hard: for the  majority, Brad Allen, Jared Bass, Jennifer Cama, Robin Juliano, Jaclyn  Kilroy, Laurie Mignone, Stephen Steigleder, and Philip Tizzani; and for  the minority, Susan Ross and Kathryn Salmon.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman and I have had these  conversations, and I appreciate being able to speak with him.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson)  for bringing attention to this critical issue. I proudly support  increased access to Head Start for all children, which is why this bill  provides an increase of $1.5 billion for this important program.   Mr. Chairman, let me commit to working with the gentleman and the  agency to get to the bottom of this issue that has impacted the  children in his district and prevented access to high-quality early  childhood education.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose my colleague's amendment  that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to use  funding in this bill to implement the Trump-Pence refusal of care rule.   Personal beliefs should never determine the type of healthcare an  individual receives. However, the administration's rule would  completely undermine patient protections by allowing hospitals,  doctors, nurses, and other individuals and institutions to deny a  patient standard medical care based on personal beliefs, not based on  what is best for the patient.   Current law already provides protections for hospitals and healthcare  workers to refuse to perform abortions, but the administration's rule  would expand Federal law to allow certain individuals and entities to  refuse care for any reason at all. That is why we added a provision to  the Labor-HHS-Education bill to block this unacceptable rule.   Let's be clear: Freedom of religion is important. It is already  protected by the First Amendment. However, this freedom does not give  anyone the right to impose their religious beliefs on others, to hurt  others, or to discriminate.   This rule has never been about religious liberty. It has been about  discriminating, shaming, and denying individuals the healthcare they  need.   Under this rule, we know women will be denied access to standard  medical care. We know hospitals have refused to treat or refer an  individual who needs an abortion.   Under this rule, we know a transgender individual can be denied  medical care. For women in rural communities, small towns, or in an  emergency situation, the hospital or pharmacy that says ``no'' means  these women will not get the care they need.   In this bill, we have made investments to right these wrongs, yet  this rule would completely undermine those efforts instead of  addressing real areas of concern.                                time  1545    The Trump-Pence administration is completely obsessed with allowing  institutions and providers the license to put their religious doctrine  before an individual's health.   As stewards of taxpayer dollars, we cannot allow these dollars to be  used to deny medical care because of religious beliefs, nor can we  allow an individual to impose their religious beliefs on another  individual. That could lead to tremendous harm, including deaths.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his amendment.   Researchers on the campuses of the National Institutes of Health  conduct groundbreaking, lifesaving research on diseases and disorders  that affect individuals and families across the Nation. These  researchers need state-of-the-art facilities and equipment to conduct  this research, which is why I was proud to provide an increase in  funding for NIH facility maintenance and construction in fiscal year  2019 in the appropriations bill.   This year's bill maintains that level of support and allows NIH to  make progress in reducing its backlog of facilities projects. I share  the gentleman's concern about this issue. I look forward to working  with him in the future to address NIH's facility construction and  maintenance needs.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this bill includes a provision prohibiting  the implementation of the administration's damaging new rule for the  Title X Family Planning program. It is often referred to as the  domestic gag rule. The administration's domestic gag rule is an  ideological assault on family planning services.   The Title X Family Planning program is the only Federal program that  provides quality, affordable, comprehensive, preventive, and  reproductive healthcare services in every single State. Title X clinics  serve more than 4 million women and men each year at 4,000 health  clinics across every State.   Over two-thirds of the patients who seek care at Title X clinics are  in a household that is at or below the poverty level. Many of these  patients are uninsured or underinsured.   To be clear, the Title X program does not provide funding for  abortions, despite what the others may be saying. However, the proposed  rule would make clinics that use non-Federal funding to provide  abortions or even referrals for abortions ineligible for funding.   The proposed rule also eliminates the requirement that grantees  provide nondirective pregnancy options counseling. That means grantees  can simply refuse to offer complete and accurate information to  patients.   The rule also allows grantees to refuse to give referrals to patients  or even give misleading information to patients when they request a  referral.   When patients can no longer rely on their healthcare provider to  share full and accurate information with them or to refer them to other  care when necessary or when they request it, then the provider-patient  relationship has been broken.   We need to trust women. We need to respect women to make choices that  are best for themselves and for their families, and we must support  providers to offer medically accurate information to patients.   This bill's provision to block the domestic gag rule is critical to  maintaining support for healthcare providers offering evidence-based  preventive and reproductive healthcare across the country.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chair, let me just repeat: Over two-thirds of the  patients who seek care at Title X clinics are in a household that is at  or below the poverty level. Many of these patients are uninsured and  underinsured.   We are looking at the opportunity for healthcare screenings in 4,000  clinics around this country, which is what we want to do. That is not  happening because of some ideological assault on family planning,  again, someone's personal beliefs being foisted on millions of people  around the country. That is not the job we came here to do.   Our job is to be able to have people get the kinds of services that  they need, to be told where they can go to get those services, to make  the referrals on healthcare that they need. This is not one's own  personal view of what someone else's healthcare needs are.   Fundamentally, at the root of all of this is a distrust and a lack of  respect for the decisions that women make on behalf of themselves and  their families.   Let's trust women. They know what is good for themselves and their  families, not 435 people who sit in this body who have their own  personal religious beliefs.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my friend for yielding. She is a  loyal champion for her constituents, for the children who benefit from  the high-quality early childhood education and services that Head Start  offers, and for the business owners in her district.   We want to hold these facilities to high standards. The recompete  process needs to be sensitive to the needs of the communities that rely  on these services.   I promise to work closely with Representative Waters and ACF to  conduct the proper oversight that this issue deserves.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose the amendment.    I support this amendment, Mr. Chairman. I know the  gentleman is a longtime supporter of increased funding for the CDC's  Lyme disease program. I commend him for his continued efforts to  address this issue, and I thank him for appearing before this  subcommittee on Member Day to talk about the importance of this issue.   I have a particular interest in this effort as well as the Lyme  disease was discovered in Lyme, Connecticut, so I know all about the  illness.   The underlying bill does include a $1 million increase. It is a total  funding level of $13 million for the CDC to intensify efforts to  develop better diagnostics and to bolster critical prevention and  surveillance networks, which are critically important as Lyme disease  is being reported in every single State. This amendment would increase  the program by an additional $1 million. And I do know from reviewing  the amendments that are coming up in the next several hours that there,  in fact, is another Lyme disease amendment.   So, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. This  is about protecting existing beryllium standards established by the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration for construction and  maritime workers.   Any effort to weaken or revoke the 2017 rule limiting exposure to  beryllium would reflect the first time that OSHA has proposed to weaken  a standard protecting workers against a known human carcinogen. It  leaves construction and shipyard workers vulnerable to life-threatening  beryllium-related diseases and increases their risk of developing lung  cancer.    I appreciate that the amendment is drawing attention to the  importance of strengthening--not weakening--worker health and safety  standards. This is about saving people's lives.   Mr. Chairman, how can you be opposed and support bureaucracy versus  saving people's lives?   I am so happy to support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, which  rejects the administration's plan to terminate the joint partnership  between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labor that  governs the operation of the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.   The Trump administration wants to turn its back on disconnected and  vulnerable youth, especially those who depend on Job Corps programs in  rural communities. These centers give disadvantaged young people  valuable, on-the-job experience and training, putting them on a path to  a good job while learning about how to conserve and protect our natural  resources.   As a matter of fact, of the top-performing 15 centers, 6 were  Civilian Conservation Centers.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bipartisan  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.   African American adults are almost twice as likely to suffer from  diabetes as White adults and are also more likely to suffer from  serious complications, such as limb amputations.   I agree with the gentlewoman that increasing the representation of  African Americans among biomedical researchers, as well as participants  in clinical trials, is essential to addressing disparities in health  outcomes for African Americans suffering from this disease.   I would tell the gentlewoman that I was part of a bipartisan effort  in the early nineties where we changed the rules of the NIH, including  minorities and women in clinical trials, but it would appear that we  have more to do. And we have increased funding for research centers in  minority institutions by $11 million to support the next generation of  researchers and enhance the research infrastructure in minority-serving  institutions.   I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I look forward to working with her to  see if we can turn this around.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.   The TRIO programs provide student support services to students in  helping them to pursue and to complete a college education. These  students may be the first in their families to attend college or face  other challenges. The student support services provided under the TRIO  programs include tutoring, academic advice, financial aid counseling,  college preparation, and so much more.   To help our most vulnerable youth access and succeed in college, the  Labor-HHS bill increases funding for TRIO by $100 million, for a total  of $1.16 billion. And I can tell you, there is bipartisan support for  this effort because I know that Ranking Member Cole is a strong  supporter of the TRIO program. He recognizes its ability to help  youngsters be able to realize their dreams and their aspirations.   So I appreciate that the amendment is highlighting the importance of  providing services to encourage individuals from disadvantaged  backgrounds to enter, to complete college, and postgraduate education,  and I am happy to support it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, is  leading the effort to track the link between the workplace exposures of  firefighters and cancer. This registry will provide something that is a  more complete, broader representation of our firefighters in our  country compared to previous studies.   The underlying bill that we are considering includes an increase of  $600,000 to the National Firefighter Registry, and this amendment would  provide an additional increase of $900,000.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment to  highlight the importance of the health of our firefighters, first  responders who never say no. They were going up in the building on 9/11  while others were coming down in order to be able to survive, and so  many lost their lives on that day.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise  in support of this amendment.   Sickle cell disease is a major public health concern. It affects an  estimated 100,000 Americans, with a disproportionate effect on African  Americans.   People living with sickle cell disease experience significant pain  and life-threatening complications.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to better  identify affected individuals, to understand their health outcomes, and  to evaluate strategies to prevent complications and factors that affect  individuals living with sickle cell disease.   We may be close to a cure for sickle cell disease because of gene  editing, making it all the more important for us to work with people  who live day after day with sickle cell.   Mr. Chair, I commend the gentleman for raising attention about this  important program, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.   I share the gentleman's concerns about the potential health impacts  of red tide and harmful algal blooms and recognize the opportunity for  NIH research to contribute to the body of knowledge on this topic.   I would note that the underlying bill under consideration today  provides an additional $1 million for the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention to expand its efforts related to surveillance and  reporting of health concerns related to harmful algal blooms.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his amendment and urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  strongly support my friend's amendment to increase the Administration  for Community Living's lifespan respite care program.   There are over 43 million family caregivers in this country providing  the vast majority of our Nation's long-term services and support.  National, State, and local surveys have shown respite care to be among  the most frequently requested services by family caregivers.   In kitchen-cabinet meetings I hosted in my home State of Connecticut,  I had constituents asking me about how respite care relief could be  available to them.   The committee included additional resources for respite care in  several places in the bill. We provided a $21 million increase for the  national family caregivers program. We included a $4 million  demonstration project through the Alzheimer's disease program to  provide direct respite services to these caregivers and to demonstrate  the benefits these services can provide.    We included a modest increase for the lifespan respite  care program, but this program really is unique in that it is the only  Federal effort that addresses respite care issues for families  regardless of age or disability. An additional $4.5 million will go a  long way for this small but mighty program.   I appreciate my friend taking the time to highlight it, and I thank  him for all of his service.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of Congressman Foster's  amendment, a bipartisan amendment to allow for the creation of a unique  health identifier.   We must do all we can to bring down the skyrocketing costs of  healthcare. A universal and interoperable patient identifier could do  so by reducing avoidable administrative errors.   Inaccurate patient information costs patients $2,000 per inpatient  stay and $800 per ER visit, according to a 2018 survey by Black Book  Market Research.   We could improve patient matching, reduce avoidable errors, and bring  down costs if we stop tying the hands of the Department of Health and  Human Services with regard to universal identifiers. As Pew Trusts  reported in 2018, ``The ban has limited government actions to  collaborate with the private sector on solutions.''   Let us reduce skyrocketing healthcare costs by reducing avoidable  medical administrative errors. I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   As noted in the report accompanying the underlying bill that we are  considering, relapse following opioid detoxification is a contributing  factor to the overdose crisis.   Medication-assisted treatment provides a whole-patient approach to  the treatment of substance use disorders, especially opioids. In  combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, FDA-approved  medications are used to treat substance misuse to prevent relapse and  to sustain recovery.   This amendment calls for the prioritization of funding for  medication-assisted treatment at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration. As part of our commitment to support people to  enter into treatment, to be in sustained recovery, medication-assisted  treatment is an effective option.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. The underlying bill  that we are considering includes a $5 million increase to HHS'  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, BARDA.   This organization has the significant responsibility to help counter  biological threats and other challenges to domestic and global health  security and safety, while fostering scientific progress.   This amendment would provide an additional $1 million specifically  for biosecurity research and development, further supporting efforts to  accelerate the development of emerging technologies and products vital  to our national security.   Research and development investments help our Nation to be prepared  for a wide range of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear  threats; pandemic influenza; and emerging infectious diseases.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. As  noted in the report accompanying the underlying bill that we are  considering, the current measles outbreak that has cases confirmed in  28 States, including in my State of Connecticut and in my colleague's  State of California, highlights the importance of immunizations.   Vaccines are one of the greatest success stories in public health.  They are the most effective way to protect the public from highly  infectious and potentially deadly diseases.   This amendment highlights efforts conducted by the Department of  Health and Human Services to understand the reasons that people do not  vaccinate themselves and their children, as well as to combat  misinformation about vaccines. What we need is, through research, to  dispel that misinformation which is, in fact, today, right now, putting  the lives of our children and families at risk.   Vaccines are safe; they are effective; and I urge my colleagues to  support this lifesaving amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this, in fact,  bipartisan amendment.   Drug overdose deaths continue to increase in the United States.  Nearly 70 percent of these deaths involve an opioid. It is staggering  that, on average, 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose.   This amendment provides $10 million for a new program at the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, to  develop best practices for emergency treatment and the coordination and  continuation of care for overdose patients.   By providing overdose reversal medications, we can save lives. By  providing overdose reversal medication, we can, I will repeat it, save  lives.   We have no higher calling in this institution than to save lives.  Those who have experienced a nonfatal drug overdose can benefit from  evidence-based, long-term treatment to prevent relapse and future  overdoses.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I  rise to support the gentleman's amendment.   There is no doubt that the child welfare system is overwhelmed by the  [[Page H4565]]  opioid epidemic. This additional funding would build upon existing data  efforts and provide child welfare caseworkers with evidence-based data  that can better inform how children are cared for if they are in the  system because of parental substance abuse.   Think about the tragedy of these youngsters. Please, let us not let  these children fall through the cracks such that we don't provide them  with the kinds of services that they need.   Madam Chair, we have both sides of the aisle recognizing the ongoing  opioid crisis, and I think this effort to help these innocent  bystanders to the crisis is an important one. I urge my colleagues to  support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment.   This amendment calls for funding of a new program at the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In fact, it would  establish its Regional Centers of Excellence in Substance Use Disorder  Education.   In 2017, approximately 19 million adults had a substance use  disorder. This program would improve the training of health  professionals in substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and  recovery so that more people can get treatment and we can reduce the  number of those who do need treatment. Part of this is to be able to  educate and train folks to be able to deal with the scale and the scope  of this public health emergency, which is what I call it, across the  Nation.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   I would note, as my colleague, Congresswoman Moore, noted, the  underlying bill under consideration today includes $2 million for a new  dedicated effort on sudden unexpected infant death and sudden  unexplained death in childhood at the CDC. Despite the decline in the  rate of sudden unexpected infant death in the past two decades,  significant racial and ethnic differences continue. CDC is working to  better understand the circumstances that may increase risks, so that  public awareness and provider education can be improved to reduce these  risks.   I strongly support the Congresswoman's efforts to prevent these  tragic deaths of very young children and the profound suffering of  their families.   I just say to my colleagues, those who are here and who are not here,  think about the power of the institution that we serve in and what it  can do in so many of these areas to profoundly change people's lives,  to save people's lives, and to give people comfort to know that we have  not forgotten them, and that while they have experienced a tragedy, we  will work to see that others will not have to face a tragedy and saving  the lives of children.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   Intimate partner violence is a serious, preventable public health  problem that affects millions of Americans. This amendment would  increase funding for CDC's efforts to work in communities to implement  proven prevention strategies, including programs that mobilize boys and  men to be allies in sexual violence prevention, and coalitions with  local governments, community partners, and police to increase safe  spaces in neighborhood parks.   The negative consequences associated with intimate partner violence  underscore the importance of stopping it before it occurs. I commend  the amendment sponsors for raising attention to this important program.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise to support the Developmental Disabilities  Projects of National Significance program, which is why this bill  rejects the administration's proposal to virtually eliminate funding  for it--why?--and instead provides a $1 million increase over the  fiscal year 2019 level.   These grants fund innovative projects that create opportunities for  those with developmental disabilities. They promote quality of  opportunity and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects  of community life, which benefits our society as a whole.   I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), my friend, for  highlighting this particular grant initiative for schools that serve  young adults on the autism spectrum by helping them develop practical  life skills that will help them transition to work and independence.   We need innovative programs like this one that create and enhance  opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities to  contribute to, to participate in, to feel their value, to know that we  recognize their value and give them respect and independence and self- confidence in who they are. This means that they can participate in all  facets of community life.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. I  appreciate my colleague offering this amendment. I am a strong  supporter of recovery support services, and I recognize their essential  role in the recovery of individuals with substance use disorders.   In my district in Connecticut, I have met with my own constituents  who credit their recoveries and often their lives to recovery coaches.   I met with constituents who were substance-use abusers, but also with  the providers, and they all said to me very specifically that one of  the difficulties is that someone can get treatment, and then they go  back out onto the street, but they have no one to be in touch with as a  support system in order to be able to continue on a road to recovery.  They slip back, and they are then once again on the street.   What you are talking about is increasing the funding for building  communities of recovery so that people don't feel that they are alone  and that there is nowhere to go, but to take up an unhealthy lifestyle  once again.   This bill will expand access to critical and lifesaving services,  including recovery support from drug or alcohol addiction, primary  care, housing services, and employment services. Maybe we could put  together some number, a 211 number, that a person can call, and they  can be referred on employment, and housing, and the kinds of services  that people need when they find themselves in this situation.   So I commend my colleague on this amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to support the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.  Suicide is devastating communities across our country as evidenced by  more than 47,000 deaths in 2017. It makes me proud that what we put  together in the underlying bill that we consider tonight includes $20  million of new funding for suicide prevention efforts at the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention and the Substance Abuse and Mental  Health Services Administration.   This amendment would increase funding for efforts to prevent suicide  among our youth at the places that many of them can be found: colleges  and universities, and youth-serving organizations. Through training and  activities aimed at identifying youth at risk for suicide, screenings  and the connection to appropriate services are preventing suicide and  suicide attempts.   We shouldn't be dealing with this after the fact. But what we ought  to be doing is trying to provide the kinds of counseling and have  people who are trained to recognize the telltale signs of a youngster  who is in difficulty and who needs help.   As the underlying bill that we consider shows, we strongly support  suicide prevention efforts, and I commend the gentleman for offering  this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of Congresswoman  Castor's amendment that, in fact, blocks the Trump administration's  rule to promote junk health insurance plans. Plain and simple, that is  what they are.   This is just another attempt by the administration to sabotage the  Affordable Care Act. Their policies have increased the costs of  healthcare. The level of uninsured in this Nation has gone up, and they  want to bring us back to a time when those folks with a preexisting  condition could no longer get healthcare coverage.   There are some who say that today, for the first time in their lives,  they have gotten that coverage, and otherwise, they would have died.  Maybe that doesn't cut it with some folks here.   Short-term plans do not have to cover the ACA's essential health  benefits. They frequently do not include maternity services,  prescription drugs, mental healthcare, or substance use disorder  treatment. Short-term plans can deny coverage to or charge higher  prices for people with preexisting conditions.   As I said a moment ago, remember those days when even being a woman  was a preexisting condition. If a child had asthma, Madam Chair, it was  a preexisting condition, and they couldn't get any help.   They often will not cover medical services associated with  preexisting conditions. We reiterate: They are junk plans.   Every American deserves affordable, high-quality health coverage,  which is why we need to block these junk plans that provide the  opposite.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, and I strongly oppose  my colleague's amendment that would strike $100 million from CMS  program management. This is funding that has been designated to support  the Affordable Care Act navigator program as well as outreach,  enrollment, and advertising during the ACA open enrollment period, just  further attempts to sabotage the act.   Because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 20 million people  gained health insurance, many for the first time in their lives. The  uninsured rate declined from a high of 18 percent before the Affordable  Care Act to a low of less than 11 percent. For families, it meant that  insurance companies could no longer discriminate against people because  of their medical history and being a woman was no longer a preexisting  condition.   The ACA was not perfect, but it was a significant achievement.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration has tried to sabotage the  Affordable Care Act since the day the President took office. It was not  successful, I might add, at least legislatively not successful. But  they have come around to the appropriations process to continue the  sabotage.   HHS shortened open enrollment, cut the annual budget for outreach and  advertising by 90 percent, and cut funding by 80 percent for ACA  navigators.   Who are the navigators? They are the people who provide in-person  assistance to a consumer who may need help in finding a health plan.   We held a hearing in February to highlight the administration's  efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act. One of our expert  witnesses estimated that HHS' cuts to outreach, advertising, and  enrollment activities resulted in more than 1 million fewer enrollments  in 2017 and a similar shortfall in 2018.   The Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill sends a clear message  to the administration: Stop undermining healthcare for millions of  Americans. Members of Congress have healthcare. They shouldn't be  undermining other Americans' healthcare. Stop allowing insurance  companies to discriminate again with junk insurance plans. Stop  attacking the mechanisms that we put in place to hold down costs for  American families.   Our bill specifically designates $100 million from ACA user fees to  support ACA navigators as well as outreach,  [[Page H4571]]  enrollment, and advertising during the ACA open enrollment period.  These funds will help millions of American families navigate the  complicated maze of health insurance to find a health plan that works  for them. It strengthens the Affordable Care Act individual market by  bringing healthier individuals into the risk pool, thereby reducing  premiums for everyone.   The gentleman's amendment seeks to eliminate those funds, which will  make it harder for Americans to enroll in high-quality health  insurance.   Madam Chair, I strongly oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, let me just repeat a statistic. Because of  the Affordable Care Act, more than 20 million people gained health  insurance, many for the first time in their lives, and the uninsured  rate declined from a high of 18 percent before the Affordable Care Act  to a low of less than 11 percent.   Now, keep in mind, from the outset of the Trump administration, the  effort was to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. I don't know  the umpteen times that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act.                                time  2115    They could never find a way to replace it. Ultimately, they failed  legislatively to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.   So, what have they done subsequently? They move through the  appropriations bills, and they cut back. They work to do away with the  cost-sharing subsidies for the insurance companies, which drives the  cost up.   They say ``no'' to the navigators to help people go through the  system and understand insurance. I will bet everyone in this  institution has somebody who explains an insurance policy to them.   So, therefore, I will just finish this and say: Let's defeat this  amendment because it is just one more attempt to sabotage the  Affordable Care Act.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would open up scarce Federal  dollars to untested and unproven, nonregistered apprenticeship  programs.   In fiscal year 2016, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies established funding for the  Apprenticeship Grant Program, which has been expanding work-based  learning programs in in-demand industries through registered  apprenticeships, a proven strategy for meeting the needs of our  Nation's workforce and industry, simultaneously.   The registered apprenticeship model has been rapidly expanding over  the past several years. It has grown from 56 percent since 2013--from  375,000 to 585,000--in diverse careers like software development,  nursing assistants, and insurance agents. According to the Department  of Labor, more than 3,000 new apprenticeship programs were established  in fiscal year 2018 alone.   To further this important work, the underlying bill provides an  unprecedented $250 million investment in registered apprenticeship  programs, a $90 million increase over last year. Yet, instead of  supporting and investing in a tried-and-true program, this amendment  would roll back worker protections and quality assurances, wasting  millions of Federal dollars on an entirely duplicative system called  IRAPs, industry-recognized apprenticeship programs.   The administration claims critics of registered apprenticeships  lament the registration process, calling it onerous, but I have spoken  with some of the industry groups represented on the President's task  force, and, frankly, I hear a different story. They like the registered  model.   During a panel discussion I held on apprenticeships, Bridget Gainer,  vice president of Aon, commented on the ease of registration, saying:  ``It was not an overwhelmingly or overly onerous process.''   A former staffer at the Department of Labor and Education, who is now  with New America, wrote an excellent piece in Inside Higher Ed on the  risks of the Trump administration's plans to deregulate  apprenticeships.   She said: ``Rather than focus its efforts on growing our small but  high-performing system of registered apprenticeships, the  administration has opted for building an entirely new system of  industry-recognized apprenticeship programs, or IRAPs.''   These IRAPs have little or no accountability, much like the predatory  for-profit colleges.   The Inside Higher Education piece makes that point: ``The  administration is copying the system used to ensure quality in the  lowest performing and most fraud-ridden sector of higher education--a  system that has repeatedly failed to protect students and taxpayers-- for its new approach to apprenticeship . . . and once Federal dollars  are on the line, the risks--and the scale of potential harm--increase  exponentially.''   We should be focusing Federal dollars on expanding the existing  system that is working for employers and for apprentices alike and not  on a confusing duplicate system.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Madam Chair, my Republican colleagues talk about the  need for fiscal restraint, government waste, the problem of  duplication. In fact, many will oppose the underlying bill, claiming  fiscal responsibility, but now they are offering an amendment that is  the antithesis of fiscal restraint.   Let's be clear. The IRAPs are duplicative. They promote government  waste. This amendment would open up Federal resources to support a  program that does not exist.   There are no IRAPs. The Department of Labor has yet to produce any  binding definition of what these programs are or what they will do. It  is easy to make promises when you do not have to deliver.   Registered apprenticeship programs do and currently are delivering.  That is why, in a bipartisan fashion, Congress has increased funding  year after year in a tested, proven model.   If the gentleman and my Republican colleagues want to support  workforce development, they can vote in favor of the underlying bill.  It provides $3 billion to States for job training to adults, youth, and  dislocated workers. I have a feeling that they will not because, like  the Trump administration's proposed IRAPs, they support workforce  development in name only.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   We have many supporters of this effort: North American Building Trade  Unions, United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters, AFL-CIO,  International Union of Operating Engineers, National Electrical  Contractors Association, New America, International Union of Painters  and Allied Trades, and Laborers' International Union of North America.   Vote ``no'' on this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   I would note the underlying bill under consideration tonight includes  a 10 percent increase, $5 million for rape prevention and education  activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   As the increase in our bill highlights, I am a strong supporter of  this program. We must stop sexual violence before it begins. This  amendment would add an additional increase of $5.57 million.   I commend my colleagues for bringing further attention to this  scourge that still exists in our society today and puts women at grave  risk. It is an important program so that we can look at, address, and  prevent sexual violence.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his commitment,  his concern, and his dedication.   I rise in support of my colleague's amendment.   The death of any child is devastating. The fact that children have  died while in the custody of the Federal Government and we don't know  the circumstances of why, or sometimes even when, they have died is  almost beyond comprehension to me.   We have an oversight role. It is our responsibility to make sure that  children are safe and protected while they are in the custody of Health  and Human Services. If you take a look at the mission statement of  Health and Human Services, it says to place a child in a safe  environment and do it as expeditiously as possible.   It is also our responsibility to ensure that HHS is fully transparent  and they ``appropriately respond to the death of an unaccompanied alien  child in the care and custody of ORR.''   What my colleague, Mr. Castro, wants to do is to make sure that the  Department of Health and Human Services follows its own written policy.  It is as simple as that. HHS' own policy, section 3.3.16 states: ``ORR  and its care providers must immediately report the death to appropriate  Federal, State, and local authorities. ORR must also notify the child  or youth's parent, legal guardian, or next-of-kin; attorney; and  applicable consulate of the death.''   My God, if we can't do that, who are we? Where are our values? Shame  on us if we are not protecting these children and reporting when  something is wrong or when they have died.   Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment. I strongly support it.  I thank the gentleman for offering it.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Horsford) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rouda, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2740)  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of this amendment and the Department of Education  Office for Civil Rights. The legacy of access to education in America  is intertwined with the legacy of civil rights in this country.  Education remains a civil rights issue today.   The Office for Civil Rights has as its mission, `` . . . to ensure  equal access to education and to promote educational excellence through  vigorous enforcement,'' and I underscore, ``vigorous enforcement of  civil rights in our Nation's schools.''                                time  0100    There are strong concerns, very strong concerns, that this Department  of Education's Office of Civil Rights is not upholding this mission.  This amendment would ensure that the critical mission of OCR is not  undermined and that equal access and treatment is present throughout  our Nation's schools. I support my colleague's amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment that  calls for the CDC to specifically study the impact of firearm violence  in elementary and secondary schools and higher education institutions.   Earlier this year, our subcommittee held a hearing on gun violence  prevention research. I might add, it was the first one we have been  able to hold in 20 years in this institution, 20 years until we were  able to have a hearing on gun violence prevention and research.   We highlighted that gun violence is a public health emergency and  that it needs to be responded to with evidence-based interventions.  Just as we do for other public health challenges, we must conduct  research to know how to best address the impact and which interventions  will be most effective.   The underlying bill that we are considering tonight includes $50  million of dedicated funding for firearm injury and mortality research  at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National  Institutes of Health. This  [[Page H4606]]  amendment specifically focuses on the impact of firearm violence on  students in our schools and higher education institutions.   Unfortunately, so many communities have students who have been  affected by firearm violence. In my own State of Connecticut, we have  all been affected by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in  2012, a slaughter of the innocents.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. It  draws attention to the importance of the National Center for College  Students with Disabilities.   The center is the only Federally funded national center in the  country for college and graduate students with any type of  disabilities, chronic health conditions, or mental or emotional  illness.   It supports students with disabilities in higher education and  provides technical assistance to students, to faculty, and to families.   I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment and am happy to  accept it.    Madam Chair, I rise to support my friend's efforts to  demonstrate how the centralized Community Resource Centers can be a  cost-effective, one-stop shop for those looking to access and apply for  Federal social service programs like SNAP, WIC, and Medicare or for  access to services like domestic violence prevention assistance.   It is an innovative approach. Partnerships with local governments  allow citizens to access Federal social services in a single location,  which could reduce burdens to constituents and allow Federal resources  to flow in a more cost-effective manner.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides free and  confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or  emotional distress, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, across the country.   The Lifeline provides this essential service through a national  network of over 150 local crisis centers, combining custom local care  and resources with national standards and best practices.   To further support these efforts, the bill includes an $8 million  increase for the Suicide Prevention Lifeline.   What this amendment calls for is a feasibility study to be conducted  on how we find out where these folks are so that we can help them. When  people reach out for help, we must do our best to respond to them in  order to be able to reduce suicide attempts.   Suicide is devastating communities across our country with 47,000  deaths in 2017. Depression and other mental health conditions are a  significant risk factor for suicide. Less than half of the people who  die from suicide have a known mental health condition.   As our bill shows, we are committed to suicide prevention efforts. I  support the gentleman's proposal to study ways to improve these  efforts, and I am urging my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   Oversight of the Unaccompanied Alien Children program has been and  will continue to be critical under my watch as chair of this  subcommittee.   To be fair, my good friend, Mr. Cole, was also very supportive of our  efforts to get reporting requirements in last year's Labor-HHS  appropriations bill and in the end-of-year bill as well.   If there is information that we are missing that we need in order to  make better decisions about how this program is funded, I will work  with my friend, Mr. Beyer, to get the best information we can from ORR.   Congress and this Appropriations Committee will be vigilant in its  oversight role of the Unaccompanied Alien Children program.   And to those who will grandstand about their concern of the fate of  these children who are in our custody, I say the following: Where were  you? Where were your voices when children were separated from their  families at the border?   Not only that, when you take your clothes to the cleaners, you get a  claim check. When you check your baggage at an airport, you get a claim  check. If you go to a restaurant and leave your coat, you get a claim  check.   This administration had no claim check for the children they took  away from their families. And to date, there may be youngsters who will  never be reunited with their families because of this administration's  policy.   Where were they? Where were you?   Crying out in help for these children. Don't come forward now and be  political in what you are doing.   We are going to provide humanitarian assistance, as we have in 2019  [[Page H4609]]  and in this budget, $1.8 billion, and moving forward with a  supplemental.   You have been silent, silent over these years because where are you  now?   I support the gentleman's amendment. I support the gentleman's  amendment.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     I will direct them to the Chair.   Where were they?   I support the gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. I share the  gentlewoman's concern about the lack of healthcare providers,  especially in rural and underserved areas across the Nation.   This bill provides an increase of $138 million for programs to  support training for the next generation of healthcare providers.   For example, the bill provides additional resources to support nurse  training, including a new $20 million nurse practitioner residency  training program. The bill increases funding for Children's Hospitals  Graduate Medical Education by $25 million.   The bill increases funding for Area Health Education Centers to  expand the reach of healthcare networks and improve healthcare delivery  in rural and underserved areas.   The bill also includes two new programs, authorized last year in the  SUPPORT Act, to support the mental health and substance use disorder  workforce.   All of these programs focus on the areas of practice and populations  most in need across the country.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment, and  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   Madam Chair, we know suicide is devastating our communities across  the country; 47,000 deaths in 2017.   The underlying bill that we are considering includes $20 million of  new funding for suicide prevention efforts at the Centers for Disease  Control and also at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration.   This amendment increases funding for efforts to prevent suicide among  youth at the places that many of them can be found: colleges and  universities, youth-serving organizations.   Through training and activities aimed at identifying youth at risk  for suicide, screenings and the connection to appropriate services are  preventing suicides and suicide attempts.   The underlying bill that we consider tonight shows my interest and  that I strongly support suicide prevention efforts.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this effort.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   We established over and over again this evening how suicide is  devastating our communities across this country. While depression and  other mental health conditions are a significant risk factor for  suicide, less than half of the people who die from suicide have a known  mental health condition.   The underlying bill that we are considering tonight includes $10  million for a new effort at the CDC to explore the leading mechanisms  of suicide deaths and identify prevention strategies to reduce deaths  by suicide. This amendment increases the funding for this effort by $2  million to specifically focus on youth suicide awareness, research, and  prevention efforts.   I am committed to suicide prevention, and I appreciate the  gentleman's support for the efforts that are focused on our youth.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman, and I rise in  support of my colleague's amendment.   As children detained at the border face increased medical needs, this  [[Page H4615]]  amendment perfects the bipartisan provision that was included in last  year's Labor-HHS bill, which allowed the Department to accept donations  to assist in providing basic medical care and support for children in  the Office of Refugee Resettlement's care. I believe it was an  amendment by our colleague Representative Cuellar of Texas.   The Congresswoman's proposal to include early childhood developmental  screenings is a great one for those generous volunteers who want to  help these children while they are in ORR's care.   I also want to emphasize that we will not allow HHS or its grantees  to abdicate any of their responsibilities to meet the standards that  are set in law to care for these children. On numerous occasions, we,  in fact, found, that the care was less than what was required by the  agreement struck in 1997.    Madam Chair, I strongly support the efforts of local  groups to provide comfort to those suffering, and I commend the  Congresswoman for her amendment.   I might also add, for those who are speaking loudly about their  support for children at the border, my colleague on the other side of  the aisle voted ``no'' on the FY appropriations Labor-HHS bill, which  provided $1.3 billion for dealing with the children at the border.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in support of this amendment.   Our country is facing medical provider shortages in many critical  fields of care, including primary care. These shortages have a  disproportionate impact in communities of color and in rural areas.   The bill includes an increase of $138 million to support the Health  Resources and Services Administration's health workforce programs,  which are designed to fill gaps in the supply of health professionals  in the areas with the most need. These programs prepare the next  generation of healthcare providers with the goal of improving access to  and quality of care.   The gentlewoman's amendment will build further on these efforts, and  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  and rise in support of this amendment.  [[Page H4617]]  I just want to commend the gentlewoman for her commitment and  dedication to rural America and to her community.   The success of HHS programs to address rural health is enhanced when  programs coordinate with other agencies that have a related mission.  The committee report encourages the Health Resources and Services  Administration, to coordinate--HRSA is a part of Health and Human  Services--to coordinate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its  forthcoming rural health liaison, which has been determined by the farm  bill, to ensure communities have access to the spectrum of Federal  resources available to them, to ensure that these resources are managed  effectively and efficiently, and that people who are living in rural  communities are not isolated and without the services they need for  themselves and for their families, whether it be health, or whether it  be broadband, whether it be a variety of other areas, to allow people  to be able to have a good quality of life in some of the most remote  areas.   I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment in grants to States under the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act, IDEA.   My colleague is right that the Federal Government has never met its  commitment to special education, which is why the underlying bill  includes $13.4 billion for IDEA Grants to States, a $1 billion increase  over fiscal year 2019.   This increase reflects the largest increase to the program in more  than a decade. I am deeply concerned that the Federal share of the  excess cost of educating students with disabilities has declined in  recent years and intend for this historic investment to play a critical  role in helping to reverse that trend.   I appreciate that the amendment draws attention to this important  program. I am happy to support it, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   The career and technical education program helps ensure that high  school and community college students are well-prepared for further  education and employment in high-skill and high-demand jobs in the  21st-century economy.   Research by the conservative American Enterprise Institute found that  students who take career and technical education credits in high school  were more likely to be employed full time a decade later than those who  did not.   The adult basic literacy education program provides education and  literacy assistance to low-skilled Americans, enabling them to acquire  foundational reading, math, and English skills as well as career  readiness skills for employment or transition to advanced postsecondary  education. That is why the Labor-HHS bill provides an increase of $77  million for CTE and adult education, for a total of $2 billion, to  further support the work that these critical programs do.   Today, 70 percent of the people in the United States do not have a 4- year liberal arts college degree. We need to make sure that this 70  percent has the opportunity to realize their dreams and aspirations and  provide them with educational opportunities that will give them and  their families economic security for their futures.   I appreciate that the amendment draws attention to these important  issues, and I am happy to support it.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of Congresswoman Porter's  amendment.   It increases funding for the Senior Medicare Patrol program by $2  million. It provides important outreach, counseling, and education to  Medicare beneficiaries, their families, and caregivers to detect and  report fraud, a critical program. It protects seniors as well as  taxpayers from criminal fraud, reaches nearly 2 million beneficiaries  per year, and returns millions of dollars in savings to the Treasury.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. First  of all, let me say a ``thank you'' to our colleague, the gentlewoman,  for having the courage to tell her own story in such a public way.   Intimate partner violence is a serious public health problem. It  affects millions of women and men across the country.   The HRSA strategy to address intimate partner violence focuses on  agency- and system-wide efforts to improve the awareness about this  violence, screening, and treatment.   The related Project Catalyst is supporting these efforts at the State  level.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment, and  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's  amendment, which adds this requirement for monthly ACA enrollment  information to be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, preferred language,  age, and sex.   The amendment will help States and their healthcare exchanges reach  underserved and in-need populations that are not yet enrolled or are  underenrolled.   As the HHS's Office of Minority Health said in 2017: ``In the United  States, it has been estimated that the combined cost of health  disparities and subsequent deaths among racial and ethnic minorities  due to inadequate and/or inequitable care is $1.24 trillion.''   We need to do more to eliminate these disparities and improve access  to healthcare. This amendment is part of our efforts to be able to do  so, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Congresswoman's  amendment. I commend Representative Mucarsel-Powell for her work to  address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in minority communities.   The additional funding in this amendment will help to address an  epidemic in communities most in need. Of all PrEP users, only 8 percent  are African American, and only 9 percent are Hispanic. I might add that  there is also a very low percentage of women who are able to access  PrEP. There is a particular lack of access in the south. And the cost  of PrEP is exorbitant, in some cases, up to $13,000.   Only half of racial minorities living with HIV have a suppressed  viral load. That is why the underlying Labor-HHS, Education bill that  we considered tonight, or early morning, increases funding for HIV/AIDS  prevention and treatment activities by more than $500 million,  including increases for the Ryan White program, to increase access to  antiretroviral therapy, or ART, community health centers, to increase  availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, and the CDC for  prevention activities.   I support this amendment and, again, commend the gentlewoman for  bringing it forward.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in support of his amendment.   The mission of the Office of Inspector General is to ``conduct  independent and objective audits, investigations, and other activities  to promote the efficiency, effectiveness, and integrity of the  Department's programs and operations.''  [[Page H4623]]    We must insist on a strong ethical framework and invest in robust  oversight of our Federal Government. That is why I am pleased to say  that the underlying Labor-HHS bill provides an increase of $2.3  million, for a total of $63.4 million for the OIG.   Over the past several years, we have witnessed a collapse of  predatory for-profit colleges; publicly-traded Corinthian and ITT  Technical Institutes were among them.   The Department of Education Inspector General issued an audit report  that evaluated the ways in which the Department is monitoring these  institutions. It concluded that the existing Borrower Defense  regulation will help the Department better mitigate potential harm to  students and taxpayers.   It is critical that we heed the information and recommendations that  come from these reports, and we must protect the integrity of the  Borrower Defense rule. It uncovered the mismanagement and the lack of  oversight of the student loan serving industry by the Federal Student  Loan Office, harming millions of students across this country.   The work carried out every day by the OIG across agencies is  fundamental to maintaining the integrity and the efficiency of our  government programs.   I commend the gentleman, and I am happy to accept this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  rise in support of her amendment. I will take less than 45 seconds.   Madam Chair, my view and what I think this amendment does is it  further increases resources for the Health Centers program. The  underlying bill is $50 million, but it expands it to provide the  opportunity for school-based care.   What we need in this Nation is mental health services in every school  in this Nation to be able to recognize telltale signs of adverse  effects that children are experiencing, whether it be trauma, whether  it be food insecurity, whether it be violence or abuse, in order to be  able to prevent what could happen as a result of those adverse  experiences.
