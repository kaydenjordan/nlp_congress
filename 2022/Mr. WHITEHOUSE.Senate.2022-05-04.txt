 Mr. President, if we want friends overseas and if we  want a robust world economy, it is important that America plays fair  with the rest of the world on climate. Participating in the  international climate fund, participating in the Paris accord and the  COP agreements, and having a robust national strategy on climate change  are all distinctly in our national security and economic interests.   I urge voting no on the Lee motion to instruct, and I further urge  that if we want to protect the American consumer, get the heck off of  fossil fuel before it drives us into ruin with high prices set by  international cartels and massive pollution.                                Vote On Motion     Madam President, this is the second shot that has  been taken this afternoon at the international climate fund by our  friends on the other side.   America is a great and powerful nation, and it is usually good for  great and powerful nations not to be a jerk, and therefore sticking up  for the countries that are suffering because of climate pollution is  something that a great and powerful nation ought to do.   Don't be a jerk and clean up your own messes are two things that I  learned as a child. And I think that our national security and our  economic advantage are both served by actually supporting the  international climate fund and helping the world work its way through  the predicament that the fossil fuel industry has foisted on us. I urge  a ``no'' vote on this.                                Vote on Motion     I ask for the yeas and nays.
