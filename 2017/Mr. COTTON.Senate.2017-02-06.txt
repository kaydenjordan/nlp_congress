The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                                 appointments    The Chair announces, on behalf of the majority leader, pursuant to  the provisions of Public Law 68-541, as amended by the appropriate  provisions of Public Law 102-246, and in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the reappointment of the following individuals to  serve as members of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board for a five  year term: Chris Long of New York and Kathleen Casey of Virginia.    Mr. President, I have to admit that this is a bittersweet  moment for me. I come here tonight to express my support for Jeff  Sessions' nomination to be the next Attorney General of the United  States. It is a high honor, and the nominee is more than worthy. The  truth is, I will be sad to see him go.   In all the time I have known Senator Sessions, I have found him to be  a consummate gentleman. We actually met before I entered the Senate. It  was 2013. I was serving in the House of Representatives--a first-term  Congressman. Senator Sessions, of course, was my elder in both age and  rank. Yet he reached out to me humbly to discuss a hot topic-- immigration. Back then, there was an effort afoot to force through  Congress a massive immigration bill the American people clearly did not  want. So the two of us worked together to stop it, and I am glad to say  we were successful.   I took away more from that experience than an appreciation of the  Senator's legislative skills. I got a sense of his character: how he  saw the world, what he believed, and why. If I had to sum it up, I  would say this is a man who loves the law--who has spent decades doing  all he could.   Senator Sessions knows the law shouldn't be the spider's web of old,  which catches the weak but cannot constrain the mighty. It is supposed  to uphold the entire community so all Americans can thrive. What we  have is a legal system that at its best strives to be a justice system.   I think if you look at Senator Sessions' career, you can see the same  qualities represented by the balance, the blindfold, and the sword of  Lady Justice. First, like the balance, he has a judicious mind--honed  over his 12 years as a U.S. attorney and his 2 years as attorney  general of the State of Alabama. He evaluates the evidence carefully  and comes to a well-considered  [[Page S886]]  conclusion. I would argue it is this very approach that led him to  advocate for an immigration system that works for working Americans. I  have every confidence, as our top law enforcement officer, he will keep  the interests of American citizens uppermost in his mind.   Second, like the blindfold, he is impartial and fair-minded. I think  of the fair sentencing law he passed, with bipartisan support, to bring  harsh penalties that fell disproportionately on African Americans more  in line with the kinds of penalties that fell on other criminals. I  also think of his work on behalf of a more equitable distribution of  funding for HIV-AIDS patients. Just as Senator Sessions strove to  represent the interests of all Alabamians, I think Attorney General  Sessions will strive to uphold the rights of all Americans.   Third, like the sword, Senator Sessions believes in swift and strong  enforcement. Perhaps the best argument for his candidacy is the  extensive list of endorsements he has received: the Fraternal Order of  Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the list goes on. I  would think such widespread support among the people he would oversee  would make a deep impression on any Senator's mind. If the people who  actually enforce the law believe in his leadership, then so do I.   So I am sorry to see him say goodbye to this august body, but I am  confident he will serve the American people well. He is the right man  for the job. I urge all Senators to vote for his confirmation.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
