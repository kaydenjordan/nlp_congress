 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use a prop  during my remarks.    Madam President, in 1989, Tracy Stone-Manning rented a  typewriter to draft and then send a letter threatening those who might  choose to harvest trees. The letter stated that the trees in question  had been sabotaged with hundreds of pounds of spikes. She closed the  letter with:  [[Page S5088]]  ``You bastards go in there anyway,'' meaning notwithstanding her  threat, ``and a lot of people could get hurt.''   She and her cohorts thus used the threat of physical violence to  achieve a political goal. This is the definition of terrorism.   In 1993, multiple associates of Ms. Stone-Manning were convicted of  tree spiking by a Federal jury. Though she signed and swore that the  information provided to the committee was ``to the best of [her]  knowledge and belief, current, accurate, and complete,'' Ms. Stone- Manning told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that she had  never been investigated.   This was, in fact, not true. It was widely reported that in 1990, Ms.  Stone-Manning was required to give hair samples, a full set of  fingerprints, and writing samples. This was already a year after she  had conspired with her circle of friends, members of the radical  environmentalist group Earth First!. She was still not cooperating with  the authorities.   Now, how do we know that she was, in fact, a target of the  investigation and not simply a bystander? Well, we know that based on a  letter from Michael Merkley, a retired special agent criminal  investigator for the Forest Service. He writes the following:         [The witness] described how Ms. Stone-Manning typed and       mailed the letter to the Forest Service. She also recounted a       conversation she had overheard wherein Ms. Stone-Manning       along with other co-conspirators planned the tree spiking and       discussed whether to use ceramic or metal spikes in the       trees.        As a result of [the witness's] testimony, the grand jury       sent Ms. Stone-Manning a ``target letter'' which meant she       was going to be indicted on criminal charges for her active       participation in planning these crimes. She hired an attorney       who negotiated a deal with an Assistant United States       Attorney to gain immunity in exchange for her testimony       against the other defendants.    Ms. Stone-Manning did not gain immunity simply for being a good  person or a model citizen. No, she traded her knowledge after  withholding it for years. This is verified by her own admission in the  May 21, 1993, edition of the Missoulian, reading:         Stone-Manning said she could have been charged with       conspiracy . . . were it not for the agreement she reached       with the U.S. attorney.    Furthermore, she received a target letter, meaning she knew very well  that she had been under investigation.   This is a direct contradiction of a sworn statement that she made to  the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which I serve, so  she deliberately misled U.S. Senators. Unfortunately, Ms. Stone-Manning  has been able to deceive a lot of people. Even a White House official  acknowledged that this was a ``massive vetting failure.''   So what exactly did this tree spiking involve? Well, it involved  spikes like these, spikes made of steel that, when placed into a tree,  can cause widespread damage to those harvesting the trees, those  milling the trees They have maimed many and wounded many others as a  result of radical environmentalists taking this tactic to try to stop  the harvesting of timber on Federal lands.    Now, regardless of how you may feel about timber-harvesting policy on  Federal lands, I think all Americans of good faith and conscience can  agree that it is not a good idea to use terrorism to advance your goals  and that it is not a good idea to use threats of physical violence and  present people with a real, foreseeable, and, in fact, foreseen and  intended risk that they will be harmed or could even die as a result of  the 500 pounds of these tree spikes that they placed in the trees in  question.   So, yes, the White House admitted that this was a vetting failure,  and a vetting failure it was. It was either a vetting failure or no one  at the administration cared when Tracy Stone-Manning tweeted out only  months ago an article written by her husband, an article that itself  states: ``There's a rude and satisfying justice in burning down the  house of someone who builds in the forest.''   When she tweeted out this story, apparently with her approval, she  called it a clarion call--her words, not mine--seeming almost to  celebrate their misfortune, to revel in the misery and loss of those  who had just had their homes destroyed, oftentimes as a result of  chronic mismanagement on Federal lands in allowing fuel to build up and  remain untreated.   There are plenty of homes in forests in Utah. I presume that there  are plenty of homes elsewhere--that there are plenty of homes in  Arizona, in Montana, in California, in Colorado, in Nevada, in West  Virginia, and elsewhere. So I would ask the question: How can we  entrust the responsibility to protect the homes of those Americans who  live on or near a forest from forest fire to an individual who actively  advocated only months ago for their demise and who, apparently,  celebrated their demise?   Lastly and, perhaps, most heinously, revelations have also come out  regarding research that she conducted for her thesis. In 1992, Tracy  Stone-Manning published her graduate student thesis at the University  of Montana, entitled ``Into the Heart of the Beast: A Case for  Environmental Advertising,'' which espoused several radical views on  population and grazing.   In this thesis, she published a photo of a child with the caption-- this photo with this caption right here. It has a picture of a young  child, a toddler. ``Can you find the environmental hazard in this  photo?'' She then indicated that the child--this baby--was the  environmental hazard.   She then elaborates:         Americans believe that overpopulation is only a problem       somewhere else in the world. But it's a problem here too. . .       . We breed more than any other industrialized nation. At the       same time, we suck up one-third of the world's energy. . . .       When we overpopulate, the earth notices it more. Stop at two.       It could be the best thing you do for the planet. . . . Do       the truly smart thing. Stop at one or two kids.    This is a fringe belief. It is a dangerous belief. Not only is it  factually flawed, but it is morally repugnant. As a father of three, I  am repulsed, ashamed, and saddened. As much as anything, as the  resident of a State, two-thirds of which is owned by the Federal  Government and 40 percent of which is under the direct management and  control of the Bureau of Land Management, the entity that she has been  nominated to head, I am mortified that she is going to be in charge of  all of that land, because this is how she views human beings.   We should all accept the fact that human beings are assets; they are  blessings. They are not liabilities. Children are beautiful gifts from  Heaven above, not environmental hazards.   I have consistently voiced outrage at China's one-child policy, and  we are here today, voting on a nominee who calls for a similar action-- telling parents in the most condescending tone imaginable: ``Stop at  one or two kids.'' According to Ms. Stone-Manning, we are simply  breeding too much.   So now we must ask ourselves: Will this body advance the nomination  of a person who played a central role in endangering the lives of  foresters and sawmillers, who engaged in acts of reckless and  deliberately harmful environmental terrorism in using 500 pounds of  tree spikes, who attempted to deceive Members of the U.S. Senate about  these same violent actions, who has advocated for homes to be left to  burn in the wilderness, indicating that she would celebrate when that  happened, and who has called children an environmental hazard?   The Director of the Bureau of Land Management, the position that Ms.  Stone-Manning has been nominated to fill, has immense discretionary  power. This isn't simply a matter that is concerning for symbolic  reasons. It is that, too, but far more than that. If confirmed to this  position, she is going to have immense discretionary power.   Could we rest knowing that she was at the helm of the Bureau of Land  Management, making decisions about grazing, wildfire response, wildfire  prevention, suppression, and rehabilitation and everything else that  the Bureau of Land Management is charged with? I could not. I cannot  and I will not. So I urge my colleagues to reject her nomination.   I yield the floor
