 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, this is not about a red herring about men wanting to  play in women's sports. Please.   This is about people like my husband, Phil, and I. We have been  married for almost 13 years. We are a pretty boring married couple,  probably not all that different than most people in Congress.   We try to sleep in a little on the weekends, we sometimes argue over  what to watch on TV, and we cherish the limited time we have with our  friends and family.   And we are really lucky, because we live in Wisconsin, the first  State in the Nation to pass a gay and lesbian civil rights bill back in  1982, and it was signed by a Republican Governor, but that is not true  for a majority of America.   If we pass the Equality Act, people like Phil and I can be free to  love who we love, and we can live where we want to live, and we can  work where we want to work without being fired or evicted simply  because of who we are or who we love.   That is pretty simple, pretty normal, pretty American.   Today, we here in Congress can protect our LGBTQ constituents who  want to live a life like Phil and mine, like yours, free of unfair  prejudice and discrimination.   Madam Speaker, I hope that Members will do the right thing today and  join me in supporting the Equality Act.                                time  0945
