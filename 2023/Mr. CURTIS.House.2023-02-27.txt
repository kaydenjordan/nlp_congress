 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address my bill before us on  the floor, the Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act.   This commonsense and bipartisan bill would require the creation of  reasonable disclosure guidelines for products that have audio or visual  recording components that are not clearly obvious to a reasonable  person, such as household appliances.   This emerging smart technology will provide unknown benefits and  conveniences to modern life, but along with this new technology, we  need to update transparency for consumers. My bill balances protecting  American consumers with continuing to foster innovation.   By working with a broad range of stakeholders, my legislation will  ensure consumers are aware of the capabilities of items they are  putting in their homes without hamstringing the technology pioneers in  places like Silicon Slopes in my district who are developing smart  technologies.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representative Moulton, Senator  Cantwell, and Senator Cruz, for their bipartisan and bicameral support  of this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
