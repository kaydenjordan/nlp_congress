 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to show an army of  congressional leaders who back the blue. I rise to show our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle and Americans across the country that we  won't back down when it comes to supporting our men and women in  uniform.   Since my time in Congress began just over 1 year ago, I have made it  my mission to show not just in words but also in action that our LEOs  across the country have a thin blue line army that won't back down,  that won't quit, and that will always have their six.   Today, we rise to honor the heroes in our midst, the everyday public  servants who get up daily to don the badge, run into harm's way, moving  towards danger and working hard to keep us all safe.   Amid efforts to defund our police, leading to a rise in crime with no  response from elected officials nationwide or from this administration;  amid phony bail reform efforts that do nothing to keep dangerous  criminals behind bars; amid an opioid crisis with record levels of  drugs pouring into our communities, perpetuated by the crisis at our  southern border--because we all know that you cannot defend your  hometowns if you cannot protect the homeland--amid dangerous rhetoric  spread by the ill-informed; amid increasing levels of vitriol for this  profession, these real heroes, well, they show up.                                time  2100    Madam Speaker, I stood on this floor in March of last year as my  Democrat colleagues passed a bill to defund police. They defunded  police. Now, that night, I challenged my colleagues across the aisle to  a ride-along. Not a single one--not one--took me up on my offer.   Instead, my team and I set out to do the ride-alongs that my  colleagues would not. And wow, did we learn a lot. Whether it was  domestic violence, robbery, battery, violent brawls, drunk drivers,  drug busts--everything in between--these ride-alongs proved it. These  men and women who wear the badge, they are amazing. They are imperfect  beings doing the toughest of jobs with the best of intentions. They are  criticized, demonized, and vilified, and yet, they continue to answer  the call in the face of it all.   Madam Speaker, 2021 was the deadliest year on record for members of  the law enforcement community--the deadliest. Next to me, you see the  names of all those that we lost. You probably can't see the names very  well or even care to read them. There is 458 of them--the poster isn't  even big enough to accommodate all of the names. That is 458 families  shattered forever. That is 458 departments forever changed. That is 458  lives lost.   As the wife of a first responder, I know all too well that feeling of  twists and turns and pain that comes when a SWAT callout has come out.  I know what it is like to sit at the kitchen table and wait for the  call, the text letting me know that the callout is over and that my  husband is on his way back to the department or to the station.   I know what it is like, and that is perhaps why I stand here today  more resolved than ever to stand in defense and in support of those who  protect and serve every day. To the spouses of our men and women in law  enforcement, know that you have a friend and sister in this fight. Know  that your service alongside your partner is just as valuable and  important to all those across the country. Whether you call yourself a  deputy or an officer, an LEO spouse or family member, the message is  simple: My colleagues and I, we see you, we hear you, we support you,  and we will always have your six.   To those who seek to divide, defund, and disparage, know that every  attempt that you make to hurt our LEOs and defund our departments, it  will only be in vain. Your efforts to make our communities less safe  will fail. Your efforts to hurt our families will falter. My colleagues  and I, we will make sure of it.

Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of California for continuing to be a champion for our  police departments and law enforcement officers.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Madam Speaker, it is pretty challenging to be standing  in a room that, from the view of C-SPAN, is filled. But I can tell you  right now that it is just you and me, Madam Speaker, as well as my  colleague from the Sunshine State, Representative Rutherford, behind  me, as well as some of our fantastic staff here on the House floor.                                time  2150    I think it is time that we stop playing these partisan games and  really come together because this truly is a bipartisan issue. This is  an issue that affects our communities as a whole, and I think if we are  going to call for responsibility, actions, and words, we should start  in this Chamber.   I have a quote here that I wanted to read from one of our colleagues.  It says: ``I am going to make sure that I have security because I know  I have had attempts on my life, and I have too much work to do. There  are too many people that need help right now. So, if I end up spending  $200,000, if I spend $10 more on it, you know what? I get to be here to  do the work. So suck it up, and defunding the police has to happen. We  need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets  because we are trying to save lives.'' Madam Speaker, those are your  words.   See, when I was homeless about a decade ago, I wasn't privileged  enough to have $200,000 to spend on private security. In fact, it was a  comfort knowing that at any moment, in some of the toughest situations  that were happening around us--violence, abuse--that a quick call to  911 would result in someone coming to help. We had nothing but the  reassurance that on the other end of that line, someone was coming to  help, someone was willing to answer the call.   I know that there is far more in this country that unites us than  divides us, but I cannot tell you how disappointed I am as we have  stood here for the last hour reciting stories of heroism, of  selflessness--if I had time, I would recite the names of our fallen  officers, but I simply haven't enough time. And, quite frankly, Madam  Speaker, you haven't even looked up off your phone.   To Americans who are watching this, know that there are people in  this Congress who do give a damn, who will look up off their phone, who  are not too bothered to listen. We will not stop fighting. We will  continue to back the blue.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
