 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Rates Act. This critical health  care reform bill would address the soaring cost of insurance premiums.   Many factors contribute to increasing premiums, from the increased  prevalence of chronic disease to the consolidation of the insurance  market. But no matter the root cause of premium hikes, it is important  that rate increases are reviewed to ensure they are fair. When  consumers see insurance premiums increase by double digits, it can add  an additional burden on top of  [[Page S4431]]  mortgage payments, childcare, and student loans. If rates are  unreasonable, they should be blocked or modified.   The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Rates Act would allow the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to act on behalf of consumers to  protect them against egregious increases in health insurance rates in  States that do not take this action.   In California and several other States across the Nation, State  regulators lack the authority to block or modify extreme health  insurance rate increases. This legislation does not change any State's  ability to take this action. Rather, it simply allows the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to help fill in the gaps in the health care  regulatory space so consumers in all States would have adequate  protections against this type of price gouging.   The Affordable Care Act slowed the growth of premium increases and  improved the value of health insurance--including how much of premiums  insurers must spend on actual medical care and ensuring rate increases  are at least reviewed. These were good first steps, but more needs to  be done. Far too many Americans are facing rate increases and full  consumer protections must be in place to ensure that prices reflect  true cost and not simply profits. Providing all Americans with  affordable, quality healthcare is of the utmost importance and Congress  ought to be building on the successes of the Affordable Care Act while  making improvements where necessary.   This bill provides a straightforward, direct enforcement mechanism to  ensure that insurers may not impose unreasonably high costs on  consumers, by empowering the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  step in when State regulators do not, or are unable to.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to protect Americans  from unreasonable rate hikes and move toward real, commonsense health  care solutions.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER:   S. 1668. A bill to rename a waterway in the State of New York as the  ``Joseph Sanford Jr. Channel''; to the Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation.
