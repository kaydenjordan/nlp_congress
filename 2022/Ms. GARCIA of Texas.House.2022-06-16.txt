 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10- year anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program,  more commonly known as DACA.   Ten years ago, President Obama and Democrats reaffirmed America's  tradition as the land of opportunity by creating DACA. Since that day,  brave young immigrants, known as Dreamers, have provided massive  contributions on their path to the American Dream.   DACA gave Dreamers a chance to do that, to dream big. It allowed them  to use their talents, giving them a chance to seek higher education,  work, and, most importantly, protection from deportation. They were  there for us on the front lines, working as healthcare workers, all  kinds of workers, to help us through the pandemic, and we thank them.   While we celebrate DACA as a significant temporary achievement for  all of America, it is by no means a substitute for fixing our broken  immigration system.   Mr. Speaker, I promise to continue our fight for comprehensive  immigration reform so that we can finally keep families together  permanently.                            ____________________
