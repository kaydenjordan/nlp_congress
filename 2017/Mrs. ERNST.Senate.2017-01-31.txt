 Mr. President, I rise today on the 1-year anniversary of  the tragic death of a fellow Iowan, Sarah Root. On January 31, 2016-- the very same day as her college graduation--Sarah was killed by an  illegal immigrant named Edwin Mejia, who was allegedly drag racing with  a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit. Sadly,  despite requests by local law enforcement, ICE failed to detain Mejia.  He then posted bond, was released, and now a year later remains a  fugitive, denying Sarah's loved ones any sense of closure or Justice.   As a mother and grandmother, I cannot fathom the grief her family and  friends continue to feel after such a devastating loss. Just 21 years  old, Sarah was bright, gifted, full of life, and ready to take on the  world. Having just graduated from Bellevue University with a 4.0 grade  point average, she was dedicated to her community and wanted to pursue  a career in criminal justice. Sarah had a remarkably bright future  ahead of her, but her opportunity to make a mark on the world was  tragically cut short 1 year ago today. Yet, even in death, she touched  the lives of others, saving six different individuals through organ  donation. Although nothing can bring Sarah back to her family, we can  ensure that ICE never makes that same mistake again.   I was encouraged to see the Trump administration take action toward  addressing this issue last week by implementing parts of Sarah's Law-- legislation I introduced with my Iowa and Nebraska colleagues in honor  of Sarah. I remain committed to continuing to work with my colleagues  to fulfill the promise I made to Sarah's loving parents: that I will do  everything I can to ensure that no other parents have to go through  what the Root family has faced.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.
