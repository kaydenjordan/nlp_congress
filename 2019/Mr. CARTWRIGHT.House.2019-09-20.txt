 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island  for yielding.   Madam Chair, we have heard the stories, and we will continue to hear  them, of all of the employees and the consumers who have been tricked  into giving away their constitutional right to a jury trial to have  their rights enforced.   It doesn't really matter all the constitutional rights you have or  all the statutory rights that you have; if you don't have a right to  enforce these in court, all of your rights are washed away. So when  consumers and employees get tricked into signing away their right to go  to court, all of their rights are washed away.   We have heard the stories. And I wanted to add to the list the story  of Barbara Jones-Davis, who is 98 years old. She had glaucoma and  dementia. She was in a nursing home in northwest Philadelphia. They let  her wander. In violation of all their own policies, she wandered  outside. She wandered outside for more than 20 minutes. She went over a  15-foot precipice and fell to her death with a broken skull.   Her family got forced into arbitration. The nursing home didn't admit  responsibility. They forced her into one of these secret and rigged  arbitrations.   These things are unconstitutional. They take away your right to go to  court. This is a constitutional right that our Founding Fathers fought  and died for: that we would be able to resolve our disputes in court,  in open court, fairly chosen, not one of these secret and rigged  proceedings that is mandatory. It is forced because people got tricked  into them.   Madam Chair, let's all vote for the FAIR Act and restore our American  constitutional rights.
