 Mr. President, on March 14, 2022, I was unable to  cast a vote on rollcall vote No. 79, the motion to invoke cloture on  Executive Calendar No. 726, the nomination of Shalanda D. Young of  Louisiana, to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I was  on a bipartisan congressional delegation visit to Poland, meeting with  refugees displaced by the violence caused by the current, illegal  invasion of Ukraine.   Had I been present, I would have voted yes to proceed with her  nomination as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.                            ____________________
