 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the Biden border crisis. Right now, our Nation is facing a dangerous  national security crisis at the border, and it is all because of the  policies and the actions of President Joe Biden.   Now, there are a lot of crises that we are facing. There is the  border crisis; the crisis of high gas prices; there is a crisis of  inflation, which is at a 40-year high; and there is the crisis of the  issue of international affairs with Vladimir Putin on NATO's doorstep  having invaded Ukraine.   When you take a look at all of these, the two that I hear about most  at home in Wyoming are that of inflation and that of illegal  immigration. The thing that is really bringing this to the fore today  and why I am coming to the floor to talk about Biden's border crisis is  the announcement that on May 23, distressingly, the crisis is going to  get a lot worse.   On May 23, the experts tell us, including people from this own  administration, that the number of people illegally coming to this  country could double or even triple overnight. Since Joe Biden took  office, there have been millions and millions of illegal crossings from  our southern border into the United States. The Border Patrol estimates  that more than 700,000 illegal immigrants got away from them since Joe  Biden has taken office. This includes 62,000 people just last month. It  works out to about 2,000 illegal immigrants vanishing into the United  States every single day. These are the ones who got away. These aren't  the tens and tens of thousands who are coming through the process and  being registered and released into the United States. Once they get in,  most likely, they will never leave.   Under Joe Biden, we are breaking record after record, and these are  the wrong kind of records to break. Last year, the number of illegal  immigrants who came to the United States was the highest ever recorded.  At the same time, America's immigration enforcement is the least amount  ever. And to that point, the Biden administration seems to think  everything is going just fine.   Yesterday, the Secretary of Homeland Security testified before  Congress. I was on a conference call with him the day before, where he  met with a number of the Members of the Republican leadership. What the  Secretary said yesterday is this. He said:         We have effectively managed an unprecedented number of non-      citizens seeking to enter the United States.    ``Effectively managed?''   To me, this is an early candidate for the fact checkers' ``lie of the  year.'' They haven't effectively managed anything. The only thing they  have effectively managed to do is erase the border completely.   The men and women on our Border Patrol are working around the clock.  They are heroes, although they have been vilified by the President of  the United States. This crisis is happening because Joe Biden's  policies have tied the hands of the border agents. They are being both  abused and disrespected by this President and this administration.   On Joe Biden's first day in office, he stopped all construction of  the border wall. He ended the successful ``Remain in Mexico'' policy.  In fact, just last week, his lawyers were pleading a case before the  Supreme Court to eliminate a policy that protects the national security  of our Nation.   Joe Biden is now ending title 42. People at home say: What exactly is  this title 42? Well, it is a section of our laws that deal with public  health. At the start of the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control  closed our border to people from coronavirus-impacted areas. So this  title 42 decision by the administration likely, at that point, saved  thousands of American lives; it protected our public health; it helped  our Border Patrol bring down illegal immigration.   Last July, Joe Biden tried to end title 42. He said coronavirus was  over; it was behind him. He was patting himself on the back for the  great job he had done. And then the Delta variant hit the country like  a sledgehammer. Joe Biden and the administration were caught by  surprise. People looking for testing were running into long lines,  empty shelves. He and the administration were caught completely off  guard as has this administration on so many things--on the border; on  the failure in Afghanistan; on inflation, which they said was going to  be temporary and transitory, month after month after month.   The administration showed they have no core competence to run this  Nation. By September of last year, the Biden administration was forced  to admit that one in every five illegal immigrants coming to this  country was bringing disease with them. That is tens of thousands of  illegal immigrants bringing disease into a country each month.   But now Joe Biden wants to end title 42 forever and do it on May 23.  If it ends, we are told and believe that this will cause a tidal wave  of illegal immigration like this Nation has never seen before. Right  now, Homeland Security is preparing for up to 18,000 illegal immigrants  each and every day after title 42 ends. That is half a million people a  month. That is a population equal to the entire population of the State  of Wyoming. Mr. President, I assume the State of Maine--I don't know  the exact population--but if you bring in half a million people a day,  it doesn't take too many days to add up to the population of the State  of Maine.   So what are Democrats saying about this? Well, Barack Obama's  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, whom we met with regularly  when he was in that position--he once said 1,000 a day would overwhelm  the system. Joe Biden seems pretty happy with 18,000 a day. Right now,  we are at 6,000 a day.   We have a system that is overwhelmed and it is going to get a lot,  lot worse. Joe Biden could triple the number of illegal immigrants  overnight to 18,000 a day come May 23.    Earlier this month, former Secretary Jeh Johnson, whom I alluded to  earlier--this is what he said. He said the current crisis trends are  unsustainable. He said it overwhelms communities in Texas and Arizona;  it overwhelms the Border Patrol. This is Barack Obama's Secretary of  Homeland Security saying that. I believe Secretary Jeh Johnson is  right.   Recently, the head of the Del Rio, TX, Border Patrol union--and my  colleague from Texas is on the floor here, the senior Senator--this  head of the  [[Page S2207]]  Del Rio, TX, Border Patrol union spoke here on Capitol Hill. He said  there are some days in Del Rio when officers are so busy with  transportation and processing of these illegal immigrants that no one  is patrolling the border, the southern border of the United States.   And I am certain that the senior Senator, the distinguished Senator  from Texas--Senator Cornyn, who is on the floor--will address this  issue after I get finished speaking because he sees this every weekend,  as he is home in Texas and talks to people from Texas every day, the  crisis that is hitting his home State and is hitting this entire  Nation.   So this Del Rio sector covers an area of 240 miles of border. And the  head of Del Rio, TX, Border Patrol told us no one is patrolling that  section of the border because the personnel are too busy filling out  paperwork and moving illegal immigrants from location to location.   In Yuma, AZ, up to 90 percent of Border Patrol agents are busy with  transportation and caretaking duties. Ninety percent of their agents  cannot spend their time guarding the border. As a result, large  portions of the southern border in Arizona are wide open, which is why  I believe the junior Senator from Arizona is so vehemently opposing the  President of his own party for a reckless move by a President, who  seems to disregard the importance of even having a border to our  Nation.   Media reports show that 60,000 people right now are waiting at our  southern border. They are counting down the days until title 42 is  over. Some of them will bring in drugs, some will be human traffickers,  some of them may even be on the Terror Watch List. If you are a foreign  terrorist on the Terror Watch List, this is a dream come true if you  are trying to get to America.   On May 23, we will face a humanitarian crisis, a public health  crisis, and a national security crisis all in one greater--much greater  than the one we are facing today and is already terrifying Americans in  every State because with an open border, every State is a border State,  every city is a sanctuary city, and people are subjected to the drugs  and the crime that is coming with it and the deaths that are coming as  well.   Now, many Democrats are asking and telling Joe Biden: Keep title 42  in place. Yet these same Democrats, they voted in lockstep with Chuck  Schumer and Joe Biden the last 15 months. They understand today that  Joe Biden's policy is unwise and very unpopular. But these are the same  Democrats who came to the floor and voted to stop building the border  wall; the same Democrats who in this very Chamber voted to give  stimulus checks--send out checks to illegal immigrants when they voted  last year. Not one of those Democrats joined us in supporting title 42  last summer.   Democrats can run for reelection, but they cannot run from their  records. They voted for the Biden border agenda, and every Democrat  shares the blame for this crisis.   What happens if the border doesn't stay at the border? No, it makes  each one of us less safe. Border Patrol tells us they have caught, so  far, 42 terrorists trying to cross the border since Joe Biden took  office. How many got away? We are hearing the numbers getting away is  60,000 a month--getaways. How many of those are terrorists who are now  living in our midst?   Federal narcotics agents say that the vast majority of illegal drugs  in this country came here over our southern border. That is how they  are getting in. Drug overdoses have never been higher than they are  right now. One hundred thousand Americans died of drug overdoses last  year. People are dying every day in every State because of drugs being  brought in across the southern border by the lax border policies of Joe  Biden and the Democrats.   If title 42 ends, it is going to mean more drugs, more crime, more  death in all of our States. Even the Washington Post newspaper--their  editorial board, that is not known for being conservative or lining up  with conservatives--this is what they recently said:         A migrant surge is coming at the border--and Biden is not       ready.    All of America knows that. They know Biden is not ready. He is not  ready to be President, not ready to run the economy, not ready to help  with the military, not ready on any level, and at the border, the  Washington Post points out he is not ready.   The article went on and said:         The predictable effect of lifting Title 42 is a new influx       of migrants . . . which would compound an existing surge at       the . . . border . . . for weeks or much longer.    The Washington Post points out and predicts:         Absent progress on [addressing the root causes], the Biden       administration . . . will surely face more chaos at the       border.    This is an administration of chaos. The Washington Post--that was my  addition. They ended by saying ``more chaos at the border.'' I am  adding ``an administration of chaos.''   Look, the Post is exactly right. This crisis is 100 percent  preventable. It is a crisis of Joe Biden's choosing and Joe Biden's  making. It is a crisis that is entirely the result of Democrats'  reckless open border policies. We need to go back to policies that  work.   I ask the President to keep title 42 in place. Listen to the  Democrats who are talking to you in addition to us, Mr. President, who  say keep title 42 in place.   And enforce the laws on the books, close the loopholes that encourage  illegal immigration, finish the wall, bring back the ``Remain in  Mexico'' policy; we know it works.   The American people in every State are pleading with Joe Biden. Only  about one in three Americans support the President's policy at the  border, two-thirds don't. Overwhelming numbers oppose what this  President is doing to this country in terms of how he is affecting the  economy, inflation, energy prices, and the border. This is a President  with record low numbers on all of those areas, and it is all of his own  doing and his own making. Mr. President, do not make this, your own  border crisis, even worse.   I yield the floor.
