 Madam President, for years American administrations of  both parties have properly labeled Iran as the world's most active  state sponsor of terrorism. This assessment is based on the cold hard  facts of Tehran's behavior.   Iran's support for terrorism knows few bounds, sectarian or  geographic. Iran has provided support to Sunni, Shia, and secular  terrorists. It has conducted or sponsored attacks around the world,  including a plot right here in Washington, during the Obama  administration, to blow up a local restaurant and kill the Saudi  Ambassador to the United States.   We know that Tehran is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of  American servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan--Americans murdered by  Iran's proxies. So while it should be shocking that Iran is now  conducting more attacks against civilian shipping vessels in  international waters, unfortunately, it really isn't all that shocking.  This is the kind of behavior we have witnessed over the years.   Until recently, the United States spent years failing to hold Iran  sufficiently accountable for its terrorism, proxies, and ``gray zone''  tactics. Tehran was emboldened to tread all over international law.   Now things are different, and Iran's corrupt, moribund economy is  feeling the pressure of U.S. sanctions. So it is not surprising that  the mullahs now resort to their favorite tool--violence.   The President has said he does not seek conflict with Iran, and  neither does the Senate. Nevertheless, the risks of a conflict are  real. But make no mistake. They are being driven by Tehran's decision  to resort to violence, and that includes what the Secretary of State  has described as a ``blatant assault'' on international shipping,  threatening the freedom of navigation in international waters.   Tehran must not be rewarded for terror and intimidation. The United  States and our partners need to stand firm and apply concerted,  coordinated diplomatic and economic pressure until Tehran changes its  behavior.    Acting Secretary Shanahan, at the request of his military commanders,  has ordered additional forces to the Middle East for purposes of  defense and deterrence. As he made clear when announcing this  deployment, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran.   I support these prudent efforts to respond to Iranian intimidation.  Defensive military deployments will help us to protect American  interests in the region and deter Iranian aggression. I encourage the  administration to continue working closely with our partners across the  globe to encourage Iran's leaders to cease their aggression.   I hope Iran's leaders will listen to the demands of their people, who  continue to protest against the stifling authoritarianism of the  Islamic Republic for a better, more prosperous, more peaceful life.   I also appreciate the administration's efforts to keep Congress  apprised of the latest intelligence, deployments, and  [[Page S3632]]  diplomatic efforts. I understand committee staff received a classified  briefing just yesterday. I look forward to hearing from the State  Department's top career diplomat at the Republican lunch today. I hope  my colleagues across the aisle rethink their decision to turn down his  offer to brief them. I understand the administration will be sending up  interagency teams this week to brief the oversight committees in a  classified setting, as well.   For our part, the Senate will consider several measures in the coming  days that will directly impact our presence and influence in this  troubled region, including arms sales to key regional partners, as well  as the NDAA. I urge every one of my colleagues to keep these deadly  serious developments at the top of our minds as we attend to our  business in the days ahead.                            ____________________     Madam President, last week I spoke about the people's  uprising in Hong Kong. Over the past several days, millions of  residents have taken to the streets to defend their autonomy and the  rule of law from continued encroachment of the communist government of  mainland China.   After days of tension, this past weekend brought some good news. In a  sign that the people's demonstrations had sent a clear message, Hong  Kong officials now said that the government will suspend consideration  of the proposed ``extradition'' bill indefinitely.   The fate of Hong Kong and its special status is a subject I have  watched carefully for decades. Early on in my Senate tenure, I  introduced the legislation that still governs our relationship with  Hong Kong, the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which President Bush  41 signed into law. On the day I introduced that legislation, I said it  was heartening to see that ``democracy is finally gaining a tenuous  foot hold in Hong Kong.''   Well, the nearly 30 years since then have shown us all just what the  people of Hong Kong can do when the terms of their independence and  freedom are respected. We have seen Hong Kong thrive, in large measure  due to the political and economic freedoms and stable rule of law that  Hong Kong's special status has enabled, but we have also seen clearly  in recent days that freedom's foothold in the shadow of mainland China  is not a given. It remains tenuous even now.   I wanted to again express my admiration for the people of Hong Kong  and their strong but peaceful response to this proposed encroachment. I  am glad to see their leaders respect their willingness to stand their  ground, and I hope the city's authorities will continue to respect the  clear will of the people on these issues moving forward.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a related subject, all of these  events I have discussed, from Iran's misbehavior to China's  aggressiveness, underscore one thing very clearly: The United States  needs to remain engaged, prepared, and powerful.   We need to leave zero doubt among our friends and allies, our most  violent foes, and everybody in between that while the United States  does not seek conflict, we must be prepared to decisively defeat our  adversaries if conflict is forced upon us. That is called deterrence.   The growing global unrest should be a lesson to us as the Senate gets  ready to turn to the National Defense Authorization Act later this  week. I know my colleagues on both sides share my hope that this year's  NDAA can build on the successes of the past 2 years.   Our first obligation to the American people is to ensure for their  defense. It is essential that we continue rebuilding our military by  authorizing sufficient support to modernize and sustain the advantages  that America's all-voluntary Armed Forces have over our adversaries.   Working with the Trump administration in recent years, we have been  able to end a chapter of harmful spending cuts that have left military  leaders less able to address emerging challenges. As a result, last  year's legislation--named for our dear colleague, the late John  McCain--authorized the largest year-on-year increase in defense  spending in 15 years.   The bill introduced last week is a step further toward implementing  our important new national defense strategy, toward renewing the  readiness and lethality of our forces, and toward making sure that we  never ask brave American men and women to step into harm's way without  all possible tools and training to help them succeed. This crucial  legislation has a chance to be a major bipartisan success story of this  Congress. It is already off to an encouraging start, having been voted  out of the Armed Services Committee by an overwhelming bipartisan  margin.   And it is easy to see why. As great-power competitors like Russia and  China continue to challenge U.S. interests, this NDAA will help to  maintain and expand our alliances and partnerships, along with our  ability to stand firm.   The bill puts readiness front and center. In recent decades, our most  formidable competitors have taken every opportunity to deploy new  technological threats. Keeping American and allied servicemembers out  of harm's way means keeping up with these developments and outpacing  them.   The bill takes steps to expand oversight and increase efficiency at  the Pentagon. It honors the tremendous sacrifices made by  servicemembers and their families by securing the largest pay raise in  a decade, along with several other important reforms.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter. I want to  celebrate another legislative accomplishment the Senate notched last  week.   On Thursday, the Senate passed the Taxpayer First Act and sent it to  President Trump's desk to become law. This legislation is the most  thorough package of reforms to the Internal Revenue Service in 20  years.   Let me say that again. The Senate just passed the most significant  reforms to the IRS in two decades. It will create a new, independent  process for appeals to ensure taxpayers receive fair treatment. During  dispute resolutions, taxpayers will now get access to the same  information the IRS has.   There will be more accountability within the IRS when it comes to  cyber security, careful management of technology, and overall  efficiency. There will be a new streamlined system for addressing  identity theft. There will be better procedures for advance  notification in the event of an audit or an asset seizure, and there  will be new steps to make it easier to file your taxes and supporting  documents online.   So this is a significant accomplishment. These reforms will make one  of the least appealing annual tasks for hard-working Americans a little  bit less painful.   A year and a half ago, the Republican Members of this body joined  with House Republicans and President Trump to deliver historic tax cuts  and tax reform to the American people. Middle-class families, parents,  small business owners, farmers, and job creators across the Nation are  keeping more of what they earn and sending less to the IRS.   Now, thanks to this latest achievement, the IRS will be just a little  bit easier to deal with as well.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent the Senate stand in recess  following the remarks of myself, Senator Collins, and Senator King.    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize a  remarkable event that this institution was fortunate enough to witness  just a few minutes ago. During the vote we just concluded, our  distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, cast her  7,000th rollcall vote. It is a great milestone for Senator Collins  which bears witness to her dedication to this work and most especially  to the people of Maine. It is actually even more impressive than that.  This wasn't just Senator Collins' 7,000th vote; it was her 7,000th  consecutive vote. From the moment she was sworn in, she has not missed  a single vote. Difficulties with travel or bad weather? She plans  around them. Personal challenges? She adapts and overcomes. Other  priorities, like political events or speaking engagements? All that  takes a back seat to her day job. No sick days. No getting caught in  meetings. No losing track of time in committee. No excuses. Just days  and months and years of peerless preparation and remarkable dedication  to her Senate duties and to the Members she is so proud to represent.  Senator Collins learned from her parents, Donald and Patricia, who each  had a turn as mayor of Caribou, ME, among other achievements.   We know our friend Senator Collins deeply admires her predecessor,  Senator Margaret Chase Smith--another legendary Maine Republican. Among  her achievements, she stood boldly against McCarthyism and insisted on  independent thought and fair treatment. But as remarkable as Senator  Margaret Chase Smith was, Senator Collins has surpassed her  distinguished predecessor in at least one way: Senator Smith's own  impressive string of consecutive votes ended just shy of 3,000; Senator  Collins has 7,000 and counting.   She is always prepared, always thoroughly well informed, and always  present. That is what today's milestone tells us, and that is exactly  who Senator Collins is every single day. She is a valued colleague. She  is a friend. And frankly, she is an inspiration. Thank goodness she  isn't stopping any time soon.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    For the information of all Senators, at 3:30 p.m. on  Wednesday, June 19, the Senate will vote on confirmation of the  following nominations in the order listed, and if confirmed, the  motions to reconsider shall be considered made and laid upon the table  and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action:  Executive Calendar Nos. 22, 28, 50, and 118. Under the previous order,  the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to S. 1790 will ripen  following disposition of Executive Calendar No. 118.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, all of God's children are blessed  with certain gifts, and we are each called to put them to work to  glorify Him. Today, it is my sincere privilege to pay tribute to my  friend who has answered this call and used his considerable gifts with  compassion and grace. At the end of May, Dave Stone stepped down as the  senior pastor of Southeast Christian Church in Louisville, KY. I would  like to take a moment to honor his years of pastoral leadership and to  sincerely thank him for his care and dedication to our church family.   Elaine and I have been attending Southeast for nearly two decades,  drawn by the moving preaching and the warm community. Dave has been an  integral part of that spiritual life for 30 years, and there are so  many of us in Louisville who have been made better by his friendship  and leadership. Throughout his 13 years as senior pastor, Dave was our  shepherd and used his many talents to point tens of thousands to the  Lord.   When Dave first joined Southeast, his devotion to Christ and His  church instantly became clear. Dave came not only with an inspirational  vision, but also with a deep sense of humility. To anyone who walked  into this church, he made a point to welcome them like a lifelong  friend. In both the easy and the difficult times, Dave shared his sense  of joy in everything he did for the church. His warmth and humor made a  positive and tangible impact on me and many other members.   Dave assumed the responsibility of senior pastor after the retirement  of Bob Russell, who had served the church community in leadership roles  for 40 years. The next year, Southeast announced the establishment of a  second location, a remarkable sign of growth and a testament to Dave's  leadership. Southeast has continued adding more campuses to the church,  and now it reaches believers on TV, on the radio, and at seven  locations. Through this development, Southeast has become the largest  church in Kentucky and the seventh largest in the entire country.   Southeast's impressive growth also brought more responsibilities for  Dave, his team, and his family. Whatever challenge presented itself  over the years, Dave's skilled ministry helped the community thrive.  Thousands of people have watched Dave preach, relied on his mentorship,  and enjoyed his friendship.   Dave admitted that he hates the word ``retirement,'' but he also knew  it was time to pass the baton. When he announced his departure, Dave  expressed his deep gratitude to the church leadership, staff, and all  the faithful. He once again showed himself the humble pastor who  fulfilled his mission from God.   Now that he has officially stepped down as Southeast's senior pastor,  Dave is looking for his next calling. I am confident he will continue  using his many gifts to draw the faithful to the Lord. He will also get  to spend more time with his wife Beth, his children, and his  grandchildren. Although Elaine and I will certainly miss his Christian  spirit and good humor, we wish Dave and his family all the best on  their next adventure.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
