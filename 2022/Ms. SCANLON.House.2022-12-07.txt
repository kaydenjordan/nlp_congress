 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1510 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1510         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       8404) to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure       respect for State regulation of marriage, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider       in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a       motion offered by the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary       or his designee that the House concur in the Senate       amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their       respective designees. The previous  [[Page H8808]]       question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its       adoption without intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, the Committee on Rules met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 1510, providing for consideration of the Senate amendment to  H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act. The rule makes in order a  motion offered by the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary that the  House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 8404 and provides 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of Committee on the Judiciary.   Mr. Speaker, tonight's rule provides for the consideration of the  Respect for Marriage Act, and I am proud to support this rule to move  that bill to the floor.   The Respect for Marriage Act will repeal the discriminatory Defense  of Marriage Act once and for all and ensure that all across America,  families in same-sex and interracial marriage are afforded the respect  and legal rights and protections they deserve.   Passage of this bill is a critical step to protect the rights and  freedoms of all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation or  race, following the Supreme Court's recent decision in Dobbs v. Jackson  Women's Health Organization. That decision and recent statements by the  Supreme Court's new rightwing majority have left families across the  country and in my district worried about the future of marriage  equality.   The Respect for Marriage Act will ensure long-term stability and  important statutory protection for all marriages. The Respect for  Marriage Act will safeguard the protections laid out in Obergefell v.  Hodges, as well as prior case law, that protect important fundamental  privacy and liberty rights, all of which were improperly called into  question in the Dobbs decision and related dicta.   This is a matter of respecting the fundamental rights, freedoms, and  liberties of our neighbors, family members, and fellow citizens.  Everyone should have the right to marry the person they love and live  free from discrimination, regardless of where in this great land they  live or travel.   In addition to securing the respect for those marriages, this bill  will also secure respect for families across America and in all of our  communities and families.   The issues addressed by this bill have been thoroughly debated in  this body, in the Senate, and by the American public. The Respect for  Marriage Act will ensure long-term stability and important statutory  protections for all.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  commonsense legislation and to reaffirm the fundamental right to  marriage equality.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, families in my community are justly skeptical of process  arguments which have been regularly weaponized to roll back the rights,  the freedoms, the liberties that they so richly deserve to exercise. So  I think at this point, there has been plenty of process. There has been  amendment process in both Chambers, and it is time to pass this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, we believe that the  gentleman's amendment is both duplicative and unnecessary.   The Senate spent months crafting a bipartisan compromise to amend  H.R. 8404 to address the religious liberty concerns that were raised by  Republicans in the House and Senate. Sections 6 and 7 of this  legislation ensure no impact on religious liberty.   Adopting this new and unnecessary amendment would unsettle the  Senate's carefully crafted compromise and delay the enactment of this  necessary, historic, and bipartisan legislation.   If the House passes this legislation, it will be sent straight to the  President's desk to become law. This Congress is coming to a close, and  we don't have the time to make changes to this legislation.   This bill has gone through both the House and Senate and through the  American public, and I believe it needs to be signed into law as soon  as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of this  legislation from the Interfaith Alliance, from U.S. Jewish  organizations, and from eight leaders of faith-based organizations  representing tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of religious  institutions.                                                  November 28, 2022.      Hon. Tammy Baldwin,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Dirksen Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Baldwin and Collins: The Respect for Marriage       Act is a simple way to provide legal stability for all       married couples and their families. Within our communities,       we approach matters of marriage, family, and identity       differently. This bill recognizes this diversity of belief       while ensuring that same-sex and interracial couples are       treated with equal respect by federal and state governments.        As faith-based organizations, we recognize that the First       Amendment right to religious freedom is a cornerstone of our       democracy. The bipartisan substitute amendment provides       important clarification around the interaction between the       Respect for Marriage Act and the robust religious freedom       protections guaranteed under federal law. Crafted in the       spirit of collaboration, the amendment protects the right to       believe as we choose while leaving intact the core mission of       the legislation to respect marriages.        The freedom to marry who one loves is a matter of human       dignity and supported by a majority of almost every major       religious tradition in the United States. We urge the Senate       to adopt the bipartisan amendment in full, without further       amendment needed to protect religious freedom.            Respectfully,        Interfaith Alliance, ADL (The Anti-Defamation League), Bend       the Arc: Jewish Action, Center for Faith, Justice, and       Reconciliation, The Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran       Church in America, Faithful America, Hindu American       Foundation, Hindus for Human Rights, Jewish Women       International, Keshet.

U.S. Jewish Organizations' Letter to Senate Supporting Respect for                                Marriage Act         On behalf of the Union for Reform Judaism, Keshet, and 108       additional Jewish organizations, the following letter was       shared in support of the Respect for Marriage Act (S. 4556):        Dear Senator:  On behalf of the 100 undersigned national,       state, and local Jewish organizations, we write to express       our support for the Respect for Marriage Act (S. 4556).       Driven by our Jewish values, we are committed to supporting       laws that protect the civil rights and individual liberties       of all people. The Respect for Marriage Act would codify       three landmark Supreme Court cases, Obergefell v. Hodges;       Windsor v. United States; and Loving v. Virginia, and       therefore the basic rights of same-sex and interracial       marriage. We urge Congress to swiftly pass this important       bill.        Jewish tradition teaches that all people are created       b'tzelem Elohim, in the Divine image, and are worthy of       dignity and respect. As organizations grounded in Jewish       values and beliefs, we have an ethical and moral       responsibility to fight for a society that ensures the       humanity of all people. Every person is entitled to marry who       they love--regardless of sexual orientation or race.        Indeed, support for same-sex marriage protections extends       across the faith community, and throughout the country. A       majority of all faith groups--including 77 percent of Jews,       57 percent of mainline Protestants, and 57 percent of       Catholics support same sex marriage. This view is shared by       seven in ten Americans--including 83 percent of Democrats, 73       percent of independents, and 55 percent of Republicans.        Additionally, the Respect for Marriage Act would ensure       that all federal benefits are available to married couples       regardless of the state in which they live. Congress has a       responsibility to pursue economic equity for all, regardless       of geographical location, and include historically       marginalized groups in this pursuit.        The right to marry who one loves is a matter of human       dignity. Our faith teaches us the kol yisrael arevim ezh       bazeh, we are all responsible for each other, and therefore       must take action to create a community for which we all can       take pride.        As Jewish organizations, we believe firmly that all people       deserve the right to marry who they love, regardless of       sexual orientation or race. We urge Congress to pass the       Respect for Marriage Act.

Re The Respect for Marriage Act (H.R. 8404)      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC 20515        Dear Senators: We are leaders of faith-based organizations       representing tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of       religious institutions. All our organizations hold to an       understanding of marriage as between one man and one woman.       Many of us privately expressed concerns about the House-      passed version of the Respect for Marriage Act.        We are gratified by the substitute religious freedom       language offered by Senators Collins, Baldwin, Sinema,       Portman, Tillis, and Romney. It adequately protects the core       religious freedom concerns raised by the bill, including tax       exempt status, educational funding, government grants and       contracts, and eligibility for licenses, certification, and       accreditation. If passed, it would continue to build on the       congressional wisdom represented by the Religious Freedom       Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA).        Attached are many statements from individual organizations.            Sincerely,      Elder Jack N.

Tim Schultz,        President, 1st Amendment Partnership.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have one additional speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I would again inquire whether my colleague  has any further testimony.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, tonight's vote should be an easy one. The Respect for  Marriage Act passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support, and the  bill is supported by over 70 percent of Americans. It provides critical  safeguards for a right that many Americans have already exercised and  rely upon for the protection and prosperity of their families.   The Respect for Marriage Act is historic legislation to protect the  marriages of same-sex and interracial couples. I don't think history  will look kindly on those who, when given the  [[Page H8811]]  ability to protect the rights and freedoms of their constituents, chose  to say no.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the LGBTQ community, my cousins, my dearest  friends and neighbors, religious communities across the country, and,  of course, the city of brotherly love and sisterly affection, which I  am so proud to represent, I stand in strong support of the Respect for  Marriage Act, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  rule and the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
