 Mr. Speaker, my message to the American people affected by  the crisis is simple: Help is on the way.   This is not a perfect bill, and I am concerned about the $2 trillion  price tag. But the American people need help, and this response to the  present crisis will put money into the pockets of struggling workers  and families. This response provides help for small business owners who  are the lifeblood of our economy, and we are responding to rising  healthcare needs with more supplies and financial aid for our  struggling hospitals.   I will cast a ``yes'' vote for this package in support of the medical  personnel on the front lines of this current crisis. That includes  heroes like the more than 200 medical personnel from the Fort Campbell  Military Base in my district who are in New York to provide medical  support.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill to help repair the damage caused by  the coronavirus to our workers and small businesses, but any additional  relief measures must focus on assisting Main Street businesses and  working Americans.
