 Mr. President, for 20 years now, I have come to this  floor hundreds of times to speak on behalf of the DREAM Act, which I  introduced long ago. During that period of time, I have had an  occasional vote. I have not been successful in making it the law of the  land.   The closest I came was about 8 years ago, when we had the  comprehensive immigration reform bill. Four Democratic Senators and  four Republican Senators--and I was among them--worked for months to  try to address our immigration system. We came up with an agreement  that was no mean feat. It is a complex area of law. It is a  controversial area of law. It is an area of law that changes almost by  the day, and we were trying to find a solution to all the challenges it  presents.   To think that we are a nation of immigrants and, then, to reflect on  our history on immigration is to leave one puzzled.   Most of the time we have been against immigration, despite the  arrival of good people on our borders. Occasionally, when we were  building a transcontinental railroad, we would invite people from China  in to take the backbreaking jobs, only to categorically exclude them  from immigration in the meantime. It is hard to explain, understand, or  appreciate where we stand on immigration.   When I hear the Republican leader come to the floor and criticize  President Obama for DACA, I have to say that it is personal to me. I  was writing letters to President Biden, my former Senate colleague from  Illinois, begging him to do just that, and he did.   In creating DACA, he gave the Dreamers a fighting chance, and more  than 800,000 of them came forward. These were young people who were  brought to the United States as toddlers and infants and children, not  because of a personal decision but a family decision. They grew up  here, went to school here, and believed they were a part of this  country, only to learn in a quiet moment of honesty from their parents  that they didn't have the necessary paperwork and they had to be extra  careful or face deportation.   I thought that was a heartbreaking conclusion for their time in  America and introduced the Dream Act. And when we could not pass it, I  asked President Obama to do what he could to help, and he did. I thank  him for it still to this day.   But DACA, if it was stretching Executive power, was certainly  reflective of where the American people are on this issue. No  apologies; the American people don't hold these young children now  grown responsible for their family's decision. They want to give them a  chance. They want to give them a chance to earn their legal status, to  earn a path to citizenship. No apologies here; these are wonderful  young people who make America a better country, and we need them to be  a part of our future.   So for those who come to the floor critical of DACA, I just tell you:  Take a couple of minutes and meet these young people. I have come to  the floor over a hundred times telling their personal stories. They are  a great source of pride, not just for me but for this Nation.   Now we face problems on our border--and we have for some time--and  they are challenges that are very real. Mr. Mayorkas has taken over as  the head of the Department of Homeland Security. He is a person I  willingly and anxiously support for that job. He has a personal family  story of immigration, but, more importantly, he has a depth of  experience that is almost impossible to find in other places.   He has tried to come together with the leaders in Central America to  fashion a plan for order on the border, and it is difficult. It is true  that larger numbers are coming to the border at this time. The Senator  from Kentucky said earlier that they believe they have a right to break  Federal law. I couldn't disagree with him more. They are presenting  themselves at the border under the law of asylum in the United States  so that they can be judged as to whether or not they are eligible to  come into this country. That is the process, but it has broken down  because the numbers presenting themselves at the border and the backlog  of cases, more than a million cases pending.   We don't have enough judges. We don't have a procedure that is  sensible and humane. We need all of that, and it is not going to happen  the day after tomorrow. Part of it depends on us. It is one thing to  come to the floor and lament the situation of immigration in our  country. It is another to roll up your sleeves and say: Let's do it;  let's solve it on a bipartisan basis. And it is certainly an imperative  in a 50-50 Senate that any immigration legislation be done on a  bipartisan basis.   I stand ready to do that as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and  I think colleagues on the Republican side agree with me. As tough as it  may be, we need to tackle these issues and not ignore them as they have  been ignored during the last 4 years. That is going to call for some  cooperation and some compromise on both sides, but we owe it to our  country to do the right thing to make our immigration system sensible,  logical, and fair.   I don't want to go back to those moments under the Trump  administration of zero tolerance, where over 2,000 children were  forcibly removed from their parents, sent into a bureaucratic ``Never  Never Land'' and then were only reunited--and not all of them have  been--those who were reunited were because of a Federal court order  calling on the Trump administration to do it.   They cast those children adrift in the bureaucracy. It wasn't until  the Federal court demanded that they be reinstated with their families  that it happened--in most instances but not in all of them. So we have  a lot of work to do, and I hope we can do it on a bipartisan basis. We  need to do it as quickly as we can on a bipartisan basis.                      56th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday    Mr. President, I was a college student in town here at Georgetown  University, and I can remember it well. You have a lot of time to talk  with your roommates about things that you might just do with your life  and things that you should do, even as a student. I remember that week  before the march on Selma, there was a serious conversation among my  roommates as to whether we ought to pack up and head to Selma, AL, to  join in the march. We were serious about it. We thought about it, but,  in the end, it fell through. Too many classes would be cut and jobs we  wouldn't be attending to, and we decided at the last minute it just  wasn't practical at all for us to do it. I regret that decision to this  day. I wish I had been there, even if I were in the back of the line,  to say I was part of that day in history.   It was 56 years ago last Sunday, some 600 civil rights activists, 56  years ago, were kneeling in prayer outside the Brown Chapel AME Church  in Selma. Leading them was our dearly departed friend--and I know he  was the Presiding Officer's friend as well--and former colleague John  Lewis. As they stood up outside the church, they formed two rows and  began a silent, orderly march toward Montgomery, AL. We all remember  that photo of John Lewis coming over that bridge in his tan raincoat  and his backpack.   As the civil rights activists reached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they  were met by a phalanx of State troopers and armed vigilantes. They  wielded cattle prods, billy clubs, shotguns, and other makeshift  weapons. We all know what happened next. Today, that violence is  remembered as ``Bloody Sunday.''   What some may not know is what happened the night before that march.  The county sheriff in Selma, Jim Clark, had issued a call to arms. He  ordered White men in the area to join troopers in Selma, and he  deputized those people to help stop the march. They answered the call,  lining up by the hundreds alongside the State troopers.   John Lewis and his fellow patriots were not going to be intimidated.  They  [[Page S1438]]  stood tall. They bore the brunt of racist violence, and they did so  with a solemn purpose: They wanted to build a more perfect union in  this country, to make sure every voice is heard in our democracy.   Days later, with the brutal scenes from Selma fresh in the minds of  America, President Lyndon Johnson urged Congress to pass the Voting  Rights Act. That August, he signed the bill into law. It is hard to  imagine, isn't it? In the same year he proposed it, we actually saw  Congress pass the law. That is what happened in the good old days. His  law fundamentally changed our Republic for the better, but our work  remains far from over.   Last weekend also marked the anniversary of another tragic moment in  our Nation's history, far more recent than Bloody Sunday. It was 2  months ago--2 months ago on January 6 that a violent mob stormed  through the halls of this Capitol Building. Like the vigilantes in  Selma, they, too, were answering a call to arms--except this one wasn't  issued by a county sheriff; it was issued by the former President of  the United States, Donald Trump. The failed insurrection of January 6  not only left five people dead, but, like Bloody Sunday, it left a  permanent stain on our Nation's history.   Make no mistake, no more than half a century stands between these two  dark days for democracy. They are part of the same thread that sadly  has run through American history: racism--racism weaponized to deny  full citizenship to Black and Brown Americans.   The mob violence that we personally witnessed on January 6 in this  building was not an aberration; it was the continuation of a sad  chapter in our history. For months, former President Trump had sowed  doubt about the legitimacy of the election. He claimed that it was  stolen from him. ``Stop the steal,'' they chanted. We know that  President Trump's claims have no basis in reality. Just 2 days ago, the  Supreme Court finally dismissed the last remaining case brought by  Trump supporters to push the big lie. The Supreme Court didn't buy it.  In fact, no court bought it.   The former President has never let facts stand in his way, has he? In  fact, he claims to know exactly where this supposed fraud transpired,  cities like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Detroit-- coincidentally, cities with large populations of Black and Brown  voters. This is no coincidence. President Trump and his enablers  believe they were entitled to victory because they don't think that  every American should have an equal vote in our democracy.   President Trump's efforts to overturn the election are just the most  recent example of a decades-long movement to suppress voters of color.   I have spoken on this floor before about investigations I conducted  as chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human rights of the  Senate Judiciary. I took the show on the road. I traveled to Ohio and  Florida, where lawmakers at that time were considering making it more  difficult to vote, requiring IDs, and this was before the Supreme  Court's disastrous decision in Shelby County.   That ruling opened the floodgates. It allowed a number of State  legislatures to enact discriminatory restrictions on voting that would  no longer require approval from the Department of Justice. That  decision was a repudiation of the sacrifice John Lewis and his fellow  patriots made on Bloody Sunday.   We must learn from our history, whether it was 56 years ago or just 2  months ago, and we must recognize that the fundamental right to vote is  still under attack. Just last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments  in a case that could further fracture the Voting Rights Act by limiting  the effectiveness of a provision that allows voters to challenge  discriminatory restrictions. Lawmakers in 43 States have already  introduced more than 250 bills this year to restrict voting access   This book, ``One Person, No Vote,'' was written by Carol Anderson, a  professor at Emory University in Atlanta. I read her first book,  ``White Rage,'' contacted her, and we are friends. I think her analysis  of Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Great Migration, and all that followed  is the most lucid presentation I have read about that chapter in  history.   In this book, she goes directly into the issue of voter suppression.  One of her observations is worth repeating on the floor of the Senate.  She refers to what is known in history as the Mississippi Plan. I will  read a few sentences from this book, as follows:         That became most apparent in 1890 when the Magnolia State       passed the Mississippi Plan, a dizzying array of poll taxes,       literacy tests, understanding clauses, newfangled voter       registration rules, and ``good character'' clauses--all       intentionally racially discriminatory but dressed up in the       genteel garb of bringing ``integrity'' to the voting booth.       This feigned legal innocence was legislative evil genius.        Virginia representative Carter Glass, like so many others,       swooned at the thought of bringing the Mississippi Plan to       his own state, especially after he saw how well it had       worked. He rushed to champion a bill in the legislature that       would ``eliminate the darkey as a political factor . . . in       less than five years.'' Glass, whom President Franklin       Roosevelt would one day describe as an ``unreconstructed       rebel,'' planned ``not to deprive a single white man of the       ballot, but [to] inevitably cut from the existing electorate       four-fifths of the Negro voters'' in Virginia.        One delegate questioned him: ``Will it not be done by fraud       and discrimination?''    Glass responded:         ``By fraud, no. By discrimination, yes,'' Glass retorted.       ``Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what we propose . .       . to discriminate to the very extremity . . . permissible . .       . under . . . the Federal Constitution, with a view to the       elimination of every negro voter who can be gotten rid of,       legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength       of the white electorate.''    In those days, they were very direct and honest about their ambitions  in voter suppression. What is the explanation these days?   If we don't believe that there was massive fraud--and there was not,  by any objective measure--in the 2020 election, why are so many  legislators in the business now of reducing the opportunity for  Americans to vote in their States? Why? If they can't sell an idea,  they just want to change the electorate, and perhaps that would lead to  victory, but at what cost?   The most enduring legacy of Bloody Sunday is the legislation that it  helped to inspire, the Voting Rights Act. We must now draw from this  moment in our history, a lesson to be realized, the promise of that  legislation: a full and vibrant democracy, made up of all Americans of  every color and creed.   We have an obligation not just to restore the Voting Rights Act but  to build on it, to make it stronger and more comprehensive.  Fortunately, President Joe Biden's administration has indicated it is  ready to do just that. Last Sunday, in honor of the 56th anniversary of  Bloody Sunday, President Biden signed an Executive order calling on the  Federal Government to make it easier for Americans to register to vote  and access the ballot box.   While this Executive order was a welcome announcement, we need to act  as well in Congress. As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a  cosponsor of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act in the last Congress, I  look forward to working to restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act  in the months ahead.   Though our friend and colleague is no longer with us today, his  legacy towers over us. We stand on his shoulders and those of all the  American heroes who bled on the streets of Selma in 1965 and long  after. We must carry on the fight for equality, and we can begin by  enacting a bill the House of Representatives passed last week, the For  the People Act.   This bill would prohibit voter roll purges, as we have seen in States  like Ohio and Georgia, and modernize and strengthen voter registration  systems and ballot access.   I would say to the other party: Don't be afraid of the voters. In  this democracy, they have the last word. Denying them the right to vote  is no way and no strategy for a great political party.   It would also help end the dominance of dark money in our political  system, including through establishing a small-donor public financing  system for congressional elections, based on my Fair Elections Now Act.   The For the People Act is a vital step toward repairing and improving  our democratic process. Passing it and the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act will provide critical tools in the fight to ensure that  all Americans can exercise their right to vote. These bills represent  the bold actions that Americans have been calling for. We must not  ignore that call.  [[Page S1439]]    In 2020, the American people turned out in historic numbers in the  election, but they also turned out in historic numbers in protests in  support of racial justice across America. John Lewis's march to  Montgomery never ended. It has taken on a new life, a new generation of  marchers, and more Americans than ever before are putting their feet to  the pavement.   It is time to finish the work of John Lewis and the heroes of the  civil rights movement. As we commemorate the 56th anniversary of Bloody  Sunday, we can do no less. With his eyes wide open, John Lewis marched  across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma knowing he was facing a  deadly, hateful crowd. They broke down his body, but they could not  defeat his spirit. The question we face today is whether John Lewis's  spirit still lives in us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 685         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) In General.--The Chair of the Council on Environmental       Quality, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture,       Commerce, and the Interior, the Chief of Engineers, and the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall--        (1) establish a target for carbon sequestration that can       reasonably be achieved through enhancing the ability of       public and private land and water to function as natural       carbon sinks;        (2) develop strategies for meeting that target; and        (3) develop strategies to expand protections for coastal       ecosystems that sequester carbon and provide resiliency       benefits, such as--        (A) flood protection;        (B) soil and beach retention;        (C) erosion reduction;        (D) biodiversity;        (E) water purification; and        (F) nutrient cycling.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to address  the teacher and school leader shortage in early childhood, elementary,  and secondary education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Finance.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 686         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Retaining Educators Takes       Added Investment Now Act'' or the ``RETAIN Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to create a refundable tax       credit for early childhood educators, teachers, early       childhood education program directors, school leaders, and       school-based mental health services providers in early       childhood, elementary, and secondary education settings that       rewards retention based on the time spent serving high-need       students.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The shortage of experienced, qualified early childhood       educators and elementary school and secondary school teachers       is a national problem that compromises the academic outcomes       and long-term success of students.        (2) The shortage is the result of many factors including       low pay, frequent turnover in school leadership, poor       teaching conditions, and inadequate teacher supports.        (3) The shortage is worse in high-poverty areas where the       factors contributing to the shortage are particularly acute       and have an increased negative impact on teachers of color       remaining in the field.        (4) A child's access to high-quality early childhood       education is critical to supporting positive outcomes, and       early childhood educators--        (A) play an important role in setting the foundation for       future learning, and        (B) promote the development of vital skills, habits, and       mindsets that children need to be successful in school and in       life.        (5) In 2019, the national median pay of early childhood       educators was a mere $30,520, with many early childhood       educators relying on government assistance programs such as       Medicaid, the supplemental nutrition assistance program       established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7       U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), or the temporary assistance for needy       families program established under part A of title IV of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and struggling       to provide for their own families.        (6) Studies have demonstrated that well-qualified,       experienced teachers are the single most important school-      based element contributing to a child's academic achievement       and success.        (7) In 2019, the average teacher salary in public       elementary schools and secondary schools was only $64,470,       which is on average 19.2 percent less than other college       graduates working in non-teaching fields, and with many       teachers struggling with large amounts of student loan debt.        (8) An experienced, well-qualified education workforce must       also be reflective of the diversity of the student body       across race, ethnicity, and disability.        (9) Experienced, well-qualified school leaders and school-      based mental health service providers are essential for       providing strong educational opportunities and services for       students and promoting teacher retention through improved       professional supports and teaching conditions.        (10) In 2020, surveys found nearly 27 percent of educators       were considering leaving teaching due to the COVID-19       pandemic, including 55 percent of teachers with more than 30       years of experience.
