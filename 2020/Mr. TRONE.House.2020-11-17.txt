 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support  my bill, the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act. This bill  directly addresses the country's worsening opioid crisis as we continue  to see overdose deaths surge during the COVID-19 pandemic.   This bipartisan bill authorizes $9 billion over 6 years in flexible  funding through grants for States and Tribes to fight the opioid  epidemic on the front lines.   This bill helps provide States the steady, sustained, and consistent  money they need for programs to: Prevent addiction through evidence- based programs;    Increase access to outpatient and residential treatment, particularly  through medication-assisted treatment;   Prevent overdoses by expanding naloxone distribution;   And support individuals in recovery with recovery housing and peer  supports.   Since 2000, there have been over 550,000 deaths from opioids, and the  CDC estimates the cost to our country is $78.5 billion per year. There  is no magic bullet to fix the opioid crisis. There will be no vaccine.  We need consistent funding to help save these lives.   Last year, nearly 71,000 people died from an overdose--the most ever.  The COVID-19 pandemic will push these numbers even higher.   In western Maryland, we have seen an increase of overdose deaths from  the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019 by 46 percent  up in Washington County, 50 percent up in Garrett County, and 54  percent up in Allegany County.   Across the country, over 40 States have reported an increase in  overdose deaths since the start of this pandemic. These numbers are  absolutely tragic and unacceptable. We must act.   Mr. Speaker, the opioid epidemic does not know the color of your  skin, where you live, or your political party. The opioid epidemic  destroys everything in its path.   It hit my family, too. On December 31, 2016, my nephew, Ian Jacob  Trone, died alone in a hotel room from a fentanyl overdose.                                time  1245    Ian was in recovery for 13 of the last 16 months of his life, but it  only took one moment to take him away from us forever.   Mr. Speaker, when I came to Congress, I spoke to the Governor of our  State, county and State leaders, hospital administrators, direct  providers,  [[Page H5811]]  and stakeholders across the country, from Georgia to Kentucky to North  Dakota. I spoke to treatment services across my district: Awakenings  Recovery in Hagerstown; Fort Recovery in Cumberland; Ideal Option in  Frederick; Wells/Robertson House in Montgomery County; and Brooke's  House in Hagerstown.   The message I heard from everyone was loud and clear: State, local,  and Tribal governments need the Federal Government to be a steady  partner in the fight against addiction.   I thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce, and the Energy Subcommittee on Health  Chairwoman Eshoo and Ranking Member Burgess, for considering this bill.   I also extend my sincere thanks to Freshmen Working Group on  Addiction members Kelly Armstrong, Mikie Sherrill, and Denver Riggleman  for helping me introduce this bill.   I want to take a moment to call out and thank Congressman Riggleman,  who has been a fantastic member of our working group and a champion on  this issue. He will be greatly missed in this institution.   Together, the Freshmen Working Group on Addiction has introduced over  50 bipartisan bills to address addiction and mental health in the last  2 years. We have shown what is possible if you put aside partisan  politics, focus on an issue, and work hard to make real change.   Investing in this bill's grants will save lives and save money.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
