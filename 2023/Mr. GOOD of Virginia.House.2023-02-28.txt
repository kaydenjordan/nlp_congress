 Mr. Speaker, today the House can repeal a  policy from the Department of Labor that harms Americans who simply  want to save for retirement.   This new rule from the Biden administration says that investment  decisions in employer-sponsored retirement plans can be based on  climate change and other environmental, social, or governance factors.   So typically without the knowledge of the retirees, their investment  funds can be invested in underperforming investments that subsidize  unreliable and unaffordable energy.   Congress never originally intended for 401Ks to be used to advance  the priorities of the phony climate movement or to push a social  justice agenda.   They were simply intended to help people to have the resources they  need in retirement. If ESG-based stocks are higher performing, they  would get those investment dollars anyway without this new rule.   But Americans inherently know that investing should be about  evaluating risk and return from a financial point of view.   Hardworking Americans want to know their investments have strong  economic fundamentals that will help them build wealth over a lifetime  of work.   If Congress is successful in overturning this rule, the investing  standard will return to one based on financial factors only.   It is bad enough that Bidenflation has eroded the spending power of  many retirement savings accounts. Matter of fact, the average  retirement account is down 30 percent over the last 2 years.   Many retirees are having to change their retirement plans or to  downsize or to work longer. There is even an increase in the number of  Americans who  [[Page H935]]  are borrowing or withdrawing from the retirement accounts before  retirement, just trying to make ends meet.                                time  1430    Still, the Department of Labor used executive fiat to leverage  trillions of dollars that would be vested in retirement plans to  advance their woke agenda that can't pass Congress.   With this vote, Congress can put some checks and balances to work for  the American people, and I urge my colleagues in the House and the  Senate to protect the retirement plans of hardworking Americans by  voting for this bill.
