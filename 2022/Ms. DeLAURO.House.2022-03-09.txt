 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 973, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2471) to measure the progress of post-disaster recovery  and efforts to address corruption, governance, rule of law, and media  freedoms in Haiti, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 2471.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of our 2022 government funding  legislation.   This package makes historic investments in the middle class and  people who are living paycheck to paycheck. They deserve a government  that, instead of catering to the wealthy and big corporations, bends  over backwards to support them. By providing a 6.7 percent increase for  nondefense funding, the largest increase in 4 years, that is exactly  what we are doing.   What a marker we have put down. That is translated into funding for  agriculture, increased by 6 percent; energy and water, increased by 6.6  percent; 5.7 percent increase for financial services and general  government; 5.2 percent increase for interior and environment; a 7.5  percent increase for transportation and housing; 11.8 percent increase  for legislative branch, which includes support for the Capitol Police  who put their lives on the line defending this body; and a 7.5 percent  increase for labor, health, and human services, and education to  support Americans at every stage of their lives. That is what this bill  represents after years of stalled investment in each area.   With the funding included in this package, we are helping working  families with the cost of living; we are helping students pay for the  high cost of education; we are giving hardworking families a better  chance to own their own homes; and we are connecting rural communities  to the internet so that they can reach their full potential.   We are putting Americans back to work by creating jobs here in  America, helping small businesses, supporting job training, rebuilding  our infrastructure, including unlocking the full funding provided by  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   We are supporting the vulnerable by feeding the hungry and the food  insecure through nutrition assistance, making housing more affordable,  and addressing gender-based violence.   And we are tackling our toughest challenges. We are confronting  climate change through environmental enforcement. We are supporting  environmental justice with $100 million, an $83 million increase over  last year. We are making historic investments in clean energy and  climate science.   By rebuilding our public health infrastructure, investing in  lifesaving biomedical research, with $3.2 billion, an increase of $104  million, for HIV/AIDS research, and confronting urgent health crises,  we are making healthcare more affordable for more Americans.   And we are going to ensure that big corporations and the wealthy pay  their fair share to support these investments by increasing funding for  the IRS to $12.6 billion.   Think about the leaders that we hoped to emulate as we entered public  life, all of us, leaders like Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve  as the U.S. Secretary of Labor and one of the principal architects of  the New Deal. She once said, ``I came to Washington to work for God,  FDR and the millions of forgotten, plain common workingmen,'' and I add  women.   She, as well as my parents, told me to battle for working people,  never to take no for an answer. They said work for the everyday  citizen.   With this government funding legislation, we are here tonight as well  to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. As the world watches  in horror, civilians--including children, the ill, expectant mothers-- are being targeted by Russia's unprovoked and utterly inhumane attacks.   We are becoming witness to one of the worst humanitarian crises we  have seen in generations, which is why this bill provides $13.6 billion  in humanitarian assistance, defense support, and economic aid to help  the Ukrainian people in their most desperate hour of need.   We care for our servicemembers and our veterans by providing $224  million for the military's child development centers; strengthening the  VA with $598 million for suicide prevention outreach of veterans; and  $840 million for gender-specific care and programmatic efforts for  women.    At the Labor, Health, and Human Services and Education, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee, which I am honored to chair, we go even further  to expand access to education, Head Start, childcare, lifesaving  biomedical research, public health, maternal health, mental health, job  training, and worker protection; and we support workers and support the  skills they need to succeed.   We deliver for our students by providing the largest increase to Pell  grants since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. By  investing $14.5 billion for special education programs, $75 million for  full-service community schools, $17.5 billion to support low-income  students, we are giving millions of students a chance to access higher  education and unlock a lifetime of opportunity.   We make healthcare more affordable and accessible; $8.5 billion for  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We bolster the public  health infrastructure. We confront pressing health crises with $1  billion for maternal and child health, $2 billion for mental health,  and $3.9 billion for substance use treatment.  [[Page H1408]]    Finally, we are strengthening lifesaving biomedical research,  accelerating the pace of scientific breakthroughs with $6.9 billion for  the National Cancer Institute, $1 billion to establish the Advanced  Research Projects Agency for Health, ARPA-H. Together we are  accelerating the pace of scientific breakthroughs for diseases such as  ALS, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer.   I must, however, express my disappointment that the Hyde amendment  remains in this bill. I am the first Appropriations chair since 1977 to  remove it, because I understand that this is an offensive and  discriminatory policy which has shut out countless women from the  reproductive healthcare that they deserve for more than 40 years. While  Republicans blocked our efforts, I will never stop fighting to ensure  equal treatment for women.   The ten bills in this package include community projects funding,  which meets the urgent needs in districts across the country and sends  a clear message to the American people that Congress is working for  them.   I conclude with this comment from Frances Perkins, who said in her  farewell address:         There is always a large horizon, and it is up to us to       contribute some small part to a program of human betterment       for all time.    I believe that through this government funding package, we are  proving that that horizon is not only large, but it is endless.   There is no limit to what we can achieve, and for the first time in a  long time I believe we show just how government can work for working  people once again and to achieve the betterment of humankind.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members' support for this transformative  investment in working families and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Energy and Water.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Commerce Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   The agreement permits the Army to use 2022 funds for the Strategic  Long-Range Cannons so long as it produces a comprehensive funding plan  and a detailed schedule of activities.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank Ranking Member Granger, our Senate partners, Chairman Leahy,  Vice Chairman Shelby, our cardinals, and all of our Members. I salute  the staff on both sides of the aisle. I won't mention all their names  in the interest of time, but these are the most unbelievably  professional individuals I have ever met. They do the job every single  day and night and they are up all night.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 973, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 75) making further continuing  appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   While we have just passed government funding legislation, we need to  ensure there is sufficient time for the Senate to process the  legislation and for it to be enrolled for the President's signature  without a lapse in appropriations.   This legislation extends government funding to provide that necessary  time, and I urge support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent  resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent, that in the  engrossment of H.R. 2471, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references, and to make such  other technical corrections and conforming changes as may be necessary  to reflect the actions of the House.
