 Mr. Speaker, there is no better sign of a healthy  economy than a healthy real estate market. We know this in this country  from bitter experience since the real estate and financial collapse of  2008.   In my State in Connecticut, we are barely at a place now where home  sales and home equity has even come in a positive direction and  climbing back towards what existed back in 2008 when the collapse  occurred.   Listening to the President's speech on Friday where he very  powerfully talked about the forgotten American, middle class  individuals and working people who really felt that they were left  behind in terms of the work that happens in this city, he clearly  touched a nerve that propelled him to the White House. As I said, it  was probably the most powerful part of his message that he delivered on  Friday.   I mention that because it was astonishing that within an hour after  taking the oath, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back  a rate reduction for mortgage insurance for homeowners. What that means  is that for many homeowners--particularly first-time home buyers--they  need to have mortgage insurance in order to qualify for a mortgage.  That ensures that if there is a default, that the mortgage will be paid  off. It de-risks the loan so that, again, particularly people who are  first-time home buyers can actually buy a house. The Federal Housing  Administration, FHA, runs this mortgage insurance program.   Again, there was a rate reduction that was slated to go into effect  on January 27, from 0.85 percent down to 0.6 percent. President Trump  canceled that reduction.   So what does that mean?   The National Association of Realtors, which is hardly a partisan  group, has, in the wake of that order, released numbers that about  750,000 to 800,000 homeowners are going to be adversely affected by  losing those savings that are just going to go to the government, by  the way. Those mortgage premiums basically are paid into the  government. And right now there is a surplus in that account, which is  why the rate reduction was slated to go into effect. There is no reason  for the government to be overcharging for mortgage insurance, given the  healthy balance that exists in that mortgage insurance account.   They also calculate that 30,000 to 40,000 home buyers will not buy a  home in 2017 because of that order that was issued on Friday. Again,  these are people who--$500 to $1,000, which is going to come out of  their pocket in terms of higher payments because of this executive  order--are basically going to be priced out of buying a home. The home  builders, the realtors, the people who are closest to the market and  clearly are not partisan--I mean, I know a lot of these guys in my  district, and they are staunch Republicans in many cases--are  dumbfounded at the fact that that order, of all things, within the  first hours of the new administration, would be a priority for, again,  the new Trump administration.   We have work to do in terms of getting this economy turned around,  but if you look at home ownership, home construction, buying a house,  having a healthy real estate market, that is absolutely the sweet spot  of trying to succeed in this country. We do not need to be overcharging  Americans for mortgage insurance, which, again, is the gateway for home  ownership, particularly at that lower end of the market. Because every  time someone buys a house for $200,000 or $250,000 in Connecticut,  which is towards the lower end, or even lower in other parts of the  country, that frees up existing homeowners either to buy up or to  retire or get a condo. When those people are locked out--which raising  these mortgage insurance premiums are going to effectively do--we are  just stifling the real estate market from recovering. That is a bad  start in terms of an administration that says it is about growing  America's economy.   I will pledge to my constituents that I am going to do everything I  can to reverse that unwise order and help the folks who are out there  doing the hard work of selling houses, building houses, hiring people,  to accomplish their goal because when they succeed, America succeeds.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Doyle for his generous  yielding of time and the great work he does representing the great city  of Pittsburgh, which has had many Super Bowl rings in the past and will  again in the future no doubt.   Mr. Speaker, again, I rise in support of this measure. As Mr.  Kinzinger indicated, this is the third try that we have pushed this  bill on a bipartisan basis, and hopefully the third time will be the  charm. It was introduced only 10 days ago, and the fact that, again, we  are moving so quickly hopefully is going to send an encouraging signal  that the Senate can really move forward and finish this very, I think,  important and useful piece of legislation.   There are about 737,000 ham radio operators that have been licensed  by the Federal Communications Commission across the country. As has  been said, they provide a great backup for emergency services around  the country. Again, in Connecticut, where we did get hit with  Hurricanes Sandy and Irene in back-to-back years, the harm that was  done to the wireless communications system as well as just the regular  radio system really put the spotlight on the fact that ham radio  operators were critical in terms of keeping police, fire, and small  communities and State services in up-to-date, realtime communication  regarding both weather conditions as well as public safety conditions.  So the work that they perform is not just kind of a hobby; it really  has great value to the country.   What I think this bill tries to address is that, in 1985, the FCC  issued an order and ruling basically describing ham radio as critical  to the Nation's information and communication infrastructure, and that  reasonable accommodation should be made in terms of public entities  like zoning boards and land use bodies. It did not extend, however, to  private land use restrictions.   Since the 1980s, there probably hasn't been a deed signed in the  country that hasn't had land use restrictions, and this bill really  tries to, I think, adjust to that reality with the compromise language  that has been put forward so that condominium associations and, again,  neighborhood developments have to reasonably make sure that this  network is going to be able to function.   The good news is that the technology has moved forward so well that  the antenna intrusion really is not what it used to be, that the  equipment that they have is quite remarkable to see how strong their  signals are and the reception is with, again, just really almost tiny  antenna technology.   So, again, this legislation I think really updates the FCC's  promotion of ham radio. Communities that are going to end up depending  on it because of natural disaster and other emergency situations I  think will benefit strongly. So again, I congratulate all the members  of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I thank Mr. Doyle again for  generously yielding his time to me.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers.   I yield back the balance of my time.
