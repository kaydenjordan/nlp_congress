 Mr. Speaker, if this was a ``Jeopardy!'' game, it would  be called: Here we go again for a thousand.   Mr. Speaker, if we look at what the EPA has done to overreach, we are  talking hundreds of proposed rules that they have overreached on  telling the American public what they can and can't do.   Mr. Speaker, if it were allowed under House rules, I would address  the gallery and I would ask the gallery, raise your hand if you like  the fact that the President of the United States is going to tell you  what kind of vehicle you can and cannot drive.   It is not necessarily allowed under House rules, but I am guessing,  because my district doesn't like it, that most Americans don't like it  either.   Today, we are going to stop the EPA from outlawing gas-powered  vehicles. The CARS Act places a critical stop sign on this failed path  toward forcing all Americans to own electric vehicles. Not only does  this legislation prohibit the EPA from enforcing a ban, but it also  acknowledges the abuse that the EPA has done.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor, and I thank Mr.  Walberg for leading this legislation. The Energy and Commerce Committee  is leading the way to energy dominance and allowing Americans to make  their own choices that they very much need to be able to make.
