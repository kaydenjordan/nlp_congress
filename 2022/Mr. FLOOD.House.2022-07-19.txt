 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legacy of  Chief Master Sergeant James M. McCoy of Omaha. Recognizing his life of  service, both public and private, the United States lost an outstanding  leader and, certainly, Nebraska lost a friend.   Born in Creston, Iowa, he entered the Air Force at 18 years old in  1951. In 1979, he was named the sixth chief master sergeant of the  United States Air Force. Whether as an instructor or part of a major  command, he was an exceptional person, eventually being named one of  the 12 Outstanding Airmen during his assignment with the Pacific Air  Forces.   My district is home to Offutt Air Force Base, a pillar in our U.S.  strategic defense. In 2007, its Airman Leadership School was named for  McCoy, and in 2016, he was inducted into the Strategic Air Command Hall  of Fame. Just recently, in 2021, the Air Force Association awarded  McCoy its Lifetime Achievement Award in the school now bearing his  name.   On behalf of the First District of Nebraska, I thank him and his  family for his great service to his community and his Nation.                            ____________________
