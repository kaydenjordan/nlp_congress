 Madam President, I think we all know the Constitution  of the United States, under article I, says the Senate and the House of  the United States are separate and coequal branches of government with  the executive branch.   We are now seeing more and more Americans hurt every day by the  government shutdown, Americans losing access to services. We just saw  that the Food and Drug Administration has stopped routine food safety  inspections of seafood. We just saw that the EPA has halted one of the  Federal Government's most important health activities--the inspection  of Federal factories, powerplants, oil refineries, water treatment  plants. Eight hundred thousand Federal employees are not getting paid.  Hundreds of thousands of them are going to work every day, including at  our border, protecting our border, not getting paid. Hundreds of  thousands more have been locked out of work.   There is a Maryland mom who just had to go on the internet to set up  a GoFundMe account to help pay her son's college tuition because they  are on a monthly installment plan. I talked to the head of a community  college in Maryland just the other day. I went to see her, asked how  things are. The first thing she told me, her phone had been ringing off  the hook all morning because the parents of students of the community  college weren't going to be able to make their monthly installment  payments.   Hundreds of thousands of Federal employees are one paycheck away from  not being able to pay their mortgage or their rent, and tomorrow  hundreds of thousands of them are not going to get a paycheck.  [[Page S115]]    So to the majority leader, I will just say, we should not be  contracting out our constitutional responsibilities to any President-- certainly not a President who said he is proud to shut down the  Government of the United States. There is nothing to be proud of in  denying important services and leaving 800,000 people without a  paycheck. I don't think any of us should be proud of that, and we  shouldn't be contracting out our responsibilities to the President of  the United States.   We should vote on these measures we have already voted for. Senator  Cardin just asked us to vote on this at the Senate desk. It has been  supported in various ways by a bipartisan majority right here in the  U.S. Senate.   I have in my hand H.J. Res. 1. This is also on the Senate calendar.  It is identical, with respect to the Department of Homeland Security,  to the measure this Senate passed just a few weeks ago.   Let's reopen the Department of Homeland Security at current funding  levels until February 8. In fact, if I recall, that was the majority  leader's legislation. We passed it overwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote.   The House, 1 week ago, as their first order of business, passed this  bill and the bill Senator Cardin asked us to vote on.   This bill to open the Department of Homeland Security, as we  negotiate the issue of border security--and there is no dispute over  whether we need border security. Of course we need secure borders. The  issue is over the most effective and smart way to accomplish that.   So now this bill is right back in our possession. It is on the  calendar. The question is, Why are our colleagues on the Republican  side refusing to allow a vote on the very bill they proposed in this  body just a few weeks ago, and how can you justify to the American  people that you are not going to vote on something you yourself  proposed as the first order of business in the U.S. Senate, when people  are losing those services, losing public safety protections, and  800,000 Federal employees are not being paid?                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 6, H.J.  Res. 1, making further continuing appropriations for the Department of  Homeland Security. I further ask that the joint resolution be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    We are clearly not shut down. We are all here.   I would say to the majority leader, if you go to a lot of Federal  Agencies right now, no one is there. They are shut down. They can't do  the work of the American people, which is why the FDA is no longer  doing important food inspections on seafood. It is why the EPA is not  able to inspect major polluters to protect the public health. We are  open.   All we are saying is, we want our first order of business to be to  also open the eight of nine Federal Departments that have nothing to do  with a wall or border security. The EPA's work has nothing to do with a  wall. The work the FDA does on food inspection has nothing to do with a  wall. So pass the measures that have already been agreed to in the U.S.  Senate on a bipartisan basis. Open those eight of nine Departments at  funding levels the Senate supported to the end of the fiscal year.  Then, with the Department of Homeland Security, do exactly what the  majority leader proposed right here and which we supported just a few  weeks ago so we can work with the President. I mean, he walked out the  other day, but we would like to work with the President to resolve  that.   What we are saying is, we are open, and we want to focus on the  urgent business of reopening the rest of the Federal Government, both  to provide the American people with the services they paid for and to  make sure Federal employees don't go without paychecks.   I will tell you, your phones will all be ringing off the hook  tomorrow when Federal employees begin to miss that first paycheck. I  will tell you, GS-2s, GS-3s in the Federal Government, they are one  paycheck away from not being able to pay their bills.   On top of that, you have small businesses all over the country--I  have heard from my Republican colleagues, small businesses that  contract with the Federal Government, they are being squeezed. One in  the State of Maryland, nonprofit small business, laid off 173 people  just yesterday. The Federal contractors' employees? They are not coming  to work. They are shut out, and they are not getting paid.   So this is having an increasingly harmful effect every day on people  throughout the country, and we have it in our power today to vote on  bills we have already voted for in the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan  basis to reopen.   We should not be accomplices to the shutdown the President said he  would be proud of. We should say today, we are proud to cast our first  vote, as the House did, to reopen the Federal Government and get people  back to work.                            ____________________
