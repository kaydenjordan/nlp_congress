 Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was unable to vote on  Monday, December 10, 2018, as I was attending an important event in  Contra Costa, California.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 426,  H. Res. 792 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 427, H.R. 3008.                            ____________________
