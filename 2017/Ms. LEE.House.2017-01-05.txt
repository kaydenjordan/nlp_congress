 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the lifesaving impact  of the Affordable Care Act.   This week, I have heard from dozens of constituents who have been  calling my office and reaching out on social media to tell me their ACA  stories.   I heard from one constituent whose mother had two devastating lung  diseases. While she had good insurance, unfair lifetime spending caps  priced her out of receiving the lifesaving treatment she needed. When  the Affordable Care Act passed, we ended the cruel practice of lifetime  spending caps. With these new protections, she was able to resume her  treatment and stay healthy to spend time with her daughter and  granddaughter.   Mr. Speaker, the ACA works. It reduces healthcare costs, enables  young people to stay on their parents' insurance, and ensures low- income and struggling families that they can access the care they need.   If Republicans repeal this law without a viable replacement, there  will be real consequences to real people. Let me be clear: by repealing  the ACA, Republicans would end healthcare coverage for millions of  families, put the insurance companies back in charge, and, yes, make  America sick again.   I urge my colleagues to consider what is at stake here--real costs,  real lives, not just a political football.   Let's do the right thing and protect families' health care.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding and  for his steadfast commitment to ensuring global peace and security.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and H. Res. 11, which  is a flawed and misguided effort as currently written. Let me be clear:  H. Res. 11 would undermine longstanding and bipartisan U.S. policy on a  two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This resolution  is deeply flawed because it does not accurately portray U.S. policy on  Israeli settlements. What is worse, this resolution completely  mischaracterizes the United Nations Security Council resolution and the  United States' abstention vote.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee shamefully rejected an  alternative introduced by Congressman Price, Congressman Connolly, and  Congressman Engel, which reflects current U.S. policy that would have  reaffirmed our commitment to a negotiated and peaceful two-state  solution. This is the only pathway to peace and security. It is  appalling--but really, it is not surprising--that Republicans pushed  through a closed rule and hurried this to the floor.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, the lack of a debate is a disgrace. But you  know what? There are some of us here who are not going to be gagged.  There are some of here who are going to speak our mind, and there are  some of us here who are going to put forth our views. That is our  constitutional responsibility. We have the right to debate, whether you  agree or disagree. It is really, really a very sad day for our  democracy when bills like this come to the floor with rules like this  which don't allow debate. I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that the  gentlewoman just got a chance to debate herself on the floor and to use  that freedom of speech. That is what this floor is for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Ross).
