 Mr. President, I object to the electoral votes of the  State of Wisconsin because 71 House Members, all of who condemn  violence as we witnessed today, are firmly committed to the resolution  of disagreements in civil, lawful, peaceful institutions with full and  fair debate, free of violence. And though not a single court has  allowed an evidentiary hearing to listen to the significant body of  evidence of fraud, and though some seize on the court's failure to  misrepresent that no court would listen to the evidence as saying  evidence did not exist; while Democrat leaders in Milwaukee illegally  and unconstitutionally created more than 200 illegal polling places;  tens of thousands of votes were changed by workers, despite election  workers' objections, plus so many other illegalities to fraudulently  create a 20,000-vote lead, we object, along with a Senator who now has  withdrawn his objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Sections 15 and 17 of title 3 of the United  States Code require that any objection be presented in writing, signed  by a Member of the House of Representatives and a Senator.   Is the objection in writing and signed by a Member and a Senator?    It is in writing. It is signed by a Member, but it is  not signed and objected to by a Senator, Mr. President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, the objection cannot be  entertained.   This certificate from Wyoming, the Parliamentarians have advised, is  the only certificate of vote from that State and purports to be a  return from the State and has annexed to it the certificate of an  authority from the same State purporting to appoint or ascertain  electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H114, third column and fourth  paragraph, the following appeared: The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral vote  of the State of Wyoming seems to be regular in form and authentic, and  it appears therefrom that Donald J. Trump of the State of Florida  received 3 votes for President and Michael R. Pence of the State of  Indiana received 3 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any objections to counting a  certificate of the vote of the State of Wyoming that the teller has  verified appears to be regular in form and authentic?   There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Hearing none, the Chair advises Members of  Congress the certificates having been read, the tellers will ascertain  and deliver the result to the President of the Senate.   Senator KLOBUCHAR. The undersigned, Roy Blunt and Amy Klobuchar,  tellers on the part of the Senate; Zoe Lofgren and Rodney Davis,  tellers on the part of the House of Representatives, report the  following as the result of the ascertainment and counting of the  electoral votes for President and Vice President of the United States  for the term beginning on the 20th day of January, 2021. The report we  make is that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be the President and the  Vice President, according to the ballots that have been given to us.

Lord of our lives and sovereign of our beloved  Nation, we deplore the desecration of the United States Capitol  Building, the shedding of innocent blood, the loss of life, and the  quagmire of dysfunction that threaten our democracy.   These tragedies have reminded us that words matter and that the power  of life and death is in the tongue. We have been warned that eternal  vigilance continues to be freedom's price.   Lord, You have helped us remember that we need to see in each other a  common humanity that reflects Your image. You have strengthened our  resolve to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies domestic, as well as foreign.   Use us to bring healing and unity to a hurting and divided Nation and  world. Thank You for what You have blessed our lawmakers to accomplish  in spite of threats to liberty.   Bless and keep us. Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our  hearts to do Your will, and guide our feet on the path of peace. And  God bless America.   We pray in Your sovereign name.   Amen.
