 Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate Dr.  Terry Michalske, who is the Executive Vice President and Director of  the Department of Energy's Savannah River National Laboratory, located  at the Savannah River site in South Carolina's Second Congressional  District.   Today is Dr. Michalske's last day as director. I am grateful to thank  him for his leadership of this critical national laboratory.   The Savannah River National Laboratory conducts research and  development, focusing on legacy waste cleanup, national security, and  clean energy. Dr. Michalske has more than 30 years of experience in  these fields. He holds seven patents, has authored 90 journal  publications, and also collaborated on several books.   Dr. Michalske also coordinates with the Department of Energy to  support the Savannah River site as a leading national laboratory and  regional producer of jobs.   Also, congratulations to Dr. Vahid Majidi, who will succeed Dr.  Michalske.   As a former staff member at the site myself, I am grateful for the  opportunity to represent the Savannah River site in Congress.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Secretary Rex Tillerson for his service, and  best wishes for continued success for Secretary of State designate Mike  Pompeo.
