 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to draw attention to the  Habitat for Humanity organization of Salem County in south Jersey.   Habitat for Humanity in Salem County, south Jersey, has been active  since its creation in 1982. As one of the oldest branches, they have  built over 40 homes, with many more in progress.   In addition, Habitat for Humanity in Salem County has a branch of  ReStore, which promotes sustainability in home improvement by selling  new and gently used materials and furniture.   I want to acknowledge their dedication to our community and to the  welfare of those around them. The Habitat for Humanity nonprofit  organization has made great strides in our district by building and  renovating homes so that more citizens can have access to affordable  housing.   We are all proud of them in south Jersey, proud of what they have  done. They are truly stars and truly have made a difference in  individuals' lives.   May God bless them.                            ____________________
