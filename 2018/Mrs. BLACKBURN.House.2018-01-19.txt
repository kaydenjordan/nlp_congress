 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama  for her leadership on this issue.   To my friends across the aisle, I want to say I would be hopeful that  you all would take a few minutes and actually read this legislation. It  is not a lengthy bill. It doesn't take that long to read. Quite  precisely, it does a few simple things that need to be done, that need  to be done to build on the 2002 law that this body chose to pass and  put on the books.   Now, the reason that we chose to do this is because of what we have  learned since 2002. If you go in and look at the Kermit Gosnell trial  and that house of horrors, and if you take the time to listen to some  of this testimony, there was a healthcare worker who said, during the  years of working in that facility, that there could have been as many  as 100 babies who survived a botched abortion. And what happened? They  lost their life.   So this bill is about protecting women and babies. It is not about  Roe v. Wade. It is all about protecting women and babies. It gives that  mother who has that abortion, and it is botched, and that baby  survives--it gives her that civil right of action that she ought to  have. It does set that standard that you have got to have medical care  provided to these precious, precious babies who survive that. You do  that immediately. They deserve that standard of care.   It says if a healthcare professional does not make the choice to  provide that care, they are going to face those criminal penalties.   So, yes, the bill is there to protect women and these babies.   I just had a great conversation with a young lady who survived an  abortion. She is an adult now. She stands for life. I encourage this  body to support the bill and to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Act.
