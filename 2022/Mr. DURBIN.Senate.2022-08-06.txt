 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, first, let me say I am joining in with  the action just taken by the Senate, led by Senator Coons, who has  shown an extraordinary gift of understanding of the importance of the  African continent and the people that need to be part of its future.   I wholeheartedly support the effort which he initiated on the floor  this afternoon. And I believe that Dr. Muyangwa is going to be a  valuable asset to AID and to Africa, and I thank him for his leadership  in bringing this issue before us today.                            ____________________     Madam President, the United States has done some good,  important, even historic work this week. On Tuesday, we passed the PACT  Act, expanding VA healthcare to an estimated 3.5 million veterans.  Their service to our Nation exposed them to potentially deadly toxic  chemicals from Agent Orange in the Vietnam conflict to toxic burn pits,  which were found to be ubiquitous in Iraq and Afghanistan.   It took too long: 12 years. Toxic exposed veterans and family members  had to stand on the steps of the Capitol, literally camped out for 5  days and nights to remind us that the veterans suffering from toxic  exposure deserve care as surely as veterans injured by bullets and  bombs.   But in the end, thank goodness, we did the right thing. The vote to  pass the PACT Act was 86 to 11--86 votes in a 50-50 Democratic/ Republican Chamber. It was a remarkable, bipartisan rollcall.   And then we made history this week when the Senate voted to ratify  the entry of Finland and Sweden to NATO. Vladimir Putin gambled that  Russia could seize Ukraine in just a few days, could use his victory to  shatter NATO's unity and to deepen divides around the world.   Vladimir Putin, again, was dead wrong. NATO is more united, larger,  and more powerful than ever, while Vladimir Putin has become an  international pariah. Russia's military is bogged down in Ukraine,  suffering heavy losses. And the Russian economy is staggering under the  weight of global sanctions imposed by the freedom-loving nations of the  world against Russia.   The Senate vote in favor of enlarging NATO to include Sweden and  Finland was 95 to 1--95 votes in favor of it in a body that is divided  equally, 50-50. Two major achievements in just 2 days, both with huge  bipartisan majorities. That is proof for the doubters that the Senate  can work together when the need is urgent and the solutions are just.   Now we are debating another historic plan that should have the  support of both parties. I listen to the speeches each day on the floor  of the Senate. And every day our Republican colleagues stand on the  floor and say it is about time we did something about inflation. They  know that is exactly the way the American families feel--and I feel, as  well. And then, sadly, when given a chance, as they will be in just a  few minutes, my Republican friends try to stop legislation that will  lower the cost and give American families a break on their cost of  living. All the speeches notwithstanding, they refuse to vote for a  provision which will actually lower families' living costs.   They oppose cutting taxes for families. They oppose banning price  gouging by oil companies. They oppose cutting healthcare premiums. They  oppose extending the Child Tax Credits. They oppose lowering  prescription drug prices. But we are going to give them another chance  to do the right thing.   They are going to have a chance to actually lower some of those big  ticket costs which they gave all their speeches about and--listen to  this bonus--reduce the deficit at the same time. Yes, the Democrats  have a proposal which will reduce our national debt by $300 billion.  Our plan is called the Inflation Reduction Act. It does exactly what it  says and even more.    The Inflation Reduction Act will cut energy costs, now and in the  future, by deploying American-made clean energy and by making the  biggest investment to battle the climate crisis in U.S. history.   You can't miss on the news the terrible things that have happened in  the Commonwealth of Kentucky in the last week. Horrible things. Thirty- seven people--at least 37 people--have lost their lives with the  flooding in that State. They go to these remote, rural villages. It  just breaks your heart to look at the devastation.   And the reporters go to families still, I guess, trying to get back  on their feet, trying to imagine tomorrow and do these interviews. And  many times, the people are clearly in pain and distraught over their  personal losses.   There was one man I remember yesterday, particularly. He did not  appear to be the kind of person who spends a lot of time thinking about  Congressional issues or even great political issues. He was a fellow, a  hardworking fellow, who just lost his home. And you know what he said?  He said: This is climate change; what you are looking at here is  climate change. I have lived in this town for 40 years. And I have  never seen anything like that. And I can't imagine if it comes again.   For him to use the words ``climate change'' really was an eye opener  for me, because it means that he is sensitized to the reality that we  face in this world. Extreme weather has become the norm in our country,  whether it is an extreme drought, an extreme flooding situation, more  tornadoes than ever at different times of the year. The list goes on  and on.   Some people think it is just God being restless. I think there is  more to it. I think we--those of us who inhabit  [[Page S4056]]  this planet Earth--bear some responsibility.   The question is, will we give speeches, will we lament these extreme  weather events, or will do something? That is why this bill that is  coming up today, starting today, subject to amendment, is so important.  We can't allow our energy and national security to be dictated by some  foreign power or some foreign leader like Vladimir Putin or anyone else  who doesn't share America's national interest.   The Inflation Reduction Act, which is coming before us, invests in  clean, new American energy sources so that our future can be determined  by American ingenuity, not by some foreign cartel or some Kremlin  kleptocrat.   Earlier today, the Senator from Kentucky came to the floor and talked  about the EPA police checking on whether people are buying certain  products or not buying other products. That isn't what this bill is  about at all. Incentives are there. And I--just from a family point of  view--am going to take a look at it. Is it time for my family to buy a  heat pump? I will take a look and see. Tax credits, tax incentives  could be an incentive for me to make that decision with my family and  my wife. And that is all that we are offering--incentives for people to  choose the right things, the environmentally smart things to deal with  climate change.   The more energy solutions we discover, the cheaper our energy bills  will be. Importantly, the Inflation Reduction Act will enable the  United States--listen to this--to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an  estimated 40 percent by the year 2030.   We have a lot of young pages here who come and work in the summer. We  are glad to have them. They brighten up the place, and their energy is  a sight to behold. They probably listen to this debate and wonder if  these graying politicians, these Senators and Congressman, really do  care about the planet that they are going to be living on, raising  their own families, building their own futures. Well, this bill is an  indication we do care. And to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only  does the right thing for America, it sets an example for the world.  Despite all the excuses, there is no excuse for ignoring climate  change, as that poor fellow down in Kentucky made obvious.   For anyone who still says global warming is a hoax--and I guess there  are a handful of those folks left--or admits that it is real and says  we just can't afford to fix it, know this: The costs of ignoring the  climate crisis are far greater than dealing with it.   A recent analysis by the Office of Management and Budget warns, if  left unchecked, climate change could reduce our Nation's gross domestic  product by 10 percent and cost Americans $2 trillion a year by the end  of the century--$2 trillion in the production of goods and services.   To put that in perspective, that is about a third of the entire U.S.  budget this year. And in case you are dismissing these warnings because  they happen to come from a Democrat or from the Biden administration,  maybe you should listen to Deloitte--a well-known accounting firming in  this country--their center for sustainable management. They released a  report in May estimating that left unchecked, climate change will cost  the global economy $178 trillion for the next 50 years. If rising sea  levels don't swamp us, rising costs of ignoring climate disasters very  well may.   The Inflation Reduction Act will enable us to make reasonable changes  now that will pay for themselves many times over. It will also cut  families' healthcare costs in four important ways. First, we extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for 13 million Americans for 3  more years.   I was so surprised to read recently that there are still 8 million  Americans uninsured. There should be none. And our goal is none. But we  made such dramatic progress cutting by a third to a half the number of  people uninsured since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.   Have you ever had a young child in your family who was sick and you  worried because you had no health insurance as to whether they would be  seen by the right doctor, the right hospital? I went through it. It  happened right after our first child was born. We didn't have health  insurance. I never felt more vulnerable, and I never had an emptier  feeling when it came to being a father caring for his child as to not  have health insurance and worrying about that. I don't think any family  should ever have to go through that. It is an experience I will never  forget.   Second, our plan allows Medicare to finally negotiate fair prices for  prescription drugs. I listened to the Republican leader on the floor  this morning talking about what a terrible idea that is.   Well, I just want to suggest to him, we have been doing that at the  Veterans' Administration for years. They have been negotiating  pharmaceutical prices so that our veterans get affordable drugs and  taxpayers get a break and don't have to subsidize them. That, to me, is  just common sense, and it is humane. The notion that we are going to  extend that to Medicare recipients is not a radical idea. It involves  something that we think is fundamental to the free market economy:  competition. If these pharmaceutical companies want to sell their drugs  to the Medicare recipients, we say to them, let's negotiate, on a  certain number of those drugs, reasonable prices.   Now, some people say that is too much government, government stepping  in there and trying to establish the prices that will be paid for these  pharmaceuticals.   Well, I would say to the same pharmaceutical companies that are  raising these objections: Look what you are doing today in Canada. You  take exactly the same drug made here in the United States, sold to  Americans at an inflated price, and sell it at a deep discount to  people living in Canada. Why do you do it? Is it out of the kindness of  your heart? No. The Canadian Government stood up and said you are not  going to gouge Canadian families. Yes, we would like to have your  pharmaceuticals and, yes, we will put them in our formulary, but you  cannot dictate the prices to us. We are going to negotiate those  prices. And the pharmaceutical companies sat down and did it--not just  in Canada but in Europe.   When you say the same thing in the United States, that they treat  Americans and those under Medicare the way they treat Canadians, you  have the Senator from Kentucky coming to the floor and calling it a  college sophomore socialist answer. I don't think so. I think it is  just common sense.   These pharmaceutical companies are some of the most profitable  companies in the United States year in and year out. They make money  hand over fist. And I am glad they do, in many respects, because they  can invest that money in the next generation of drugs.   You say to yourself: Wait a minute. If you are going to give them  less for the product, they will have less for research. Not necessarily  because there is something that you ought to remember that I think is  very important. I want to make sure I get these figures right. The big  pharmaceutical companies today spend more on advertising than on  research.   Let me give you a couple of examples. Bayer, one of the makers of  Xarelto--you have heard that one, haven't you, on TV--spent $18 billion  on sales and marketing, $18 billion. How much did they spend on  research for new drugs and new products? Eight billion. More than twice  as much of the research budget went to be spent on marketing and  television advertising.   Incidentally, the United States is only one of two nations in the  world that allows direct-to-consumer drug advertising. The other one is  New Zealand, if you can imagine. They put all this money on television  advertising drugs like Xarelto. Why? So that people say: Wait a minute.  Maybe that is what I have needed all along. I have to write down that  name. How do you spell ``Xarelto?'' They get it right, finally, because  ads keep coming on hour after hour on television, and they go to the  doctor and say: I need Xarelto.   The doctor may have second thoughts about whether that is a good  drug, but he doesn't have a lot of time for each patient. He is not  going to debate his customers. He ends up writing a script for a high- priced drug like Xarelto, and Bayer makes more money.   They are not the only ones. Johnson & Johnson--that is a pretty well- known company. They spent $22 billion on sales and marketing. How much,  if they spent $22 billion on sales and marketing, did they spend on  research? Twelve--twelve. Do you see a pattern here?  [[Page S4057]]    To be fair, not all of pharma's big bucks go into TV ads. Over the  past 5 years, the 14 largest drug corporations spent more on stock  buybacks lining the pockets of their CEOs than on R&D. Remember what I  just said. They took their profits, turned them into stock buybacks so  that the wealthiest people in America got a better balance sheet. Money  that could have gone into research for new drugs, they diverted into  profit-taking. So this notion about saying that Medicare should be able  to negotiate more competitive and fairly priced drugs is not  unreasonable, and it isn't going to stop research. We know that.   Can I add one other element to this? Each of these pharmaceutical  companies has a benefactor, a major benefactor. Think of it. It is an  Agency that generates research by the billions each year, and the  product of that research--which is a suggestion for new drugs, for  example--is literally given to the pharmaceutical industry to use and  make a profit. What is that Agency? The National Institutes of Health.  It does the basic research by the Federal Government, paid for by  American taxpayers--billions of dollars--and makes it available to  pharmaceutical companies to develop the next generations of drugs. That  is as it should be. But this notion that the pharmaceutical companies  are just making it on their own and their own skills goes way beyond  the obvious. NIH is helping very much.   We want to cut healthcare costs to make sure as well that seniors cap  their out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year, and  $2,000 a year is still a sacrifice for many seniors, but it is a  reasonable amount. We know what is happening now. Many seniors have  drugs that they are supposed to be taking. They can't afford to fill  the prescriptions or they take half the dose when they should be taking  a full dosage. That is the reality of the prescription drug pricing in  America.   Is it a serious problem? Well, just ask Blue Cross Blue Shield in  Chicago, and I have: What is the impact of these inflated prescription  drug prices on healthcare premiums? Blue Cross Blue Shield said to me  that it is the No. 1 driver of increased health insurance premium  costs, the cost of prescription drugs.   So when we start bringing down these costs, we are also going to  create a situation where we have less incentive to increase premiums  for health insurance.   Fourth, we penalize drug companies if they try to increase the price  of the drug more than the rate of inflation. That was another on the  list of sophomore in college socialist ideas, according to the  Republican leader on the floor this morning. Well, I think he is wrong.  We know what happens to the price of these drugs year in and year out.  They just don't go up with the cost of inflation, they go up by  multiples that reach the point people can't afford to pay it. That has  to come to an end.   Five years ago, Republicans used this same process we are using  called reconciliation to pass a nearly $2 trillion tax bill that  overwhelmingly benefited big corporations and the wealthiest people in  America, and they put the whole boondoggle on the credit card. It was  unpaid for--tax cuts unpaid for. They claimed their tax cuts would pay  for themselves. Dynamic scoring, they called it. Instead, they blew up  the national debt.   Our plan is paid for, and here is the bottom line: No one in  America--no one earning less than $400,000 a year--is seeing any  increase in their taxes. Now, the Republicans say: Well, if you raise  taxes on the wealthiest people, it is going to hurt the poorest people.  When it gets right down to it, many of these corporations are extremely  profitable--a billion dollars a year in profits and pay no Federal  taxes. What is wrong with this picture?   The average American family is paying their taxes, as the law  requires, and yet these corporations have found an escape hatch to  avoid paying any taxes whatsoever. If they pay any taxes, they are  going to hurt the poor families. The poor families are doing their part  to pay their taxes. It is time these wealthy individuals and  corporations did the same.    Instead of adding to the national debt, as our Republican colleagues  did with their tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, our proposal  that we will vote on today will reduce the deficit by $300 billion.  That is on top of the $1.7 trillion we have already cut from the  deficit this year. Cutting the deficit reduces inflation pressure in  the long run. In the short term, we are fighting inflation by lowering  the cost of energy and healthcare, two of the biggest ticket items in  family budgets.   And lastly, Senator McConnell and our Republican colleagues seem to  have developed a great respect for the economic wisdom of former  Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. I can't tell you how many times  Senator McConnell has mentioned Larry Summers' name as if he is the  great leader of all the great thinkers in the economics field in  America. Let me tell you what Mr. Summers happens to say about our plan  that we are going to vote for today and that all the Republicans are  going to oppose. He said:         This bill is fighting inflation.    He also said:         This is an easy bill to get behind.    I didn't hear that this morning when Senator McConnell came to the  floor and talked about his view of this bill. Larry Summers was his  expert previously. Now he is ignoring when Summers says we ought to  vote for this bill to reduce inflation.   Do our Republican friends really want to tame inflation and help  families with energy and healthcare or just come to the floor and  complain? That is the choice they have. If they want to help, we have a  plan. It is fair; it is paid for; it fights inflation; and it lowers  the deficit. Wouldn't it be great if they would join us in a bipartisan  effort to pass this at this moment in history? It is what America is  waiting for and looking for. I hope that a number of Republicans will  surprise us and join us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 3115  and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  675 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Van  Hollen amendment at the desk to the resolution be agreed to; the  preamble be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following resolutions,  submitted earlier today: S. Res. 749 and S. Res. 750.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to; and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 466, S. 4205.    I ask that the committee-reported substitute amendment be  agreed to; the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  698 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  remaining time on the bill be yielded back; that there be 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided, prior to each vote with respect to the  reconciliation bill; and that following the disposition of Sanders  amendment No. 5210, the following amendments be the first Republican  amendments in order: No. 1, amendment No. 5301, Senator Graham; No. 2,  amendment No. 5409, Senator Barrasso; No. 3, amendment No. 5382,  Senator Capito; No. 4, amendment No. 5384, Senator Lankford; and No. 5,  amendment No. 5404, Senator Crapo.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S4170, August 6, 2022, second column, the following  appears: ; and that following the disposition of Sanders amendment  No. 5120, the following amendments      The online Record has been corrected to read: ; and that  following the disposition of Sanders amendment No. 5210, the  following amendments    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Would the Senator from Montana hold for just one moment,  please? Thank you.                              Order of Business    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following disposition  of the Crapo amendment No. 5404, the following amendments be the next  Republican amendments in order: No. 5358, Collins; motion to commit,  Scott; No. 5389, Marshall; No. 5383, Capito; and No. 5421, Grassley.    Madam President, I raise a point of order that the  pending amendment does not produce a change in outlays or revenues and  therefore violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act  of 1974.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Collins  amendment No. 5358 be in order following Grassley amendment No. 5421.    Mr. President, the senior Senator from Florida says we  should stop our efforts on reconciliation until we put money in law  enforcement. So we checked the record. When we put billions in local  communities for law enforcement in the American Rescue Plan, the senior  Senator from Florida voted no.   And when it came to the Omnibus bill and Byrne grants and COPS money  that local organizations and law enforcement needed so they could be  stronger and fight crime, 31 Republicans voted no, including the senior  Senator from Florida.   So I would suggest we vote no on his amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be the next Republican amendments in order: 5316, Lee; 5418,  Shelby; Motion to Commit, Tim Scott; 5263, Cruz; 5425, Daines; 5361,  Ernst; 5360, Fischer; 5265, Cruz; 5385, Kennedy; motion to waive budget  with respect to insulin; 5472, Thune; 5406 Hagerty; 5224, Portman;  motion to commit, Hoeven; Cruz motion to commit on vaccines; Cruz  motion to commit on targeting parents; further, that the Sanders  amendment No. 5208 occur following the Scott motion to commit; and  Sanders No. 5281 following the Daines amendment No. 5425.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S4185, August 6, 2022, second column, the following  appears: amendments be the next Republican amendments in order:  5116, Lee: 5418, Shelby      The online Record has been corrected to read: amendments be the  next Republican amendments in order: 5316, Lee: 5418, Shelby    ========================= END NOTE =========================       I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments and motions be the next amendments and motions in  order: 5265, Cruz; 5281, Sanders; 5385, Kennedy; motion to waive the  budget with respect to insulin; Cruz motion to commit on vaccines; Cruz  motion to commit targeting parents; and that all provisions under the  previous order remain in effect.    Mr. President, the FBI has told us repeatedly that  domestic extremism is a very real threat in America. Last November, 60  percent of America's school leaders said that someone in their schools  had been verbally or physically threatened over school policy.   There is no evidence--none--that the Department of Justice is  threatening the constitutional right of parents to peaceful, free  speech. But there is no excuse--none--for violence against school  teachers or board members.   If you believe there is nothing peaceful or legitimate about  threatening teachers, school board members or their families, vote no  on this amendment.                           Vote on Motion to Commit     Mr. President, Members, the Senator from Tennessee just  provided us with this copy of his new amendment, and I hope you will  take a look at it because it is recommitting this motion for 3 days.  End of conversation, end of debate, end of any possibility of passing  what we consider to be a major piece of legislation, from prescription  drugs, dealing with environmental issues, and the list goes on. We have  faced this so many times already in the last 12 or 14 hours.   But the second thing I would like to note is, we understand the  seriousness of this challenge, so much so that we have already decided  it is a crime, and it is a crime that can be prosecuted. And it is a  crime that is investigated and enforced by an Agency of the Federal  Government which we funded just 4 months ago. Four months ago, we gave  $8 billion to ICE for this purpose. Thirty-one Republicans voted  against funding this purpose. One of them was the Senator from  Tennessee.   So now we are told we need the money, but 4 months ago he wouldn't  vote for it. I think we know what we have here. We have a challenge  that really is important to this motion that both parties share, but we  have a political challenge with an effort to derail this measure today.  Stick together and vote against this amendment.
