 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Joint Resolution 37, which annuls a poorly-written regulation put in  place by the Obama administration.   We need to clean up the regulations that the previous administration  imposed upon American business. We need to reform them, and ensure that  they serve a useful purpose. This is especially important for the  Department of Defense and NASA.   The regulation in question does not allow contractors to exercise  their right of due process. Rather than letting our legal system  provide justice, American companies could be blacklisted by contracting  agencies if ``preliminary determinations'' had been made against them.   This is not how our justice system works. Perhaps that is why this  regulation was halted by a nationwide injunction.   We should protect American workers. The regulation we strike today  was poorly crafted, and it would ultimately do America's workforce more  harm than good.   As Chairman of the Science Committee, I know that such a regulation  would impede NASA from carrying out its mission of exploration and  place an unnecessary cost on taxpayers by diminishing competition.   NASA should not be hampered by such unnecessary regulations and needs  to focus its resources on the challenges of outer space exploration.   The Federal procurement process cannot afford to be bogged down with  defective regulations. Congress must clean up how our government does  business to ensure that it is just and efficient.   I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, we often tell young  people that if they work hard and play by the rules, their efforts will  be rewarded.   Yet this unjust resolution fails to put our federal government's  money where its mouth is.   It will ensure that our tax dollars continue to go to companies that  fail to live up to their end of this bargain.   Time and again, reports have cited the glaring frequency with which  serial labor law violators receive federal contracts.   In the mid-1990s, GAO identified dozens of companies of violating  core workplace protections, like the National Labor Relations Act and  the Occupational Safety and Health Act.   And these abuses have continued. Reports in 2010 and 2013 again found  that companies with significant labor citations continued to receive  federal contracts.   The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule makes certain that our agencies  have the information about these violations they need to protect  American workers and safeguard our tax dollars.   It makes clear that companies who violate our landmark labor  protections, who deny overtime pay or family leave, and who deny  workers' rights to organize are not rewarded for repeatedly flouting  the law.   It also ensures that workers who have been discriminated against or  sexually harassed can have their day in court. They cannot be forced  into arbitration.   Our procurement laws already ask that tax dollars only go to  responsible contractors, with ``a satisfactory record of integrity''.   Serial labor law violators do not meet this test.   What's more, numerous studies have found that contractors with better  compliance records also perform better.   So let's not brush around the edges; this is not about safeguarding  tax dollars.   This vote is about allowing labor abuses to go rewarded.   I cannot stand for that. I urge my colleagues to vote no.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 74, the previous question is ordered.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
