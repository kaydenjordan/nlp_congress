 Mr. Speaker, during this pandemic, many companies and  individuals in California's 39th have gone above and beyond to help and  support others. Some have donated PPE; others raised money; some even  changed their entire business operation to support the district.   But today I want to mention one young lady, L'Mio Edwards, a rising  freshman at Diamond Bar High School and the number five cross country  runner for her age group in the country.   Using her gift as a talented runner, L'Mio committed to running a 5K  for 30 consecutive days in order to raise money for local food banks to  support families during COVID-19. So far, she has raised thousands of  dollars and helped hundreds of people.   Last Saturday, I had the honor of joining this young lady for a run,  and she blew me away both with her commitment to support her community  and with her speed, leaving me in her dust.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting L'Mio Edwards  for her commitment to her community and our country.                            ____________________
