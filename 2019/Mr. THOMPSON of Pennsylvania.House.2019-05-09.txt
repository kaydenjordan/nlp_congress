 Madam Speaker, I rise today during  Teacher Appreciation Week to celebrate America's hardworking,  dedicated, and passionate teachers.   The National Education Association and the National PTA team up each  year to recognize the contributions our teachers make every day to  shape the minds of their students.   Madam Speaker, I am sure every Member of the House can think of a  teacher who had a positive influence on not only their education but  their life.   Our teachers push students to achieve their best, and they show  students how to realize their full potential.   Teachers are some of the most powerful professionals in the entire  world. They lend a caring hand and extend a loving heart. They make  differences in the lives of our students academically, emotionally, and  physically.   I thank every teacher in America for the job they do, for the hours  they work, for the patience they show, and for the impact they have on  so many lives.   Happy Teachers Appreciation Week. This Nation would be lost without  them.                            ____________________
