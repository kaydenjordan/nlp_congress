 Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague,  Congressman Schweikert from Arizona.   I hadn't intended to, but I will begin my remarks by addressing his  remarks, and I will do something that I rarely do, and that is to quote  a French historian, political scientist, and diplomat, Alexis de  Tocqueville, who stated: ``The American Republic will endure until the  day that Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the  public's own money.''   The previous administration was led by an individual who, on the  campaign trail, said that $7 trillion in debt was unpatriotic. Now we  sit at the precipice of $20 trillion after two terms, and I would  submit that perhaps that is unpatriotic multiplied by three, or nearly  that, and echo the sentiments of Mr. Schweikert that it is absolutely,  positively unsustainable.   Now, there are ways that we could certainly deal with runaway debt.  One way would be to completely devalue the currency. If you really want  to step away from the hyperbolic barbs that are thrown by my colleagues  across the aisle as relate to the motives for the legislation that we  carry and find out who would be really harming seniors and children, it  would be those who would continue to spend until the only way to cover  the tab was to deflate the value of the very moneys set aside to care  for those least able to care for themselves.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Schweikert not only for his wise  remarks, but also for reminding me just how much I miss being a member  of the statehouse in the Commonwealth of Virginia where there is actual  back-and-forth debate on the merits of issues, wherein that small  percentage of individuals who choose to inform themselves might shape  their opinions based on a discourse rather than people standing at this  microphone unchecked.   That leads me to my next point, which is also not on the subject that  I originally intended to address, and that is the statement of my  distinguished colleague from Maryland, Mr. Raskin, who spoke on this  floor about 45 minutes ago on a subject that is important not just to  him and not just to me, but to America, and that is on the subject of  asset forfeiture.   His comments were indicative of the tone that this body has devolved  into. One of the many Democrats whom I admire, Daniel Patrick Moynihan,  whom Vanity Fair described as a fervent Democrat who saw the value in  working with Republicans--where is he today?--he once said: You are  entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your own  facts.   Mr. Raskin said that the Trump administration was burdening Americans  [[Page H6038]]  by virtue of an asset forfeiture policy, and he cited the case of a  Chinese restaurant, an entrepreneur who he said had amassed $25,000 so  that he could buy a building. But he was going over the speed limit so  he was pulled over by police. So without cause, they took his money,  and it took him 7 years, according to my colleague, to recoup his money  and the opportunity was lost, and that is what is wrong with Mr.  Trump's policy.   Wow. And he implored listeners to please look up this case, so I did.   In fact, there was a man who had saved money to purchase a Chinese  restaurant who was going 10 miles an hour over the speed limit. He was  pulled over by law enforcement, and he had not $25,000, but $75,000  forfeited. It took him not 7 years, but 10 months to get it back, and  it happened in 2014. I am not terribly sure who was President then, but  I don't think it was Donald Trump.   So I will join my colleague in suggesting that we need asset  forfeiture review and reform in this country. But, please, you are  entitled to your own opinions; you are not entitled to your own facts.   Now, why am I here tonight? Golly, Ned, why am I here at all? Who are  we as a nation?   I tell my children, if you want to know what is the right thing to do  in life when you are confronted with tough challenges, when you have a  dilemma, ask yourself, ``Who do I want to be?'' Not ``Who am I?'' ``Who  do I want to be?''   Because I hope I never reach my aspirational goals, but I keep trying  as long as I am here. I don't think if you reach all of your goals for  who you want to be that you have aimed high enough. If you ask  yourself, ``Who do I want to be when I face that ethical or moral  dilemma?'' you will always then come up with the right answer when you  answer what the person you want to be would do.   I grew up with a father who actually had a name for the belt that he  wore around his waist. It was ``The Enforcer.'' I had a mother who  thought I could do anything I wanted to do and a father who would kick  my tail if I didn't give it my best effort.   I spent nearly 10 years as a prosecutor, and I can't tell you how  many times I looked down the dais at the criminal defendant and  thought, ``I wonder, but there for the grace of God go I''--but for the  fact that I was blessed with amazing parents who encouraged me and  loved me and disciplined me and told me the things I could do, unlike  so many in political office today who garner votes and support by  telling people what they can't do, what they need done for them.   By gosh, this country was built on a government dependent upon  people, not a people dependent upon government. And that is who we are.  Now, who are we going to be? Where are we going?   A wiser person than I once said, if you want to know where you are  going, you should look where you have been. It is a relatively humbling  thing to do representing the Fifth District of Virginia, because the  Fifth District of Virginia was first represented in this institution by  James Madison.   I tell people those are some very small, big shoes to fill--very  small, big shoes to fill. James Madison won the congressional seat when  he ran in an election against a pillar of American foreign policy named  Monroe. They were so collegial during their campaign that they often  traveled together.   When Madison was elected to Congress prior to the 17th Amendment, he  went to the Virginia General Assembly--the longest serving  democratically elected legislative body on the planet Earth--and  suggested that James Monroe should be the Senator; and, indeed, he was  made the Senator. So we have Madison. We have Monroe.   The drafter of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson,  lived in Virginia's Fifth District. The power of the Article III branch  of government, the Supreme Court, John Marshall retired in Virginia's  Fifth District. Patrick Henry retired in Virginia's Fifth District. Lee  and Grant sat at a table at Appomattox Court House and ended the  American Civil War in the Fifth District of Virginia, and a young woman  named Barbara Johns stood up in the face of possible injury or death to  start the Virginia civil rights movement in the Fifth District. So it  is pretty humbling, but it gives me a good lesson in who we are.   So many on my side of the aisle criticized President Obama when he  said: If you have a business, you didn't do that. Somebody else did  that for you.    I will defend him. I will defend him. You did it with blood and sweat  and tears and hard work and persistence and the willingness to stand up  time and again after failing. You did it, but you did it because you  stood on the shoulders of giants who gave you the opportunity to do it,  those imperfect people: Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, who gave us  near-perfect documents; James Madison, documents that have been  revised, oh, I don't know, 27 times in hundreds of years, that we  constantly should strive to be a more perfect Union, that we will never  achieve that status of a perfect Union so long as institutions on Earth  are governed by mere mortal men, but that we have a duty in this Nation  to try to continue to.   So that is why I am here. I am not here to perpetuate my own power. I  understand that the most indispensable person is the person who  recognizes that they are not indispensable.   Folks, drive past the graveyard and look at the headstones, because I  can promise you, there are piles of folks buried there who thought the  world just couldn't go on without them. And the band played on.   The Fifth District of Virginia was here before I got here. It will be  here after I leave. I am not here to perpetuate my own name or my own  legacy or any sort of power. I am here to make sure that everything I  do is pointed towards giving the posterity that will follow us--to my  children, Schweikert's children, and your children--every bit as good,  if not better, opportunities than those which we had.   I believe there are two fundamental entitlements to birth of  Americanism.                                time  1945    First, you are entitled to an opportunity. We should always strive to  make that opportunity more of an equal opportunity. But in a world  where if your last name is Clinton, Trump, Obama, or Bush, you probably  have a better chance of getting into Harvard. We are not there yet. But  everyone is entitled to an opportunity. Everyone within the  Jeffersonian construct of liberty that is ``my freedom extends to the  point where yours starts so long as you don't harm another,'' should be  free to make decisions for yourself and has an entitlement to define  success for themselves.   If you want to be the world's best beekeeper, go be the world's best  beekeeper. If you want to be a great stay-at-home dad, by golly, be a  great stay-at-home dad. If you would like to work to cure cancer,  please do. If you want to be a Member of this body and try to  perpetuate opportunity for our posterity, please do. If you want to be  a Member of this body and try to perpetuate your own power or your own  legacy, please don't.   So this brings me to the point where I stand here today. I have been  here 6 months--not terribly long. Thank God I have been unable to shake  my citizen world view in favor of a legislator world view. So as I walk  into this Chamber and as I stand next to these women and men on both  sides of the aisle, I am a little humbled. When I walk down the  staircase on the edge of the original House Chamber that has been worn  through time by the footfalls of the likes of Kennedy, Madison, Monroe,  Eisenhower, and Lincoln, I am humbled.   But I would revert back to the words that Alexis de Tocqueville  observed over 150 years ago, and that is we will thrive until we begin  to attempt to bribe the taxpayers with their own money. At some point  things become unsustainable. At some point we need to recognize that we  are about freedom of individuals to venture and fail and venture and  gain, that we are a nation whose government should depend upon people,  not whose people should depend upon government.   An hour and a half ago I stood on this very floor, and I dropped at  the Clerk's desk H. Res. 458. H. Res. 458 is a vehicle that would move  to discharge past the normal process of procedures. H.R. 1436 is a bill  that was voted for by every Republican Member of this body in 2015,  which would provide for a repeal of the broken promises that are the  Affordable Care Act.  [[Page H6039]]    Just yesterday, in conference, they showed us polling, and it showed  that the American people trust the Republicans more on national  defense, border security, jobs, and the economy, but we were kind of  sketchy on healthcare. I can read a poll, but I came here to do what I  think is right. I came here to do what I said I would do.   This plan that I think could reasonably be called the Managed  Healthcare Bailout Program or the Health Insurance Industry Profit  Enhancement Act has failed working Americans, and the paradigm under  which we have debated it has failed to be an honest one. So if I am  here not to enhance myself or my legacy, if I am here to do what I  think is right or what I said I would do when I ran for office, then I  need to stand up and do what I said I was going to do when I ran for  office, and that was to ensure that the decisions of Americans were  left to Americans, that we minimize the interference in individuals'  lives by the government, and that we recognize--and I will paraphrase-- that Mr. Jefferson was correct when he said that the fruits of the  working class are safest when the legislature is not in session.   I believe it was Will Rogers who said: They say the only certain  things in life are death and taxes, only death doesn't get worse every  time Congress meets.   We hear about a CBO score that says X million people will lose  coverage. The last time I looked, this thing was called the Affordable  Care Act, not the Affordable Coverage Act. Even if it were called the  Affordable Coverage Act, it would be a misnomer because it is not  affordable.   A story published about 3 months ago indicated that two-thirds of  Americans couldn't find $1,000 in case of a financial crisis. But  deductibles have gone from $1,000 to 2,000, to 3,000, to 4,000, to  $5,000 for the average family of four.   I ask you: If your deductible is $5,000 and you can't find $1,000 in  times of crisis, do you have healthcare?   You have coverage. You have coverage, but you don't have healthcare.  You are still indigent, and it is a broken promise. But don't worry,  there were lots more: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. It  turns out that wasn't true. If you like your doctor, you can keep your  doctor. It turns out that wasn't true. We should see an average  decrease of about $2,500 a year per policy. It turns out that wasn't  true.   Don't worry, these insurers who supported the plan--remember the  insurance industry endorsed the Affordable Care Act--they are doing  this out of benevolence, folks.   I have an article from the New York Post that says there is a cost  spiral associated with ObamaCare and with the insurance industry, but  the cost spiral is upward. If you had bought $100 worth of  UnitedHealthcare the day the ACA passed and sold it, the last time I  looked, you would have $580. That is a heck of an investment. The only  people making out on this are the big insurers. Meanwhile, rank and  file Americans are perpetually lied to by folks who say: Those guys  don't care.   Actually, we do. We are just not trying to perpetuate our own power  by taking from one group and giving to another while bankrupting our  Nation and robbing our children blind.   So I have only been here for 6 months. I went to some people very  early on and I said: How about discharging this bill? I am frustrated.   They said: Well, it is not time for that.   I said: Okay. I want to be a team player.   I am frustrated, and we get to this point. The President is  frustrated. The Senate is frustrated. I don't give a hootin' heck about  the President or the Senate or this body. I care about the American  people whom I serve. They are frustrated. And nobody on the other side  of the aisle will talk about a plan that the namesake of the plan,  President Barack Obama, said has serious problems, that Minnesota  Democratic Governor Mark Dayton said is bankrupting his State and is  unsustainable, and that President Bill Clinton said is the craziest  thing.    We have zero suggestions for help because, by gosh, we can score  political points. Shame on both sides of the aisle if you are doing  this to score political points.   We ought to be doing this to make sure that the fundamental  birthright of Americanism, opportunity, is perpetuated for perpetuity  and that it doesn't die in the hands of a group of the political class  who say: Well, this will get me points at home. People told me not to  do this. It might not help you. Your district is not that safe.   I don't rightly care. I am going to do the right thing. I have never  had a job in my life that I wasn't willing to lose if it meant doing  the right thing.   So what are the goals of this?   This is rather brash. They are humble. I want the leadership of this  Chamber to understand that the rank and file Members support them, that  we got their backs, that we thank them for their best efforts, and we  don't want to quit this fight. We thank you for what you do. Let's keep  going and keep that darn promise.   I got a feeling that if you keep your promise, if you are worried  about elections, then your reward will come when people realize there  is somebody in this town who has some integrity. So I want to support  leadership. I want to send a message to the other Chamber that we are  willing to act if they are willing to act, and maybe embolden them. I  want to let the President know that we haven't quit on him. But, most  importantly, I want to send a message to the American people that some  people in D.C. mean what they say.   There have been dozens of votes for repeal by Members who knew that  the repeal would never happen because it had to cross the desk of the  person for whom the bill was named. It was a theoretical abstract:  Sure, I support it.   We are playing with live ammunition, folks. Let's see who meant what  they said. Come to this desk--and if you are watching at home, contact  your Member and tell him to come to this desk--and sign onto the  discharge petition, H. Res. 458. Or maybe you didn't mean it or you  did. Who knows? But let us know. Shoot straight with folks. Dozens of  votes for repeal.   Let me be clear about this, too. I am not sitting here trying to pull  the rug out from under people. The bill that would be discharged by  this resolution would not immediately end ObamaCare. Instead, it would  give us a 2-year window. And I will bet you that if we repealed and had  a 2-year window to debate a replacement, that we might get some input  from people on both sides of the aisle. I know to a metaphysical  certainty that no side has the monopoly on good ideas. I would love to  have some input. There will certainly be Members who say: I don't  believe the Federal Government should have a large role. There will be  other Members who say: We should have single payer.   Right now, we are stuck in a broken system because of political  gamesmanship. It burned me when I was on the outside, and it burns me  on the inside.   What are the facts? What are the real facts?   The average individual premium, according to eHealth, May 3, 2017,  has gone up 39 percent in the last 2 years. The average family plan has  gone up 49 percent. That means if you were an individual and your  premium was $1,000 a month, it is now $1,330 roughly a month. I am  doing math on the fly in my head. If you are a family and you were  paying $500 a month, then it is $740-ish a month. That is in 2 years.  The average individual plan is up 147 percent from 2008. The average  family plan is up 177 percent.   Folks, Americans' income hasn't increased at that rate.   The average is up 25 percent in the last year, and that is according  to the Department of Health and Human Services' report of October of  2016. That means if you were paying $2,000 a year ago, you are paying  $2,500 now--25 percent in 1 year.   Candidly, all the disingenuous arguments on the other side about how  many will die if we move to a system that allows individuals choices  are not only hollow, disingenuous, and beneath the dignity of this body  by virtue of their disingenuousness, but they are also false.   Folks, for the first time in nearly a generation, the mortality rate  rose in 2015. U.S. life expectancy dropped from 2014 to 2015 for the  first time since the 1990s. Ironically, it dropped more in States that  expanded Medicaid. So I am not only disgusted with and sick of such  harsh rhetoric, but I think it has now been proven demonstrably false.   We talk about who will be kicked off their plan. According to the  CBO, 10  [[Page H6040]]  million people lost their employer plans. Those are the plans that, if  they liked, they could keep. Roughly 15 million of the people who are  now insured are insured by virtue of an individual mandate. That means  that we have forcefully compelled American citizens to purchase a good  or service at the risk of forfeiture of their money or their freedom.   We live in a country where you can choose in many places to buy  marijuana. You can choose to bungee jump. You can choose to skydive.  Heck, in some places, you can choose to visit a prostitute. But you  can't choose a healthcare plan that doesn't carry coverage for mental  health or for maternity. You can't do that. That is against the law.   This is about choice. I served in the United States Army as a fire  support officer, and when I left the Army, I made the egregious error  of attending law school--just kidding. When I did that, I chose not to  have healthcare because as I looked at what I was able to do on the  limited amount of money that my family had and did a cost-benefit  analysis and the fact I was in relatively good shape and young, I  determined that our family's best interests were served by not spending  that money. It was a crazy, brazen risk that I think paid off, but it  certainly should be within the purview of decisions that Americans are  allowed to make, and right now it is not.    I am frustrated, but I am fighting. A lot of people are frustrated,  but they are fighting. I want to see our leadership succeed. I want to  see this Nation continue to be unequivocally the greatest experiment in  freedom that the Earth has ever known. But if we continue to try to  parlay largesse in failed programs into political power, we won't. We  won't.   The time to measure things based not on intentions, but results is  nigh. In Oregon, they spent hundreds of millions of dollars to create a  website for the ObamaCare exchange that failed to enroll a single  individual, and nobody was fired and nobody went to prison. I was a  prosecutor for a long time, and I will tell you, if you waste or  defraud people of 100, 200, $300 million, you usually either lose your  job or go to prison. But if you are in politics in Oregon, you are  rewarded because, by gosh, you had great intentions.   Let's judge these things not by their intentions, but by their  outcomes. Let's not argue about who has coverage, but about who has  access to affordable care. Let's support revision that drives down  premiums and deductibles, and let's trumpet our victories based on whom  we actually help, not whom we intended to help.                                time  2000    I stand united with the bulk of my colleagues. I know there are some  who might have said one thing and now do another. This is an avenue by  which we might find out who they are.   I don't, for a moment, question the individual motives of Members. I  think they have an opportunity to distinguish themselves by virtue of  signing onto this resolution.   I ask you again, if you are watching at home, to contact your Member  if you agree with what I said and ask them if they will come to this  bar when we are in session and sign their name to H. Res. 458 and  demonstrate that they are willing to do the exact same thing now, when  it counts, that they did dozens and dozens of times under the previous  administration when they knew that their actions would be met with a  veto pen.   I don't do this to score political points, I don't do this to make my  name bigger, and I don't do this because it feels good. I do this  because we owe it to the giants whose shoulders we stand upon--Patrick  Henry; Thomas Jefferson; Martin Luther King, Jr.; Abraham Lincoln;  Barbara Johns; John F. Kennedy; and Ronald Reagan--the people who gave  us the opportunity to be as successful and great as we are. Don't  piddle it away. Be responsible. Be willing to say no when no is the  appropriate answer, and do what is right.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, July 20, 2017, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
