 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Representative  Norton, for her leadership on getting this bill to the floor, and I  thank her for yielding to me.   I also thank my good friends, Mr. Pfluger and Mr. Arrington, for  carrying this legislation along with Senator Cruz, Senator Lujan, and  Senator Cornyn on the Senate side for their work on this important  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to designate a portion  of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor as Interstate 27. I-27 starts in my  hometown of Laredo, Texas, which ranks number one in trade of all the  Nation's 450-plus airports, seaports, and border crossings. It starts  off in Laredo, then goes up into west Texas and off to New Mexico.   In the fiscal year 2022 appropriations bill, I was able to secure  language designating this as a future interstate making it eligible for  Federal funding.   This bill today formally names it the I-27 in Texas and in New  Mexico. Upgrading this route to an interstate will result in a $17.2  billion increase in the Texas GDP and 178,000 of new jobs.   I certainly urge my colleagues in the House to pass this bipartisan  bill to support trade and growth in Texas and New Mexico. I see my good  friend Mr. Arrington, and I thank him for his leadership in west Texas.  I am glad that we are able to connect Laredo with west Texas and onto  New Mexico.
