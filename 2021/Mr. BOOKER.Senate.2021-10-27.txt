 Mr. President, I first want to say before my colleague  leaves--I know he has a packed day--when I came to the U.S. Senate, I  found a friend, I found a mentor, and I found a leader on issues of  justice. The incredible friend I have in the Senator from Illinois--he  has been leading on issues from immigration reform and fighting for  Dreamers all the way to being the principal leader on the Democratic  side for the passage of the First Step Act.   I will never forget that he invited me to the White House in my  earliest days with then-President Obama, centering me on that table. I  had just gotten here, and he then was talking about these issues--the  issues of mass incarceration, the issues of racial discrimination and  incarceration. What I rise to talk about really is an issue that my  colleague has been dealing with for 35 years. He gave important  history.    It was a bipartisan issue 35 years ago when the Senate and House of  Representatives voted to pass the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and the  President signed it into law that year. He said, very specifically, one  of the things it did was create a massive sentencing disparity between  crack and powder cocaine. The bill made it so that five grams of crack  cocaine--the example that my colleague gave--carried the same mandatory  minimum prison sentence as 500 grams of powder cocaine. That is a 100- to-1 disparity.   What is very powerful to me is what Maya Angelou said. She said:         Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you       know better, do better.    And that is the leadership of Senator Dick Durbin. Understanding that  this was a failure, that the policy did not achieve its intended  purpose--in fact, it created, as he described, the opposite--Dick  Durbin then led this body towards the long process of making reforms  happen.   I was proud that when I got into the Senate, Senator Durbin told me  the story of how we got it from 100 to 1 down to 18 to 1. It wasn't  necessarily based on science. It wasn't necessarily based on law  enforcement evidence. It was a negotiation between Senator Durbin and  another Republican colleague. I love the story because Senator Durbin  pushed for what we are asking for right now. He then fought for 1 to 1.  He couldn't get it but was able to negotiate down from 100 to 1 to 18  to 1.   So what I would like to do is read real quickly the research that  looked at cocaine use in the United States from right before this bill  was first passed up until 2013. I want to quote:         Despite harsher ADAA penalties for crack compared to powder       cocaine, there was no decrease in crack use following       implementation of sentencing policies . . . although both       powder cocaine use and misuse of prescription drugs (the       negative control) decreased.    The report concluded that ``these findings suggest that mandatory  minimum sentencing may not be an effective method of deterring cocaine  use.''   This has been the growing consensus about the War on Drugs on both  sides of the aisle. It has been one that has been changing policy.   I am so grateful for Senator Durbin's work chipping away at the  mistakes that were made.   During the time between when I was in law school in the 1990s and  mayor of the largest city in my State in 2006, we saw the prison  population explode in this country. In that period, we were building a  new prison or jail--about 1 every 10 days. We became the place on the  planet Earth with the most incarcerated people. One-third of all the  women incarcerated on planet Earth are now in the United States of  America; one out of every four incarcerated people, period--in the  United States of America.   A growing consensus of bipartisan work led by Senator Durbin with his  wingman from Jersey has been beginning to undermine that, with our  partners. So we saw the 2018 passage of the First Step Act, a bill  which was made retroactive, and we saw thousands of people liberated  from Federal prison who were unjustly sentenced under that 1986 law.  The bill Senator Durbin and I wrote and introduced, the EQUAL Act--this  is again Senator Durbin's leadership--is now our opportunity to do  better.   It must feel good for everyone who understands the good intentions  but disastrous results of the crack cocaine-powder cocaine disparity.  For all those who understand that we say equal justice under law, but  the disproportionate impact it had on Black and Brown communities,  further punishing African-American communities in a disproportionate  way--in fact, incarcerated Black men at rates that we now have more  Black men under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves in  1850. So we are working to do better.   The bill that I picked up to partner with Senator Durbin on passed  the House of Representatives. And Senator Durbin hinted at this--I  would have never expected it--it passed with overwhelming bipartisan  support. The bill was championed by Democrats and Republicans. It  passed with 149 Republicans voting for it, and now it is over here. The  great thing is, our list of cosponsors, which Senator Durbin read, is  growing. I think we will have an announcement over the next few days of  other Republicans joining this bill.   We can't change the past, but we can make for a better future. We  can't undo the disparities that have disproportionately sent African  Americans to prison, but we can make for a more equal and more just  future.   There is an old saying that ``the arc of the moral universe is long,  but it bends towards justice.'' It was a Martin Luther King quote. But  he also said that ``change does not roll in on the wheels of  inevitability.'' It must be carried in on the backs of people who are  willing to struggle for it, people who still believe that this Nation  can be a symbol to this world about justice and its justice system.   A terrible mistake was made 35 years ago. I was a teenager. There are  people right now unjustly incarcerated--an affront to our most sacred  ideal in this country, that of liberty. They are there because of this  mistake. We have not fixed it. It was grievous. We have not fixed it.  It is wrong. This is our moment. It is a moment of redemption to right  past wrongs, to set this Nation on a more just course, to bend the arc  of the moral universe more towards justice.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I urge them to be arc  benders. Together, we can make this a more perfect Union.   I yield the floor.
