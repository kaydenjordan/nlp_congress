 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  rule for my bill, H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare  Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory  Board, or IPAB, which was created solely as a cost containment  mechanism as part of the Affordable Care Act. It has nothing to do  about quality of care or access to care. I can't think of anything more  important, Mr. Speaker, that this Congress should be doing than  providing quality care and access to care for our senior citizens of  this country, some 58 million of them.   Whatever your feelings may be about the ACA, this provision has had  strong bipartisan opposition from its beginning, and it was not  contained in the House Democrat's version of the bill, but was jammed  in by the Senate at the end.   If you still need convincing on just how unpopular this provision of  the law is, ask yourself: How often do we see a bill come to the floor  under a rule that has 270 bipartisan cosponsors?   Passing this bill will send a strong message to our Senate colleagues  that the time to act is now.   Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming bipartisan support for Members is only  outdone by the overwhelming nationwide coalition of support.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Protect My  Doctor and Me coalition, a letter that has been signed by nearly 800  groups representing patients, providers, and all sectors of the  healthcare industry with support in all 50 States.                                                  September 6, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned organizations--      representing Medicare beneficiaries and patients, all sectors       of the healthcare industry as well as employers and other       purchasers of health care--believe strongly that the Medicare       program must protect patient access to quality healthcare.       The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a provision of       the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), not       only poses a threat to that access but also, once activated,       will shift healthcare costs to consumers in the private       sector and infringe upon the decisionmaking responsibilities       and prerogatives of the Congress. We request your support to       repeal IPAB.        IPAB, as constructed under PPACA, is a board comprised of       Presidential appointees who will be charged with making       recommendations to cut Medicare expenditures if spending       growth reaches an arbitrary level. Once the Secretary of       Health and Human Services (HHS) implements an IPAB       recommendation, that action is not subject to administrative       or judicial review. As constructed, IPAB is granted       unprecedented powers--even the ability to change laws       previously enacted by Congress--with virtually no oversight.        The potential impact of this board causes deep concern       among our organizations and the millions of Americans we       represent. IPAB proponents suggest that the board will be an       asset in developing needed healthcare delivery reforms. That       goal, however, is not realistically achievable. The law       requires IPAB to achieve scoreable savings within a one-year       time period. Thus, instead of pursuing long-term reforms that       may not achieve immediate savings, IPAB is more likely to       consider short-term savings in the form of payment cuts for       healthcare providers. This was, in fact, the conclusion of       the Congressional Budget Office, which stated that IPAB is       most likely to focus on payment rates or methodologies for       services provided by non-exempt providers.        This would be devastating for patients, affecting access to       care and innovative therapies. Already, the number of       physicians unable to accept new Medicare patients due to low       reimbursement rates has been increasing over the past several       years. IPAB-generated payment reductions would only increase       the access difficulties faced by too many Medicare       beneficiaries. Furthermore, payment reductions to Medicare       providers will almost certainly result in a shifting of       health costs to employers and consumers in the private       sector.        Under IPAB's provisions, the responsibility for enacting       healthcare system changes of this magnitude would be       transferred from the legislative branch to the executive.       More specifically, an unelected board without adequate       oversight or accountability would be taking actions       historically reserved for the public's elected       representatives in the U.S. House and Senate. This is an       unacceptable decisionmaking process for a program that       millions of our nation's seniors and individuals with       disabilities rely upon.        Moreover, if IPAB does not act within the law's required       timeframe or if IPAB members are not appointed by the       President or confirmed by the Senate, the law transfers       IPAB's responsibilities solely to the HHS Secretary. This       places an enormous degree of power in the hands of one       unelected individual.        We strongly support bringing greater cost-efficiency to the       Medicare program. We also advocate continuing efforts to       improve the quality of care delivered to Medicare       beneficiaries.        The Independent Payment Advisory Board will achieve neither       of these objectives and will only weaken, not strengthen, a       program critical to the health and well-being of current and       future beneficiaries. We urge Congress to eliminate the IPAB       provision.

Mr. Speaker, let me just read one paragraph:   ``IPAB, as constructed under PPACA, is a board comprised of  Presidential appointees who will be charged with making recommendations  to cut Medicare expenditures if spending growth reaches an arbitrary  level. Once the Secretary of Health and Human Services implements an  IPAB recommendation, that action is not subject to administrative or  judicial review. As constructed, IPAB is granted unprecedented powers-- even the ability to change laws previously enacted by Congress--with  virtually no oversight.'' Peter Orszag, President Obama's Office of  Management and Budget Director, said it was the largest transfer of  power from the legislative branch to a bureaucratic branch since the  Federal Reserve, and that is a mouthful.   Democrats and Republicans may not always agree on how to get things  done around here, but when you can bring 270 House Members together on  one bill, it is pretty clear that something needs to be done  immediately.   We were lucky this summer that the Medicare trustees report indicated  that IPAB would not trigger until 2021 or 2022, but our back is against  the wall and we must act. We cannot afford to let 15 unelected,  unaccountable bureaucrats make decisions for our Nation's 58 million  Medicare enrollees with no checks from Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this.   I refer also to a bipartisan letter I signed on December 17, 2009,  that was written to the Speaker of the House at that time, Nancy  Pelosi, which said the following:   ``Finally, as the people's elected representatives, we must oppose  any proposal to create a board that would surrender our legislative  authority and responsibility for a Medicare program to unelected,  unaccountable officials within the very same branch of government that  is charged with implementing the Medicare policies that affect so many  Americans.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and support  the final passage because that will show the American people you stand  with America's seniors.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the  Record the following letter:                                  Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, December 17, 2009.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Speaker: In July, 75 members of the U.S. House       of Representatives wrote to express strong opposition to       proposals, such as the ``Independent Medicare Advisory       Council (IMAC) Act of 2009'' and the ``Medicare Payment       Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Reform Act of 2009'' (H.R 2718,       S. 1110, S. 1380), that would divest Congress of its       authority for Medicare payment policy and place this       responsibility in an executive branch commission or board.       This letter clearly stated opposition to the inclusion of       these or any other similar proposals in health reform or any       other legislation, but with recent developments, we, the       undersigned members, believe it is imperative to restate our       strong opposition to any proposal or legislation that would       place authority for Medicare payment policy in an unelected,       executive branch commission or board.        Consistent with the July letter, on November 7, 2009, the       House passed the ``Affordable Health Care for America Act''       (H.R. 3962) did not include provisions to create an unelected       Medicare board. Yet, at present, the Senate is considering       the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009,''       which includes provisions to create an ``Independent Medicare       Advisory Board'' (IMAB) that would effectively end Congress's       authority over Medicare payment policy.        To create an unelected, unaccountable Medicare commission       as envisioned in the Senate's IMAB proposal would end       Congress's ability to shape Medicare to provide the best       policies for beneficiaries in our communities around the       country. Through the legislative process, and from Medicare's       beginning, Members have been able to represent the needs of       their communities by improving benefits for seniors and the       disabled, affecting policies that fill the health care       workforce pipeline, and ensuring that hospitals are equipped       to care for diverse populations across our individual       districts. Such a responsibility is one that is not taken,       nor should be given away, lightly.        These proposals would severely limit Congressional       oversight of the Medicare program, and to place this       authority within the executive branch, without Congressional       oversight or judicial review, would eliminate the       transparency of Congressional hearings and debate. Without       the open and transparent legislative process, Medicare       beneficiaries and the range of providers who care for them       would be greatly limited in their ability to help develop and       implement new policies that improve the health care of our       nation's seniors. An executive branch Medicare board would       also effectively eliminate Congress's ability to work with       the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to create and       implement demonstration and pilot projects designed to       evaluate new and advanced policies such as home care for the       elderly, the patient-centered medical home, new less invasive       surgical procedures, collaborative efforts between hospitals       and physicians, and programs designed to eliminate fraud and       abuse.        The creation of a Medicare board would also effectively       eliminate state and community input into the Medicare       program, removing the ability to develop and implement       policies expressly applicable to different patient       populations. Instead, national policies that would flow from       such a board would ignore the significant differences and       health care needs of states and communities. Geographic and       demographic variances that exist in our nation's health care       system and patient populations would be dangerously       disregarded. Furthermore, all providers in all states would       be required to comply even if these policies were detrimental       to the patients they serve. Such a commission could not only       threaten the ability of Medicare beneficiaries, but of all       Americans, to access the care they need.        Finally, as the people's elected representatives, we must       oppose any proposal to create a board that would surrender       our legislative authority and responsibility for the Medicare       program to unelected, unaccountable officials within the very       same branch of government that is charged with implementing       the Medicare policies that affect so many Americans.       Therefore, we must strongly oppose the creation of IMAB,       IMAC, a reconstituted MedPAC or any Medicare board or       commission that would undermine our ability to represent the       needs of the seniors and disabled in our own communities.       Again, we urge you to reject the inclusion of these or any       like proposal in health reform or any other legislation.            Sincerely,        Richard Neal, Gary Ackerman, Shelley Berkley, Brian       Bilbray, Tim Bishop, Marsha Blackburn, Mary Bono Mack, Ginny       Brown-Waite, Michael Burgess, G.K.

The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:  [[Page H8402]]                 An Amendment to H. Res. 600 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for her       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R.  849, the  [[Page H8415]]  Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017, a bipartisan bill  with 270 cosponsors, that repeals two sections of the Affordable Care  Act and terminates the Independent Payment Advisory Board--or the  IPAB--once and for all. I thank Chairman Brady and Chairman Walden for  bringing this important bill to the floor.   I also want to start by thanking my lead Democrat cosponsor from  California, Dr. Raul Ruiz. Dr. Ruiz and his staff have worked  tirelessly with my staff to get more cosponsors this Congress than we  have ever had before, including 45 Democrats. Seeing such strong  bipartisan support for my bill only makes sense, however, since doing  away with the IPAB has been a bipartisan idea since it was first  proposed.   In December of 2009, I joined Congressman Richard Neal and 72 other  bipartisan Members in writing then-Speaker Pelosi expressing our  opposition to the IPAB's creation. On the day the ACA passed the House,  I filed legislation to repeal the IPAB, and have received bipartisan  support in every Congress since. This is about access for seniors' care  and quality of their care. By the way, the IPAB was not in the House  version of the Affordable Care Act. Only the Senate sent that back over  here. So it was not part of the House to begin with.   We got lucky this summer that the Medicare trustees' report did not  trigger the IPAB. Otherwise, there would have been significant  statutory requirements to cut Medicare within a year. These cuts would  have been made to provide reimbursements, which would do nothing but  drive providers out of Medicare and would eliminate options for our  seniors to receive healthcare.   Peter Orszag, President Obama's Office of Management and Budget  Director, said this was the greatest ceding of power from the Congress  to a bureaucracy since the formation of the Federal Reserve. Remember,  it has been stated here, Mr. Speaker, that the board hasn't been  formed. That means one person makes these decisions, not the Congress.  Medicare recipients can't come to their elected official and effect  changes in this IPAB if it is enacted, and it will be.   One of the major concerns we hear today is that the CBO has estimated  that this bill will cost over $17 billion that is not paid for. First  of all, the CBO describes its estimates as ``extremely uncertain''  because it is quite possible that under current law, the IPAB will not  be triggered.   Secondly, this is the same dilemma we were in with the sustainable  growth rate--SGR. Medicare says to doctors: You go out and provide the  care, but if you provide too much, we will cut your payments.   As a physician myself, having seen how much havoc the SGR wreaked  every year, we can't afford to put providers through this again. We  spent months and years getting that corrected. Knowing that many  Members were concerned about the offsets in previous years, we have a  bill on the floor today that all of our cosponsors can support.   I look forward to seeing all 270 of my cosponsors voting in favor of  passage in order to preserve Medicare for our Nation's seniors. We have  a chance to send a strong statement of support to Americans of Medicare  age that do not want to see their healthcare arbitrarily cut by a body  of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, or the Secretary of HHS, if  the board is not empaneled. If there are hard decisions to be made on  Medicare, Congress should not abdicate that duty to a group of people  with no oversight or legal recourse. Those decisions should be made by  the people elected as representatives of the people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this  bill and maintain Medicare services for our Nation's seniors, because  this is truly a bipartisan issue that will affect all seniors equally.
