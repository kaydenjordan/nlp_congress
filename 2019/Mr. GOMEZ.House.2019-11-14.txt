 Mr. Speaker, we are just days away from another funding  cliff for our community health centers.   This is unacceptable. Our Nation's community health centers need  stable, long-term funding to serve the most vulnerable patients in our  communities effectively.   Community health centers are a bright spot in our Nation's healthcare  system. Last year, they served 29 million patients across the country,  including 693,000 who visited 74 different sites in my district alone.  Community health centers like Clinica Romero in Boyle Heights provide  care to immigrants, low-income individuals, communities of color, and  the homeless.   For many Americans, community health centers are the first and only  place they turn when they need to see a medical professional. Making  sure that these Americans receive the care they need is good for our  healthcare system, for our economy, and for working families in all of  our communities.   We have long had bipartisan support on community health centers, but  our failure to provide long-term funding hurts their ability to budget  and plan. It creates uncertainty and has an impact on the patients they  serve, including hundreds of thousands of my constituents.   With them in mind, I urge my colleagues to join me to support stable,  long-term funding for our Nation's community health centers.                            ____________________
