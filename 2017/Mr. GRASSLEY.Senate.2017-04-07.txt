 Madam President, we are about to vote on the nomination  of Judge Gorsuch, so I would like to say to my colleagues why I am so  pleased that we will soon be referring to him as ``Justice Gorsuch.''   I opened our Judiciary Committee hearing with this:         One of Justice Scalia's best opinions begins with this       declaration: it is the ``proud boast of our democracy that we       have a government of laws and not of men. . . . Without a       secure structure of separated powers, our Bill of Rights       would be worthless.''    The separation of powers in our Constitution is a guardian of our  liberty. Judge Gorsuch understands that. His deep understanding of the  separation of powers enlivens his opinions.   By faithfully enforcing the boundaries among the branches of  government and the power of the Federal Government in our lives, this  Justice will ensure that the law protects our liberties.   Here is the other thing that is important about a judge who respects  the separation of powers: We know he will be independent. He told us  that he is his own man, that no person speaks for him. He is not  beholden to the President who appointed him. His testimony shows that  he is not beholden to us in the Congress either. He wouldn't compromise  his independence to win confirmation votes. He passed the test.   This is a man of integrity, and his qualifications for the bench are  exceptional. You know the story: bachelor's from Columbia University,  Harvard Law School, doctorate from Oxford University, partnership at a  prestigious law firm, and high-level Justice Department service for the  people of our country, but most importantly, a decade-long record of  faithfully applying the law on the Federal bench in 2,700 cases as a  member of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Let me sum up this way: This brilliant, honest, humble man is a  judge's judge, and he will make a superb Justice.   I yield the floor.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, there are some people who need to have a  thank-you for what we just completed here--people who hardly ever get  any attention. So I will take a couple of minutes to express my  appreciation to some of the staff who worked on this Supreme Court  nomination.   The staff for both the majority and minority put in a lot of hours  and reviewed a lot of material. Their work ensured that the hearing we  held for Judge Gorsuch went smoothly and was fair to all of the  Members. Our staff reviewed all of the 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch  participated in as well as 180,000 pages of documents that were  produced by the Department of Justice and the George W. Bush  Presidential Library and Museum that were related to that nomination.   First, on my staff, I would like to recognize my Judiciary Committee  staff director, Kolan Davis. Mr. Davis has been with me for 31 years,  and I always value his wise counsel.   I thank, as well, my personal office chief of staff, Jill Kozeny, who  has been with me for 27 years.   My deputy staff director is Rita Lari, and my chief nominations  counsel is right here at my side, Ted Lehman.   I would also like to thank counsels Megan Lacy, Lauren Mehler, Kasey  O'Connor, and Katharine Willey. Each of them worked incredibly hard.   Also on the team were several special counsels who joined the staff  to work on this important nomination. They are Dan Guarnera, Bill Lane,  Katie Roholt, and Carol Szurkowski.   Every one of these talented lawyers played a very important role, and  I think every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee benefited from  their wise counsel throughout this confirmation process.   I would also like to acknowledge and thank Ranking Member Feinstein,  the Senator from California. The ranking member and her staff  approached this process seriously from the very beginning. So I want to  thank her staff for all the work they have put into preparing for the  hearing and the debate, both in committee and here on the floor.   Thank you to her staff director, Jennifer Duck, and several of the  other lawyers on her staff who, I know, put a lot of time into ensuring  that the hearing was a success. They include Paige Herwig, Nazneen  Mehta, and Chan Park.   I am also thankful for my very talented press team, Beth Levine and  Taylor Foy, and for Jen Heins for keeping me on schedule, as well as  for my personal office staff and the rest of the Judiciary Committee  staff who took care of things while I was on the floor and during the  long hours in the hearing.   I also deeply appreciate the work of Senator McConnell's staff who  was constantly in contact with my staff--most importantly John Abegg.   The people I mentioned bore the bulk of the workload and labored  tirelessly night after night, day after day, and nonstop through the  weekends. They deserve our recognition as a tribute to their hard work,  professionalism, and dedication to public service.   Finally, my thanks to the Judiciary Committee's chief clerk, Roslyne  Turner, and her team, Michelle Heller and Jason Covey.   All of these staff members contributed to this process, and we would  not have been able to conduct such a fair and thorough hearing without  their hard work and their professionalism. To each of them, I extend a  heartfelt thanks, and if I left anybody out, I will buy them a Dairy  Queen.   Mr. President, finally, my wife Barbara is in the Capitol today. As  always, I thank her for her support and partnership for more than 62  years.   I yield the floor.
