 Mr. Speaker, I really wish I could say that  caring for our veterans is a bipartisan issue, something we all agree  on. Instead, for the first time in years, the appropriations for  military construction and VA will not be bipartisan because my  colleagues across the aisle have not put veterans first. Instead, they  have tacked onto their VA bill a kitchen sink of culture wars.   H.R. 4366 would trample on our veterans' freedoms, slash access to  reproductive care, and slash access to gender-affirming care. It would  prohibit training that helps people from different backgrounds work  together that addresses the inequalities that still exist in our  military. It would allow homophobia to run rampant.   This legislation makes our VA facilities less welcoming for the  thousands of diverse New Mexicans who receive care there.   Every homeowner knows it is better to fix a leaking roof right away  because if not, it is going to be really expensive.   Yet, this bill cuts $1.5 billion from military construction. Our  military housing and health clinics are leaking, but these cuts will  cost us so much more in the future. We must do more than just thank our  veterans for their service. We can't just use words. We must actually  back it up with resources.   When Democrats led the House, we passed the Honoring our PACT Act to  expand healthcare coverage and compensate veterans exposed to toxic  substances, which 174 Republicans voted against. Democrats listened to  the needs of our communities and passed legislation that made an actual  difference in their lives.   Now veterans have until August 9 to file a claim to receive  retroactive 2023 benefits. To make sure our veterans know about these  benefits, I am hosting a PACT Act townhall on August 1.   That is what it looks like to not just thank veterans but to truly  care about the patriots who served our country. That is the difference  that Democratic leadership makes.
