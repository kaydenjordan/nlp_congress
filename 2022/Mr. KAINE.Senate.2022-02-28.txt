 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Auto Reenroll  Act of 2022, alongside Representative Kathy Manning, who has introduced  companion legislation in the House of Representatives. Enacting this  bill would improve financial security for Americans by strengthening  their private retirement savings.   Nearly 7 in 10 Americans working in the private sector have access to  employer-sponsored retirement plans, but a quarter of those with access  do not participate in those plans. This means less money saved for  retirement. Often, it means leaving money on the table, in the form of  employer-matching contributions. Encouraging more employees to  participate in their workplace plans would increase their overall  compensation and improve their financial security and retirement  outlook.   The Auto Reenroll Act of 2022 would boost participation through a  simple change to the automatic enrollment safe harbor. Automatic  enrollment plans have been tremendously successful at encouraging  workers to participate in employer-sponsored plans, but employees who  opt out of participating at the beginning of their tenure will likely  never reconsider that decision. This bill would build on the success of  auto enrollment by having employers reenroll nonparticipants once every  3 years, providing them another opportunity to consider participation.  This would encourage those employees to reassess their nonparticipation  as their financial situation evolves.   I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation to  bolster private retirement savings.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Murkowski):   S. 3713. A bill to codify the essential holdings of Roe v. Wade (410  U.S. 113 (1973)) and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.  Casey (505 U.S. 833 (1992)); to the Committee on the Judiciary.
