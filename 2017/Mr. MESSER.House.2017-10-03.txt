 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my coauthor on this bill,  Congresswoman Maloney, for her great leadership on this legislation, as  well as Chairman Huizenga, Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters,  and the entire Financial Services Committee team for their hard work on  this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, it is a rare occasion in Washington when Republicans and  Democrats can come together and get behind a change to the banking  regulations, but we stand here today behind H.R. 1624 because the  banking regulators, frankly, well, they messed it up. They created a  rule that gives foreign municipalities a competitive advantage over our  American cities and towns, and this advantage is hurting our  communities.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is really quite simple. It will help  cities and towns in my State and across the United States save money on  roads and bridges and schools. President Trump has made rebuilding our  infrastructure a priority for our Nation, and this bipartisan bill  paves the way for this type of investment by lowering the price tag for  roads and bridges.   H.R. 1624 reverses a backwards banking regulation that makes it more  expensive for U.S. municipalities to finance infrastructure projects.  Specifically, the bill will amend the regulation to enable more banks  to hold municipal bonds to cover their liquidity requirements. This  change should reduce the cost of borrowing for cities and towns across  the country. Ultimately, this bill helps taxpayers by making it cheaper  to finance infrastructure projects.   H.R. 1624 will help blue States and red States alike, and that is why  you have seen such overwhelming bipartisan support for this in the  Halls of Congress. The bill passed the Financial  [[Page H7706]]  Services Committee unanimously this summer, and very similar  legislation passed the Chamber by a voice vote last year.                                time  1515    Still we have got more work to do, and there is now momentum in the  Senate to get H.R. 1624 across the finish line.   The bill is also supported by numerous outside advocacy groups,  including the National Governors Association, the Government Finance  Officers Association, the National League of Cities, the National  Association of State Treasurers, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and  even the State treasurer from my home State of Indiana, my good friend,  Kelly Mitchell.   Mr. Speaker, today we take the first step in this process in the  House toward reversing this backwards regulation, and I urge all my  colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume, and I thank Mr. Messer for his leadership on  this legislation.   He is absolutely correct. He worked very closely with Mrs. Maloney.  This is a bipartisan bill. He correctly stated that we do sometimes get  together and work on issues in ways that we can be helpful, not only to  our constituents in general but to cities and towns. We have talked an  awful lot about wanting to improve our infrastructures, and this is one  way that it certainly can be done.   I would like to point out again the Federal Reserve's role in this  because of the way that they recognized the problem and what they did  to adopt a correction to the problem. So this bill again, as amended,  takes the relief adopted by the Federal Reserve.   Again, this is a case where we had Members who understood this  problem, moved forward on it, and recognized that the Federal Reserve  also recognized the problem. When you have several entities who have  recognized a problem, it certainly makes good sense and good public  policy for everybody to come together to correct it. So with the  Federal Reserve having come forward and adopting this relief, it means  that it is extended to banks regulated by the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.   Again, I wish I could say that every city in the United States would  benefit from it, but not all will. Not all need it. But for those who  do, I think it is important for us to recognize that when we have the  opportunity to come together and to help any part of our country, and  when it is very easy to do so, I think we should do it. So I am very  pleased that we have been able to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who is the lead Democratic  cosponsor of this bill.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking  member for yielding and for her leadership on this issue and so many  others.   I strongly support the bill, and I would like to thank my good friend  from Indiana (Mr. Messer) for his leadership.   We introduced this bill in order to level the playing field for our  cities and States by requiring the banking regulators to treat certain  municipal bonds as liquid assets, just like corporate bonds, stocks,  and other assets.   As a former member of the city council in New York, I know firsthand  the importance of municipal bonds. They allow States and cities to  finance infrastructure, build schools, pave roads, and build subways.  They are all financed with municipal bonds.   Unfortunately, in the banking regulators' liquidity rule--which  requires banks to hold a minimum amount of liquid assets--they chose to  allow corporate bonds to qualify as liquid assets, but completely  excluded municipal bonds--even municipal bonds that are just as liquid  and high-grade as corporate bonds.   This makes no sense, and it effectively discriminates against  municipal bonds and cities. A municipal bond that is just as liquid as  the most liquid corporate bond would not be counted as a liquid asset  under the rule just because it was issued by a municipality rather than  a corporation.   The Fed has already recognized this error and has amended its rule to  fix the problem. But the OCC, which regulates national banks, is still  refusing to amend its rule and insists on favoring corporations over  municipalities. So Mr. Messer and I introduced this bill because this  kind of arbitrary discrimination against municipalities cannot be  allowed to continue.   So in sum, this bill levels the playing field for cities and States  in a way that maintains the safety and soundness of our banking system.  The bill passed the Financial Services Committee 60-0 in July, and last  Congress the bill passed the full House by a voice vote.   So I urge my colleagues to, once again, support this bipartisan  legislation which is critically important for our States and our  cities.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act.   Our Nation has long recognized that we are all endowed by our creator  with certain inalienable rights, chief among them is the right to life.  I am unapologetically pro-life because all human life has dignity and  should be protected, especially the lives of defenseless unborn  children.   Today the House is taking a critical but seemingly uncontroversial  step forward in protecting life by prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks  of pregnancy, or put another way, when unborn children can feel pain.   Currently, the United States is one of only seven countries  worldwide, including North Korea, that still allow late-term abortions.  This bill would end these horrific procedures.   I pray that one day our Nation will protect all unborn children, but  this important bill is a big step forward towards that goal.
