 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  dangerous tax plan that is currently being considered by the House Ways  and Means Committee. House Republicans wrote this proposal behind  closed doors and then presented it to Congress and the public just last  week.   This is not the kind of bipartisan tax plan we need to help lift up  working families, grow our economy, and lead to a better future for our  constituents. In fact, under this proposed plan, about 80 percent of  the benefits will go to the wealthiest 1 percent. While helping out  wealthy individuals and corporations, the proposal hurts many working  families by getting rid of deductions for  [[Page H8526]]  State and local taxes and medical expenses, for example.   Mr. Speaker, there is another place where this bill will hurt working  families. Mr. Speaker, Benjamin Franklin said: ``an investment in  knowledge pays the best interest.'' When it comes to education, this  plan is an inexcusable lost opportunity.   Education is one of the smartest investments we can make, and tax  policy is a place where there is tremendous potential to do great  things. Unfortunately, this tax proposal shortchanges America's  schools, students, and teachers.    Ninety percent of students attend public schools, yet this tax plan  starves public education by making changes to the property tax  deduction and reducing funding sources for the bipartisan Every Student  Succeeds Act.   On top of that, the plan would turn 529 college savings plans into a  Trump-DeVos private school voucher scheme that will primarily aid  wealthy families and will further undermine our public education  system.   This tax plan doesn't just hurt our students, it also hurts teachers.  Right now, across the country, teachers pay an average of $500 a year  out of their pockets to help stock their classrooms with supplies like  pencils, notebooks, and materials to enhance learning, and that has  been offset by a $250 classroom supplies deduction, which is the least  we could do to help those hardworking, underpaid teachers, but this  bill eliminates that deduction for classroom supplies.   We should all also be deeply concerned about the consequences of this  GOP tax plan for families who invest in higher education. The bill  eliminates the student loan interest deduction, making it harder,  rather than easier, for millions of Americans who are working to pay  off their student loans.   On top of that, the bill repeals the lifetime learning credit and the  Hope scholarship credit, has major reductions in tax credits for  tuition, and will make employer-paid tuition count as income.   That is the wrong direction. We need a tax proposal that helps, not  hurts, students and working families.   This proposal takes away important investments in education, and at  the same time will add about $1.5 trillion to the deficit, leaving our  children and grandchildren to pay the bill.   Mr. Speaker, this plan will limit opportunities for people to get  ahead. That is wrong. We should come back to the table and craft a plan  that works for all Americans, not a plan that strongly and wrongly  favors those at the top.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the so-called Save Local  Business Act. This administration and this Congress have already  weakened workplace protections that keep Americans safe from  discrimination at their jobs, and make sure that they receive fair pay  and provide additional opportunities to save for a secure retirement.   Joint employer provisions make sure that employers cannot escape  liability for violating worker protection laws. This standard makes our  laws on overtime pay, on safe workplaces, on minimum wage enforceable.   What this bill does not do is turn franchisors into employers unless  they act like employers. I spent years as a lawyer representing  franchisees, and I know this won't turn franchisors into employers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Signatory Wall  and Ceiling Contractors Alliance. They oppose this bill because it  would put law-abiding small businesses at a competitive disadvantage  with unscrupulous companies that don't respect worker's rights and  don't pay workers the wages they have earned.                                                  Signatory Wall and                                    Ceiling Contractors Alliance,                                    Saint Paul, MN, October 5, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf       of the Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance       (SWACCA) to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3441, the       ``Save Local Business Act.'' This legislation will not       benefit honest small businesses that create good jobs with       family-sustaining wages and benefits. It will actually place       such employers at a permanent competitive disadvantage to       unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at the       expense of their workers and taxpayer-funded social safety-      net programs.        SWACCA is a national alliance of wall and ceiling       contractors committed to working in partnership with our       workers and our customers to provide the highest-quality,       most efficient construction services. Through the superior       training, skill, and efficiency of our workers SWACCA       contractors are able to provide both cost-effective       construction services and middle class jobs with health and       retirement benefits. Our organization prides itself on       representing companies that accept responsibility for paying       fair wages, abiding by health and safety standards, workers       compensation laws, and unemployment insurance requirements.        Unfortunately, however, we increasingly find ourselves       bidding against companies that seek to compete solely on the       basis of labor costs. They do so by relieving themselves of       the traditional obligations associated with being an       employer. The news is littered with examples of contractors       who have sought to reduce costs by willfully violating the       laws governing minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation       unemployment insurance, and workplace safety protections. The       key to this disturbing business model is a cadre of labor       brokers who claim to provide a company with an entire       workforce that follows them to job after job. It is a       workforce that the actual wall or ceiling contractor controls       as a practical matter, but for which it takes no legal       responsibility. In this model workers receive no benefits,       are rarely covered by workers compensation or unemployment       insurance, and are frequently not paid  [[Page H8578]]       in compliance with federal and state wage laws. The joint       employment doctrine is an important means for forcing these       unscrupulous contractors to compete on a level playing field       and to be held accountable for the unlawful treatment of the       workers they utilize.        As an association representing large, medium, and small       businesses, we oppose H.R. 3441 because it proposes a       radical, unprecedented re-definition of joint employment       under both the FLSA and the NLRA that goes far beyond       reversing the standard articulated by the NLRB in Browning-      Ferris or returning to any concept of joint employment that       has ever existed under the FLSA since the Act's passage. H.R.       3441's radical and unprecedented redefinition of joint       employment would proliferate the use of fly-by-night labor       brokers by ensuring that no contractor using a workforce       provided by a labor broker would ever be deemed a joint       employer. This is because the bill precludes a finding of       joint employment unless a company controls each ``of the       essential terms and conditions of employment (including       hiring employees, discharging employees, determining       individual employee rates of pay and benefits, day-to-day       supervision of employees, assigning individual work       schedules, positions and tasks, and administering employee       discipline)''. H.R. 3441 goes further by expressly       countenancing a company using labor brokers retaining control       of the essential aspects of the workers' employment in a       ``limited and routine manner'' without facing any risk of       being a joint employer.        Simply put, H.R. 3441 would create a standard that would       surely accelerate a race to the bottom in the construction       industry and many other sectors of the economy. It would       further tilt the field of competition against honest, ethical       businesses. Any concerns about the prior administration's       recently-rescinded interpretative guidance on joint       employment under the FLSA or the NLRB's joint employment       doctrine enunciated in Browning-Ferris can be addressed in a       far more responsible manner. Make no mistake, H.R. 3441 does       not return the law to any prior precedents or standards. It       creates a radical, new standard. This standard will help       unethical employers get rich not by creating more value, but       instead by ensuring their ability to treat American workers       as a permanent pool of low-wage, subcontracted labor that has       neither benefits nor any meaningful recourse against them       under our nation's labor and employment laws.        On behalf of the membership of SWACCA, thank you in advance       for your attention to our concerns about this legislation.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any       questions or require additional information.            Sincerely,                                                   Timothy J. Wies,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, this legislation would leave workers  behind and would give a free pass to unscrupulous companies that  violate labor laws. Please oppose this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill.  It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the  bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today is another assault on  hardworking Americans who are desperately trying to put food on the  table for their families, scrape together enough money to pay for child  care, and have a roof over their heads.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying that they  need this bill to save local businesses. We all support local  businesses in our community. But my colleagues suggest that unless they  pass this law, franchisors will become joint employers. Well, if they  act like franchisors and control brands and standards, and they don't  do things like hire, fire, and supervise the franchisees' employees,  they won't be. In other words, if they act like a franchisor and not an  employer, they won't be considered a joint employer.   In fact, this bill could actually harm franchisees and take away  their independence because it would allow franchisors to indirectly  control the labor relations of its franchisees, but be insulated from  liability for violations that might arise from that control.   Now, my amendment would require that if a franchisor directs a  franchisee to take an unlawful action that would violate labor laws,  then the franchisor shall be considered a joint employer for the  purpose of the violation.   In other words, if a franchisor acts like an employer, then they  should be held accountable for their actions as an employer. Workers  must be able to get their hard-earned overtime pay and the wages they  are owed. This is common sense.   This motion would protect small businesses, promote the independence  of franchisees, and, importantly, cure the defect in the bill that  insulates franchisors from liability for exercising control over their  franchisees' labor or employment relations.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation currently is an attack on workers'  rights.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
