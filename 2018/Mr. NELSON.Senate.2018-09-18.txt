 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past few weeks, I have been  meeting with residents and business owners in South Florida who are  continuing to experience the health impacts and the financial troubles  as a result of the persistent algae blooms which are on the east coast  of Florida. On the west coast, those algae blooms that are going down  the Caloosahatchee River are supercharging the red tide bacteria in the  gulf, and the profound ecological effect is that of dead sea life  literally littering the beaches. The smell is pungent, and it is  irritating.   I am here to urge my colleagues to support the Water Resources  Development Act--what we refer to as the WRDA bill--because it contains  the authorization for an important reservoir project that could help  alleviate some of the discharges.   When discharges come out of the big lake, Lake Okeechobee, that are  already combined with local runoff and discharges of nutrient-laden  water into the waters and lakes of Florida--particularly the  Caloosahatchee on the west coast and the St. Lucie on the east coast-- then all of that nutrient-laden water is like throwing fertilizer into  water. Since algae is already in the water, if you throw fertilizer  into it, the algae is going to grow. The algae grows, and it turns into  this green gunk. It absorbs all of the oxygen in the water, and it  becomes a dead waterway. The fish can't live because the oxygen is not  there.   There are important things in this Water Resources Development Act,  particularly an in-excess-of-10,000-acre reservoir that is going to be  authorized south of Lake Okeechobee, which would allow for the flow of  some of those discharges.   Last week, the House and the Senate committees of jurisdiction  resolved their differences in conference negotiations and reached an  agreement that passed in the House by a voice vote. We are going to  have the WRDA bill come up in the Senate. We should take it up and pass  this bill immediately so it can go to the White House for signature and  become law so we can get to work on the reservoir that will be south of  Lake Okeechobee.   The reservoir is particularly important and timely right now because  of this algae crisis in Florida. It is also a critical piece of our  broader Everglades restoration effort. We need additional storage so we  can move water gradually from Lake Okeechobee, clean it up, and send it  south to the areas of the Everglades that are starved for freshwater.   One of the true champions of Everglades restoration, Nat Reed, passed  away earlier this summer. I expressed remarks on the floor of the  Senate about what he meant to our State and to our country and its  environment. I note, today, that I am filing legislation with my  colleague Senator Rubio to formally rename the Hobe Sound National  Wildlife Refuge after Nathaniel Reed.   When we all learned the sad news in July that Nat had passed away,  there were conversations about the most fitting tribute and what it  might be. Naming this particular refuge after Nat Reed makes sense  because the refuge wouldn't be there without his family.   In 1967, Nat's father, Joseph Reed, established the Reed Wilderness  Seashore Sanctuary on the northern end of Jupiter Island and had it  designated as a national landmark. In 1969, he gave Florida Audubon the  piece of land that today is the island portion of the Hobe Sound  National Wildlife Refuge. Today, the refuge provides habitat for dozens  of threatened and endangered species. In fact, this stretch of beach is  one of the most productive sea turtle nesting areas in the entire  Southeastern United States. So it is fitting that we rename the Hobe  Sound National Refuge, which Nat Reed's father started, after this  great American environmentalist.   I urge my colleagues to pass Senator Rubio's and my bill, to take it  up and pass it very soon to honor Nat Reed's legacy. I urge the  majority leader to call up the WRDA bill for a vote immediately so we  can get on with this new reservoir project and many other projects that  are in the water bill.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, on the 11th of November 2018, the world  celebrates the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. America  entered the Great War 2 years, 8 months, and 9 days after it started,  but with our allies and through great sacrifice, defeated the Central  Powers.   In honor of the Great War centennial, two men have served as thankful  ambassadors from our oldest ally: France. Mr. Christophe de Goulaine  and Mr. Pierre Lauvergeat have undertaken a historic effort named  Operation Twin Links. In tribute to American World War I veterans and  their families, the two men traveled almost 5,000 miles of American  countryside on a fully restored 1918 Harley Davidson 1000 18-J  motorcycle. This is the very model our servicemembers rode throughout  the Western Front. It is also the same model that Corporal Roy Holtz of  Chippewa Falls, WI, rode into Germany on November 12, 1918, in the  famous photograph titled, ``The first Yank and Harley to enter  Germany.'' The motorcycle is named Bony, after the French commune which  is home to Somme American Cemetery and Memorial, the final resting  place for 1,844 American soldiers.   Operation Twin Link's historic journey of remembrance and thanks  began at Fort Caroline National Memorial in Jacksonville, FL, which  shares a special linkage as twin city to Nantes, France. From there,  Bony traveled to the Harley Davidson Headquarters in Milwaukee, WI,  then to Las Vegas, NV. Along the way, these ambassadors made numerous  stops, thanking Americans for their support during those dark times in  history and reminding us all of the links shared between our two great  nations. Bony's trip concluded on September 10, 2018, in Jacksonville,  FL, where Mr. de Goulaine's ancestor, French explorer Rene de Goulaine  de Laudonniere, founded the first European settlement in America.   As we near the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, I invite  all Americans to remember the sacrifice of our great generation and our  enduring allies in Europe. Furthermore, it is with gratitude and  appreciation that I thank Mr. de Goulaine and Mr. Lauvergeat for  reminding us of the deep friendship of the people of France and for  undertaking this feat to bring home a symbol of American ingenuity,  steadfastness, and resolve from World War I.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize the  legacy of an extraordinary fourth generation Floridian and friend who  passed away last weekend.   Otis Odell ``Pete'' Clemons died on September 16, 2018, at the age of  91. He was a well-known Florida cowboy. In fact, he won the Best All  Around Cowboy honors at Silver Spurs Rodeo a record eight times. His  rodeo skills inspired artist Buster Kenton to create a cartoon  character named Cowboy Jake.   Pete served his country in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After  the war, he attended the University of Florida and earned his  bachelor's degree in 1950.   He became the owner and operator of the Okeechobee Livestock Market.  The market continues to operate today under the management of his two  sons, Jeff and Todd Clemons.   Notably, Pete is the only person to be inducted into the Florida  Agriculture Hall of Fame and the Florida Sports Hall of Fame. In 2009,  he received the Florida Folk Heritage Award in recognition of his  successful rodeo career, as well as his contributions to the State's  cattle-ranching community.   Pete was a longtime member of the Okeechobee Cattlemen's Association  and served as honorary director of the Florida Cattlemen's Association.  He was an active member of the First United Methodist Church.   I extend my deepest condolences to his family, particularly his wife  Susanne and his children: Jeff Clemons and his wife Debbie and Todd  Clemons and his wife Tina. Pete is also survived by his siblings,  Billie Jean Reynolds and her husband Mark and Bud Clemons and his wife  Kathy, as well as his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.                            ____________________
