Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology, which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor, thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit       (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube       assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight       that provides a target engagement capability in adverse       weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be       used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and       target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second       generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To       facilitate initial loading and subsequent updating of       software, all on-board missile software is uploaded via the       CLU after mating and prior to launch.        4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the       top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Brazil can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Brazil.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally that continues to be an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in North Africa.        The proposed sale will improve Morocco's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing timely Intelligence,       Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition       for its security and defense. The capability is a deterrent       to regional threats and to strengthen its self-defense.       Morocco has demonstrated a commitment to modernizing its       military and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be General Atomic       Aeronautical Systems Inc., San Diego, CA; Lockheed Martin       Inc., Bethesda, MD; Raytheon Inc., Waltham, MA; and Leonardo       SpA, Rome, Italy. The purchaser typically requests offsets.       Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between       the purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Morocco.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-12       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1.

Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 22-0J. This       notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the       level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in       the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 20-69 of October 21,       2020.            Sincerely,                                                   James A. Hursch,                                                          Director.        Enclosures.                            Transmittal No. 22-0J       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(C), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative       Office (TECRO) in the United States.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(l), AECA Transmittal No.: 20-69; Date:       October 21, 2020; Military Department: Navy.        Funding Source: National Funds.        (iii) Description: On October 21, 2020, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       20-69 of the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the       Arms Export Control Act, of one hundred thirty-five (135)       AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-      ER) Missiles; four (4) ATM-84H SLAM-ER Telemetry Missiles;       and twelve (12) CATM-84H Captive Air Training Missiles       (CATM). Also included are one hundred fifty-one (151)       containers, spare and repair parts, support and test       equipment, publications and technical documentation,       personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government       and contractor representatives' technical assistance,       engineering and logistics support services, and other related       elements of logistics support. The estimated total cost was       $1.008 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted       $608 million of this total.  [[Page S4431]]         This transmittal reports increases in MDE value by $147       million to $755 million and non-MDE value by $145 million to       $545 million. This will result in an overall total case value       increase of $292 million to $1.3 billion.        (iv) Significance: Reassessment of recent market trends by       the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has identified an       increase in cost of parts from suppliers, ranging from 20% to       120% over the past 12 months. Global supply chain logistics       issues are impacting Long-lead items and increasing       volatility to pricing, as some sub-tier suppliers are       refusing to bid and others are offering pricing that is only       valid for very limited timeframes, resulting in the need to       qualify new sources. The OEM has repriced the effort to       account for these price increases to add to the stability of       this effort. There is no change to sensitive equipment or       quantity/type of MDE previously notified.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale serves U.S. national,       economic, and security interests by supporting the       recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces       and to maintain a credible defensive capability. The proposed       sale will help improve the security of the recipient and       assist in maintaining political stability, military balance,       and economic progress in the region.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensitivity of       Technology statement contained in the original notification       applies to items reported here.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       CONFIDENTIAL.

This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and       security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing       efforts to maintain a credible defensive capability. The       proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient       and assist in maintaining political stability, military       balance, and economic progress in the region.        The proposed sale will contribute to the modernization of       the recipient's capability to meet current and future threats       as it will be able to employ a highly reliable and effective       system to increase their warfighting effectiveness, as       needed, which can counter or  [[Page S4433]]       deter aggressions by demonstrated precision against air       targets. This equipment will contribute to the recipient's       goal of updating its military capability while further       enhancing interoperability with the United States and other       allies. The recipient will have no difficulty absorbing this       equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missiles and       Defense, Tucson, AZ. The recipient has requested offsets. At       this time, agreements are undetermined and will be defined in       negotiations between the recipient and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       permanent assignment of any additional U.S. Government or       contractor representatives to recipient. Support teams will       travel to recipient on a temporary basis.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-46       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder Missile represents a       substantial increase in missile acquisition and kinematics       performance over the AIM-9M and replaces the AIM-9X Block I       Missile configuration. The missile includes a high off-      boresight seeker, enhanced countermeasure rejection       capability, low drag/high angle of attack airframe and the       ability to integrate with the Helmet Mounted Cueing System.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the recipient.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(C) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 20-0M. This       notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the       level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in       the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 15-51 of November 4,       2015.

Transmittal No. 20-0M       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(C), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of the United Arab Emirates.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 15-51; Date:       November 4, 2015; Military Department: Air Force.        (iii) Description: On November 4, 2015, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       15-51, of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the       Arms Export Control Act of three thousand two hundred and       fifty (3,250) GBU-31V1 (KMU-556 Joint Direct Attack Munitions       (JDAM) kits); three thousand two hundred and fifty (3,250)       MK-84/BLU-117 bombs; seven hundred and fifty (750) GBU-31V3       (KMU-557 JDAM kits); seven hundred and fifty (750) BLU-109       bombs; one thousand (1,000) GBU-12 Paveway II Laser Guided       bomb kits; one thousand and two (1,002) MK-82/BLU-111 bombs;       four thousand two hundred and fifty (4,250) FMU-152 fuzes;       two hundred and sixteen (216) GBU-24 tail kits (BSU-84); non-      MDE related munitions items (fuzes and bomb components),       sustainment, and support. The estimated total cost was $380       million, including $365 million in Major Defense Equipment       (MDE).        This transmittal reports the addition of eight hundred       (800) GBU-56V1 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM)       (consisting of eight hundred (800) KMU-556 tail kits (MDE);       eight hundred (800) DSU-40 Laser Sensors (SME); and eight       hundred (800) Mk-84 bombs (MDE)); two hundred (200) GBU-56V3       Laser JDAMs (consisting of two hundred (200) KMU-557 tail       kits (MDE); two hundred (200) DSU-42 Laser Sensors (SME); and       two hundred (200) BLU-109 bombs (MDE)); three thousand       (3,000) FMU-139 fuzes (MDE); and associated munitions support       items. The total cost of the new MDE articles is $69 million.       Due to a reduction in other MDE items, the total MDE case       value will remain $365 million. The total estimated case       value remains $380 million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided to       report the inclusion of MDE items not previously notified.       The UAE requested a reduction of Mk-84/BLU-117s and the       addition of LJDAMs and fuzes so this proposed sale may       include Mk-84/BLU-117s, LJDAMs, or a mix. The addition of the       LJDAMs represents an increase in capability over what was       previously notified. The proposed sale increases UAE's       ability to achieve more exact targeting over a wide range of       conditions and greater interoperability with the U.S. Air       Force.        (v) Justification: The proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to improve the security of an important       regional partner. The UAE continues to be a vital U.S.       partner for political stability and economic progress in the       Middle East.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The GBU-56 Laser JDAM is a       2,000-pound JDAM with a DSU-40 or DSU-42 Laser Sensor. The       LJDAM uses both Global Position System aided internal       navigations and/or Laser guidance allowing rapid prosecution       of fixed targets. The Laser Sensor also provides the       additional capability to engage mobile targets. The DSU-40       Laser Sensor is attached to the MK-84 or BLU-117 bomb body,       and the DSU-42 Laser Sensor is attached to the BLU-109 bomb       body, which turns a standard GBU-31 JDAM into a GBU-56 Laser       JDAM.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: August 25, 2022.                            ____________________
