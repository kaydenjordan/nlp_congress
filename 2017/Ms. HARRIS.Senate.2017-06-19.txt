 Mr. President, this healthcare bill will affect over 5  million Californians. That is why it is so important that this bill  goes to the  [[Page S3577]]  committees that are in charge of healthcare. It is so that it can get a  hearing and members can discuss it and consider changes, and so that  the public can understand what is in it. Any bill that is going to  bypass our normal floor procedures and be voted on with only one party  being heard and being on board should at least go through committee and  have an open hearing process.   The Democrats introduced a bill to change our process in order to say  exactly that any bill that gets the expedited, simple majority  reconciliation process of passing the Senate has to at least go through  committee and have a hearing.   I now ask my colleagues to agree to immediately consider that bill so  that we can fix this process before this healthcare bill comes to the  floor.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the  Budget be discharged from further consideration of S. 1376 and that the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, Senator Carper talked about Tanzania. It  reminds me of a greeting I have often heard from people who live in  various African countries. When you meet someone for the first time,  instead of what we would normally say--``Pleased to meet you''--the  greeting is ``I see you.'' I see you. I think that really is part of  our concern here: Do we see the people who will be impacted in the way  they are actually living their lives, and do we understand, if we see  them, that this bill will not be in their best interests?   Right now, for example, we know 13 Senators--all Republicans--are  crafting a bill. This bill would restructure our Nation's entire  healthcare system, which, when we add up what Americans spend on  hospitals, doctors, prescription drugs, and all the rest, we understand  it makes up one-sixth of our economy. It would affect the lives of  everyone--our parents, grandparents, those who are in need of  caregiving, our children struggling with asthma or opioid abuse, our  spouses, who may be battling cancer.   What is equally distressing is that this bill is being written in  secret. The chairman of the Finance Committee says he has not seen the  bill. The Secretary of Health and Human Services says he has not seen  the bill. The American people, the people we all represent, have  certainly not seen the bill.   I think the American people deserve better. This bill is being  written entirely along partisan lines without any attempt to bring  Democrats on board, and the American people deserve better. This bill  is being written and rushed through the Senate with hardly any time to  debate the cost or the details of this proposal, and the American  people deserve better.   I remember when our colleagues across the aisle said the Affordable  Care Act was being rammed down the American people's throats in the  middle of the night. The ACA, in fact, went through 106 public  hearings. It incorporated more than 170 Republican amendments. The  whole process took an entire year. But this healthcare plan involves no  hearings, no bill text, and no transparency at all.   As Senators, we were sent here to represent the American people. We  answer to the American people.   Why are my colleagues from across the aisle trying to put one over on  the American people? I have met folks all across California and this  country, and they see what is happening. They know that if this bill  were as wonderful as its proponents would like us to believe, it would  be out in the open.   The American people deserve greater transparency. Even though the  authors of this proposal have tried to conceal the details of their  plan, we know enough to know this bill would be nothing short of a  disaster. We know because we have been told it is about 80 percent the  same as the bill that was passed by the House--a bill so catastrophic  that even the President of the United States who hailed its passage now  calls it ``mean.''   We know it would throw 23 million Americans off their health  insurance within a decade, including putting 4 to 5 million  Californians at risk of losing coverage. We know it would raise costs  for middle-class families and seniors. In every county of California,  average monthly premium costs would go up while financial support to  pay premiums would fall.   We know it would put Americans with preexisting conditions at risk  and leave people who need maternity care or opioid treatment without  coverage or force them to pay huge out-of-pocket costs. We know it  would cut about $834 billion from Medicaid, which means less money for  families to pay for nursing homes, to support children with special  needs, or to treat substance abuse. We need the Affordable Care Act to  be in place, in a way that we fix what is wrong, but we mend what is  broken and not repeal it altogether.   I recently visited a really remarkable treatment clinic in Los  Angeles. It is called the Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center.  Everyone from the doctors to the patients can tell you that when 4,600  Californians are dying every year from substance abuse and opioid  overdoses, it is wrong and irrational to cut Medicaid.   It really makes you wonder why anyone would support this bill. How  does this bill help real people with real challenges?   At a healthcare rally in Los Angeles in January, I met a woman named  Tonia. Before the ACA, she had signed up for insurance just long enough  to see a doctor, have a few tests done, and fill a prescription. Then  she would realize she couldn't pay and couldn't afford to pay for the  insurance beyond that. She said:         It's the worst feeling in the world to have to tell your       doctor--who is trying to make you well--that you cannot       afford the treatment prescribed.    Tonia told me:         Before the Affordable Care Act, living without health       coverage was a nightmare in this country.    She went on to say:         But that has all changed, and thanks to the ACA I can now       see a doctor when I need to, monitor my condition, and stay       healthy so that I can keep working and contribute to our       nation's economy. If the Republicans in Congress repeal the       law, I don't know what I will do.    I ask, How does the Republican healthcare plan help Tonia?   Another woman, Krista, told me:         I am married with four children, one of whom is a 10-year-      old type one diabetic. He requires daily active insulin       management to stay alive--24 hours a day, 7 days a week.    She went on to say:         Healthcare is not optional for us; even with health       insurance, diabetes management is the type of thing that can       bankrupt you. Without health insurance, I can't imagine. ACA       is a huge relief for my family.    I ask, How does this bill help Krista and her family?   Then, there is Rhett, in Marin County. More than 7 years ago, he was  diagnosed with leukemia. Rhett is 9 years old. He says:         Cancer cells are the bad guys.    This is what he wrote me.         For 3\1/2\ years I took chemo to get the bad guys out. I       had more than one thousand doses of chemotherapy. . . . My       parents had to tell my sister that I might die of cancer.    And then he went on to write:         Thanks to my doctors and nurses, my family and friends, my       church and my community, and the Affordable Care Act . . .       now I'm Gone-with-the-Cancer. I have a pre-existing       condition. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, my parents       don't worry about losing coverage.    A 9-year-old Rhett is showing us the way. How does this bill help  Rhett?   I don't know the party affiliation of any of these folks. I don't  know if they are Democrats. I don't know if they are Republicans. I  don't know if they are Independents. I don't know if they are members  of the Green Party. I am not asking them those questions. I am asking  them: How are you doing? What is helping you? What do you need? How  will this impact you?   I know I am one of two Senators whom they have. When it comes to  their needs and their need to be represented in the U.S. Congress and  their need to be heard and their need to be seen, party affiliation  should not matter. What should matter are the needs of the American  people.   Regardless of whom they vote for in a partisan election, I am certain  of this. This healthcare plan that is being proposed by my colleagues  from across the aisle will not solve their problems. It will only  create more problems and potentially devastate people's lives.   To my colleagues I say, this shouldn't be a matter of supporting this  bill automatically if you are a Republican or objecting just because  you are a Democrat; this is about what is right and what is wrong.  [[Page S3582]]    If you know this bill is bad, stand up and stop it. Speak that truth.  Now is not the time to keep quiet and hope nobody notices. Forget the  politics. Forget partisan pressure and talk radio and primary ads.  Instead, just listen to the voices of the American people, not just in  California but in Nevada, in Arizona, in Ohio, in Alaska, in Maine, in  Pennsylvania, in West Virginia because they have made themselves  overwhelmingly clear. Only 20 percent of Americans support this bill.   A majority opposes it in every State in this country. It is the least  popular piece of legislation in modern history. I am asking you to  think about the American people. I am asking you to think about Tonia.  Think about Krista. Think about Rhett living with leukemia since he was  just 2\1/2\ years old, undergoing 2\1/2\-hour infusions every night  with such incredible bravery.   Let the determination of Americans like Rhett bring us together--a 9- year-old boy who tells us, in his words: ``Don't repeal the Affordable  Care Act, Improve it!'' We all agree, the ACA can be improved. It must  be improved. It isn't perfect. I am ready to work with anyone who  really wants to make it better.   Instead of playing politics, instead of playing politics with public  health and people's lives, we can actually work together to strengthen  our healthcare system.   In fact, I am proud to have recently cosponsored a bill with Senator  Dianne Feinstein and a number of my Democratic colleagues. Our bill  would make it safer and easier for middle-class Americans to buy  insurance if they currently don't qualify for any help paying their  premiums.   These are the kinds of solutions Democrats can get behind. These are  the kinds of solutions that would help and not hurt the people we  represent. We took an oath to represent all the people. I am asking  every Member of this Chamber to think long and hard about the  consequences of this bill. Think about the responsibility we have been  entrusted with.   We owe it to the American people to tell the truth, not to hide it.  We owe it to the American people to solve real problems, not to  manufacture new ones. We owe it to the American people to do the job we  were sent here to do.   I urge my colleagues to vote down this bill and stand up for the  people we represent and serve.   I yield back.
