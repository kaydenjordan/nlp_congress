 Madam President, I rise today to discuss my serious  concerns about the judgment and the temperament of the nominee Colin  Kahl, the controversial nominee to be the Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy, the third highest position in our Department of Defense.   On April 13, 2021, I, along with 17 other Senators, wrote to FBI  Director Christopher Wray requesting an investigation into whether Kahl  had improperly disclosed classified information. We also asked the  majority leader not to advance Kahl's nomination to the floor until the  FBI completes its investigation. Yet here we stand.   The 18 Senators who signed these letters include Senators who sit on  the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and  the Senate Armed Services Committee.   As Senators, the Constitution charges us with providing advice and  consent, and so I stand here today because the Senate deserves to have  these questions answered so that we may properly discharge our duties.   I fear my Democratic colleagues want to force this nominee through  before we know all the facts--facts which may be incredibly damning to  his nomination.   Here is what we do know. As a U.S. Government employee with a Top  Secret security clearance, Colin Kahl signed a classified information  nondisclosure agreement. In fact, he likely signed many of them during  his tenure in government. This document binds government employees in  perpetuity to protect classified information under U.S. laws,  regulations, and Executive orders.   These classified information nondisclosure agreements don't come with  footnotes. They don't come with fine print that says you are only  obligated to protect classified information when it is a President you  like or when it is a President that belongs to the political party you  agree with.   Mr. Kahl signed this document to protect classified information in  perpetuity, period. Rather than uphold the oath that he took to his  Nation and to his government, Kahl decided to recklessly disclose  sensitive information to secure political points on Twitter.   Some of the information that Kahl appears to have leaked--internal  deliberations of the National Security Council--is of a category that  even Senators and Senate staff with the highest security clearances are  almost always denied access.   In December of 2017, Kahl publicly bragged that he confirmed the  disclosure to the media of classified planning for military operations  in North Korea with ``multiple sources inside the Administration.''   You can see right here his tweet:         There is a contingent at the White House that believes a       limited strike is viable and  [[Page S2115]]       the US can control escalation by threatening regime change if       Kim Jong Un retaliates.    This is incredible.   Continuing on that same thread, he says:         I've heard this separately from multiple sources inside the       Administration.    In other words, if the intelligence services of North Korea, China,  Russia, Iran, and other adversaries were working to corroborate the  accuracy of this leaked information, Kahl saved them the trouble by  working with ``multiple sources inside the Administration'' to confirm  this leaked classified information, publicly, no less.   Let me put this in a personal perspective. When Kahl tweeted these  leaks in December of 2017, I was serving as U.S. Ambassador to Japan.  This was at a time when North Korea had launched two intercontinental  ballistic missiles over Japan, and they had also detonated a  thermonuclear warhead, putting the lives of my family, my fellow  American diplomats, and more than 50,000 Active-Duty U.S. military and  their families--all of us living within range of North Korea--in harm's  way   At a time when tensions couldn't have been higher, Colin Kahl was  willing to expose vital information to North Korea and risk American  lives--all of this just to score political points. Reckless, I say.   In February and March of 2017, Kahl leaked details about a classified  National Security Council meeting on counterterrorism operations in  Yemen that he ``confirmed with 4 separate staffers in the room.''   Here is his message, talking about Yemen, quoting the Deputy National  Security Advisor, K.T. McFarland, saying ``saddle up.''   The existence of this meeting should have been classified and  certainly anything that was said during this meeting. Here it is on  Twitter.   Then he follows up by saying he has ``confirmed with 4 separate  staffers in the room.''   In short, Kahl used social media and other forums to leak classified  information to brag about his ability to get U.S. Government employees  to confirm with him the veracity of leaked classified information.   Whoever holds the third highest position at DOD must be someone who  completely understands and appreciates the important nature of  sensitive information and is dedicated to safeguarding it.   Yet rather than respect the responsibility that came with his access  to sensitive material, Kahl recklessly shared this privileged  information on Twitter for the world to see, merely to scratch  political, partisan itch.   If we let this nominee slide through under these conditions, what  message does it send to other ambitious national security types?  Doesn't it say that leaking classified information for political  reasons will be rewarded? Doesn't it encourage further disclosure of  classified information? Doesn't it play right into our adversaries'  hands by showing that our internal political divisions can be exploited  to obtain the most sensitive information that our government keeps?   My Senate colleagues and I explained in our letter to FBI Director  Wray:         The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy plays a key role       in matters crucial to America's national security and should       be held by a person of sound judgment and temperament--      someone who understands and respects the need to safeguard       classified information and to keep national security affairs       distinct and separate from partisan political activities.''        Kahl's growing record of apparent mishandling of classified       information and his evasive response regarding this issue       fall far short of the standards required for holding one of       our nation's top national security positions.        By apparently soliciting or otherwise receiving classified       information from U.S. government officials serving in       national security roles and repeatedly posting such       information on social media . . . Kahl demonstrated disregard       for security protocols that are designed to protect our       national security interests.    Kahl has shown that he is unfit to serve and his nomination should  not move forward until the FBI has completed the investigation  requested by me and 17 of my Senate colleagues.   I hope that all of my colleagues want to see answers to these  important questions, as well, before we begin to advance his  nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
