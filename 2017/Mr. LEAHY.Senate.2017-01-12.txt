 Mr. President, the Senate is faced with a clear but  complicated choice: support this expedited legislation that will pave  the way for the confirmation of the next nominee to be Secretary of  Defense or embroil one of the most consequential Cabinet positions--and  with it the lives of thousands of men and women, as well as our  national defense--in what would surely become a legal and legislative  morass.   The Framers of the Constitution established that the Senate should  provide advice and consent in the appointment of such Cabinet nominees.  Congress subsequently, in the aftermath of World War II, sought to  implement limitations on who could serve as Secretary of Defense,  specifically, a cooling off period for members of the military  nominated to serve as Secretary of Defense. The goal? To ensure that  America's military would remain under civilian control. Circumventing  these limitations requires an act of Congress. It has been done just  once before, ironically almost immediately after Congress first enacted  those limitations.   In Gen. Mattis, the President-elect--who is inexperienced in the  world of military affairs and has sometimes proven rash in his public  comments--has identified an able leader, who is tremendously popular  and who has time and again shown himself worthy of the respect he has  earned. I believe he will be a voice of reason in the Department of  Defense and was encouraged to hear at his confirmation hearing this  morning that he understands the importance of civilian control of our  Defense Department and intends to preserve that tradition.   As Senator Reed said earlier today in the Armed Services Committee,  this is a once-in-a-generation waiver. Chairman McCain similarly  emphasized that he supports the law that this legislation would  temporarily waive. I do not support efforts to change the law to  permanently eliminate this statutory cooling off period. I am  disappointed that the Senate majority has insisted on creating an  expedited debate on such a critical question. I cannot support such an  abrupt and accelerated revision of the law, even in the form of a one- time-only exemption. I couldn't support such a haphazard process,  regardless of who the President, President-elect, or the nominee is.   As I said in December when the Senate considered the legislation that  paved the way for this rushed process today, my vote on this bill does  not foreshadow my vote on Gen. Mattis's nomination. I do believe that  Gen. Mattis can respect the boundaries that  [[Page S310]]  make our Armed Forces the strongest in the world. I believe Gen. Mattis  will offer a critical perspective to an inexperienced and sometimes  volatile incoming Commander in Chief. And those are reasons why I  believe he may receive my support when the Senate considers his  nomination.                            ____________________
