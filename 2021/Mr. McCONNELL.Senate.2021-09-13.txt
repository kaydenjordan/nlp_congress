 Madam President, over the State work period, as  Senators attended business back home, the Biden administration's  reckless decision to retreat from Afghanistan was carried through to a  damaging and deadly end.   The consequences of its hasty retreat were not just foreseeable; they  were actually foreseen. And yet, against the advice of Members from  both parties and even its own national security experts, the  administration plowed right ahead.   Just weeks after abandoning our strategic airbase in the dead of  night, the Biden administration told Americans and vulnerable Afghan  partners they were largely on their own to make it to the commercial  airport in Kabul if they wanted out of Afghanistan.   And by the White House's own admission, some of the Americans who  wanted to come home were left behind. So let's let that sink in.  President Biden left Americans who wanted to escape behind, in the  clutches of the Taliban.   Of course, Americans aren't the only people we left behind. In order  to meet an arbitrary political deadline, the Biden administration also  pulled out before we helped all the brave Afghans who stuck their necks  out to assist American servicemembers and build a better future for  their country.   Our Nation made a promise of aid and safety in exchange for their  service; and on this President's watch, we actually failed to keep the  promise. We left Americans and vulnerable Afghans behind.   The administration naively expected the Taliban to behave like any  law-abiding member of the so-called international community, supposedly  subject to tremendous leverage for recognition and for funding.   Well, our adversaries are sending emissaries to the Taliban, and the  terrorists in Kabul seem unconcerned with diplomacy. Trust in the  Taliban to ensure safe passage to the airport for evacuees was fatally  misplaced. Anyone who expected the group to become ``inclusive'' should  now rightly expect to literally be laughed out of the room.   The administration confidently insisted it would own the consequences  of its withdrawal efforts; but as soon as their lack of planning bore  real, deadly consequences, it pointed the blame at everyone but the  reflection in the mirror.   Now, in a bizarre twist of narcissism, the White House is now holding  up its belated and frantic evacuations as worthy of praise and credit.   So where are we now?   A wall outside the compound that, until recently, housed the U.S.  Embassy in Kabul now bears a mural of the Taliban flag. Four terrorists  once detained at Guantanamo Bay now hold senior positions in the  Taliban regime. And in the void left by our coalition's withdrawal, we  are less able to collect intelligence and fight terrorists on their own  soil.   This failure was entirely avoidable; the consequences were totally  foreseeable; and the stain on our retreat has left America more  endangered, less credible, and with fewer capabilities in the face of  real and growing terrorist threats.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, the international  stage isn't the only area where the Biden administration's policies  have caused damage that was both foreseeable and foreseen.   Back in the springtime, Washington Democrats dumped trillions of  dollars in liberal borrowing and spending onto the American people.  They pretended it was a COVID relief bill. What it was, was a recipe  for rampant inflation, a silent tax hike on American families.   It was clear what would happen. Even liberal economists warned this  was a bad idea that would cause inflation. But just like in  Afghanistan, Democrats had made up their minds long ago and were  certainly not going to be deterred.   Now working Americans are paying the price. Annual inflation is up  5.4 percent, tied for the worst inflation in over a decade. It has more  than swamped American workers' wage gains over the last year. The  Democrats' inflation is turning American workers' pay raises into  effective pay cuts, essentially pick-pocketing American families.   You might think this would give our Democratic friends some pause and  encourage them to deal in reality; but, alas, that is not what is  happening. Instead, they are eager to jam through yet another massive  multitrillion-dollar reckless taxing-and-spending spree in an effort to  move our country to the left, literally, forever.   Massive new government intrusion into Americans' childcare  arrangements, into Americans' medical prescriptions, into the power  grid; new welfare spending that hands out cash with zero--zero--work  requirements; socialist price setting that would leave our medical  system with fewer new cures; and a thousand more awful, far-left  policies just like these, all accompanied by a suite of staggering-- literally staggering--tax hikes that would kill jobs, hurt families,  and crush our competitiveness with the Chinese.   Details are already emerging about the seismic tax hikes that  Democrats are cooking up: more higher taxes on employers and job  creators, targeted tax hikes to hit small businesses and family farms,  pulling more Americans into the death tax.   This tax-hiking wish list would add up to one of the biggest tax  hikes in American history at exactly the time their liberal policies  already have our economy sputtering. So it is the very last thing  American workers need. It is the last thing American families can  afford, and Republicans are going to fight these terrible, painful  policies tooth and nail.                            ____________________
