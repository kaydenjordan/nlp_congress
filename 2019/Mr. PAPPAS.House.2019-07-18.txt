 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my constituents,  Bob and Cathy, who shared their story recently with me at a roundtable  discussion in Manchester.   When Bob was in need of a kidney transplant, his wife, Cathy, was a  match, and she donated her own kidney to overcome extensive wait times.  Today, 15 years after Bob's successful surgery, he must continue to  take antirejection drugs. This prescription has always been covered by  Cathy's private insurance.   Even as Bob and Cathy are near retirement age, retirement is not an  option for them, because Bob's life is dependent on a prescription drug  that costs $3,000 a month out of pocket.   Nobody in America should be deprived the dignity of retirement after  a lifetime of hard work because of the outrageous costs of lifesaving  drugs. I am committed to working with my colleagues to ease the  significant burden and anxiety that so many Americans unnecessarily  face every day.   We must tackle the high cost of prescription drugs now. The American  people are counting on us to do just that.                            ____________________
