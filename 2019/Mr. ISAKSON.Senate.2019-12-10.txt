 Madam President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.   If you want to go home on time, if you want to take something home to  give to the American people that they want and they need, then you will  vote with me and the other Members who have spoken on the Over-the- Counter Monograph bill today.   There are sunscreens on the market in Europe that are 12 years short  of being on the market in America all because of an antiquated approval  system to make sure they are safe but to get them to the market in  time. It is about time we ended melanoma, and it is about time we got  American consumers what they want. It is about time we settle the  problem. It has been a problem for a long time.   So I ask you--in fact, I plead with you--to vote for this bill, and  you will make everybody happy, nobody mad, and you will save a life.  There is nothing better than that.   I yield the floor.
