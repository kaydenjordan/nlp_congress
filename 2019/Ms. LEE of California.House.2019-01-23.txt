 Madam Speaker, yesterday was the 46th  anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that  affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion.   This decision allowed millions of women to come out of the shadows  and access lifesaving reproductive care, yet antiabortion laws and  sustained attacks on women's access to the full range of reproductive  healthcare continues to push abortion coverage out of the reach for too  many people.   Since 2011, State lawmakers have passed more than 400 laws that  restrict abortion, and policies like the Hyde amendment have pushed  coverage out of reach for millions of women, especially low-income  women and women of color. That is why I have been proud to be the lead  cosponsor of the EACH Woman Act, along with Congresswoman Jan  Schakowsky and Congresswoman Diana DeGette.   This legislation will end the harmful Hyde amendment and make sure  that all people, regardless of where they live or how much they make,  have access to a full range of reproductive healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I remember the days of back-alley abortions, and we  cannot allow this administration to turn back the clock on women's  access to abortion. It is time to be bold and end Hyde and lift all the  bans that deny a full range of reproductive healthcare to all women.                            ____________________
