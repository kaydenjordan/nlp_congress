 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise today to honor my good friend and fellow midwesterner, our  colleague, Congressman   John Shimkus.   I had the absolute honor of serving with him also on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   His 24 years of serving this body has had a tremendous impact on our  country, as we have heard, but personally, his role on the steering  committee had a critical impact on my own career, from which I am  retiring from Congress this year as well.   I thank him for fighting for me, because for the first time ever, two  Hoosiers made it to the Energy and Commerce Committee, which was  unprecedented, in myself and Dr. Bucshon.  [[Page H5046]]    So the reputation of the E&C, he has led the way in working both  sides of the aisle, as we have seen, to create bipartisan legislation  that he crafted to help all Americans. He was instrumental in  designating 911 as the universal emergency number. I am a former  teacher and the mom of a teacher; he ensured that schools have the  appropriate lifesaving equipment to keep students safe.   As a proud Lithuanian descendant--and I might say, he is a rock star  in Lithuania, and I was there once with he and Karen in Lithuania--his  support for our staunch ally has been critical to our two countries'  really important relationship.   There are just so many things to mention.   This body is going to miss him and his patriotic passion dearly, but  I wish John and Karen really an incredible retirement of love and a lot  of music.
