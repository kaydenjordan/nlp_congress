 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the purpose of my amendment is to put the House  on record in support of strengthening HUD's oversight of public  housing.   Many of my colleagues may have never heard of Cairo, Illinois, or  what took place at the Alexander County Housing Authority, but they  should.   An investigation by The Southern Illinoisan newspaper discovered a  public housing agency plagued with corruption and mismanagement.   Residents lived in unsafe, unsanitary conditions, with mold, rodents,  and broken air ducts that allowed for the creation of black mold-- public housing that was not suitable for any human being to live in.  The problem was so bad that many of the buildings had to be demolished.                                time  1645    Residents were forced to move far from Cairo.   All the while, the housing authority's senior leadership was cashing  in. Officials received excessive pay and benefits, large pensions,  lavish travel expenses, and a big consulting contract for a former  director; all of this paid for with taxpayer money.   These problems did not occur overnight. It took decades of corruption  and neglect. The Federal regulators were asleep at the switch. Despite  the terrible living conditions, HUD inspectors gave a passing grade to  the Alexander Housing Authority on several occasions.   HUD failed to properly audit the financials. If they did, they would  have taken action before conditions became a crisis.   Last year, HUD Office of Inspector General issued a report on  failures in Alexander County. The report included four specific  recommendations on improvement to the agency's regulations of public  housing.   The House Committee on Financial Services conducted a hearing on this  report. I testified as a witness. I was glad to see the bipartisan  outrage which occurred about the situation that occurred in Cairo.   More recently, the HUD Inspector General issued a report on the  specific criminal actions of Alexander County Housing Authority  leadership. Charges have been filed against these officials.  Unfortunately, it comes too late for most residents of the housing  authority.   But we can stop this from happening again. The purpose of my  amendment is for HUD to implement the OIG improvements.   In addition, it is my hope that the House Financial Services  Committee continue its work to conduct oversight of public housing  agencies. What happened in Alexander County may be the most extreme  outcome, but it is not the only one of these types of issues that are  occurring around this Nation today.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his support of the  amendment. With this, it is our hope that things like what happened in  Alexander County will not happen again; that proper oversight will be  given.   The effect that this has on people's lives is tremendous, and anyone  that has worked with these situations knows and understands.   I appreciate the fact that my colleague, the chairman, supports this,  and I ask for my colleagues' support.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time
