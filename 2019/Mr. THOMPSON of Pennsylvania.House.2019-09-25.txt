 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Erin Willman of Warren, Pennsylvania. Just 22 years old, Erin  is running her own business, White Cane Coffee.   Erin founded her company with an important goal in mind: to provide  people with disabilities with self-sustaining jobs.   Erin is blind and on the autism spectrum. She believes that providing  a welcoming environment centered around a good cup of coffee is a  natural way to promote inclusivity.   White Cane Coffee offers eight different roast varieties, and each  bag includes braille-friendly labels.   Despite being capable and wanting to work, almost 90 percent of  adults with autism are either unemployed or underemployed. For many,  jobs are extremely difficult to find; and for others, work environments  are not supportive or are even hostile to those who are disabled. Erin  is helping to bridge this gap by empowering autistic adults in her  community.   I am proud of the work that Erin is doing every day to create  opportunities for autistic adults in Warren County.                            ____________________
