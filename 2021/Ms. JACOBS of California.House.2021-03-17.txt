 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the equal rights amendment.   From the beginning, gender equality was left out of the Constitution.  Generations of women and LGBTQ-plus Americans lived and died without  ever having the equal rights and dignity that they deserve under the  law.   We know that the ERA is necessary by the words of its opponents,  including the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who argued  that the Constitution does not prohibit discrimination based on sex. We  can change that.   Madam Speaker, 38 States have ratified the ERA. The only hurdle that  remains is the arbitrary deadline set by Congress, a deadline that  passed before I was born, but a deadline that never stopped the pursuit  of justice. With every vote we take in this Chamber, we have the chance  to correct past mistakes and repeal past wrongs. That is what we will  do again today.   Madam Speaker, our march for equal rights is not done. It will not  stop, and it does not expire.                            ____________________
