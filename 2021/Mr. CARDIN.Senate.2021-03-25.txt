 Madam President, reserving the right to object.    Madam President, first, let me thank the Senator from  Oklahoma for bringing this to the floor.   Here is our challenge. If it gets onto the bill that we have before  us, it will delay the continuation of the Paycheck Protection Program  because it terminates on March 31. We are not going to have any program  to modify. And the House is not in session until the second week in  April so it is not possible to get this done before the program  expires.   So, for that reason, we have to oppose any amendment on the  underlying bill, which is a clean extension of the PPP.   But I want to thank my friend from Oklahoma for bringing this forward  because I agree with you. As chairman of the Small Business and  Entrepreneurship Committee, I support making the changes that the  administration made in regard to the determination for self-employed  retroactive. I think that is a fair thing to do. I also support making  sure that the business structure that is chosen by a small business  also qualifies, whether it be a partnership or a traditional business  arrangement.   I think we need to make those changes, and I know our staffs are  working on the exact language. There is some challenge on how we draft  the language. And you have my commitment that we will work during this  recess, and I assure you that I want to see this done. I hope we can do  it by UC when we return, when the House is in session, and get this  done as quickly as possible.   The point the Senator from Oklahoma raises is very valid, but let me  go back to the original bill for the self-employed that used, as you  said, a formula that didn't work. In some cases, it was $50 or $80 that  they got on the PPP, which was ridiculous because a self-employed  person doesn't have the same payroll expenses that a traditional small  business has.   We based the PPP calculations on the payroll amount. That didn't  apply to the self-employed. So that is why the gross receipts are the  right way to make those calculations, and that is what we want to do.  That is what this administration did in its recalculation, but it made  it prospective only. It needs to be retroactive.   So I agree with the gentleman, but I cannot consent to agree to it  today. And it is not going to delay the Senate consideration of it  because the House is not in session for the next 2 weeks.   So the first time we can really get this done is the second week in  April, and you have my commitment that we will work together to get the  provision made retroactive and to cover the legal structures that are  used by some of our small businesses that are not currently covered  under the current interpretation--I think legal, this is a legal issue  that we have to resolve.   For all those reasons, I do object.    Madam President.    I ask unanimous consent that there be two minutes of  debate, equally divided, before each vote in today's series.    Madam President.    I rise in opposition to the Kennedy amendment.   Let me be clear. Any amendment that is put on this clean extension  will mean that the program will terminate in less than 1 week, and  hundreds of thousands of small businesses will not be able to get their  PPP loans. These are newly eligible. We changed the calculations on how  much you can apply for. Those who have difficulty finding a financial  institution to write the forgivable loan, those in hard-to-serve  communities, all are going to be denied. The SBA has indicated there  are hundreds of thousands of eligible applicants that have not been  able to get in by the due date.   Now, in regard to the Kennedy amendment, the SBA COVID-19 relief is  for existing businesses and current business owners with proven reentry  track records. Anyone who has rebuilt their life after being  incarcerated should be celebrated and supported. There is no reason why  a business owned by someone with an unrelated criminal record should be  treated any differently.   I would urge my colleagues, for the sake of getting this bill to the  President and signed so we can help our small businesses, to reject the  Kennedy amendment.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds  to respond.    The gentleman's amendment goes well beyond that. The  gentleman's amendment goes back 2 years. It could have been a civil  disturbance on a college campus if someone now has an existing business  totally unrelated to any economic crime. It is just something that  should not be in this law, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Rubio  amendment.   The policy that Senator Rubio is objecting to is implemented by the  Small Business Administration to help the underserved communities.   During that 14-day period, 400,000 small businesses with 20 employees  or less were able, at long last, to get PPP help. And almost half were  first-time borrowers under the PPP program, those that had been shut  out in the past.   But, specifically, the Rubio amendment, if it were adopted--and it is  wrong policy--would require the House to concur. The House is not in  session for 2 weeks. That could take us beyond the 31st of March, and  the program would end, costing hundreds of thousands of small  businesses the opportunity that--some are now eligible for the first  time; some are trying to figure out the calculations.   So for all those reasons--and one last point: The Chamber of Commerce  of the United States urges all of us to vote in favor of the underlying  bill and oppose any amendment that would derail the expeditious  approval of this measure.   Let's follow the Chamber's advice. Let's vote down the Rubio  amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1405     Mr. President, I have been advised by the administration  there is an excess of $50 billion available at the end of this month  for the extension. So pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable budget  resolutions in section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of  2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and  applicable budget resolutions for purpose of the pending measure, and I  ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, first, I want to thank Senator Collins for  her leadership on this issue. I want to thank Senator Shaheen for her  help in getting this done.   This bill is widely supported. It passed the House by 415 to 3,  supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the NFIB, and numerous other  stakeholders in small business.   It will be 1 year since the passage of the CARES Act, and the PPP  program has saved millions of small businesses from being shuttered. It  has helped save our unemployment insurance system by keeping small- employer employees on the payroll. It has kept workforce together for  small businesses, which is critically important to get through this  pandemic.   Small businesses need additional time because we have changed the  eligibility, we have changed the calculation, and you have to find  private banks that are willing to take on this loan. And we are now  into a second round. There is over $50 billion available at the end of  this month to continue the program.   I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   I would yield the remainder of our time to Senator Collins.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
