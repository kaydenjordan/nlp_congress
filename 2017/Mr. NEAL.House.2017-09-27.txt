 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first I want to acknowledge those individuals that Mr.  Curbelo pointed out and congratulate them for their courage and their  kindness as they attempt to get southern Florida back on its feet.   But the key phrase here that my friend from Florida mentioned was the  following: Now it is time for us to do our part.   ``Our part'' calls for a much more vigorous effort, a much more  robust investment, and it could, it should, be done now. We don't have  to wait to get this done. We don't have to parcel this out in the small  amounts that are being suggested.   Now, earlier this week, I rose in opposition to H.R. 3823, the  Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, as well.  Today, I am disappointed to say that I am not going to support today's  updated version of the legislation either, based on the word ``more.''   I take no issue with a clean 6-month extension of the FAA expenditure  authority, but today's bill includes an extensive list of extraneous  provisions.   If we are to include extraneous measures on this must-pass  legislation, then the process of compiling the bill should have been  done in a bipartisan manner. Instead, our Republican friends assembled  their near-term priorities barely, if at all, consulting the Democratic  minority, even though many of these issues are indeed bipartisan.   Worse, rather than work together to solve what is rapidly becoming an  American humanitarian crisis, they chose to take most of the day off to  unveil the tax cut for the wealthiest people in America.   The priorities at this moment are misguided. As I noted earlier this  week, while I support the disaster tax relief in this bill, the package  is plainly insufficient. I had hoped that we might work together in a  manner on these provisions, but that has not occurred.   Traditionally, in this body, we honored and used to respect what is  known as the national principle. It was a code of honor that bound us  together when one part of the Nation was beset by disaster. Whether it  was an earthquake in California, a hurricane in North Carolina, a  tornado in Massachusetts, floods in Missouri, or forest fires in  Alabama, we did not ask about gender, race, geography. We simply said  the national principle prevails and the Federal Government will offer a  robust response.                                time  1745    We are failing in that respect to set the precedent today. Instead,  unfortunately, this disaster relief package that we will consider does  not provide the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that  will drive investment and speed up recovery in American communities in  Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the devastation across  Puerto Rico.  [[Page H7561]]    These hurricanes left massive devastation in their wake, and the  ongoing situation in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are dire.  The situation not only justifies but demands a comprehensive package of  incentives and relief to help these communities and their residents get  back to their feet.   Republicans will hide behind an amendment they added to the Rules  Committee last night. It is really a fig leaf, amounting to $68 per  person in tax relief. We can do much more for our American brothers and  sisters in the Caribbean, especially given that the administration  continues to drag its feet in terms of sending an emergency  supplemental request. That should be done forthwith. We can do better,  and we must do better.   They are making vague assurances that we will get around to  considering a more extensive package later, but delay and uncertainty  will make the situation worse, not better.   Today's package should have included other powerful and proven tax  incentives that we have extended in the past disaster recovery efforts  consistently. I consider this a missed opportunity.   We need to do more to help our fellow Americans recover from these  tragedies. Therefore, I intend to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. DeFazio), who is the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this would be the fourth FAA extension in 2  years. It didn't have to be this way. We had a bill come out of the  committee in the last Congress and this Congress that was bipartisan  except for one provision; that is the privatization of the Air Traffic  Organization.   Now, there is a citizen group out there called Citizens for On Time  Flights--actually, Airlines for America funds this--who are saying that  we have to fly these old zigzag routes with 1950s' radar, and if only  we, the airlines--the same airlines, by the way, that have had their  dispatch and reservation systems go down 39 times in the last 2 years.  The national air traffic system hasn't gone down in the last 2 years.   But, anyway, they could do better, they say--or Citizens for On Time  Flights say. But, unfortunately, it is based on lies.   We have deployed a system where we could fly planes closer together.  It is operational, actually, but the airlines haven't purchased the  equipment to use it, and they are not going to purchase that equipment  until 2020 or after.   So they are saying the FAA is dragging its feet; the FAA is over  budget; the FAA is this, the FAA is that. No. Actually, it is the  airlines that haven't purchased the equipment to use that system.   Now, the other most egregious part of this privatization proposal is  the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Brady, has decided to give  taxing authority to the private corporation. Now, they are not going to  call it taxes. It is fees. Okay.   But right now we finance our Air Traffic Organization with a 7\1/2\  percent tax, a progressive tax; the more expensive your ticket, the  more you pay. That is how we finance, predominantly, our Air Traffic  Organization.    Well, this bill repeals that ticket tax. First thing that happens is  the airlines raise their tickets by 7\1/2\ percent. They already did  that once 5 years ago when there was a temporary lapse. Only two  airlines didn't, Spirit and Alaska. Everybody else grabbed the money  and ran, $400 billion.   So Congress repeals the ticket tax. They raise prices 7\1/2\ percent,  and then they would get three seats on the board. Three seats will go  to direct airlines interests to decide what passengers and how people  will pay to use the national airspace. So they, in all probability,  will come up with a head tax.   So, in addition to paying $7 billion a year for baggage fees, now we  are going to start charging people to use the national airspace with a  flat tax. So, hey, that is a big, great win for the people with first  class tickets. The people, of course, who have got a $100 coach seat  are now going to be paying more like 20 percent or 25 percent. And the  person with a $2,000 ticket is going to pay, basically, 3-point- something percent.   So this is all really unfortunate because we could have passed  already out of this House a bipartisan bill, sent it to the Senate.  Instead of trying to jam them with this bill that is loaded down with  riders, we would be jamming them with good, long-term policy for the  FAA and the traveling public and the aviation industry in America.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr Speaker, we have already heard from the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is a member of the committee, who is  going to oppose the bill because of provisions regarding private flood  insurance. He thinks it will cause Federal flood insurance to collapse.  And the two Senators from Louisiana who they are attempting to jam with  this bill are saying they are going to oppose the bill and block it in  the Senate. So we may end up with no continuing authorization for the  FAA because they wanted to put these flood insurance provisions and  other riders on this bill instead of passing them as separate  legislation.                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts for his leadership. He has been particularly helpful in  thinking through how we can work together on the multiple crises that  Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico are facing.   Let me thank the manager of the bill for working on these issues as  well.   Let me first of all indicate, as I have done earlier today, that I  understand that the FAA extension is a clean extension which I will  support, recognizing the international airport that is in my district.  But again, I will seek the important leadership on the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, and particularly, the ranking  [[Page H7563]]  member, when it comes to dealing with not supporting privatization of  air traffic controllers.   I want to speak specifically to the hurricane tax relief. As I do so,  let me particularly make mention that I had hoped this bill would have  an extension of the CHIP program and the community health centers.  Maybe we can work on that, because I know in many of our communities  impacted by the hurricanes, those elements are important, community  health centers, and, certainly, the Children's Health Insurance  Program.   I do want to make a point to say that I wish we could have gone  further. I know that there were at least 21 different tax credits or  exemptions that we could have had to help those who are impacted by the  hurricanes, but these, I want to cite and say that I appreciate them  being utilized for my constituents now.   The bill would provide tax credit deductions and other relief to  taxpayers in disaster areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria. Most measures would apply to taxpayers in parts of Florida,  Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   In particular, access to one's retirement funds, the bill would waive  the 10 percent penalty on each distribution from retirement accounts  for taxpayers in affected areas. Individuals will be eligible to make  the withdrawal if their primary residence was in one of the disaster  areas as of the date of the storm and they sustained an economic loss.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the bill would increase the size of a  loan an individual can take from their employee retirement fund under  the retirement plan loans. It would also provide a credit for  businesses that were rendered inoperable by the hurricanes but that  retained employees, and on the charitable deduction for those who are  giving dollars between the 23rd and December 31.   What I would like to do, Mr. Speaker, is to look at some form of a  disaster relief tax scheme, if you will, to enhance what we are doing  now and to listen, where we can do this in a bipartisan way, working  with Mr. Neal, working with the chairman of the committee, and really  making sure we have a long-term response to the journey that my  constituents and others will have to take.   I close by saying that now we are up to 185,000 homes that have been  severely damaged or damaged. We have got problems with mortgage  deductions and a number of other issues, and, therefore, I am hoping we  can work together.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez), and I must tell you that anybody who has  witnessed her heartfelt advocacy on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico  in the last 24 hours would be moved. I also would say that nobody in  this Chamber knows more about what has happened in Puerto Rico right  now than the gentlewoman from New York, Nydia Velazquez.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you just heard the eloquent testimony from Ms. Velazquez  about what the people of Puerto Rico are facing right now.   I wish that the majority would have approached this process  differently. The reauthorization of the FAA could have been a simple,  straightforward exercise. It could have and should have been a  bipartisan effort. They saddled the FAA with unrelated partisan  priorities, incorporated with little input from Democrats, and  presented a weak tax package to address the recent major national  disasters.   As I said when a version of this bill came up earlier this week, I  wish the disaster tax relief section were better designed and more  extensive. This updated bill still doesn't provide adequate relief to  the affected families and communities who desperately need it. You just  heard from Ms. Velazquez on that basis.   While waiving penalties on the withdrawal of retirement savings and  expanding EITC and child tax credit provisions are helpful, the  majority inexplicably left out some of the most economically powerful  tax incentives on the shelf, including those that would be helpful to  rebuild devastated infrastructure.   Given this damage and the needs of hard-hit areas, especially the  Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, I cannot understand why we are not  including proven  [[Page H7564]]  assistance contained in previous disaster tax packages as we did to our  family and friends in places like Texas and Louisiana.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
