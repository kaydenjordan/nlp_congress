 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my thoughts on H. Res.  326, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives  regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   While I am a firm believer in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process  and the two-state solution, I am disappointed that the version of the  resolution brought to the Floor did not reflect the language as  introduced, language that I and 191 of my colleagues cosponsored.   It remains my firm belief that the United States must continue to  call for an end to Israeli settlement expansion and oppose Israel's  unilateral annexation of territory. Furthermore, the United States must  do more to uphold human rights and ensure that democratic ideals are  preserved as part of the process.   All humankind deserves to live a productive life without fear of  threat to their safety. That is why I remain committed to the peace  process and welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues, on both  sides of the aisle, to achieve that aim.
