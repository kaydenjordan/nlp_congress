 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am here  to express support for this payroll tax holiday, and I think Congress  should do much better than that, and that is to come together and  forgive these taxes, period.   In fact, back in March, I pushed for Congress to include a payroll  tax cut in the CARES Act, and I still support that today because the  payroll tax cut is about supporting workers who might have had their  hours reduced.   These are workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, workers across  our country who are struggling to make ends meet because of the impact  of COVID-19 on our economy.   Allowing folks to keep more of their hard-earned money could make a  big difference. It would provide immediate support--immediate support-- for Montana's families who are struggling to get by. And, importantly,  we ensure that this will have no impact--zero impact--on Social  Security because we transfer money from the general fund to the  Treasury.   This is not a new concept. It has been done by Congress. In fact, it  was done under the Obama administration. As an example, a Montanan who  earns an annual salary of about $40,000 typically pays about $2,500 in  payroll taxes every year. Forgiving the taxes deferred during this 4- month payroll tax deferral would save that Montanan about $827.   What we should be doing is working together to pass a COVID relief  package that delivers much needed aid for families who have had a tough  go the last several months. And it is going to get tougher going  forward, not only for these families but workers and small businesses.   Instead, my colleagues across the aisle have continued to block very  targeted relief, several times, right here on the floor of the U.S.  Senate, which is holding Montanans and the American people hostage. We  should come together and agree on this targeted relief. We can continue  to disagree on these other items, but let's get this targeted relief  package passed.   So instead of coming to the floor today to try to pass a bill that  undermines a payroll tax holiday to save folks more of their hard- earned money, I urge my colleague here before us to work with Members  of his caucus and get the COVID-19 relief passed.   Once again, we should be forgiving these taxes as a payroll tax  holiday, not unlike what happened during the Obama administration, and  for these reasons, I object.    Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Maryland  raising these points. In regard to the proposal of the bill that was  passed by Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of House, the reason we didn't take  a vote on that bill in the U.S. Senate is because it was full,  basically, of her wish list of many items that didn't really relate to  COVID-19 relief. We did put a targeted bill on the floor of the U.S.  Senate in the amount of $600 billion that, frankly, addressed many of  the issues that the House had in their bill, and we had many issues  that we agreed on here in the Senate that would be at least targeted.  This is about the Paycheck Protection Program. This is relief for  schools. This is resources for the vaccine, for additional PPE, for  additional testing. It is a long list, including relief for the U.S.  Postal Service. Of course, I would hope that you would support it, but  we were blocked from even bringing that bill to the floor of the U.S.  Senate. We couldn't get to debate on that bill in September when it  came before the U.S. Senate.  [[Page S7199]]    I appreciate these points. Obviously, we have a disagreement.  President Trump pushed for Congress to pass a payroll tax cut. I would  rather see a cut, not a deferral. That is the way to really help  workers across this country. When Congress failed to act in July, the  President enacted that deferral as a way to provide immediate relief to  the American people. I would ask that we come together and let's  forgive those taxes. Forgive them, and they won't be getting a surprise  tax increase if we do that.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back the  time in order for the vote to occur now.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Laura Nowlin of Teton County for her compassion and  dedication to her community.   Since 1986, Laura has devoted her time to working at the Teton County  Food Pantry as both a volunteer and a member of the executive board.  Over the course of her 33 years at the food pantry, she ensured  families in the community had healthy and hearty groceries with no  exceptions. Rain or shine, Laura was always there to help the people of  Teton County get the nutrition they needed.   Recently named a board member emeritus of the pantry, Laura will be  dearly missed by her colleagues. Her unwavering selflessness was an  incredibly valuable asset to both the pantry and her community.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Laura for her tireless service  to the people of Teton County. Her kindness and charitable approach to  work serves as an inspiration to all Montanans who serve our  communities.                            ____________________
