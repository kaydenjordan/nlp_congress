 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to  an urgent problem threatening Texas seniors' availability to vote.   One in every three States in our country have passed voting  restriction laws this year. This is alarming.   New voting restrictions can threaten seniors, like my constituent,  Earlene Sullivan, who turned 102 years old recently. Earlene is a  beloved member of our community and served our county as a presiding  judge. She oversaw elections and has voted all her life.   Today, Earlene votes by mail with the help of her daughter,  Catherine. But the GOP's false claims on ballot harvesting have already  caused a rift in her family.   Proposed voting restrictions in Texas, such as stricter driver's  license and Social Security verification requirements, could threaten  Earlene's and millions of seniors' ability to vote by mail.   Madam Speaker, this is unacceptable. Congress must pass voting rights  for all Americans by passing H.R. 1 and H.R. 4.                            ____________________
