 Mr. Speaker, I have been here--this is my 37th year. This  is the most reckless and irresponsible budget that I have seen in the  37 years that I have been here.   Today, we are considering the Senate's budget resolution, not because  the House supports it, but because it is just a vehicle to get partisan  tax reform--strike that--tax cuts.   On an issue as consequential as tax reform, the Congress should not  be rushing to meet self-imposed political deadlines without enough time  to read and analyze the effects.   More importantly, we should not be considering a bill to cut taxes  that is partisan and that is as terrible as we are hearing the  majority's proposal will be. I say that because we still haven't seen  the full details of a bill that this resolution provides for  Republicans to jam through on an expedited process; one they will  reportedly introduce, mark up, and bring to the floor in the few  legislative days we have left before Thanksgiving.   Is the sunshine too bright for you?   Even my friends on the other side of the aisle don't know exactly how  bad it will be for their constituents. When asked about the details of  the Republican bill, Representative Chris Collins, a Republican from  New York, said: ``We don't know, we don't know, we don't know, we don't  know, we don't know.''   That is a Republican Member of Congress who is saying he has no idea  what this bill is empowering.   But we do know that, based on a nonpartisan analysis of their  framework, it will raise taxes on 47 million Americans.   We know that 80 percent of the tax cuts--80 percent of the tax cuts-- will go to the top 1 percent.   And we know, as well, that nearly half of all taxpayers with  children, 44.5 percent, will see their taxes go up. Those same children  will be on the hook for a $2.4 trillion cost. This is the biggest debt  explosion of any bill that I have seen.   Republican Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida summed up today's  vote as being for a budget--hear this, my friends on both sides of the  aisle. This is Matt Gaetz, Republican, Florida, summed up today's vote  as being for a budget that ``nobody believes in so that we have a  chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody's read.''   That is not what we should be doing. We ought to be working together  to craft a bipartisan tax reform package that is revenue neutral.   It will be the height of hypocrisy to say that you are for fiscal  discipline and to vote for this budget. Let's not risk our fiscal  future and the economic security of our people. Defeat this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the  schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, the majority leader announced that the CHIP  bill will be on the floor next week. CHIP and community health centers  have always been, as the majority leader points out, a bipartisan  priority.   Unfortunately, this bill did not come out of the committee as a  bipartisan bill, and negotiations were essentially not fruitful, and  the committee reported out legislation to extend these important  programs that included billions of dollars in partisan offsets.   Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the majority leader, does the gentleman  know whether the $8.2 billion reauthorization of the Children's Health  Insurance Program, which serves nearly 9 million children from low- income working families, will be offset?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   First, let me say, as far as I know, the leadership didn't give any  direction to the committee. The committee decided on its own that it  thought that the cuts that were being proposed by the Republicans are  very harmful to some very important programs in healthcare for seniors  that the gentleman, in his previous remarks telling us what the  schedule was, said were very important.   So the reason that we have concerns is we believe the offsets being  proposed, Mr. Speaker, by the Republicans, and why we don't agree with  the bill that is being brought forward is because we think it hurts the  healthcare of millions of Americans.   Let me ask another question, Mr. Speaker, of the majority leader, and  let me preface it with Mr. McCarthy said in response to my question  about the CHIP program: Of course, it is offset.   Let me ask him a follow-up question.   Does the gentleman know whether the $7.2 billion for community health  centers that provide primary care services to 26 million medically  underserved Americans will be offset?    I yield to my friend from California.    Mr. Speaker, I am chagrined that I have stunned my friend,  the majority leader.   Yes, we don't agree with some of those pay-fors. I happen to, by the  way, agree. There is no reason why a lottery winner of millions of  dollars ought to be on Medicaid.    I didn't yield yet.   I simply say to my friend, had I instructed or the leader instructed,  that outcome may have been different. However, there are some really  substantive issues that we had, we had for a long  [[Page H8256]]  time, we negotiated for a long time, and we didn't reach agreement.   My question to you was: Are they offset? I think your answer was,  yes, they were offset, and then you proceeded to tell me what the  offsets were.   Now, let me ask you a follow-up question to that.   Does the gentleman know whether the repeal of IPAB is offset? That is  a $17 billion deficit creation item. Is it offset?   I yield to my friend.    Offset.    I thank the gentleman for that answer. Perhaps now he  knows why I asked the first two questions.   Apparently, it is not the debt that is of concern, because if the  debt were of concern, the $17 billion would be of concern.   That was put in the bill, as the gentleman knows, to try to pay for,  as we paid for every nickel of the Affordable Care Act, and that was  one of the larger pay-fors.   Now, many Members on your side of the aisle don't like that pay-for,  and many Members on my side of the aisle don't like that pay-for. That  pay-for said that we are going to decide, if we are exceeding  expenditure caps, what needs to be cut.   As the gentleman knows, that board has never been appointed. But if  it had been appointed, we would have had 30 days--30 legislative days  or calendar days--30 calendar days in which to say, no, we don't agree  with that. So the representatives of the people would have had that.   But my point is we are selective in what we want to pay for, and I  think that is a concern certainly to me, and I am sure it is to others.   And the gentleman said: Of course, it is offset. The gentleman, here,  says this is not offset.   Can I ask the gentleman, why is this not offset? Why is this $17  billion apparently not a worry for the debt and the other dollars for  children are necessary to be offset?   I yield to my friend.    Reclaiming my time, the gentleman is correct. The  gentleman has come to me. We tried to work on getting it bipartisan. We  didn't reach that conclusion, and I regret that we didn't reach that  conclusion.   The majority leader did, in fact, come to me in, I think, absolute  good faith, and I wanted to try to get to a resolution. We didn't get  there, and I regret that. We are where we are. But I want to tell my  friend that I am going to continue to try to work towards that  objective.   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his response. I was  going to respond later, but let me respond now.   This bill was not marked up in committee prior to its expiring, prior  to the authorization ending. So when the gentleman talks to me about  time, with all due respect, had it been an item of importance--which it  is a bipartisan bill. We both want to see this get done. The gentleman  is correct, this program exists. The gentleman is also correct that,  until we fix this, there will be States that will be running out of  money. That is a great concern to us. It will adversely affect millions  of children.   We ought to get this done. We ought to get it done in a bipartisan  fashion, and I am sorry that we didn't. I am sorry the committee didn't  get it done so it didn't have to come to the majority leader or come to  my attention or the leader's attention.   But having said that, that does not answer the question of the  gentleman says IPAB doesn't exist. It certainly exists in scoring. As  the gentleman surely knows, this is a $17 billion item that will have  to be paid for at some point in time, and it will add to the debt if we  don't pay for it. It may not exist right now. It may not exist for  reasons that the gentleman probably points out, correctly, that a large  number on his side and a large number on my side are not for it.   I want to tell the gentleman that I am for it. I voted that way. But  a large number of the majority of my party, I think, are not for it. I  agree with that.   But the fact of the matter is repealing this is not paid for, and, as  a result, the costs will have to come from somewhere; but on CHIP we  had to pay for it, and on community health centers we had to pay for  it.   I agree with that, by the way, Mr. Speaker.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    I believe I did. No? I am checking on it.   But I am saying here, publicly, I voted for the ACA. I think the ACA  was good for the country, and one of the pay-fors we said we would pay  for, and we did, one of the pay-fors was IPAB.   If we want to substitute some other way to pay for the healthcare  that we are giving, fine. That will not increase the debt. But if we  don't pay for repeal of this IPAB, it is going to increase the debt.   I yield to my friend.    I thought I said, and let me reiterate, I voted against  repealing IPAB. I am for IPAB. I will say it again. I know it is  politically very controversial. It is a tough thing to do, but it helps  pay for what we buy. And the problem in this House and the problem that  we just did on the tax bill is we are not paying for what we buy. It is  not spend-spend or tax-tax. We do not pay for what we buy. It is easy  to buy and it is hard to pay. Here we are with another example.   I yield to my friend.    I appreciate the gentleman's remarks and I appreciate the  premise for which he stood. I look forward to having the Dream Act  brought to the floor, which a majority of Members are for on this floor  and will vote for. I believe my friend knows that to be the case, and I  hope we would bring it to the floor.   Let me go to this, if I can. The majority leader did not mention  whether Alexander-Murray was going to be on the floor next week.  Obviously, as the gentleman knows, there is an extraordinary disruption  of the marketplace in the healthcare insurance field.   Alexander-Murray, at the request of President Trump, was an effort by  Senator Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, a former Secretary of  Education, and a former Governor of Tennessee, to respond to the  President's request and, as the gentleman has just noted, working in a  bipartisan fashion to come to an agreement to stabilize markets to  ensure that people are going to have healthcare and particularly to  ensure that the poorest among us can afford their healthcare.  Alexander-Murray is bipartisan and has over 60 Senators supporting it.   Do you believe that that will be brought to the floor at any time in  the near future?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman, my friend, the majority  leader, with whom I work in a constructive way on many, many items  mentioned earlier about how children may lose their health insurance or  some of our less well-off citizens who rely on Community Health Centers  will lose access, and that, therefore, we need to get this bill done  soon.   Millions, I suggest to the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, will be  adversely affected if we don't pass a bill stabilizing it.   Yes, I understand you introduced a bill to repeal. You control the  House, the Senate, and the Presidency. We are now 10 months into the  year. That bill hasn't passed.   So what we implore, Mr. Speaker, the administration and the majority  party to do is not to do indirectly, that is, destroy access to  affordable, quality healthcare for millions of Americans, that which  they cannot do directly, and they haven't done it directly.   So I would hope that we could bring at least a bipartisan bill, in  light of the failure to pass a partisan bill, which has, I am told, 60  Senators who have indicated they support it, maybe more.   I would hope when it comes from the Senate, if Senator McConnell will  put it on the floor, that we will consider it forthwith, because the  instability that grips the system now is hurting millions, costing them  millions, perhaps billions. So I hope that would be a priority item for  us, along with the bill that we call the Dream Act.   We need to redeem the dream, Mr. Speaker, and continue a policy which  the Speaker has indicated he thought was erroneously repealed by the  President of the United States, which I think many Republicans with  whom I have talked to think is a policy that ought to be pursued. I  hope we can bring that to the floor as soon as possible, and certainly  before Thanksgiving.   Mr. Speaker, unless the majority leader has anything further to say,  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
