 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5407, the bipartisan  Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Through Campus Planning  Act.   The mental health of our Nation's students is on the minds of many  Americans. According to a study by Boston University, mental health  issues increased steadily over the past 8 years among college students.  In fact, 60 percent of students met the criteria for at least one  mental health problem, including increased rates of anxiety,  depression, and thoughts of suicide.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  approximately 25 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds surveyed in 2020 had  seriously considered suicide. Unfortunately, these issues were made  only worse by the pandemic. Clearly, something needs to be done.   That is why I joined my Pennsylvania colleague, Representative Wild,  in introducing H.R. 5407. This legislation will encourage institutions  of higher education to develop comprehensive mental health and suicide  prevention plans to support college students.   H.R. 5407 directs the Secretary of Education to encourage  institutions of higher education to develop and implement comprehensive  campus mental health and suicide prevention plans. The bill also  directs the Department of Education and the Department of Health and  Human Services to work together in a way that will allow the  institutions to draw from existing evidence-based approaches and  programs enacted by the 21st Century Cures Act, the Garrett Lee Smith  Memorial Act, and the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, as well as  other existing Federal and State programs.   We all want to see our Nation's students thrive and succeed. Yet,  many students are battling severe depression and contemplating suicide.  We must all come together to prevent such tragedy. The best way to do  this is to ensure that students know safe resources are nearby, so they  can get the mental health support they need.   It is time to break down barriers to mental health access. This means  breaking down the stigmas and the practical barriers associated with  seeking mental health services. That is what this bill seeks to do.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5407, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I want to discuss the importance of what we are doing.  COVID-19 burdened young people with more anxiety, stress, and isolation  than ever before. Now, they need support that works.   According to one study, mental health problems among young adults  rose 50 percent over the past 10 years. Many of us have seen the young  people in our lives struggling, and it is devastating to watch.   I am dedicated to serving the needs of students nationwide. To me,  this bill is a no-brainer.   Empowering postsecondary institutions to develop comprehensive  suicide prevention plans and partner with community-based mental health  organizations will do much to solve this mental health crisis. This  critical investment in the mental health of our young people is an  investment in the future of this country.   Lastly, I express my gratitude to my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for working together on this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 5407, and I yield back the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I stand today in support of H.R. 6493, the bipartisan Campus  Prevention and Recovery Services for Students Act of 2022.   Sadly, college students were not exempt from the tremendous pressure  brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. For many students, these escalating  [[Page H5844]]  pressures have resulted in behavioral and mental health challenges,  such as substance abuse.   Even before the pandemic, studies found that young adults were  turning to dangerous substances as 18-to-25-year-olds were reported to  have the highest percent of opioid use of all age groups.   This is why I am proud to join my colleagues in support of this bill  today.   H.R. 6493 promotes evidence-based prevention and recovery efforts on  college campuses by providing colleges and universities the tools they  need to support students struggling with substance abuse.   Specifically, this bill requires institutions of higher education  that receive Federal funding to adopt an evidence-based program to  prevent alcohol and substance misuse by both students and employees.  The bill also ensures that the institutions are equipped with proven,  evidence-based methods by directing the Secretary of Education to  coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop  best practices for colleges and universities when implementing  substance abuse programs. Such coordination and cooperation are  crucial.   For those colleges and universities that may need additional help for  student recovery services, the bill updates an existing Federal grant  for these uses. We know that colleges and university staff can serve as  a critical support system for students suffering from an addiction or  mental health issue. This bill will also empower staff to do so.   With college students experiencing increased loneliness, isolation,  and depression, it is important that these students have access to  alcohol and substance misuse prevention programs.   H.R. 6493 will keep students from falling into substance abuse, thus  ensuring they start their future out on the right foot and on a path to  a successful career. I urge my colleagues to support this bill today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared  to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Through this commonsense bipartisan legislation, we will support  institutions of higher education in their work to address the health  and well-being of students and employees.   The isolation brought on by the pandemic exacerbated the mental  health challenges students in this country were already facing. Data  shows that substance abuse is a serious problem on college campuses.  Some students may feel anxious about pursuing a degree in higher  education and moving away from home for the first time, the challenges  surrounding the pandemic have exacerbated those feelings.   Current and future generations of college students will be well- served with access to high-quality mental health and substance abuse  disorder treatment services. The best thing postsecondary institutions  can do is give students tools to handle those pressures in a healthy  way.   Today, I am honored to stand in support of this legislation, H.R.  6493, as I believe it will give vulnerable students the assistance they  desperately need.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
