 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (S. 3201) to extend the temporary scheduling order  for fentanyl-related substances, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3201         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Temporary Reauthorization       and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues       Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY ORDER FOR FENTANYL-RELATED                     SUBSTANCES.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, section       1308.11(h)(30) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations,       shall remain in effect until May 6, 2021.       SEC. 3.

(f) Input From Certain Non-Federal Entities.--In conducting       the study and developing the report under subsection (b), the       Comptroller General shall consider the views of experts from       certain non-Federal entities, including experts from--        (1) the scientific and medical research community;        (2) the State and local law enforcement community; and        (3) the civil rights and criminal justice reform       communities.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 3201.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we, as a Congress, have worked over the past several  years to combat the opioid epidemic and support the millions of  Americans with a substance use disorder. That work includes bipartisan  passage of legislation like the 21st Century Cures Act, the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and the SUPPORT for Patients  and Communities Act.   In 2017 and 2018, we appropriated nearly $11 billion for a total of  57 Federal programs that fund efforts to curb this epidemic. These  programs span the continuum of care, including prevention, treatment,  and long-term recovery.   The funding also spans across agencies, directing investments toward  research, public health surveillance, and supply reduction efforts.  Most recently, in the fiscal year 2020 funding bill, we included over  $4 billion in public health dollars to help with prevention and  treatment.   In December, the House passed H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower  Drug Costs Now Act, which included an additional $10 billion in funding  to support public health efforts to combat the opioid epidemic.   On the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have had the chance to hear  directly from States that our work at the Federal level has helped save  lives. Last year, in my State of New Hampshire, a total of 284 deaths  were attributed to drug overdoses, of which 82 percent, 234 deaths,  involved the use of fentanyl. This is an alarming statistic and the  frightening reality of opioid addiction in our communities.   It is crucial that we understand the significance of synthetic  opioids. As we have seen in New Hampshire and around this country,  though the most  [[Page H648]]  recent data has indicated overdose deaths have plateaued, deaths from  synthetic opioids continue to rise.   This is primarily fueled by illicit fentanyl and substances  structurally related to fentanyl, which we commonly refer to as  fentanyl analogues. These drugs are often far more powerful. Fentanyl,  the most well-known of this class of drug, is approximately 50 times  more powerful than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine.                                time  1230    Although it is used in legitimate medical settings, we have seen a  proliferation of illicitly produced fentanyl, fentanyl analogue, and  its precursor chemicals originating from China.   Because fentanyl is relatively easy to make and so potent, it is  tragically leading to large increases in overdose deaths. One kilogram  of fentanyl purchased in China for $3,000 to $5,000 can generate  upwards of $1.5 million in revenue on the illicit market here in the  United States. That is potentially enough to kill 500,000 Americans by  overdose.   We have all heard the terrible numbers that tell this story. In 2017,  there were over 47,000 opioid overdose deaths, and 28,000 of those  deaths involved synthetic opioids such as fentanyl in the United  States.   A more complicating factor is that we are now seeing fentanyl  increasingly mixed into other drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, and  even counterfeit prescription drugs like oxycodone. This means that  many unsuspecting Americans are dying at the hands of fentanyl when  they didn't even realize they were taking it.   Mr. Speaker, the nature of our Nation's fentanyl problem is far more  complex than drug epidemics of the past. In addition to traditional  routes, users can purchase fentanyl analogues and fentanyl precursor  chemicals online on the internet. These purchases, which typically  include the most pure and potent fentanyl, are often packaged and  shipped through the United States Postal Service or consignment  carriers in small quantities, making detection a significant challenge.   These factors create a complex problem which requires a multifaceted  solution. Part of that solution is finding a way to support both public  health and public safety actions aimed at stemming the tide of overdose  deaths.   In February 2018, the Drug Enforcement Agency used its authority in  the Controlled Substances Act to temporarily place, for 2 years, all  illicit fentanyl-like substances in schedule I. With this authority  expiring in just 9 days, we must do more to understand the true impact  of this temporary scheduling order, including its impact on public  health, public safety, research, and Federal criminal prosecutions.   That is why, today, we are considering S. 3201, the Temporary  Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl  Analogues Act. This bill, which passed unanimously out of the Senate,  would extend DEA's temporary order for 15 months, while also tasking  the Government Accountability Office with an evaluation of the  temporary order.   Placing a whole class of fentanyl-like substances into schedule I  does not come without implications for criminal justice and research.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse notes that obtaining or modifying  a schedule I registration involves significant administrative  challenges, and researchers report that obtaining a new registration  can take more than a year.   It is critical that our response balance the need for legitimate  research access that holds potential for improved treatments for pain  and addiction, while also prioritizing a more long-term solution to the  dangerous trafficking of fentanyl analogues.   This temporary emergency scheduling order also has international  implications. A year after the United States moved to schedule all  fentanyl-related substances, China finally announced that it would act  and do the same. This classwide control in China has slowed the rate of  new fentanyl analogue encounters in the illicit market.   An expiration in 9 days would also put the DEA back in the position  of playing whack-a-mole, scheduling fentanyl substances one by one  while clandestine criminal chemists in China work to stay one molecule  ahead of our efforts.   As founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force, I agree  with many of my colleagues that we cannot arrest our way out of this  epidemic, and that is why I have introduced the Humane Correctional  Healthcare Act. This legislation would repeal the Medicaid Inmate  Exclusion and allow justice-involved individuals to access quality  healthcare, including mental health treatment and substance misuse  services.   The complexity of the fentanyl crisis and creation of other synthetic  drugs demand a thoughtful, balanced approach that protects the public  health and public safety of all Americans.   This temporary extension, coupled with the GAO study, will give us  the time to work on a longer term solution and will also give us the  opportunity to better understand the full range of implications that  come with classwide scheduling of these substances.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     committee on Ways and Means,                                   Washington, DC, January 29, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of S. 3201, the Temporary       Reauthorization for the Study of Emergency Scheduling of       Fentanyl Analogues Act, the Committee on Ways and Means       agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as to       provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of S. 3201.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, January 29, 2020.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to waive formal       consideration of S. 3201, the Temporary Reauthorization and       Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act,       so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on S. 3201 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman for those comments, and I echo the need to  address mandatory minimum sentencing and comprehensive criminal justice  reform.   The opioid epidemic is not a problem that we can jail our way out of,  and it is imperative that we work together to fix our broken criminal  justice system that unjustly incarcerates Black and brown Americans at  alarming rates.   I agree that we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past in responding  to drug epidemics, but the dramatic increases in fentanyl-related  deaths require us to act. Ensuring that the DEA has the authority to  ban new synthetic analogues, most of which are being manufactured by  criminal chemists in China, is important to curb the influx of  fentanyl.   I believe that a critical component of criminal justice reform is  improving health access and coverage for incarcerated individuals, many  of whom suffer from substance misuse disorder and mental health issues  with a co-occurring mental health disorder.    I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the Humane Correctional  Health Care Act, which aims to break the cycle of reincarceration and  recidivism by repealing the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion, which blocks  access to care. Healthcare is a fundamental human right that should  never be stripped from any person for any reason.   The legislation that we are voting on today will give lawmakers  additional time to craft a long-term plan for fentanyl while also  considering comprehensive criminal justice reform, and I welcome the  opportunity to work with the gentlewoman on this critically important  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her comments, and I look forward to our work together going forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we do not have any more  speakers, and I am prepared to close if my Republican colleagues don't  have any more speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that I appreciate my colleagues who  have come to the floor to speak on this bill. I think everyone knows  that this is a very personal issue for me, not just because of my own  constituents, but because of my own family, and I appreciate the  bipartisan support for this bill.   I do want to work with my colleagues in the Judiciary Committee and  in the Congressional Black Caucus and others on reform of sentencing  guidelines. I think we can make that kind of progress during the 15  months, and I hope that I will get bipartisan support for my  legislation which would bring treatment for mental health issues and  substance use disorder into the justice-served population, because my  view is that we have created a system that is not functional and not  serving the purposes of the American people or the American taxpayers.
