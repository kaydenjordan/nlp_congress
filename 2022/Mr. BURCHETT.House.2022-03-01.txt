 Madam Speaker, on February 6, Bearden High School's  dance team brought home another national championship from the  Universal Dance Association's National Dance Team championship. The  team earned its third national championship in the large varsity Game  Day Division, the sixth in team history.   Routines in the Game Day Division are focused on school spirit and  crowd engagement. Teamwork is crucial in these choreographed  competitions, and athletes must be on the same page if they want to  win. Bearden's dance team won this competition by working together and  perfecting a motivating, effective routine during Bearden Bulldog  athletic competitions.   Members of this national championship winning team are Abigail  Abrams, Olivia Roddy, Jordan James, Ella Klenck, Julie Horn, Maddie  Taylor, Cadance Eastman, Kenzie Bankes, Mallory Simpson, Ruby Fisher,  Leah Cho, Ella McLaughlin, Marian Mitchell, Mallory Haskins, Eli  Keziah, Lana Nelson, Avery Duncanson, and Reagan Honeycutt.   The team's leadership includes head coach Hannah Keathley, assistant  coaches Natalie Adkins and Sydney Schriver, technical coach Kathryn  Brasfield, choreographer Katie Fear Lane, and team sponsor and high  school teacher Rebecca Nutter.   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to celebrate this group of athletes  from Bearden High School, my alma mater. Our community is proud of your  continued success on the national stage.   And go Bulldogs.   Recognizing Tennessee Volunteers Legend Gus Manning    Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize somebody who really  needs no recognition at all but is somebody who is very dear to me. He  is a good friend of mine. He is a Tennessee Volunteer legend, Gus  Manning. He is turning 99 this July, and I wanted to take a few moments  to recognize Gus' life and distinguished career here on the House  floor.  [[Page H1184]]    Gus is a lifelong Knoxvillian. He graduated from Rule High School,  the Fighting Golden Bears, and then served in the United States Marine  Corps during World War II. After he completed serving his country in  the Marine Corps he decided to become a Tennessee Volunteer, and that  journey began.    A tremendously athletic individual, Gus walked onto UT's football  team in 1947 and played baseball for the Volunteers. He graduated from  Tennessee in 1950 but returned to UT in 1951 when the athletic  director, General Robert Neyland, hired him to be the sports  information director for Volunteer athletics. This was the beginning of  Gus' nearly half-century long professional career with UT's athletic  department.   Outside of the athletic department, Gus co-hosted Vol Sports Report  on WIVK. He also served as president of the Tennessee Sports Hall of  Fame, the Southeastern Conference Sports Information Directors, and the  Southeastern Conference Business Managers.   From 1951 to 2003, Gus attended 608 consecutive Tennessee Volunteers  football games. His dedication to the University of Tennessee's  athletic program earned him inductions into halls of fame and awards  from various organizations. His greatest recognition came in 2015, when  Gate 16 at Neyland Stadium was renamed Gus Manning Gate. It is fitting  that an individual who dedicated so much of his life to the football  teams that play in that stadium is now a part of it forever.   I thank Gus for continuing to be such a great representative of the  University of Tennessee and its athletic programs.                            ____________________
