 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy  in permitting me to speak on this and bringing us together, and I have  enjoyed listening to my colleagues walk us down memory lane.   Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, these are painful memories, but we were  here when the United States made the single biggest foreign policy  blunder in our history, costing hundreds of thousands of lives in the  Middle East--not just thousands of Americans--costing trillions of  dollars.   We are watching every day in America the price being paid by men and  women who come back with injuries, both visible and those that aren't:  PTSD, missing limbs, lost opportunities, and troubled families.   Three days ago, there was a quotation describing what was going on  with Boeing's design of the 737 MAX, where one of their engineers said  it was designed by clowns and supervised by monkeys. I think that act,  sadly, is what we are looking at, the clown act that is going on now,  trying to sort out a rationale for another rash act that has, in fact,  left us less safe.   Now, Donald Trump campaigned tapping into the antiwar sentiment and  professed to be against endless wars. He professed to have been against  the war in Iraq. Of course, an examination of his record finds out,  like most things, he is on both sides of that question.   But he has taken a step that puts us in harm's way again. It recalls  the Beirut tragedy, where there was the largest loss of life since  World War II in a single day, October 23, 1983. 241 marines were lost  in that car bombing in the barracks in Beirut.   But that was preceded by what some, at this point, would, I think,  fairly assess reckless action on behalf of the United States in terms  of heavy shelling of Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, things that we  could have done many times before but cooler heads prevailed because of  some of the potential backlash. That was, indeed, a serious backlash,  and we ended up not only having the loss of Marine lives; we had to  withdraw and further unsettle that troubled area of the country.   Well, what we have seen now is that, with one reckless act--the  execution, the assassination of General Soleimani is something that we  could have done. Prior Presidents knew his location. They could have  assassinated him, and they certainly had no love lost for a truly  reprehensible human being. But they knew that they needed to exercise  restraint because the consequences could be grave.   The one act of assassination has been fascinating to watch because  what we have seen now is that the Iraqis, in their Parliament, have  disinvited us, told us to leave.   We have watched in Iran where just weeks before there were violent  demonstrations that were put down by that repressive regime against  their own people. People were demonstrating at great personal peril as  the forces for reform were bubbling up.   But wasn't it interesting. Immediately after that assassination by  the United States in Iraq, not only did it consolidate Iraqis wanting  us to leave, but it--at least, temporarily--united the Iranian people  against us.   But for the tragedy of shooting down a civilian airliner which was  mistaken for an American bomber, there would have been--that has  generated more hostility toward the regime, and it was their own  ineptness that did that, no thanks to this administration.   Watch what has been happening lately. We had a series of briefings  that were scheduled to finally give information to some of the  committees. I am under no illusion that they would be detailed, but at  least they would have gone through the motions.   They have been canceled, a series of them, with no good reason, after  they had been scheduled, and people were looking forward to that  conversation.                                time  1800    Perhaps it is because this administration can't get its act together,  can't get its stories straight. For the last 10 days, we have watched  late night comedians use film clips of the Secretary of Defense, of the  Secretary of State, of Donald Trump dissembling, tripping over  themselves in not just fractured rhetoric and syntax but contradicting  what, in fact, was their rationale, why, when, and where. It makes for  good comedy, but unfortunately, this is serious. We are talking about a  very fragile state in the Middle East.   I was in the White House being briefed by Secretary of State Condi  Rice and George Tenet, head of the CIA, telling us about an imminent  danger then, but at least we had White House briefings, at least they  went through the pretext. They were wrong, and they didn't persuade me  or a number of my colleagues, some of whom you have heard from tonight,  who voted against their authorization, voted against their reckless  efforts. We have seen this movie before. I hope it doesn't spiral out  of control again.   It is important, Mr. Speaker, that Americans understand the stakes  that are involved. It is important for Congress to finally reassert  itself. I think knowing what we know now, those of us who opposed the  Iraq war would have been overwhelmingly supported, and we would have  rejected it. But we have had the benefit of history to be able to  hopefully learn from our mistakes.   We have legislation coming forward when we return to Washington in 2  weeks. H.R. 5543, the No War Against Iran Act sponsored by  Representative Ro Khanna, a number of us are original cosponsors,  agitating for this moving forward. It would prevent any funds from  being used for military force  [[Page H281]]  against Iran, unless legislation is passed to specifically authorize  such military action and clarify that Congress has not already  authorized the use of force against Iran, specifically indicating those  2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force do not authorize  war with Iran. We need to pass that.   The bill's text matches an amendment that passed on the House floor  with 251 votes just last summer. And I would hope that we would find  members of the House in both parties who voted for it last summer to  add their voice and urge their Republican colleagues in the Senate to  join us to permit a vote.   We have H.R. 2456 to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military  Force Against Iraq, the resolution of 2002 led by Congresswoman Barbara  Lee, who spoke so eloquently here a few moments ago. Again, I am proud  to cosponsor and support it. It would eliminate the authorization for  the use of force against Iraq resolution of 2002. And again, this  matches a bipartisan amendment passed last summer with 242 votes in the  House.   These are simple, commonsense, bipartisan, and it is time for us to  enact them into law. These were stripped out in the process of the  budget that Republicans in the Senate and the administration would not  go along with, but it is time, especially given the reckless acts of  this administration recently, to go back, revisit, and approve each of  these elements when we are given an opportunity on the floor of the  House.   I am absolutely convinced, based on conversations I have had with  friends of mine, well-meaning Members of Congress at the time, who  voted for that authorization, who voted for the war who felt that that  was one of the worst votes they ever cast. We have an opportunity to  unwind some of that now when we come back by approving those two pieces  of legislation.   I deeply appreciate my colleague organizing this conversation  tonight. For some people it may seem like it is beating a dead horse. I  think not. These are lessons that we learn too slowly. These are  lessons that we have paid for in blood, in treasure, in upset in our  communities, in pain and suffering in the United States and around the  world. I hope that Congresswoman Tlaib will continue in her effort at  being such a strong voice for peace and rationality, because we have to  continue to amplify this message for the American people.   I thank the congresswoman again for allowing me to participate in  this conversation this evening.
