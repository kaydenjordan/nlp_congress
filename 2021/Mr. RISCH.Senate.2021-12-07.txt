 Mr. President, fellow Senators, I rise to oppose the  matter that is before us, and I want to rise in support of the sale of  these particular weapons to the Saudis.   The Saudis are an ally of ours. As with many allies, they have items  that we don't agree with, and those obviously have been highlighted  here on the floor today. My colleague, the chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee, has laid out exactly why we need to see that the  sale goes through.   There have been 240-plus drone missiles to strike Saudi targets this  year. The latest one was just yesterday. These are Houthi rebel drones  that come out of Yemen. They are provided to them by the Iranians. This  thing would be over if the Iranians would back away and get out of  this.   I agree that we need to press for a solution here. What is going on  in Yemen  [[Page S8955]]  is one of--not the but close to it--one of the worst humanitarian  crises on the planet today. In fact, what is going on there, it is  going to get worse as this year goes on. As the Senator from New Jersey  indicated, the Houthis have been really unhelpful in getting  humanitarian supplies to the people of Yemen, who badly need it.   The Saudis, obviously, need the weaponry that is included in this  sale. There are a lot of American citizens in Saudi Arabia, and we  should support our allies when they are doing defensive things like  this to defend themselves, to defend Americans who are present in their  country. We all hope that this will reach a resolution in the near  future.   The Iranians are the ones who are stoking this fire. The Houthis are  not helpful to us. But we need to help the Saudis defend themselves. So  I would urge a ``no'' vote on this matter before us.   I yield the floor.
