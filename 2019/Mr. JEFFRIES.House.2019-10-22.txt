If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this       Act, or the application of such  [[Page H8352]]       provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held       to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the       amendments made by this Act, and the application of the       provision or the amendment to any other person or       circumstance, shall not be affected.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we will vote on H.R. 2426, the Copyright  Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act, otherwise known as the  CASE Act, a bill that will allow creators to protect their copyrighted  work under law.   Copyright infringement is not a victimless crime. Photographers,  illustrators, visual artists, authors, songwriters, and musicians all  rely upon their protected works to put food on the table, clothing on  their backs, and support their families. When their copyrighted work is  used unlawfully or pirated, that is the functional equivalent of a  burglary.   But small creators victimized by infringement often find themselves  in a tough spot. They have a right to enforce their work under  copyright law but are often unable to do so in a practical sense.   On the one hand, you have the notice and takedown process that can be  inefficient, cumbersome, and, as many small creators will tell you,  often pointless. On the other hand, there is the Article III Federal  court system that can be expensive, time-consuming, and often out of  reach for many working-class and middle-class creators.   For instance, the average cost of litigating an infringement case in  Federal court is approximately $350,000, but the total amount of  damages that can be awarded, for instance, in a CASE Act-eligible  matter cannot exceed $30,000. In that instance, the cost of litigating  a case could be more than 10 times the damages that are at issue.   According to a survey by the American Bar Association, which supports  this legislation, most lawyers will not take infringement cases with  damages at or lower than $30,000. As a result, many petitioners are  functionally unable to vindicate their rights under law. In other  words, these creators are given a right without a remedy.   The CASE Act will provide a viable alternative. This legislation  would establish a voluntary forum for small copyright claims housed  within the Copyright Office. Disputes would be heard by a new entity  called the Copyright Claims Board made up of intellectual property  experts with experience representing both creators and the users of  copyrighted material.   Unlike Federal court, the cases before the board will have limited  damages. Parties would not have to appear in person and can proceed, if  they choose, without an attorney.   These provisions address the significant burdens that currently  exist, imposed by Federal court litigation, making this system more  user-friendly for all, regardless of your side, but inclusive of  working-class and middle-class members of the creative community.   Both sides must agree to participate in order for the small claims  tribunal to have jurisdiction. It is a voluntary system where either  side can opt out.   Simply put, the legislation allows for copyright disputes to be  resolved in a fair, timely, and affordable manner.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the distinguished  gentleman from the Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. Cline) for his  leadership as it relates to the CASE Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), the distinguished chair of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, the CASE Act is the product of more than 10 years of  careful study by this House and the United States Copyright Office.   As Chairman Nadler indicated, I want to thank the Copyright Office  for the work that they have done in laying the foundation for the CASE  Act.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that  creators, authors, musicians, and users finally have a forum for small  copyright claims where they can meaningfully assert their rights and  defenses.   This bill has support through cosponsorship of more than 150 Members  of this House on both sides of the aisle, and I thank each and every  one of them.   The bill is endorsed by dozens of groups, including the American Bar  Association, AFL-CIO, the NAACP, the Copyright Alliance, the United  States Chamber of Commerce, the Association of American Publishers, the  Authors Guild, CreativeFuture, Nashville Songwriters, National Press  Photographers, the Recording Academy, the Latin American Recording  Academy, the Songwriters Guild of America, the Institute for  Intellectual Property and Social Justice, the Songwriters of North  America, as well as SAG-AFTRA, and many, many more. I would like to  thank all of them for their advocacy and for their effort.   Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution  gives Congress the power to create a robust intellectual property  system in order to, in the words of the Framers of the Constitution,  ``promote the progress of science and useful arts.''   The Founders recognized that society would benefit if we incentivize  and protect creativity and innovation. In doing so, the creative  community will continue to share their creative brilliance with the  American people and the world and experience some benefit from the  fruits of their labor.   Times have changed since the provisions of Article I, Section 8,  Clause 8 were first written into the Constitution in 1787, but the  constitutional principle remains the same, and that is what the CASE  Act is all about.   I would like to thank the many cosponsors of this legislation,  including my good friend, Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug  Collins; the Judiciary Committee chair for his tremendous leadership,  Jerry Nadler; Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet  Subcommittee Chairman Hank Johnson; Courts, Intellectual Property, and  the Internet Subcommittee Ranking Member Martha Roby; Ted Lieu; Ben  Cline; Judy Chu; Brian Fitzpatrick; and many, many others.   On the Senate side, I am grateful for the leadership of Senators John  Kennedy, Dick Durbin, Thom Tillis, and Mazie Hirono, who are original  cosponsors of the Senate companion to this legislation, which is making  its way through that Chamber as well.   In the last Congress, we came together, Democrats and Republicans,  progressives and conservatives, the left and the right, to pass the  historic Music Modernization Act that was signed into law by President  Donald Trump, illustrating that we can come together. In this instance,  I am grateful that the same coalition has come back together in support  of the working-class and middle-class creative community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
