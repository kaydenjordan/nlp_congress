 Madam Speaker, this Thanksgiving is expected to be the  most expensive in history due to skyrocketing inflation. Americans are  also being warned that their Christmas presents will cost more and  might not arrive on time due to the supply chain disruptions. I hope  that doesn't happen.   President Biden's and House Democrats' out-of-control spending  policies are to blame for both the economic and supply chain woes. To  make matters worse, they are now pushing a made-in-America tax, which  will only drive businesses and jobs overseas and further devastate our  troubled economy.   There are plenty of signs that our economy is significantly  struggling, unfortunately. Most recently, the GDP growth decelerated to  2 percent in the third quarter. This is the slowest growth rate since  the start of the pandemic-era recovery. Real disposable personal income  also decreased another 5.6 percent in the third quarter after  decreasing a staggering 30.2 percent in the second quarter.   We must reverse course and abandon these irresponsible policies  rather than continuing to compound the economic pain.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Dr.  Ruiz, for organizing this very important Special Order. I know he is a  terrific doctor, and the fact that he has sacrificed to be here, to  complete the mission. I appreciate it so very much. I have a similar  story as well, but we must complete this mission as soon as possible.  As Jennifer said, this is the Agent Orange of our era.   Providing the care and support for our veterans, our Nation's heroes,  has been one of my top priorities since I was elected to Congress, and  I will continue to fight to ensure that our veterans get the benefits  they deserve.  [[Page H6173]]    As a matter of fact, after one of our hearings a few years ago on the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, we had many veterans who were exposed  to Agent Orange. Their families were present with them, their children  were present with them, and I invited them into my office. One-on-one,  they told me the stories of what happened. The spouses would tell me:  my husband, my wife, was exposed, and now he or she can't work. Who is  going to support the family? What is going to happen to these children  if their father or mother passes away? Who is going to take care of  them? They need healthcare now. They need their benefits now.   We can't wait any longer, Madam Speaker. Burn pits are the Agent  Orange of our era, as Jennifer said. And the fact that we haven't  resolved the issue of burn pit exposure is an absolute disservice to  our veterans. They were exposed, and we must help them.    I have fought for over multiple Congresses, with my colleague Dr.  Ruiz and my colleague Brad Wenstrup from the great State of Ohio,  leading and sponsoring numerous pieces of legislation to get toxic- exposed veterans the treatment and benefits they deserve, because many  cannot afford to wait any longer.   Tragically, one of our veterans came to me a few years ago, Lauren  Price. Similar to Dr. Ruiz and Jennifer, we made it our mission to get  this done. During Lauren's service to our country, she was exposed to  burn pits. This past spring, she sadly passed away due to an illness  linked to her burn pit exposure, but not before taking up the cause for  her fellow veterans to make sure they or their families would not have  to experience the same suffering she and her family experienced. Lauren  knew that she was going to pass away, but she wanted to make it better  for her fellow veterans. Her goal was to pass this legislation and  similar legislation that Dr. Ruiz and I have cosponsored over the  years.   I was incredibly moved to see her husband and my good friend, Jim  Price, continue this tireless advocacy by testifying as a witness  before the Veterans' Affairs Committee just this past year in support  of the TEAM Act, which would comprehensively address toxic exposures  now and in the future.   This critical bill adopts provisions for my legislation that I  previously authored, the Protection for Veterans' Burn Pit Exposure  Act.   I urge Congress to take up and pass the TEAM Act immediately. If we  are going to be spending money, Madam Speaker, let's spend it on our  heros.   I am also proud to co-lead a host of additional burn pit legislative  fixes with Dr. Ruiz and urge immediate action in the House and Senate  on H.R. 4398, H.R. 4397, H.R. 2432, and H.R. 2371.   While both H.R. 4398 and H.R. 4397 were included in the House version  of the NDAA, we must continue pushing until they are across the finish  line and signed by the President.   Again, I thank my good friend, Dr. Ruiz, for organizing this Special  Order. I can't think of a more worthy cause than providing for these  veterans in their time of need, just as they provided for our country  when we needed them. Let's get this done for our veterans.
