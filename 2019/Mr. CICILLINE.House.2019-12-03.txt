 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 565) to include Portugal in the list of foreign states whose  nationals are eligible for admission into the United States as E1 and  E2 nonimmigrants if United States nationals are treated similarly by  the Government of Portugal, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 565         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Mutual Interests       and Growing Our Success Act'' or the ``AMIGOS Act''.       SEC. 2. NONIMMIGRANT TRADERS AND INVESTORS.         For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of section       101(a)(15)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)), Portugal shall be considered to be a       foreign state described in such section if the Government of       Portugal provides similar nonimmigrant status to nationals of       the United States.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H9190]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the AMIGOS Act is a bipartisan bill that I introduced,  along with the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), my colleague, to  encourage greater investment and trade between the United States and  Portugal.   H.R. 565 makes Portuguese nationals eligible for E-1 and E-2  nonimmigrant visas if the Government of Portugal provides similar  nonimmigrant status to U.S. nationals. Access to these investor visas  will allow Portuguese investors to support projects in the United  States, which will benefit our economy as well as that of Portugal.   As one of the first countries to recognize the United States after  the Revolutionary War, Portugal is one of our closest economic partners  and strongest allies. Today, the United States maintains that  longstanding relationship as the fifth largest export market for  Portugal and its largest trading partner outside of the European Union.   I am proud to represent the First District of Rhode Island, home to  one of the country's largest and most vibrant Portuguese communities, a  community that has made outstanding contributions in the arts, culture,  business, and public service in this country for many decades.   From 2010-2015, we saw a 30 percent increase in trade between the  United States and Portugal. 2015 also marked the year that the United  States became Portugal's largest trading partner outside the European  Union, with bilateral trade reaching $4.2 billion. Bilateral trade in  goods and services between the United States and Portugal has continued  to grow, with a 9 percent increase from $8 billion in 2018 when  compared to just a year earlier. There are currently over 130 American  companies operating in Portugal in a wide range of economic sectors,  including pharmaceutical, chemical, technology, banking, and health  sectors.   In 2018, the United States' direct investment position in Portugal  was $2.8 billion, an increase of 37 percent from 2017. The direct  investment position from Portugal in the United States, however,  experienced a 3.5 percent decrease to $1 billion from 2017 to 2018.   While the majority of the countries within the European Union had  preexisting bilateral investor treaties with the United States before  joining the EU, Portugal did not and is one of the only five EU  countries whose citizens are not currently eligible for E-1 or E-2  visas.   In the absence of a bilateral treaty, which Portugal cannot enter due  to the rules of the European Union, Congress has the power to authorize  E-1 and E-2 benefits to other countries; and we have exercised our  authority to do so for both Israel in 2012 and New Zealand just last  year. I am pleased to lead the effort to do the same for Portugal.   Foreign direct investment plays a significant role in the U.S.  economy. One of the most important factors in encouraging investments  in the United States is the availability of business-related visas,  like nonimmigrant E-1 and E-2 visas. Allowing Portuguese citizens  access to conduct substantial trade between the United States and  Portugal or invest a substantial amount of capital in the United States  to qualify for nonimmigrant E-1 and E-2 visas will help strengthen  U.S.-Portugal ties and promote an increase in Portugal's investments in  the United States.   Extending visas to Portugal not only gives Portuguese businesses an  opportunity to invest in the United States, but it is a mutually  beneficial relationship that promotes jobs in both countries and growth  in United States businesses and our economy.                                time  1600    I am proud to lead this effort to support our ally and friend,  Portugal. I want to thank Chairman Nadler for his strong support of  this legislation and for bringing this bill to the floor today. I  encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 565, the AMIGOS Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which  will strengthen the really important and historical relationship  between the United States and Portugal, which will help to promote  economic growth in both of our countries, lead to the creation of good  paying jobs, and really strengthen the long and important economic  relationship between our two great countries.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
