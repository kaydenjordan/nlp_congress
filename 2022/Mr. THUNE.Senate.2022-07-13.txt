 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, inflation numbers came out this morning,  and, once again, they were not good. Inflation in June was 9.1  percent--9.1 percent, the highest level since November of 1981.   Groceries are up 12 percent, on average. Baby food is up 14 percent,  milk up 16 percent. Chicken is up 18 percent. And the list goes on.  Household cleaning products are up 11 percent. Gas prices are up nearly  60 percent. Furniture and bedding are up 13 percent. Utility gas  service is up 38 percent. Health insurance is up 17 percent and on and  on and on.   Everywhere Americans look, they are facing price increases, price  increases on the most essential items: groceries, gas, their utility  bills. And on top of all this, real average hourly earnings are  currently declining at the fastest pace in 40 years. Fifty-eight  percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Price increases  on the most essential items--groceries, gas, their utility bills--all  these things are forcing Americans to dig into their savings, when they  have them, to try and make ends meet.   Others are relying on things like credit cards or visits to food  banks. Demand for food assistance has soared in recent months. One  organization in my hometown in South Dakota received 600 more calls for  food assistance in May of this year than it had received in the same  month a year ago. Food banks often have fewer resources to meet the  need, thanks to declines in donations and the high price of groceries.  And there is no end to this pain in sight.   A recent Joint Economic Committee analysis found that inflation will  cost the average household $7,620 over the next year or $635 per  month--$635 per month. That is an unsustainable burden for working  families.   By now, most Americans are familiar with how we got here. When  President Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent, well within  the Fed's target inflation rate of 2 percent. And it might have stayed  there had Democrats not decided to pass a massive and  [[Page S3248]]  partisan $1.9 trillion spending spree under the guise of COVID relief,  mere weeks--mere weeks--after Congress had passed a fifth bipartisan  COVID bill that met essentially all current pressing COVID needs.   The Democrats' so-called American Rescue Plan sent a lot of  unnecessary government money into the economy, and the economy  overheated as a result. You don't have to take my word for that on the  damaging effects of this legislation. Here is what one Democratic  economist who worked in the Obama administration had to say on the  subject:         The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in the early       days of the Biden administration will go down in history as       an extraordinary policy mistake.    Another former Obama adviser noted:         The original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan. It       contributed to both higher output but also higher prices.    Those are warnings that came from Democrats that their so-called  American Rescue Plan ran the risk of overheating the economy, but  Democrats here in Congress passed it anyway. The President signed it.   What is also worse is that even after they saw the inflation that  resulted from their $1.9 trillion boondoggle, they spent months last  year trying to double down on the reckless spending that helped cause  so much inflation in the first place. Even as inflation was steadily  increasing, Democrats spent months working to pass their so-called  Build Back Better bill--a multitrillion-dollar--trillion-dollar-- reckless tax-and-spending spree that would have dumped more unnecessary  government money into an already overheated economy. But, fortunately,  their efforts ultimately failed last December.   But like a zombie, Democrats' Build Back Better tax-and-spending  spree just keeps coming back from the dead. That is right. Despite the  fact that our inflation crisis is even worse--worse now than it was  last fall--Democrats are once again considering a version of their  Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree. We don't know all the details  yet, but what we do know--what we do know--is cause for alarm.   Democrats are planning to raise taxes by a trillion dollars--$1  trillion--and a substantial part of that tax increase would come in the  form of new taxes on small businesses. That is right, on small  individually and family-owned businesses or what are often called  passthrough businesses; in other words, Main Street America, the  businesses that create jobs.   In South Dakota, passthroughs, such as sole proprietorships, S  corporations, and partnerships, employ an estimated 68 percent of the  private sector and represent almost 100 percent--99 percent or  thereabouts--of all businesses in my home State of South Dakota.  Nationwide, more than 90 percent of American businesses are  passthroughs, and these businesses employ tens of millions of  Americans.   Small business owners' expectations for better business conditions  recently hit an alltime low. Business owners are struggling with the  high cost of everything, from inputs to electricity, as inflation  continues to soar and global supply chains continue to be sluggish.   I recently read a comment from one small business owner in South  Dakota who noted:         It's hard when you're working so hard but you're not making       money. . . . We are right there right now.    ``It's hard when you are working so hard but you're not making  money.'' Yes, it is.   And if Democrats have their way, life for small business owners--and  their employees--is going to get even harder because raising taxes on  businesses will lead to a combination of lower wages for workers, lower  returns for business owners, and higher prices for goods and services.  It is just intuitive.   Think about it. If you are a small business owner, you are paying  more for inputs and all the supplies that you need to run your  business, and then government says: Oh, we are going to hand you a big,  fat tax increase on top of that, what happens? Well, you can take lower  profits--and some of them certainly, I am sure, will, but inevitably  that gets passed on in the form of higher cost to the consumers, to the  people they serve, their customers, or in the form of lower wages to  their employees. That is what it is going to do. It will also make it  more challenging for small business owners to reinvest in and grow  their businesses.   As I said, altogether, Democrats are contemplating raising taxes by  $1 trillion in their new Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree. And  those tax hikes and their economic impacts are not going to be limited  to small businesses, nor are they going to be limited to families  bringing home more than $400,000, despite the fact that the President  has repeatedly pledged not to raise taxes on families making less than  that.   The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation studied the tax-and-spend  provisions that Democrats are discussing, and its analysis shows that  lower and middle-income taxpayers will face significant hits from the  proposed tax hikes.   The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis--again, bipartisan,  nonpartisan organization studies the implications of taxing-and- spending provisions on our economy and on classes of different people  in this country--that JCT analysis found that more than half of  Americans earning between $100,000 and $200,000 would see a tax hike  next year as well as a quarter of Americans making between $75,000 and  $100,000 a year.   Raising taxes on small businesses, including passthroughs in South  Dakota and across this country, is a reckless--reckless--approach to  the economy.   Mr. President, we have an economy that is wobbling. I just mentioned  that the inflation numbers are historic: 9.1 percent. We haven't seen  that kind of inflation since 1981, back when I was in college.   We have an economy that some argue is already in a recession,  depending on what ultimately the numbers are for the second quarter of  this year. But some people--economists--are expecting negative GDP  growth for the second quarter, which, by the clinical, technical  definition, would put the country already into a recession. But most  economists and people who study this suggest that there is certainly a  likelihood of a recession within the next year.   So we have the prospect of a recession. We are looking down at the  possibility of record inflation, coupled with a recession, and what do  the Democrats want to do? Raise taxes. Raise taxes and grow government.  Spend more. Flood the zone with more spending. Hit businesses with  higher taxes, which will get passed on in the form of lower wages and  higher prices.   So the Democrats apparently are content with the idea of a recession.  They almost want to seem to guarantee that we want to get there, and I  am at a loss to understand any other reason why they would be  contemplating increasing the tax burden on small businesses and middle- class Americans during an inflation crisis.   Mr. President, Democrats tried their hardest last fall to double down  on the spending strategy that helped plunge us into this inflation  crisis in the first place. Mercifully--and I say ``mercifully,'' and I  thank God for a couple of discerning Democrats who saw otherwise-- mercifully, they failed.   Let's hope that common sense will once again prevail and the  Democrats' latest reckless tax-and-spending proposal will come to  nothing. American families are already suffering. They should not-- not--have to deal with the economic consequences of yet another ill- advised piece of Democratic legislation.   I yield the floor.
