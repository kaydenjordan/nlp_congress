The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 48         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 3) setting forth the       congressional budget for the United States Government for       fiscal year 2017 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary       levels for fiscal years 2018 through 2026. The first reading       of the concurrent resolution shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the concurrent       resolution are waived.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 48 provides for  consideration of S. Con. Res. 3, the FY17 budget resolution, as well as  consideration of a bill to move forward on the process of confirming  our civilian Secretary of Defense, former General Mattis.   Mr. Speaker, the rule is a structured rule today to move  expeditiously on both of these measures, and in the time we have gotten  to spend together, Mr. Speaker, you know I am a fan of the festival of  democracy that can be the Committee on Rules process, particularly the  appropriations process. But there are times where moving expeditiously  is required, and today is one of those days.   You are not going to see a rule like this come very often because we  are considering the FY17 budget resolution today. Historically, as you  know, in this Chamber, when we get ready to consider budget  resolutions, Mr. Speaker, we are considering every single one that any  Member of Congress would have an opportunity to write. That process  takes place every spring to meet the statutory deadline of passing  budgets by April. This is not that budget today, Mr. Speaker.   This is a budget, as you know, to move us forward on a reconciliation  process to finish up the FY17 budget process, and rather than  considering all the amendments that one might have to offer, we have  made in order just one. It is the Democratic substitute. It is offered  by my good friend, the ranking member on the Committee on the Budget,  Mr. Yarmuth, and it is absolutely worthy of the Membership's  consideration. But it is not going to be a vote-a-rama on every budget  known to mankind. It will be the underlying budget from the House  Committee on the Budget as well as one substitute from the ranking  member.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to consideration of the measure to waive a  statutory prohibition on naming a civilian Secretary of Defense who has  been out of the military for less than 7 years, we are also offering  that under a closed rule today. No amendments are going to be made in  order. You may not know, Mr. Speaker, but that is the  [[Page H478]]  only statutory change that has passed the United States Senate in 2017.   When we talk about having to move expeditiously, when we talk about  whether or not we are going to have an open process or a closed  process, understand that while this body has passed dozens of statutory  changes in just these first 9 days of legislative activity, the Senate  has passed but one. This is in anticipation of an inauguration of a  President on January 20. This is in anticipation of trying to fill out  a Cabinet. This is in anticipation of trying to make sure that civilian  leadership is in place on day one to lead and to serve the men and  women of the United States military.   This is not the time to have that vote-a-rama. This is the time to  move expeditiously, again, with a bill that has passed in a bipartisan  way in the other Chamber. I look forward to getting back into the  business of leading the Senate, not following the Senate. I look  forward to getting back in the business of voting on absolutely every  idea that Members bring to this floor.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule so that  we can move expeditiously on two of our priorities: passing that FY17  budget resolution and ensuring the speedy confirmation of the civilian  leader of the Department of Defense.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this  restrictive rule, and I rise in strong opposition to the underlying  legislation.   Because of Republican in-fighting, Congress was unable to do one of  its most basic jobs last year, passing a full budget for FY17. So now  House Republicans have brought this budget bill to the floor, but we  all know that this is just a vehicle for them to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and take away health care from millions and millions of  Americans.   For nearly 7 years, my Republican friends have railed against the  Affordable Care Act. Their well-funded allies have spent billions of  dollars distorting the ACA and lying to the American people about what  it actually does. And for nearly 7 years there has not been a single  comprehensive healthcare bill brought to the floor by Republicans as a  replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Not one.   We have voted over 60 times to repeal the ACA on the House floor. I  will be the first to admit that ACA is not perfect, but rather than  work together to tweak it or to make it better, all we get from them  are repeal bills, repeal bills, repeal bills. Let me again point out  that not once, not once, was there a replacement bill offered.   Not only do Republicans not have a plan to replace the Affordable  Care Act and protect access to health care for more than 20 million  Americans who gained coverage, they can't even agree on a timeline for  when they will pass their replacement. President-elect Trump says  repeal and replace will be done on the same day, and he wants it to  happen now. Representative Steve Scalise said Republicans will replace  the ACA over the course of the next few months. Senator John Thune said  it could take 2 or 3 years for the replacement to be implemented.  Representative Chris Collins said Republicans have 6 months to work out  the replacement plan, and Senator Mitch McConnell refused to even give  a timeline, just saying that it would happen.    Well, while the Republicans fight with each other over timelines, I  think it is appropriate to ask: If they did have a replacement, what  would that replacement be?   Well, President-elect Trump has the answer. When asked what we should  replace ObamaCare with, he said: ``Something terrific.'' When pressed  for further details, and more specificity, he said: ``Something that  people will really, really, really like.''   Mr. Speaker, you can't make this stuff up. It would be laughable if  it weren't so tragic. It is tragic because what Republicans are trying  to do is take healthcare protections away from millions and millions of  families.   Now, no one in this Congress has to worry about health care if the  Affordable Care Act is repealed, and the Donald Trumps of the world  certainly don't have to worry about health care if the Affordable Care  Act is repealed. If someone in their family gets really sick, they will  just sell some stocks or close down another American factory or not pay  their workers, as our President-elect has been known to do on many,  many occasions.   But for millions of Americans, it will be a different story.  Repealing the ACA would mean over 30 million Americans would lose  coverage, including nearly 4 million children. More than 52 million  individuals with preexisting conditions could have coverage rescinded  or see their premiums dramatically increased. Millions of young adults  would be unable to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26. Over  14 million individuals enrolled in Medicaid under the expansion would  lose coverage, and nearly 140 million individuals with private  insurance would lose access to preventive services without copays and  deductibles. And millions of seniors would see their prescription drug  prices increase because it would reopen the so-called doughnut hole  that the ACA has begun to close.   Republicans want to slash Medicaid, a healthcare program that does a  lot of good stuff and enables mothers to work their way out of poverty  by providing affordable coverage for their children. As someone who  represents Massachusetts, this is especially personal because Medicaid  is one of the best tools we have in the fight against opioid addiction,  providing real care for the addiction and underlying conditions that  drive the opioid epidemic in our communities. Repealing Medicaid  expansion under the ACA would rip coverage away from an estimated 1.6  million newly insured individuals with substance use disorders.   That is what is at stake, and that is what my Republican colleagues  are so happy, giddy, and excited to do. It is sad. It is pathetic, but  they are moving forward anyway with no replacement in sight. I suppose  they can roll out their oldies but goodies, like health savings  accounts or their other healthcare prescription, take two tax breaks  and call me in the morning. But that doesn't do it.   Mr. Speaker, we have a complicated healthcare system, no doubt. I  wish it were simpler. That is why I have always favored a single-payer  system and that is why I favored a public option. But the problem with  our system before ObamaCare was that it left all the decisions up to  the insurance companies.   Do you remember the days when insurance companies could charge women  more for health insurance because they said being a woman was a  preexisting condition?   They can't do that anymore. Why? Not because of my Republican  friends. They can't do it anymore because we passed the ACA.   This budget bill would also give Republicans a green light to defund  Planned Parenthood. To my colleagues who are so anxious to defund  Planned Parenthood just to satisfy their rightwing base, let me ask:  Have you ever visited a Planned Parenthood clinic? Because if you had,  you would understand why what you are doing is so wrong.                                time  0930    The fact is that Planned Parenthood plays a critical role in  protecting and providing access to critical health services for both  women and men. One in five women has relied on a Planned Parenthood  health center for care in her lifetime, and Planned Parenthood serves  2.7 million patients each year. One of the most important statistics  that my Republican friends like to ignore is that more than 90 percent  of what Planned Parenthood does nationally is preventive care,  including cervical cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, and  family planning, not abortion services.   Add to this fact that Planned Parenthood clinics are often one of the  few affordable healthcare options available for many women. Nearly 80  percent of women using Planned Parenthood clinics have incomes at or  below 150 percent of poverty. It is easy to see why a majority of  Americans don't think Federal funding should be eliminated. In one  recent poll, 63 percent of voters,  [[Page H479]]  including 72 percent of independents, do not agree with my Republican  friends that Federal funding for Planned Parenthood should be  eliminated.   In fact, we also heard very little about the consequences that  defunding Planned Parenthood would have for families across the  country. One of the biggest myths perpetrated by Republicans is the  idea that our Nation's community health centers, which I love and adore  and respect, could suddenly pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood is  defunded.   For the millions of low-income women who depend on Planned Parenthood  clinics, defunding them would mean the loss of affordable and  accessible contraceptive services and counseling, as well as breast and  cervical cancer screenings. Simply put, for the many communities served  by Planned Parenthood clinics, recklessly cutting funding would wipe  out access to vital health services for the people who need them the  most.   Let me make something very clear. Zero Federal dollars go towards the  abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood--zero. The vast  majority of funding that Planned Parenthood receives comes in the form  of Medicaid reimbursements for preventive care that they provide.   Mr. Speaker, it is a cruel thing to do, to take away people's health  care. I will say to my Republican colleagues that they need to know  that we are going to fight you every step of the way on this. There are  some battles on behalf of the American people that are worth having and  worth fighting, and this is one of them--making sure that their health  care protections remain intact. I came to Congress to help people, not  make their lives more miserable.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me comment briefly on the other piece of  legislation in this rule, S. 84. General James Mattis has been praised  by both Democrats and Republicans, but there is very real concern about  civilian control over the military, the language of the underlying  legislation, and the duties and responsibilities of the House of  Representatives.   General Mattis has a distinguished career, but we are talking about  changing the law here. Approving a waiver for him to serve in the  Cabinet so soon after his military service is a serious decision. It is  so serious that such a waiver has happened only once before in the  entire history of the United States. Now, we should debate this.  Instead, the Trump transition team canceled General Mattis' testimony  before the House Armed Services Committee and now expects us to vote  for him willy-nilly without us being able to ask him any questions.   Congress is supposed to be a check on the executive branch, but if  the House is denied the opportunity to meet with and question the  military officer who is nominated as our next Defense Secretary, how  can we fulfill our duty and blindly just vote for him?   I would also say to my Republican friends, this is an early warning  sign of the disregard that this new administration has for the House of  Representatives. General Mattis was willing to testify, but the Trump  team said no. They said no to the House of Representatives. Caving in  on this issue will only mean continued disregard for the people's House  in the future, and I think that that is regrettable.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield 4 minutes  to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), who probably knows more  about the Health and Human Services Appropriations bill than anyone  else in this Congress, the cardinal from that committee in the 114th  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to thank my  colleague for her admonition to reject divisive and self-serving  rhetoric because I think that is absolutely something we should take to  heart.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee and a new member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Reluctantly I recognize that we are, apparently, not going to have an  end to divisive, self-serving rhetoric. I am still optimistic, as it is  a long year ahead of us.   What the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) is suggesting, Mr.  Speaker, is that we ensure the failure of Social Security going  forward. The only guaranteed benefit in Social Security is that it is  guaranteed to fail. Those are not my words. These are the words of the  actuaries who are in charge of protecting Social Security. The  nonpartisan actuaries who govern Social Security say that there is not  enough money today to pay the benefits that folks are expecting. The  law of the land, as it exists today, requires that, when that day  comes, benefits will get cut dramatically. Only a 75 percent  realization of benefits is what the law requires that befalls our  senior citizens. If we pass the amendment that is suggested by my  friend, we would be prohibited from considering any solutions to that  problem. Means testing, which my colleagues have advocated for years,  is off the table under that scenario.   Mr. Speaker, to suggest that anyone on this side of the aisle wants  to undermine the commitment that this country has made to our seniors  is ludicrous; but to suggest that I go to a 22-year-old, whose polling  today suggests he or she believes they are more likely to see a UFO in  their lifetime than a Social Security check in their lifetime--to  suggest that going to that 22-year-old and my thinking that maybe his  retirement age would be a year or two higher than his great- grandparents' since he is now living decades longer--I will remind my  colleagues we came together in a bipartisan way to raise the retirement  age from 65 to 67 in 1983, not because one of us hated seniors and one  of us loved seniors, but because we all believed in our commitment to  seniors.    Mr. Speaker, don't let the Record reflect anything other than that  this budget resolution provides the framework to begin this discussion,  to begin the discussion of what comes next. There is not a single line  of authorizing language in this budget resolution. Any suggestion that  the law will change tomorrow because of this budget resolution is  false. The law will be the same tomorrow as it was yesterday. The  difference is we have begun a path--we will have created a framework;  we will have provided the tools--to have a discussion about how to  solve very real problems in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me respond to my colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, by saying  that I don't know what he is talking about. The Pocan amendment is  pretty clear. It says that there will be a point of order against any  legislation that would cut the benefits under Social Security,  Medicare, or Medicaid or would attempt to privatize Social Security.   Now, I know my Republican friends want to privatize Social Security,  because they tried that in the past; and I know they want to privatize  Medicare and turn it into a voucher system, because that is what their  budgets continually do. I mean, that is what we are trying to prevent.   If you want to privatize Social Security, if you want to privatize  Medicare and turn it into a voucher system, then stand with them. But  if you want to protect these programs--and the vast majority of  Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents want to protect the  integrity of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--then oppose this  budget.   By the way, this budget, basically, is the green light to go ahead  and destroy the protections that people value in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Massachusetts said in his opening statement that  he didn't come to Congress to hurt people; that he came to help people.  I want to stipulate that that is 100 percent true. There is no one in  this Chamber who I believe has a bigger heart for men and   [[Page H482]]  women than the gentleman from Massachusetts, which is why I know that  he does not support what I see happening to my constituency.    He says people are paying less for their health care today. I dispute  those numbers writ large, but I know it is true in my district because  the free healthcare clinic has doubled since the passage of ObamaCare.  Folks once had access to small plans that they chose for their  families. Those plans were outlawed. Now they have high deductible  plans that are worthless to them, so they seek care at the free  clinics. I know that ripping the plans out from under those men and  women in my district was not the gentleman's intention when he passed  the Affordable Care Act, but it is absolutely the result.   I know that when the gentleman set up those exchanges, which all  Americans were supposed to be able to go to to buy their healthcare  plans, he did not intend for those plans to get canceled year after  year after year after year, because they were unsustainable. We all  know, of the constituents in our districts who did what the government  told them to do, they lost the plans their employers used to provide;  they went to the exchanges to buy a plan; and, 1 year later, those  plans were canceled. They went through the process again: they picked  out other plans; they went through the exchanges and paid their money;  and, 1 year later, those plans were canceled again and again.   We all know those constituents; so to suggest that the only reason  someone would come to the floor today would be to solve a nonexistent  problem is ridiculous. We all know that there are problems. What is  ridiculous are the folks who would come and defend the status quo. The  status quo is indefensible, Mr. Speaker.   When we get together, we can do amazing things. There are vast  experiences of the Members in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, and our  bringing those to the table leads to better solutions. We have spent 6  years being stuck in the status quo, and this bill represents an  opportunity to turn the page on that status quo, and I know every  single Member has constituents in his district who will welcome it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to help the gentleman understand the benefits of the ACA  in his home State of Georgia:   There are 468,000 individuals in the State who have gained coverage  since the ACA was implemented, and now they could lose it if he gets  his way.   478,000 individuals in the State who were able to purchase high- quality marketplace coverage now stand to lose that coverage if the  gentleman gets his way.   In 2016, 427,000 individuals in the State have received financial  assistance to purchase marketplace coverage; they are at risk of losing  that.   65,000 kids have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented in the  State of Georgia.   74,000 young adults are able to stay on their parents' health  insurance until they are 26 because of the ACA.   That is all in Georgia. So I would hope the gentleman would  understand what is happening in his own State before he votes to repeal  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I was not in Congress at the time the Affordable Care Act passed, but  I remember it, watching from home. We talk about this as if it was some  sort of thoughtfully crafted piece of legislation that folks are so  tremendously proud of. I happen to have the numbers here, Mr. Speaker.   It was H.R. 4872 that moved through the House, that was the  authorizing part. We had three votes in the U.S. House of  Representatives on that bill. We had a motion to recommit, as it was  not actually a healthcare bill to begin with, and a vote on final  passage.   Then it went over to the U.S. Senate where they worked their will on  it. They had 43 votes on it, amendments offered, ideas, and changes.   Then it came back to the House where we changed it not at all. There  was one straight partisan vote on the Affordable Care Act. Not one idea  from the U.S. House of Representatives added, not one change from the  U.S. House of Representatives, not one alteration of any kind.   As you recall, Mr. Speaker, they had a filibuster-proof majority in  the United States Senate, so Democrats could work their will any way  they wanted. When they lost that filibuster-proof majority--they only  had 59 votes out of 100 instead of 60--they ended debate, they ended  discussion, they ended collaboration and jammed what they had passed at  midnight on Christmas Eve right on through the U.S. House of  Representatives. I can't imagine who defends that as the proper outcome  of the legislative process. We have a chance to change that, Mr.  Speaker.   I am glad that my friend from Connecticut has some constituents that  have benefited. I have some constituents that have benefited. But I  have constituents who are being failed, and I know my friend from  Connecticut does, too.   I am glad that my friends on the other side of the aisle are talking  about all of their success stories, but I want my friends to join me  and grapple with all of the failures.   I will not deny the way the conversation about health care has  changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act--folks talking  about preexisting conditions, folks talking about lifetime caps, folks  talking about keeping young kids on their policies until they are 26.   I just don't understand why my colleagues would deny that folks who  used to have care, now don't. Folks who used to have affordable plans,  now don't. Folks who used to be able to take care of their employees  through their small business plans, now can't. This is undisputed, and  we have an opportunity to do better. I hope my colleagues will join me  in doing that.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is entitled to his own  opinions but not his own facts. The facts with regard to the process in  which the Affordable Care Act was developed, I think, are worth  repeating here.   In the House of Representatives, we held nearly 100 hours of hearings  and 83 hours of committee markups. The House heard from 181 witnesses,  both Democrats and Republicans. 239 amendments were considered in the  three committees of jurisdiction, and 121 of them were adopted. The  bill was available for 72 hours before Members were asked to vote on  the floor.    In the Senate, the Senate Finance Committee held more than 53  hearings. The committee also spent 8 days marking up the legislation,  the longest  [[Page H483]]  markup in the 22 years of the committee. The Senate Health Committee  held 47 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs on the  healthcare reform bill.   So to say that this was not a thoughtful process is just wrong.   Compare that to the way this budget bill is being brought to the  floor. There is no committee consideration, no deliberation. It is just  given to us. In fact, most of the committees aren't even organized yet  in the House of Representatives.   So there is a contrast there, and I stand with the way we approached  the Affordable Care Act as opposed to the way the Republicans have  approached this budget deal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to share with my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) that one is  not entitled to their own facts, but one is also not entitled to share  just half the story and leave it as if it is the entire story.   Everything the gentleman from Massachusetts said was true, until the  U.S. House abdicated any responsibility whatsoever and passed exactly  what the Senate did with no amendment whatsoever. All of the work  product the gentleman talked about, all of the work that the gentleman  talked about went for naught in this U.S. House of Representatives.   To deny that this is not the bill that folks wanted to have crafted  is to deny reality. To deny that this is not the bill that folks wanted  to have crafted is to deny the nine different times the Republican  House and Senate sent to the President repeals of ObamaCare, things  that were so broken even the President couldn't live with it and he  signed those repeals into law.   Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to denigrate any of the motives of my  friends on the other side of the aisle. I just can't understand, for  the life of me, why they don't want to try to do better.   That pride of authorship, that arrogance, it has a real impact on the  men and women that I serve, and I am asking my friends to partner with  me to help me fix it. But if they won't partner with me, I am going to  move forward and fix it anyway.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have been willing to work with our Republican friends to try to  improve the Affordable Care Act for nearly 7 years. They have been  unwilling to work with us in a bipartisan way. Instead, they just want  to repeal, repeal, repeal.   Now, I don't know what their motivation is. Maybe it is because they  don't like President Obama. Judging from some of the rhetoric that we  have heard on this House floor over these years, I think some of the  Members over there actually hate the President of the United States,  and this is all driven by this personal animosity.   Let me just say to the gentleman that the Affordable Care Act may  have started out with a different bill number, but the facts remain  that there were hundreds of hours of hearings on the Affordable Care  Act, 181 witnesses testified; hundreds of amendments were considered in  committee.   The process of using a different bill number is very common in both  Chambers. In fact, the House Republicans have done it several times in  the past 3 years. Regardless of the bill number, the work that went  into forming this legislation was one of the most open processes in the  history of the Congress, and it has resulted in providing protections  and health care for millions and millions of people in this country.  All of that is at risk with this budget resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say  absolutely none of that is true. Absolutely not one word of that is  true. This bill does not one of those things. This bill does, in fact,  nothing to change the law at all in any way, shape, or form. It is not  true. This bill provides a process for debating the law, and I  certainly hope we will pass it so we can have that debate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I advise my friend from Massachusetts I do  not have any further speakers and would be happy to close when he is  prepared.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. A report by Families U.S.A. said that repeal of the  Affordable Care Act equals a huge tax cut for the wealthy.   What people don't know, and the public doesn't know at the moment, is  that this will hand over to wealthy and major corporations new tax  breaks worth nearly $600 million--more than a half-trillion dollars  over 10 years, $345.8 billion over 10 years in tax cuts for people  whose incomes are over a specified threshold; $200,000 for single  individuals; and $250,000 for families. There are $274.4 billion over  10 years going to health insurance companies, drug manufacturers, and  other large healthcare corporations.   That is what repeal of the Affordable Care Act does. My colleagues  need to face up to that, and the public needs to know it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Medical Association, a letter from 120 interfaith groups, a letter from  the Consumers Union, a letter from the Massachusetts Health & Hospital  Association, a letter from a number of labor organizations in my home  State of Massachusetts, and a letter from UMassMemorial Community  Healthlink, which is a provider of comprehensive health care in my  district. They are all opposed to undoing the Affordable Care Act.                                   American Medical Association,                                       Chicago, IL, January 3, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Speaker       Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the physician and       medical student members of the American Medical Association       (AMA), I am writing regarding our ongoing commitment to       reform of the health care system and potential legislative       actions during the first months of the 115th Congress.        The AMA has long advocated for health insurance coverage       for all Americans, as well as pluralism, freedom of choice,       freedom of practice, and universal access for patients. These       policy positions are guided by the actions of the AMA House       of Delegates, composed of representatives of more than 190       state and national specialty medical associations, and they       form the basis for AMA consideration of reforms to our health       care system. (A summary of key AMA objectives for health       system reform is attached.)        Health system reform is an ongoing quest for improvement.       The AMA supported passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)       because it was a significant improvement on the status quo at       that time. We continue to embrace the primary goal of that       law--to make high quality, affordable health care coverage       accessible to all Americans. We also recognize that the ACA       is imperfect and there a number of issues that need to be       addressed. As such, we welcome proposals, consistent with the       policies of our House of Delegates, to make coverage more       affordable, provide greater choice, and increase the number       of those insured.        In considering opportunities to make coverage more       affordable and accessible to all Americans, it is essential       that gains in the number of Americans with health insurance       coverage be maintained.        Consistent with this core principle, we believe that before       any action is taken through reconciliation or other means       that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should       lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what       will replace current policies. Patients and other       stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy       to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about       whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process       of health reform.        We stand ready to work with you to continue the process of       improving our health care system and ensuring that all       Americans have access to high quality, affordable health care       coverage.            Sincerely,                                               James L. Madara, MD,      Executive Vice President, CEO.                                   ____                                                   January 12, 2017.        Dear President-elect Trump and Members of the U.S.       Congress: We the undersigned members of the investment and       public health communities want to re-affirm our deep       commitment to a more accessible and affordable health care       system by voicing our support for the continued expansion of       coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).        In order for our economy to thrive and Americans to       prosper, our health care system must be both equitable and       efficient. As a result of ACA's implementation, quality and       affordable health insurance has been guaranteed to more than       20 million previously uninsured Americans. While the ACA has       dramatically expanded coverage, we support reforms within the       framework of the Act to further contain rising health care       costs.        We agree that thoughtful improvements to the ACA are       needed, but we are deeply concerned by threats to repeal and/      or replace the ACA before these improvements are implemented.       Repeal of the ACA would destroy the tremendous strides we       have made as a nation in expanding coverage, would have a       destabilizing effect on jobs, businesses and our economy, and       would further jeopardize the health and financial security of       millions of Americans.        We call on you, our elected leaders to:        1) Preserve the Affordable Care Act.        2) Work collaboratively with all key stakeholders to       improve the ACA and better rein in health care costs.        3) Make the fiscal and political commitment necessary to       expand quality health care coverage to all Americans.        We pledge to do our part to support the ACA and expanded       health care coverage through our own operations and beyond,       and request that as legislators and leaders of our nation       entrusted with the health of all Americans, you will do the       same.

House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative McGovern: On behalf of Consumers Union,       the public policy and mobilization arm of nonprofit Consumer       Reports, I write to express our deep concern that the budget       resolution for fiscal year 2017 will begin a process that       could lead to the repeal of several key parts of the       Affordable Care Act (ACA), and could result in tens of       millions of Americans losing vital health coverage and the       destabilization of insurance markets. As an organization       whose founding principles include ensuring access to quality,       affordable health coverage and care for all, Consumers Union       is concerned that this would jeopardize both the health and       financial stability of American families.        Consumers Union has a long history of working for a fairer       and more just marketplace for consumers. We believe all       Americans deserve care and coverage that is accessible,       affordable, understandable, fairly priced, and meets high,       uniform standards for quality and safety. The Affordable Care       Act was an important step towards this goal, allowing more       than 20 million consumers to purchase private insurance       through exchanges or benefit from the Medicaid expansion,       thus lowering the uninsurance rate in our nation to its       lowest point ever.        The ACA also includes a number of critical consumer       protections that benefit all consumers, regardless of the       source of their coverage. The law prevents insurers from       discriminating against consumers with pre-existing conditions       or charging them more for coverage, prohibits insurers from       imposing annual or lifetime limits on coverage, and ensures       coverage of a comprehensive package of essential health care       services. It also takes steps to measure and improve the       safety and quality of care received by all. Consumers Union       opposes legislative changes that would eliminate or weaken       these critical consumer protections.        A move to repeal the ACA without a simultaneous replacement       that, at minimum, maintains coverage for the number of people       currently covered and provides comparable consumer       protections would be irresponsible and affect every American       family. It could destabilize the individual market for those       who buy insurance for themselves, resulting in fewer choices       for consumers and sending premiums skyrocketing while       benefits shrink. Consumers do not want to go back to a time       in which health insurers ran unchecked and insurance coverage       was out-of-reach and unreliable for so many Americans.        Consumers Union strongly urges you to oppose the repealing       of the Affordable Care Act.            Sincerely,                                                Laura MacCleery,         Vice President, Consumer Policy and Mobilization, Consumer       Reports.                                   ____                        Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association,                                                  January 12, 2017.

Moulton,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Stephen F. Lynch,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation:       On behalf of our member hospitals and health systems, the       Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association (MHA) opposes       the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). MHA is a       founding member of the new Massachusetts Coalition for       Coverage and Care that was formed to preserve and improve       access to health insurance coverage in Massachusetts and to       protect the gains in access to care, health, and health       equity that have resulted from near universal coverage. We       stand ready both as an individual organization and as a       coalition member to provide you the information and resources       you will need to oppose efforts to repeal the ACA.        As you know, Massachusetts has been a pioneer in expanding       health coverage over the years, including our state's       historic 2006 health reform law that served as a model for       the ACA. We believe our state serves as an example of how the       ACA's approach to expanding access to affordable health       coverage can be successful nationally if given the time and       support it deserves. With 10 years now passed since then-      Governor Mitt Romney signed our initial health reform       initiative into law, we can proudly say that the commonwealth       is better off than where we stood in 2005. We know we share       this sentiment with other Massachusetts healthcare providers,       insurers, the employer community, government leaders, and,       most importantly, Massachusetts consumers and families. With       time, support, and improvements to the ACA, we know the       country will value and appreciate the full benefits of       ensuring access to affordable health coverage to all citizens       as well as creating an environment for our health system to       better manage its resources and deliver high-quality care.        While we were successful in achieving expanded coverage       prior to the ACA, it took time and the collective effort of       all stakeholders to achieve the reductions in uninsured.       Expanding Medicaid was essential to providing coverage to the       poorest individuals in our society. First through waivers and       then through the ACA, the federal government has played an       instrumental role in supporting coverage to economically       challenged Massachusetts residents. Approximately 300,000       individuals now are covered due to the ACA's Medicaid       expansion, many of whom would otherwise be unable to afford       health insurance in the commercial market even with       government subsidies.        Since 2006, our state's health insurance exchange has       consistently served as a dynamic marketplace for those       purchasing insurance in the small group and non-group market.       In Massachusetts, we have modified our exchange to conform to       the ACA and it remains as robust as it did 10 years ago. The       state's Health Connector has experienced broad participation       from many health insurers, with 10 insurers currently       offering 62 insurance products. Lower and middle income       individuals have relied on the exchange for the past decade       to shop for affordable health coverage, benefitting from       subsidy support, which now comes in the form of federal tax       credits and co-payment subsidies. More than 234,000       individuals purchased their insurance coverage through the       state's exchange in December, including more than 190,000       with the support of federal advanced premium tax credits.       Another 1,300 small groups covering more than 6,000 lives       also purchased insurance in the exchange.        The effect of these expansions in reducing the number of       uninsured has been well documented. According to the United       States Census Bureau, Massachusetts had 97.2% of its       population covered with health insurance in 2015 compared to       89.3% for the three-year average between 2002 and 2005. This       coverage expansion had its greatest effect on people with       great healthcare needs, working adults with disabilities,       younger adults, people with low incomes, and women--all who       gained coverage at a faster rate than the general population.       And while there are many statistics that highlight the       achievements made in expanding coverage, there has been a       tremendous positive effect on individual lives  [[Page H486]]       as result of better access to care. Researchers have found       improvements in physical health, mental health, functional       limitations, joint disorders, and body mass index for those       in Massachusetts, especially for those with low incomes,       minorities, near-elderly adults, and women. Individuals here       and around the country also no longer fear not being able to       access health coverage due to pre-existing conditions or       having inadequate health coverage during their times of       medical need.        The cost of providing care to the uninsured also has been       significantly reduced due to reform. In Massachusetts, our       state's Uncompensated Care Pool covered hospital care for       low-income uninsured and underinsured residents for decades.       In FY2005 hospital uncompensated care costs totaled $702       million, or $992 million adjusting for inflation. This       financial burden to hospitals, insurers, and government was       yet another reason to address affordable coverage for low-      income residents so care could be better managed with       insurance coverage, including Medicaid. Hospital costs in the       program's successor, now called the Health Safety Net, was       $407 million in FY2016--or 59% percent less than prior to our       2006 reform adjusting for inflation. While there have been       some changes to the program over the years, undoubtedly the       most significant contributor to this reduction has been the       expansion of coverage. Also, it is impossible to calculate       the unknown potential for increased numbers of uninsured if       affordable health insurance had not been introduced in 2006       and maintained for the past 10 years.        A repeal of the ACA would turn back the clock here in       Massachusetts. Attempting to revert back to our Massachusetts       coverage programs that existed before the ACA would not be       accomplished easily and would involve significant challenges       related to the federal support needed for the current level       of coverage as well as hospital uncompensated care for       uninsured residents. The current subsidized insurance       offerings in the state's Connector exchange are now built off       of the ACA federal tax credit approach, and the financing of       that coverage is heavily dependent on federal funding. On the       Medicaid side, the ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility even in       states like Massachusetts that had higher levels of Medicaid       coverage through waivers. Massachusetts would likely need to       seek a waiver to maintain that coverage through Medicaid if       the ACA expansions were repealed. Of great concern, losing       the ACA's enhanced federal Medicaid funding for these       expansions would be a significant issue as the MassHealth       program is already facing financial challenges with growing       enrollment and reimbursement cuts to hospitals and other       providers.        The ACA also ushered in profound innovations that have       improved how healthcare is paid for and delivered. These       enhancements improved quality of care, improved value,       enhanced integration and collaborations in delivering care,       and expanded preventive health screening. And other federal       statutes, like meaningful use electronic medical record       changes and the new Medicare physician payment law (MACRA),       are designed to integrate with the ACA for success. The ACA       included many less well known provisions that have improved       the integrity of our healthcare system, such as the       ``sunshine'' act provisions which greatly improved       transparency in the financial relationships between       clinicians and manufacturers. These are only a handful of the       examples of how significantly the ACA has changed the way we       deliver healthcare and, either directly or indirectly, has       led to improvements in access and quality for everyone.        As you know, our hospitals are also in the midst of       responding to an opioid use crisis, increased prescription       drug prices, a behavioral health system in drastic need of       repair, and an aging patient population--all with limited       financial resources. The Massachusetts healthcare system is       also focused on improving the delivery of care and achieving       cost savings through increased care coordination. The ACA       aligns financial incentives and alternative payments as       levers for improving healthcare quality while driving down       costs. Without comprehensive health coverage, progress on all       of these efforts will be seriously challenged.        In dollar terms the picture is very clear if the ACA were       to be repealed--especially since a large part of the funding       for the ACA came from payment cuts to hospitals, and since       those cuts may continue despite repeal of essential ACA       components. A recent study commissioned by the American       Hospital Association (AHA) and Federation of American       Hospitals (FAH) found that hospitals stand to lose $289.5       billion in Medicare inflation updates alone from 2018 to 2026       if the payment cuts in the ACA are continued, and estimated       further hospital losses of $102.9 billion if Medicare and       Medicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions are       retained. The effect of these losses in Massachusetts would       be $12.3 billion over this time period, according to the       study. The report also estimates that nationwide insurance       coverage losses without a replacement would have an       additional $165.8 billion financial impact on hospitals in       this same time period. The AHA/FAH analysis also estimates       the cumulative federal payment reductions to hospital       services that have been imposed through other actions       subsequent to, and independent of, the ACA; these cuts total       another $148 billion nationally from 2010 to 2026, and come       on top of the ACA cuts.        The ACA, like Medicare in 1965, has had its growing pains,       but the benefits of the ACA far exceed any ongoing problems.       As with any comprehensive law it has been a work in progress.       We are still trying to review all the potential aspects of       what repeal might mean, but simply getting beyond the key       threats of repeal is difficult; the effect on coverage and on       the Medicaid waiver programs, the end of quality initiatives,       and the great hospital financial hit of not reversing the       cuts in place to pay for expansion are all extraordinarily       troubling. To our knowledge, no proposal has been floated       that would actually maintain insurance coverage that now       currently exists as a result of the ACA, or that would       continue the quality and delivery system improvements now       underway.        Our hospitals, and the thousands of healthcare employees in       the commonwealth, are on the frontline of providing some of       the best healthcare in the world. Every day Americans see the       importance of access to high-quality, cost-effective       healthcare, and millions more are insured because of the ACA.       We will work with you to ensure that affordable health       coverage is sustained so that our efforts can continue to       focus on the payment and delivery reforms which remain       underway.            Sincerely,                                                     Lynn Nicholas,      MHA President & CEO.                                   ____                                                   January 12, 2017.      Congressman Jim McGovern,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McGovern: We write today on behalf of       adults and children, persons with lived experience, family       members, providers, and organized labor that make up the       mental health and addiction disorders advocacy community to       urge you to strongly oppose any major restructuring of the       Medicaid program.        A study done by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health       Services Administration (SAMHSA) concluded that one in five       Americans experience a mental illness or addiction in any       given year. The number of adults and children in the       Commonwealth who need behavioral health care services is       staggering. In 2015 in Massachusetts, about 4.2% of all       adults aged 18 or older had a serious mental illness within       the year prior to being surveyed; 46.2% of these individual       did not receive any mental health treatment/counseling during       that time period.        Massachusetts and the United States as a whole are in the       midst of an unprecedented opioid epidemic. In Massachusetts,       an estimated 1475 individuals died from January 2016 to       September 2016. The first 9 months of 2016 saw a higher       opioid overdose rate than the first 9 months of 2015.       Nationwide, more people died from drug overdoses in 2014 than       in any year on record, and the majority of drug overdose       deaths (more than six out of ten) involved an opioid.        We know that recovery is possible for these individuals       with effective treatment and supports, which is why       preserving Medicaid funding for vital treatment services is       so important.        In 2014, spending by Medicaid accounted for 25% of all       mental health spending in the U.S. and 21% of all substance       use disorder expenditures in the nation. People with       behavioral health conditions are nearly one-third of the ACA       expansion population.        Republican proposals to drastically restructure Medicaid       will shift costs onto states and enrollees, restrict access       to care, and increase the number of uninsured and       underinsured. The ultimate goal of re-financing Medicaid into       block grants/per capita caps is to massively cut the amount       of federal spending for Medicaid. According to House Speaker       Paul Ryan's proposed Medicaid plan, these proposed changes       would result in a total of $1 trillion in cuts to federal       Medicaid spending over the next ten years. Massachusetts       would then be forced to increase state spending on the       Commonwealth's Medicaid program, and/or reduce eligibility,       payments to providers, or benefits.        Proponents of the block grant/per capita cap approach have       argued that states would gain greater flexibility in       designing and managing their Medicaid programs. However,       block grants/per capita caps will not provide any greater       programmatic flexibility to states than they have under       current law. States currently work with CMS through the       section 1115 waiver process to tailor their Medicaid program       to fit the needs of their specific state.        We are especially concerned about how many of the proposals       being offered by the President-Elect and Republican members       of Congress will impact access to vital behavioral health       services. The pressure on state Medicaid programs and the       corresponding efforts to reduce funding and eligibility will       put mental health and substance use disorder services at       significant risk. The risk to behavioral health services is       so high because Massachusetts, like the rest of the nation,       is not required to cover mental health and addiction       treatment services as part of our state Medicaid program.        Over the past decade, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has       implemented many reforms to improve health care delivery in       the Massachusetts. Despite these efforts, access to a robust       continuum of behavioral health services continues to be a       challenge for individuals living with a mental health and/or       addiction disorder. Any changes that result in reduced       funding for Massachusetts' Medicaid program will only       exacerbate this problem as Medicaid continues to be the       largest payer of these services across the Commonwealth.  [[Page H487]]         It is imperative that adults, children and families be able       to access the services they need, when they need them, where       they need them. These services should be person-centered,       outcome-oriented and clinically and cost effective. Massive       cuts to Medicaid funding will make the provisions of such       services almost impossible.        Thank you very much for your attention to this important       matter.

Attn: Jennifer Chandler, Chief of Staff,      Hon. Representative Jim McGovern,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative McGovern: On behalf of Community       Healthlink located in Worcester, Leominster and Fitchburg       Massachusetts, I am writing today to urge and request your       support in protecting the Affordable Care Act and preserving       Medicaid expansion in the 115th Congress.        We provide care to approximately 20,000 of the       Commonwealth's most vulnerable individuals. We deliver       outpatient mental health and substance abuse services,       residential programs for those with mental illness and       addiction, detoxification and stabilization services,       emergency services for Worcester and North Central       Massachusetts, for youth and adults. We also provide primary       care for a significant number of adults in addition to       services for the homeless in Worcester. The vast majority of       our patients are Medicaid eligible and many of the adults are       disabled due to mental illness. Though Massachusetts lead the       way with covering all of its citizens, at this point the ACA       provides a good deal of the funding that we need to continue       to provide this near universal coverage.        Recent health insurance data show that Americans with       mental health and substance use disorders are the single       largest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid       expansion. Approximately one in three people who receive       health insurance coverage through the Medicaid expansion       either have a mental illness, substance use disorder or both       simultaneously. By repealing the Medicaid expansion, this       population of vulnerable American would be left without       access to lifesaving treatment, driving up costs in emergency       room visits and hospital stays.        Moreover, I am writing to urge your support for the       protection of the Medicaid program from proposals to       restructure Medicaid as a block grant or capped program.       These proposals would reduce federal investment in Medicaid       and leave millions of Americans without access to needed       mental health and addictions treatment in our state and       communities. Please work with your colleagues to protect our       nation's most vulnerable patient population and preserve       their access to treatment.        Thank you for your continued support. I would be honored to       help you in any way possible.            Sincerely,      Marie Hobart, MD,        Chief Medical Officer, Community Healthlink Clinical       Associate Professor of Psychiatry University of Massachusetts       Medical School.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  the previous question, and that would allow us to vote on an amendment  by Mr. Pocan which would create a point of order against any  legislation that would cut the benefits under Social Security, Medicare  or Medicaid, or attempts to privatize Social Security.   So if you want to protect those programs, and if you are against  privatizing Social Security, then vote against the previous question so  we can bring this up.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me just say that this is a sad day because  what we are doing here by voting for this budget is setting in motion a  process to deny millions of people healthcare protections. I can't  imagine why anybody would want to do that.   Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? No, and we are the first to admit  it. We want to work in a bipartisan way to strengthen it, to make it  better, and to make it less onerous on certain businesses. But my  colleagues don't want to do that. They are determined just to vote for  an outright repeal, and that is going to hurt countless people in this  country, people who have now benefited from no preexisting conditions,  people who have benefited from allowing their kids to stay on their  insurance until they are 26, and senior citizens who have benefited  from closing the doughnut hole. I could go on and on and on. All of  that is about to be eliminated.   We are told that there will be replacement someday, somehow. For 6  years--over 6 years--you have been talking about repealing the  Affordable Care Act and a replacement, and you haven't brought one bill  to the floor--not one.   Now, we believe that health care ought to be a right; I know you  don't. We believe that healthcare protections ought to be in law; you  believe they ought to be up to the insurance company. But this is a  lousy thing to do. As I said in my opening statement, we are going to  fight you on this. This is a fight worth having. Protecting people's  health care is something that we all should be dedicated to, and we're  going to fight you on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their  remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am fond of telling folks back home, Mr. Speaker, when they tell me  they know exactly what is going to happen over the next 2 years, that I  don't think they are telling me the truth. Because I confess to you, I  have absolutely no idea what is coming over these next 2 years. I think  these next 2 years are going to be unlike any we have seen in the  history of self-governance in this land; and, candidly, I am excited  about that because the status quo isn't working for the 700,000 people  that I represent.   I don't know what's going to happen over these next 2 years, but I  believe that, for the first time, we are going to grapple with some  really, really, really hard problems that folks on both sides of the  aisle have been ignoring for too long.   Mr. Speaker, I don't question the commitment of my friends on the  other side of the aisle to the American people. I question the  legislation that they use to deliver it. You heard my friend from  Oklahoma talk about premiums going up 67 percent for his constituents.  That is indefensible. It is not okay. We can do better, and, with the  passage of this budget resolution, we will have the tools to do that. I  say again, the law will be the same tomorrow as it is today, but we  will have the tools to grapple with these problems.   Eight million Americans were so failed by the Affordable Care Act  that they paid a tax penalty instead of accessing care. That is not  okay. I don't believe a single Member on the other side of the aisle  decided they just wanted to tax young people instead of provide young  people with quality care. This budget will give us the opportunity to  have the tools to fix that problem.   Billions of dollars, Mr. Speaker, have gone into State-based co-ops  that have failed, gone bankrupt, and terminated all of their plans  which not only ripped health care out from under the American people,  Mr. Speaker, but threw billions of dollars away in administrative costs  at the same time. That is not okay. That is indefensible. We can do  better. Passing this budget resolution will give us those tools.   Mr. Speaker, I made a commitment in the Rules Committee last night to  do everything I could to stop poisoning the well of public discourse.  Then I re-  [[Page H488]]  upped for the Rules Committee, and I realized that is going to be a  tough promise to fulfill. We have difficult work to do, and we are  passionate about the quality of that work.   But, Mr. Speaker, we all know the status quo has failed. We all know  that we have the opportunity to deliver, and we all know that a vote of  ``yes'' on this budget resolution will give us more tools to deliver  that success than we have today. We need to do this. We need to  celebrate doing this.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the rule and support the  two underlying measures that it will bring to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 234,  nays 179, not voting 21, as follows:                               [Roll No. 55]                                 YEAS--234       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Beutler      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Hice, Jody B.
