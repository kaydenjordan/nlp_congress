 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman not on just  this but his entire chairmanship, for getting big things done.   Mr. Speaker, I want to speak on the underlying bill, the Sports  Medicine Licensure Clarity Act. Currently, healthcare providers are  licensed by their State. If a healthcare provider travels with a team-- professional, college, high school--out of State to take care of the  players that they are responsible for, they could be practicing out of  the scope of their license since they are out of State.   For example, this April, when our Kentucky Wildcats go to Minneapolis  for the Final Four, the physicians and healthcare people who travel  with them need to be practicing within their licenses. It is clearly  within the Commerce Clause for us to clarify this. It is important to  do. I encourage the passage of this bill, this provision, and the  overall bill.
