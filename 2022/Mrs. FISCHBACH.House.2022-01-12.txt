 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank the Representative from Massachusetts for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes.   Madam Speaker, today we were informed by the majority at the last  minute that we would be brought in to discuss the NASA Enhanced Use  Leasing Extension Act of 2021, which was amended by the Senate and will  be amended yet again here in the House, if this rule passes.   I don't think anyone here is surprised by yet another last-minute  meeting, but I am starting to feel the effects from all of the whiplash  over the last year. This time, House Democrats seek to insert the  Freedom to Vote Act and the Voting Rights Advancement Act as a last- ditch effort to cater to the Senate majority's sporadic attempts to get  something passed for their radical base, even though we all know  neither of these bills will pass through the Senate.   House Democrats and Senator Schumer still need bipartisan support for  this partisan bill. And certain other Senators in their party have yet  to cede to the fringe of their party and go nuclear on a longstanding  Senate principle, the filibuster. Whatever the thought process behind  this effort tonight, it is disappointing that it is yet another deeply  partisan attempt to Federalize all elections.   Madam Speaker, the Constitution places the responsibility for  elections at the State level and has a long history of letting each  State run their own elections. But H.R. 4, a component of this bill,  would grant the Federal Government unprecedented control over State and  local elections. It would empower the Attorney General to bully States  and force them to seek Federal approval before making changes to their  own voting laws.   Madam Speaker, this is an assault on the rights of States and local  governments to manage their own elections. The right to vote is one of  our most fundamental rights as citizens. It is upsetting to see the  majority take advantage of this important issue because they are so  desperate to maintain their power. This can be seen almost explicitly  in the Freedom to Vote Act, which includes a new campaign finance  provision that would ensure certain candidates receive millions of  dollars in public funding for running a campaign.   The majority does not discuss this provision very often, but do the  American people really want public dollars to go to fund campaigns?   State oversight in elections is important. Like so many things, the  majority fails to recognize what works best for one State is not  necessarily going to work in another State or across the  [[Page H66]]  country. States know what practices work best for their voters, as they  have done throughout history. It was not hard to find many flaws in  this bill, and I was able to do so with less than an hour's time. But I  remained disappointed in the priorities and practices of this majority.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2140     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question,  Republicans will offer an amendment to the rule allowing for the  immediate consideration of H. Res. 866.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, this resolution states clearly that  the right to vote is fundamental to democracy, and that legitimate  elections are those which are safe from foreign interference, including  illegal votes from foreigners.   The resolution denounces the practice by some cities in America of  giving the right to vote to noncitizens, including foreigners who have  violated our laws by being here illegally in the U.S.   The resolution states firmly that the House of Representatives  recognizes that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues  the vote of every United States citizen.   Madam Speaker, I present this amendment, and I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I would like to remind my colleague  from Massachusetts that I believe in 2016 he also objected to  certification of the election. It doesn't always sound like that when  he speaks about the objections.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I just want to remind everyone that  the issue here is the Federal takeover of elections. The statement that  was made was about someone objecting to the certification and how that  was somehow wrong. I just wanted to simply remind my colleague that he  himself had voted that way and many of the Democrats have, over the  years, voted to object to certification.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional  20 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   I have not heard any compelling arguments for pushing either of these  bills forward because the flaws are clear. We cannot create a one-size- fits-all election system imposed from Washington that requires States  to provide automatic same-day voter registration, prevents States from  removing dormant voters from rolls, and overrides State ID laws.   The Freedom to Vote Act would also guarantee public dollars would go  into certain candidates' coffers. This is all nothing more than a  partisan play for the Democrats to federalize all of America's  elections. They are pushing it because they think it will help them  stay in power. Historically, States have had oversight of their own  elections.   While there is always room for improvement, let's keep the Federal  Government out of it and leave the States to handle their own  elections, as has been done in the past.   I oppose the rule and the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
