 Mr. Speaker, as a grandfather, I ask unanimous consent to  bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on  women, like the 69-year-old who was scheduled to visit the U.S. this  past weekend to meet her new grandson but is now in limbo.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 276, a bill  to provide more reliable air service to the people of American Samoa  for air travel within American Samoa.   The Northern Mariana Islands are similar to American Samoa in many  ways. Although the large majority of our population resides on Saipan,  I have also several thousand constituents residing on the islands  Tinian and Rota. We are fortunate that air travel between these islands  is possible with the presence of commercial air travel.   Unfortunately, in American Samoa, there are no U.S. carriers  operating a route between Tutuila and Manu'a. So Polynesian Airlines,  based out of Samoa, is the only carrier operating that route.   H.R. 276, introduced by my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman  from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen), presents a commonsense approach  to cut red tape and allow regular flights to continue between these  islands. It would help the people of American Samoa conduct business,  visit relatives, and access health care.   It has my full support, and I ask the House to pass this commonsense  legislation.
