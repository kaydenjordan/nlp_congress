 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the  TAILOR Act. As the vice chairman of the Financial Institutions and  Consumer Credit Subcommittee, and a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill,  I also want to thank my colleague, Representative Tipton, for his work  on this measure.   I emphasize bipartisan. I listened to the other side of the aisle,  and it sounds like there would be no support for this legislation, but  there is support for this legislation. I wonder if the ranking member  has been having some of the conversations with some of her members,  because, over the past few years, we have learned that one-size-fits- all, those rules, are a recipe for a more concentrated and less dynamic  financial system.   I spend a lot of time talking with community bankers, credit unions,  and their customers. They complain about skyrocketing compliance costs  and regulatory burdens that force them to take attention away from  their core businesses when they continue to add staff not to serve  customers but to work on compliance issues.   Consumers complained about higher prices, fewer choices, and less  access to important financial products. Small- and mid-sized  institutions play an important role in financing the dreams and  aspirations of Main Street businesses and middle class families.   Unfortunately, these institutions are disproportionately affected by  the one-size-fits-all rules coming out of Washington, D.C. Banks and  credit unions are merging or closing altogether, and new banks are not  forming to take their place. Storied institutions with  multigenerational relationships in their communities are being forced  to close their doors and abandon the cities and towns they once served.   It is very sad, Mr. Speaker, to see a small town with a shuttered  bank. We see it across western Pennsylvania and we are seeing it across  the country.   This has an unmistakable impact on our economy. I remind the other  side about the studies where, because of the overregulation over the  last 10 years, that 650,000 fewer small businesses have been created;  6.5 million fewer jobs, that is 6.5 million fewer people paying Social  Security tax, 6.5 million people fewer paying Medicare tax; critical,  critical jobs that have not been created.    Mr. Speaker, small businesses can't get the loans that  they need. Families can't get the mortgage or pay for college. All of  this means that the American Dream is getting harder and harder for  people across the country.   Again, as I often remind my colleagues, the solution isn't  deregulation. It is right regulation. The TAILOR Act achieves this. By  enacting the TAILOR Act, we can focus regulatory energy and resources  where they are most needed and help reinvigorate our community  financial institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise in remembrance of a remarkable  community servant, a faithful friend and husband, and a brave veteran:  Sergeant Mark J. Baserman.   A corrections officer who devoted many years of service at the State  Correctional Institute in Somerset, Pennsylvania, Mark tragically lost  his life in the line of duty on February 26, 2018. Known throughout  Johnstown and by colleagues as a man of integrity, bravery, and  strength, thousands attended his remembrance service to pay their  respects to Mark and his family.   A 1975 graduate of Greater Johnstown Vo-Tech High School, as a young  man, Mark volunteered many years with the Oakland Volunteer Fire  Company and he served in the Army. Before becoming a corrections  officer, Mark worked more than 20 years as a first responder with East  Hills Ambulance Service.   Mark's life history of public service is evident. Putting others  first, including his wife, Rebecca, and mother, Lucille--both who have  physical disabilities--is a powerful testimony and a shining example.   Mr. Speaker, as we grieve the loss of this honorable man, I offer my  deepest condolences to Mark's family, friends, and the Johnstown  community.                            ____________________
