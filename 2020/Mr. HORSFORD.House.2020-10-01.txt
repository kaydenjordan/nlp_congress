 Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for this bill being brought  forward on COVID relief before the House goes out of session.   It is important to demonstrate to the American People that we are  leading and willing to negotiate to provide real relief.   Unfortunately, this bill does not include a pivotal provision--the  Worker that would provide federal assistance to cover the full cost of  COBRA premiums for laid off and furloughed workers.   That policy is the only one that would protect the hard-earned  benefits that union members and working families have fought for.   So while this bill takes many important steps to protect Medicaid and  private coverage, it provides premium tax credits for unemployed  Americans--I am concerned that protections for employer-sponsored plans  were not included.   I urge this body to include all coverage measures in our relief  package--including COBRA coverage for workers who have come to rely on  their employer-sponsored plans.
