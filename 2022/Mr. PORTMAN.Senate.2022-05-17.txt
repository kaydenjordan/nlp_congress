 Madam President, I come to the floor today for the 12th  consecutive week while the Senate has been in session to talk about the  illegal, unprovoked, and brutal assault on Ukraine being carried out by  Russia.   We started these discussions before this latest invasion even  occurred; and, unfortunately, every week, as I talk about it, there are  more and more examples of brutality as the Russians continue to bomb  innocent civilians in Ukraine. Also, we have been able to talk about  some progress that we have made in helping Ukraine, and that has been  very effective in helping Ukraine help itself.   This is a classic fight for freedom. The importance of our  humanitarian aid, our weapons, and our material support have all been  in that cause, and the impact cannot be overstated. Since February 24,  when the invasion began, we have provided $13.6 billion in U.S.  taxpayer funds for military, humanitarian, and economic aid for  Ukraine. By the way, it has made a huge difference in keeping Ukraine  from being totally overrun by Russia. You will remember that the  Russian objective here, in looking at this map, was to take over the  entire country. In starting with Kyiv, remember that they surrounded  Kyiv at one point. Now they have been pushed out altogether.   The Russians have now been forced to just focus here, in the southern  and  [[Page S2536]]  eastern parts of Ukraine, where there continues to be very fierce  fighting. These darker red sections are sections that the Russians took  back in 2014. The lighter red are the sections of Ukraine they are  trying to take now. The blue, you can see here, is where the Ukrainians  have made progress, including around Kharkiv, which is a major city  here in Eastern Ukraine. You can see where there is quite a bit of  blue--in fact, in one case, all the way to the Russian border where the  Ukrainians have pushed back the Russians.    So our support has made a difference. But that support--the $13.6  billion in aid--has now been depleted, and it is necessary for us to  re-up, including in just providing basic munitions so that the  Ukrainians can continue the fight with ammunition but also in providing  heavier weapons because, down in this area, that is what is required.  As the Russians use more and more artillery and other heavy weapons to  try to push back the Ukrainians' positions, the Ukrainians must respond  in kind.   Without the support that we have provided, Russia would have  destroyed a lot more of Ukraine; they would have killed a lot more  innocent civilians; and they would have achieved a victory. It would  have been damaging, of course, to Ukraine and its people but also  damaging to us and our national interest and a safer world because, had  they been successful, there would have been a much more dangerous and  volatile world in its thinking that an authoritarian country could just  come into a peaceful, democratic neighbor and take over another  country.   Again, the fighting continues, but we, along with so many of our  allies--over 40 countries--over 40 countries--have stepped up to say:  We are with you, Ukraine. You are an independent, sovereign country.  You are an ally, and we want to support you.   They have never asked for us to do the fighting for them, by the way,  but they have asked for us to help them have the tools to be able to  survive and to be able to push back against the brutal Russian assault.   The administration has now submitted what is called a supplemental  request for funding. The House passed it last week 368 to 57--strong  bipartisan support. Last night and earlier today, we had the first of  two procedural votes on the Senate's action on this same supplemental  spending bill. The votes were 81 to 11 last night and 88 to 11 earlier  today--again, strong bipartisan support for this funding. This package  includes $40 billion--nearly $40 billion--for munitions, for weapons,  for training to stop Russia.   It also provides funds for humanitarian aid. Remember, there have  been millions of refugees both internally and who have left the  country. There are about 5 or 6 million refugees still out of the  country and at least 7 or 8 million refugees inside the country. So  this has been an unprecedented level of humanitarian aid that has been  needed but also economic support to a country that has been  devastated--literally flattened--in many areas by this Russian assault.   There are also funds to support our troops, who are in the countries  neighboring Ukraine, joining other NATO forces. That funding is also in  here. Some of these troops came from Germany, and some came from the  United States, but it is an effort to be sure that we are supporting  and bolstering these other countries in the region--Romania, Slovakia,  Poland, and the Baltic countries of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia--to  be sure that they are not going to be subject to the same attacks.  Those preventive measures have been put in place, and that is also  costly. Forty billion dollars is a lot of money, and we have to be sure  that it is spent wisely and is not wasted.   I am glad to see we were able to get some changes in the  administration's request to task the Department of Defense, the  Department of State, and USAID inspectors general--from all three of  those entities--with the oversight of the spending and provide them  with sufficient resources to do that. So these inspectors general from  those three entities are there to ensure the money is properly spent.   Additionally, the funds in this bill for urgent budget support to  Ukraine's government will be subject to especially stringent oversight  mechanisms. These funds will be placed in a separate, auditable  account, and their use will be governed by a memorandum of  understanding with Ukraine. The MOU will describe strict guardrails for  transparency and accountability that will ensure that these funds are  not diverted to corrupt interests but, instead, are used to help the  Government of Ukraine provide for its people in their hour of need. I  am glad that language was included and added to the supplemental.   The supplemental bill also mandates that the use of these funds will  be notified to Congress. I think this is very important. Most of our  foreign assistance to other countries is subject to strict notification  requirements like these. It is only appropriate these funds have a  similar mechanism in place. If Congress is going to appropriate these  large amounts of taxpayer dollars to support Ukraine, I think it is  essential that we have sufficient congressional oversight. We have  strong bipartisan support for this funding in the House and in the  Senate but also the assurance that we will have effective oversight of  our assistance to Ukraine. By the way, effective oversight also will  require us to have a diplomatic presence in Ukraine--a permanent one-- to help ensure that these funds are spent properly--the military funds,  the humanitarian funds, and the economic aid.   I have been calling for the administration to reopen our Embassy in  Kyiv, which is here--the capital city--for the past several weeks. I  hope we do that as soon as possible. My understanding is that the team  in Kyiv, which has been mostly in Poland and sometimes goes to Lviv,  wants to get back to the capital. There are, probably, a couple dozen  countries--I heard Israel moved their Embassy back today--that have  already moved back to Kyiv. It is time for us to do so as well. We  understand it is dangerous, and we respect the service of those Foreign  Service Officers, but we have got to be sure that they are there to  provide a clear line of communication with the Ukrainians and ensure  that this $40 billion in funding is properly spent but also ensure that  we are able to have a go-between at a high level, which is one reason  we need to get our Ambassador over there to Ukraine as soon as  possible. The good news is we had a good hearing with that Ambassador  just last week, and my hope is that we can get her moving even later  this week.    With regard to the funding--the $40 billion--in helping, again, to  continue to push back so that Russia doesn't turn the tide, that  funding, I hope, will be sent this week. What you just heard from the  majority leader is that he has set up a vote for Thursday, which would  be a cloture vote. Then, hopefully, we will have the final vote that  day, too. Cloture is the next procedural vote. Let's not slow this  thing down on either side of the aisle. Let's get this done. I wish we  had gotten it done last week, and we should have. Every day that we  delay means we are putting at risk more Ukrainian civilians and putting  at risk more of the Ukrainian military because they don't have the  munitions for existing weapons, because they don't have the heavy  weapons they need to be able to counter the Russians. So this is not a  time for us to play partisan politics. It is a time for us to get this  assistance to the President's desk. Hopefully, he will sign it  immediately and begin to re-up this commitment we have made to help  Ukraine defend itself.   As you probably know, it took the constant urging from this Congress,  on a bipartisan basis, to get the administration to finally begin to  provide the level of lethal support that the Ukrainians have needed to  survive this war against Russia. Some of us were pushing for more  before this latest invasion as well, but we cannot afford to backslide  now. It is really important that we continue to help them to be able to  defend themselves. Again, we are not alone in this. There are many  countries around the world, including, obviously, the other NATO allies  who are also helping out.   I understand there is only enough existing Presidential drawdown  authority--that is the authority they are using for the munitions and  the weapons--to do one more partial transfer of arms. So this is urgent  to get it done now. This supplemental will fix that problem. It raises  the Presidential cap to $11 billion in the drawdown authority. It also  provides $6 billion for the  [[Page S2537]]  Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is a program that I co- wrote back into law in 2015. This money will fund training, equipment,  and advisory efforts to boost Ukraine's combat capacities; to  professionalize its military further; and to bring it up to NATO  standards.   That was very important to have them as prepared as they are. Over  the past 7 years, it has helped turn Ukraine's army into a powerful,  professional fighting force that has proven to be at least Russia's  equal on the battlefield. The bravery and determination of these troops  is the single most important weapon they have, but the training and the  equipment and the munitions and so on are essential for them to be able  to take that bravery and that perseverance and that commitment and to  be able to be such an effective fighting force.   Additionally, the supplemental includes $4 billion in Foreign  Military Financing to provide Ukraine with the American-made weapons  and equipment that its troops need. It also has $3.9 billion to support  enhanced U.S. troop deployments to Europe, such as the 82nd Airborne,  which is here in Poland. I got to see them when I was over in the  region recently. They are doing an amazing job in ensuring that there  is protection for Poland against the possibility that Poland could be  dragged into this conflict, but it is also to help ensure that the arms  transfers are occurring from countries all over the world. All of this  vital funding will ensure that we can continue to support Ukraine and  our other Eastern European allies who are threatened by Russian  aggression. We just can't allow any gap in this support.   We must not adjourn this week until we are finished with this. So the  vote is supposed to be on Thursday, and I hope it is; but until we have  the final passage of this measure and it goes to the President's desk,  we cannot leave this week. In my view, Congress must stay in session.   At this time in this war, it is also time for us to take a breath and  hold the administration accountable for giving us a long-term strategy  so that we in Congress can be a bigger part of the conversation about  how to move forward. I think that is not unreasonable, given where we  are. And a number of us, on a bipartisan basis, are calling for that.  Give us a long-term strategy so we know where we are.   I know there have been concerns that we have been spending a lot of  money on weapons and equipment from our military stockpiles to Ukraine  without adequately refilling our own supplies. But this supplemental  funding bill--and one reason it is a higher number--fixes that. It  provides $9 billion to replenish our stocks with Javelins, Stingers,  howitzers, rifles, vehicles, and other equipment needed to keep America  safe. So part of the funds we are providing here are for Ukraine, but  really they are for updating our own stockpiles. That is good for our  own military.   I am also aware of a concern that some of our manufacturers cannot  make these weapons fast enough for both the stockpiling for our weapons  and providing weapons to Ukraine. This supplemental bill addresses  that, too, providing $600 million to ease chokepoints in our industrial  supply chain. That will ensure that we have the capacity to produce  enough missiles to simultaneously help keep Ukrainians in the fight and  keep our stockpiles full.   Last week, at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I  asked the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, Karen Donfried, what  the administration's definition of ``victory'' was, and she said: Well,  ``that is for the Ukrainians to define.''   Well, I guess that is fair, but the Ukrainians have already defined  what victory looks like for them. They want all of their territory  back. It is their sovereign territory that Russia has already taken-- the darker red--and wants to take now in the lighter red and wants to  go even farther. That is what the Ukrainians say victory looks like.   Last week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba said that ``victory for  us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories.''   On Saturday, the Foreign Ministers of the G7 countries--those are the  biggest economies of the world except for China. Those are our allies  in all of this. Our Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, was there, and he  endorsed this view, saying in a statement that ``[w]e will never  recognize borders that Russia has attempted to change by military  aggression.''   I appreciate the Secretary of State saying that, and I hope the rest  of the administration adopts that position.   During recent testimony, LTG Scott Barrier of the Defense  Intelligence Agency called the war situation a ``stalemate.'' While  this is not optimal, it is giving the Ukrainian forces time to regroup  forces in this area and to be able to train on some of the new Western  weapons we and our allies have donated. Soon, more of our 155- millimeter ``M Triple 7'' howitzers, as an example, will be deployed to  the frontlines. This will give the Ukrainians the capability to  outrange the Russians, when they could sit back and use the artillery  to push the Russians back without being in danger themselves. And when  combined with surveillance, including surveillance drones, this will  allow the Ukrainians to even the odds on the battlefield. That is all  arriving now and beginning to come, and that is good news to report  tonight. It is going to make a big difference.   In fact, we have recently seen just how effective artillery can be in  Ukraine. We just learned yesterday that last week, as a Russian  battalion tactical group was attempting to cross a river in Ukraine,  called the Siverskyi Donets River, Ukrainian artillerymen sighted them  and opened fire. Over the next several minutes, under a Ukrainian  bombardment, it is estimated that Russian forces suffered almost 500  casualties--including killed, wounded, and missing in action--and also  lost almost 80 vehicles, including infantry fighting vehicles and T-72  main battle tanks.   This map shows images of the actual bridge and what actually  happened. Here is the attack. Here are some of those Russian tanks we  talked about and other armored vehicles. Here is what is left of the  bridge. Here are some more images of the road coming in and some of the  vehicles that were destroyed.   The pontoon bridge they had been using to cross the river right here,  you can see, was totally destroyed, sending some vehicles plunging into  the water below. This Russian advance was completely halted at immense  cost.   Again, it makes a difference if you have these weapons and you have  the surveillance. You have the ability to do this. It was such a  significant defeat for Russian forces that even the pro-Russian  military bloggers--who have toed the Kremlin line for the war thus  far--have now begun to publicly question the competency of the Russian  military leadership on social media.   This is precisely why we and other countries need to keep sending  heavy weapons and ammunition, including artillery and better artillery,  so the Ukrainians can continue to inflict defeats like this on the  Russians and push them out of their territory.   The Ukrainians are succeeding, first, because of their bravery, their  tenacity, their skill but also because the United States and our allies  are placing in their hands the tools they need to succeed.   Let's not forget that President Putin said he launched this war  because Ukraine had NATO aspirations and that a NATO country on their  border was a threat. I think he thought that this would be intimidating  to NATO and would split NATO. Now, because of the invasion, Finland and  Sweden have applied for NATO membership. President Putin thought it  would split NATO; instead, NATO is actually getting stronger.   America and the world should recognize this is a major shift in the  power structure of Europe. This is a big deal. Finland, Sweden--Sweden  has been traditionally neutral--and other European countries now see  clearly the threat posed by Vladimir Putin and his desire to recreate  the Soviet Socialist Republic.   Earlier in the conflict, Putin threatened both Finland and Sweden  with ``grave consequences'' if they sought to join NATO. Does this  sound familiar? It is the same thing he said about Ukraine.   Remember, Finland shares a border with Russia, about 810 miles. To  the Finns, the threat of Russian troops is  [[Page S2538]]  very real, and it is on their border. Finland is not dependent on  Russia, as some other nations are. In fact, they barely get 5 percent  of their energy from Russia, and they are working to even cut that  amount down further. Good for them. They are not afraid of Russia. They  would rather see the benefits of a defensive alliance based on common,  shared democratic values. That is what NATO is about. It is not  offensive; it is defensive. And that is what Finland and Sweden both  see.   We should be encouraged by Finland's increased military spending,  which they just increased to about 2 percent of their GDP. That is the  NATO target of 2 percent. I commend Finland for that. They need to set  an example for other members of the alliance.   They also just augmented their air force, and they are among Europe's  most effective and largest Armed Forces per capita. They are able to  mobilize an army of 280,000 troops and 600,000 reservists. Sweden also  increased its military spending this year for the biggest increase in  70 years.   This is all positive because it puts actions behind the words and  sends the message to Russia, to Vladimir Putin, that freedom-loving  countries are not going to stand idly by while allies are invaded or  intimidated. All we want to do is live in peace, but we are not going  to stand by while this aggression occurs.   The Senate has a role to play here because these two countries,  Sweden and Finland, will be coming before the U.S. Senate to be  confirmed as members of NATO. We should do so as soon as we possibly  can.   In addition, the administration should press other countries to  approve this very quickly. I heard today that the Turks may have some  concerns about it based on other issues. I hope no country stands in  the way of this. This will make NATO a more effective fighting force.  It would augment NATO's ability to be able to be an effective, again,  peaceful, defensive alliance.   In addition, the administration should press the world to approve  NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, a move that would strengthen  the security structure and posture for free nations, free nations  around the globe.   I have talked about a variety of sanctions in my remarks over these  past 12 weeks, and I won't go over all those sanctions. There are  trading sanctions. They are eliminating Russia's preferred tax status.  There are banking sanctions and, of course, energy.   Europe, unfortunately, is continuing to buy Russian gas and oil. They  say they are going to stop buying Russian coal by August. I hope that  is true. But they now send about $870 million a day to Russia. Think  about that, $870 million a day to help fund the war machine. One reason  Russia's economy hasn't totally collapsed is because of that--because  it is still getting a lot of receipts for energy not just from China  and India, which we all know about and we regret, but also from the EU  countries that are way too dependent on Russia.   We are not as dependent, so it is easy for us to cut off their oil  and gas supplies, which we did, to our credit. But we need to back up  those European nations now with some of our own. We have plenty of gas  in this country; as an example, natural gas that can back up what  Russia is providing now, and we have a loose agreement to do so. We had  to tighten that agreement and ensure we are not sending these  millions--hundreds of millions of dollars every day to Vladimir Putin  to fund his war machine, especially when Russia not only continues its  onslaught on Ukrainian defensive combatants but also on noncombatants.  We need to act. What they are doing is committing war crimes. We have  all seen them. We all know that.    I have called on the International Criminal Court, which, by the way,  has announced an investigation to follow in Ukraine's footsteps and  take the next step to begin an actual war crimes tribunal. We know  enough now. We continue to hear about this every day. And every day we  don't act, the stories get worse. I think this could be a deterrent if  we moved forward more aggressively.   Six million Ukrainians have been forced out of their country. And  according to UNICEF, thousands of innocent Ukrainians have been killed,  including hundreds of children. Since February 24, Russian troops have  engaged in rape and other forms of sexual violence across Ukraine.  These victims--Ukrainian women and girls--have been cruelly targeted.  We have a moral obligation to step up here. The whole world does.   I was glad to hear that a court in Kyiv began hearings last Friday on  a case against Sergeant Vadim Shishimarin, the first Russian soldier to  go on trial for alleged war crimes. He is accused of shooting and  killing a 62-year-old civilian man in the northeastern Ukrainian region  of Sumy in late February, just a few yards from his home. Apparently,  this has all been recorded.   But this is just a drop in the bucket. Ukraine's prosecutor has said  her office is currently investigating more than 10,000 alleged war  crimes by Russian forces involving more than 600 suspects. It will take  a vast amount of time and resources to hold these criminals to account,  and the United States should help Ukraine in this regard.   I am glad that the supplemental funding bill before the Senate right  now includes funding to do just that: $400 million to investigate and  document war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian  forces in Ukraine. My hope is that holding these Russians accountable  will have this strong deterrent effect.   To Russian commanders and to Kremlin officials who are backing this  brutal and unjustified war, the message is very simple: The world is  watching. They are watching you. The world is watching for war crimes,  and they are being recorded. You have a choice: Say no to the orders to  attack and kill your innocent neighbors in Ukraine, your neighbors who  only want to live in peace.   By the way, there is a special designation in U.S. law for countries  that provide support for international terrorism. They are called state  sponsors of terrorism. In my view, Russia has now earned that notorious  designation. We should vote on that here in the U.S. Senate and further  isolate Russia from the community of nations.   The Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, along with three of our other  colleagues, went to Kyiv over the weekend to meet with President  Zelenskyy. In that meeting, he reports that the issue of Russia being  designated as a state sponsor of terrorism came up. And he agreed, as  the Republican leader here in the U.S. Senate, that we should move  forward with that legislation.   Speaker Pelosi has also been to Kyiv for the delegation. I am glad  they both went, and I hope both of them will agree on that designation,  which is something that President Zelenskyy has asked for, and also,  again, to ensure that we not only provide this aid package as soon as  possible this week but we continue to provide whatever help is  necessary for our allies in Ukraine.   I close tonight with a few thoughts on our leadership not abroad, but  here at home, and not the leadership of the U.S. Government, but  instead the leadership of the people of America because it is not just  the U.S. Government that is supporting Ukraine in its hour of need.   Since this terrible conflict began, everyday Americans across the  country have stepped up to provide much needed assistance--humanitarian  assistance, economic aid.   The Ukrainian defenders, the refugees, and the first responders are  deeply grateful. In March, in Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine sent out a  request for surplus or expired personal protective gear to provide to  Ukrainian territorial defense forces that had asked for them. I am  proud to say that Ohio answered that call.   Altogether, more than two dozen law enforcement agencies across Ohio  have donated 2,000 pieces of personal protective gear, including 71  vest carriers, 45 helmets, and 1,880 pieces of body armor. With the  help of the Fund to Aid Ukraine, a nonprofit located in Parma, OH, this  badly needed equipment will soon make its way into the hands of brave  Ukrainian defenders who are fighting for their lives as they endure  Russia's brutal onslaught.   This organization has now given 24 pallets of supplies and over 7  tons of  [[Page S2539]]  medical supplies to Ukraine as well. I am grateful to them and for all  the law enforcement agencies that sacrificed their time and resources  to organize this effort to provide personal protective gear.   In addition, MedWish International in Cleveland, which is a highly  effective nonprofit I met with last month, has partnered with United  Ukrainian Organizations of Ohio, headed by Marta Liscynesky, to provide  individual first aid kits and other medical equipment to Ukrainian  first responders, defenders, and civilians. And Cleveland-based KOACORE  has delivered 17,000 individual first aid kits to the frontlines. With  this donation, Ukrainian first responders running into the rubble of  schools, apartment buildings, and homes will be able to save more  lives.   When I was on the Polish-Ukrainian border in March, I saw Marta, who  set up United Ukrainian Organizations of Ohio, and also another Ohio  friend, Andy Futey, who is president of the Ukrainian World Congress;  and I got to see them in action delivering these humanitarian supplies  to refugees and helping to organize the effort.   I saw how this affected refugees at the border. They came up to us  with tears in their eyes, almost all women and children--the men had  been left behind to fight--and they pleaded with us to continue the  help. They pleaded with us to, as they said, ``close the skies,'' to  stop these bombs--just constant bombardment of their families. They  talked about how their homes had been destroyed, how members of their  families had been killed or maimed, how the unspeakable crimes being  committed by these Russian soldiers were something that many of these  families had endured.   We didn't have all the answers. We haven't closed the skies. But we  did say, ``The American people are with you,'' and talked about some of  these incredibly generous Americans who have stepped forward.   As the Russian forces intentionally target these Ukrainian civilians  to spread fear and panic, this display of generosity from the people of  Ohio and the people of every State represented here in this body  reassures these Ukrainians that we have their back, that America--not  just our American Government but America, the people of America--care.  I am proud of that. I am proud of how people have given their time and  resources to help those in need.   In Cincinnati, my hometown, we organized a fundraiser last week for  what is called World Central Kitchen and the good work that they are  doing all throughout Ukraine and in the border areas. This fundraiser  went to support World Central Kitchen's work and the Kharkiv sister  city efforts. Cincinnati and Kharkiv are sister cities. I was involved  in that group a few decades ago, and I remember that, at the time, we  were so proud to be a sister city to Kharkiv because it resembled  Cincinnati in many ways--a beautiful city with a river running through  it, like the Ohio River runs through Cincinnati.   Today, Kharkiv has been nearly flattened. It has been nearly totally  destroyed. But, as we talked about in this map, look at what is  happening. They are pushing the Russians back from Kharkiv. And they  will rebuild, and it will be beautiful again.   I saw the good work that World Central Kitchen does when I was on the  Ukrainian-Polish border. Chef Jose Andres, here from Washington, DC,  and his brainchild, World Central Kitchen, is doing amazing work. I  volunteered with a few colleagues, serving food to refugees at one of  his 60 popup restaurants in the border regions. There are dozens more  in Ukraine itself.   There is much more to be done to help Ukraine get through this, to  help them defend themselves, to help them push back the Russians, to  help them deal with the humanitarian crisis, to help them rebuild, to  help them survive this brutal Russian onslaught and rebuild their  homeland, which they love so much.   And we are inspired to do more, both because this is in our national  security interest--Vladimir Putin's victory is our loss--and because we  are inspired by the resiliency and fortitude of the Ukrainian Armed  Forces and the Ukrainian people. They have truly shown the rest of the  world what bravery and patriotism is all about.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
