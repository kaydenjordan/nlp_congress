General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on House Resolution 736, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule today on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act; H.R. 3978,  the TRID Improvement Act; and H.R. 3299, the Protecting Consumers'  Access to Credit Act of 2017.   The rule provides for one hour of debate on H.R. 620, equally divided  between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The  rule also provides for a motion to recommit and makes in order multiple  amendments from colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   It also provides for one hour of debate on the two Financial Services  bills, with time equally divided between the chairman and ranking  member of that committee.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from my  fellow Judiciary Committee members: Mr. Nadler, Mr. Poe, as well as Mr.  Langevin. We also heard from Mr. Hill and Ms. Waters on the Financial  Services bill.   H.R. 620 received consideration by the Judiciary Committee and  enjoyed a rigorous markup process. H.R. 3299 and H.R. 3978 were  considered and reported by the Financial Services Committee.   The bills before us today address different topics on different  segments of our economy and our Nation, but they have something in  common. They are all pro-growth bills aimed at righting wrongs,  increasing common sense, and improving the way that the current system  works.   I am a cosponsor of H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act and,  as a member of the Judiciary Committee, have had multiple occasions to  talk and listen about this bill. It is sponsored by my good friend from  Texas (Mr. Poe), and several of my friends from both sides of the aisle  have cosponsored this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I have cosponsored this bill because I believe the  Americans with Disabilities Act is critical legislation. No individual  should ever suffer discrimination for any reason, and disabled  individuals should have access to businesses and other sites that  provide public accommodation. I am a former small-business owner, so I  speak from experience running businesses.   Even more importantly, however, one of the main reasons I stand  before you on this issue and behind this bill is I am the father of a  strong, intelligent, capable, and a little sassy daughter named Jordan.  Jordan is 26 years old and has spina bifida. Jordan has been in a  wheelchair her entire life. Her first walk and first steps came in a  little, pink wheelchair.   Jordan makes this issue personal for me. Discrimination is  unacceptable, and it is also unacceptable for opportunists to build a  cottage industry of serial litigation on the backs of the disabled,  especially when these drive-by lawsuits offer little to no discernible  benefit to disabled individuals.   Mr. Speaker, my daughter Jordan helps me understand the importance of  [[Page H1137]]  access to public space and the danger posed by lawsuits that exploit  the disabled community instead of serving its members. I believe that  there are good actors genuinely seeking to increase access and call to  task those who block access to disabled individuals. Unfortunately,  what we are seeing too often is bad actors intentionally exploiting the  law for their own financial gain.   When these bad actors, these serial litigants, clog up the courts by  drive-by lawsuits geared not at solutions but at profits, they take up  time the courts could be using to address issues that truly need  remediation. They also undermine the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The intent and purpose of the ADA is not to drum up lawsuits; it is to  prevent discrimination, increase access, and to protect those with  disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, the disability community, my daughter included,  represents some of the strongest people I know. They have a voice, and  they are powerful. Today, we are here making sure the law works better  for them and that it isn't being exploited by those who seek to  undermine that law.   Today, small businesses face legal fees and complex technical jargon  when presented with an impediment to access. Most businesses want to  fix such issues and would, but instead of being able to make this issue  right, they are forced into court before they have the chance to do so.  In some examples of these serial lawsuits, the issues have not even  been perceptible to the human eye; in others, building codes have  changed--and yes, even the ADA--yet business owners have been hauled  into court before they have a chance to respond or to fix the problem.   H.R. 620 ensures businesses have the opportunity to fix any access  issues once they have been made aware of them. It provides notice and a  cure period and clarifies the requirements for demand letters. It also  provides training for business owners and State and local governments  so that they can better understand proper ADA compliance.   The number of ADA title III lawsuits has skyrocketed in recent years.  Since 2013, there has been a 132 percent increase in the number of  lawsuits in Federal courts. H.R. 620 addresses this problem in a smart  way that maintains the integrity, purpose, and key provisions of the  Americans with Disabilities Act while ensuring there is a chance to fix  access issues.   This bill does not take away an individual's right to sue for access.  This bill does not overturn the ADA. It does give business owners a  chance to fix ADA problems quickly. Some owners may not even actually  realize they are not in compliance. Codes have changed, and there are  literally hundreds of pages of compliance.                                time  1230    That, however, is not an excuse for willful noncompliance. Far from  it. But it is a reason that good actors who may need to update their  accommodations should have a chance to do so.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that this bill has bipartisan  support and that the Rules Committee made in order several amendments  from Members on both sides of the aisle so that we can consider ideas  to even further strengthen this legislation. I would ask that all  Members listen to that amendment debate because these amendments do  have an impact on this bill, and I would encourage them to be a part of  that.   H.R. 620 makes sense and focuses on fixing issues rather than  spending money on trials or, better yet, extorting money from  businesses with no thought of helping those with disabilities.   We also have a chance to consider some other commonsense measures  today with the two important Financial Services bills also provided for  by this rule.   H.R. 3299, the Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act, was  introduced by Mr. McHenry and Mr. Meeks, and reported by the Financial  Services Committee with bipartisan support. Similar language was  included in the House-passed CHOICE Act last year.   This legislation codifies the ``valid-when-made'' doctrine, a  longstanding legal principle that, if a loan is valid when it is made  with respect to its interest rate, then it does not become invalid or  unenforceable when assigned to another party. This bill is a response  to the 2015 decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Madden  v. Midland, which appears to have ignored the longstanding legal  principle.   The decision in the Madden case created instability and uncertainty  in the secondary credit market, and restricts the availability of loans  to borrowers, particularly those with less access to traditional  lending sources. It has also led to regulatory uncertainty and fallout  for fintech lenders. My home State of Georgia has an increasing  presence in fintech, and H.R. 3299 provides a legislative fix that  increases certainty and supports economic opportunity.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, we are here to discuss 3978, the TRID  Improvement Act, which incorporates numerous important provisions from  several smart Financial Services bills. It was introduced by  Congressman Hill from Arkansas, and takes steps to provide important  regulatory relief and make capital markets more competitive and  efficient.   Dodd-Frank led to an explosion of regulations and requirements that  ultimately have squeezed access to capital, created hurdles to smaller  market entrants, and imposed burdens on small businesses, startups, and  investors.   One especially critical provision is H.R. 3978, the language authored  by Mr. Duffy from Wisconsin. This provision prohibits the SEC from  compelling the production of source code or similar intellectual  property without a subpoena. The SEC has had a data breach, and the GAO  has been critical of its cybersecurity.   I think Mr. Duffy and Mr. Hill, along with my colleague David Scott  from Georgia, are right to recognize that we shouldn't be forcing SEC  registered entities to hand over their highly sensitive source code  without due process protections. This legislation ensures normal  processes can be followed to access this information is needed, but  prevents unnecessary disclosures of this intellectual property.   Mr. Speaker, source code for security and other financial entities is  similar to what the Coke recipe is to Coca-Cola, or the doughnut recipe  is to Krispy Kreme. It is critical intellectual property that  represents the backbone of a company. This bill makes clear that this  sensitive and highly valuable information doesn't have to be simply  handed over to the SEC with the hope that the information remains  secure.   H.R. 3978 includes numerous other key provisions, including  recognizing unique needs of emerging growth companies and tailoring  regulatory burdens accordingly, and requiring the CFPB--the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau--to allow for more accurate and clear  calculations to be provided to consumers when they purchase lenders and  owners title insurance policies.   Mr. Speaker, today, you are seeing a theme. You are seeing a rule  that provides for numerous bills that make commonsense changes to the  current system to spur growth and simply increases fairness. And you  are seeing bipartisan bills, including bipartisan amendments, that will  be coming forward on this in support of these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of things that  we can agree or disagree on here, but one of the things, from my  position, especially with a daughter who has a handicap--this is not an  insult to disabilities. It is actually keeping them from being abused  and used by folks who don't even have a disability suing and asking for  money and not really caring if the issue gets fixed or not.   At the end of the day, which would somebody rather have: a person in  a wheelchair have something fixed, or have someone pay an attorney off  so that they can make some money?   Let's at least put this in context of what it truly is.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think the interesting thing is, as has been expressed  by a couple of our speakers, especially on the Financial Services  bills, these are bipartisan pieces of legislation that have come back.  They have been vetted. They came before not only this body, many of  them through the CHOICE Act, previously, but also have been coming  back. And something that is really interesting is the bicameral,  bipartisan process of making sure that capital and these Financial  Services bills are actually something that we can move and can improve.   But I do, again, take a little bit of exception. And look, rhetoric  is rhetoric, but deceit is also deceit in the sense that we don't talk  about, especially in this ADA--I am not sure how opposing a bill that  is designed to make improvements for folks and in protecting trial  lawyers who can get people who do not even have disabilities to sue or  to send a demand letter to get money without ever requiring that the  business actually solve the problem. That is what has been missing in  this debate today.   They can actually send a letter, say: Here is where our problem is.  We are going to sue you, but if you send us X amount of dollars, that  will do away with it--never concerned at all if the decision is  actually making a difference in the business or the location. They  don't care.   And, in fact, if you want to oppose this, then you are just actually,  frankly, saying: That is a good idea. I like that. Let's just pick on  businesses, and at the end of the day, you know those folks with  disabilities, they are just our key to making more money.   That is wrong. My daughter is not a money-making proposition. That  has got to cease.   We can disagree on ways about this. My friend from Rhode Island and I  have talked about this a great deal. We are of the same mind and same  agreement. We may disagree on somehow this is it and how to get there,  but at the end of the day, the ADA is still there. The ADA is not going  away. The ADA is not being gutted, and nobody is asking folks with  disabilities to get law degrees. A lot of them have, and they are  making a difference.   But one of the greatest emphases to a business that may have an  impediment, they may have put something in the way, is for somebody  with a disability to say: By the way, I can't get in here.   And most every business on Earth does not want to stand at the door  and say: I don't want disability folks in my business.   No. They want to fix it because they want to do business. To say  anything else is simply, unfortunately at times, tending to scare  people for the wrong reasons.   If you want to defend trial lawyers and others who are willing to sue  with nondisabled people, to sue businesses taking Google photographs of  Google Maps and saying, ``This is a business that we are going to  extort something from,'' then vote against this bill, but then explain  to somebody in a wheelchair why you are using them and allowing these  folks to use them for their profit motive. That is wrong.   We can find a lot of ways to find agreement here, but let's at least  look at the situation on how it is.   So, with these Financial Services bills, they provide regulatory  relief. They reduce unnecessary burdens. They are bipartisan. I am  urging my friends and colleagues to take a look at the amendments  because there are a lot of amendments that are going to come forward on  these, especially the ADA bill and others.   Look at that. Listen to it. Talk about it. But at the end of the day,  never forget what is actually happening here, and what we are actually  seeing is something that we can make a difference in and we are looking  to make a difference in.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this rule and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 736 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.  [[Page H1145]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
