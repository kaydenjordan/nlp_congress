 Mr. Speaker, selling a gun to a convicted felon, to a  perpetrator of domestic violence, to a fugitive from justice, merits a  jail term, but those who oppose this reasonable background check bill  are enabling just that.   Someone who couldn't buy a .22 inside a gun shop can, today, go  outside that shop and buy a military-style killing machine and get away  with it.   Doctors Seth Goldstein and Lisa Epstein, who visited my office this  very week on behalf of Moms Demand Action, and 117 San Antonio  physicians, they have a view that is different from Members of Congress  concerning the result of gun violence. They witness this violence in  the emergency room after young bodies are torn apart.   What a different view this debate would have if it were occurring  amidst the pain, violence, and blood in a hospital emergency room,  because closing this loophole is about life support.   We have got to end the trauma. Let's join the doctors who are out  there seeking to save lives and do our part to save lives by passing  this bill.                            ____________________
