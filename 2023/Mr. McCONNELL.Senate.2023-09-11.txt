 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today marks 22 years since terrorists  shattered a peaceful morning in New York, Pennsylvania, and here in  Washington; 22 years since enemies of America's freedom and leadership  killed 2,977 innocent people; 22 years, but the shock of that day and  the pain of loss are still every bit as real.   Today, we remember the parents and the children and spouses and  siblings who never returned home. We thank the first responders who ran  toward danger in service of others. And we honor the servicemembers,  intelligence professionals, and law enforcement officers who kept  America safe since that awful day. But today is not just about  remembering the past.   Year after year, September 11 is a reminder of our commitment to  confront growing threats from global terror and to preserve the tools  and authorities our national security community need to carry out this  essential mission.
