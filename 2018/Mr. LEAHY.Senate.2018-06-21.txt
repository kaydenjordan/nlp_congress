 Will the Senator yield on that point?    Mr. President, I was simply going to add to what the  Senator from Tennessee was saying.   Senator Shelby and I have tried to keep things that are inappropriate  out of the appropriations bill so that we may actually pass some  appropriations bills. So I will join the Senator from Tennessee.
