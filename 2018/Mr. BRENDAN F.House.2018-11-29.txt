 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  [[Page H9731]]         BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am here this  evening to honor Raed Fares, a hero who I had the opportunity to meet  right here in the Capitol some months ago. He was shot and killed in  Idlib, Syria, last week by two gunmen, likely al-Qaida affiliates.   Raed founded ``Radio Fresh'' to give Syrians a source for unbiased  reporting other than that of the extremists and the Assad regime. He  trained journalists and organized community services and events with  the goal of empowering civil society. His work made him the target of  the Assad regime, al-Nusrah, and ISIS many times, but he refused to  back down.   Raed was killed because of his bravery. His work mattered. His life  mattered. Raed's death must remind each of us that the Syrian people  are fighting for their lives. In the words of Raed: ``Freedom is an  idea, and an idea cannot die.''                            ____________________
