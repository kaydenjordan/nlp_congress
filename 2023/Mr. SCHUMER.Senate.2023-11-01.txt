 Mr. President, so last night, I filed cloture on  President Biden's nominees to serve as Chief of Naval Operations and  Chief of Staff to the Air Force, the remaining vacancies on the Joint  Chiefs of Staff which we said we would fill. We will move on these  critical military appointments soon here on the floor.   I also filed on the nomination of Lieutenant General Mahoney to be  second in command of the U.S. Marine Corps. His appointment has become  urgent because this weekend the Commandant of the Marines, Gen. Eric  Smith, was unexpectedly hospitalized after a serious medical emergency.  Now, normally, Lieutenant General Mahoney would have been able to  immediately step in to temporarily serve as Commandant. But,  unfortunately, because of the blanket holds of just one Senator,  Senator Tuberville, that cannot happen. The situation at the Marine  Corps is precisely the kind of avoidable emergency that Senator  Tuberville has provoked through his reckless holds. Lieutenant General  Mahoney is one of more than 300 nominees Senator Tuberville is  currently blocking. So while the Senate will proceed quickly to vote on  Lieutenant General Mahoney's nomination, these holds cannot and must  not continue.   Yesterday, my colleague Senator Reed, the chairman of the Armed  Services Committee, introduced a resolution that will allow the Senate  to quickly confirm the nominations that are currently being blocked by  the Senator from Alabama. The resolution will be referred to the Rules  Committee; and when the time comes, I will bring it to the floor of the  Senate for consideration.   We must--we absolutely must--ensure that our military is fully  staffed and fully equipped to defend the American people, and it begins  by confirming these vital nominations that are currently on hold. Every  day that Senator Tuberville continues his blanket holds, our military  preparedness is degraded. Our military families--most of whom have  served decades in the Armed Forces--suffer. Our military appointments  risk being further ensnared in partisan politics. These nominees must  be confirmed, and both parties should work together to make sure we  fulfill our obligation to America's servicemembers.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, now on the minibus, for the information of Senators,  today we will pass the first of three bipartisan appropriations bills:  Agriculture, MILCON-VA, and T-HUD.   When these bills pass, they will be the only--I underscore--the only  bipartisan appropriations bills that have passed either Chamber. These  bills will make a huge difference for America's farmers, for our  infrastructure, for housing on our military bases, and for veterans.  Bipartisanship isn't easy. On the contrary, it is very difficult. But  here in the Senate, we are making sure  [[Page S5270]]  that the appropriations process is succeeding. I want to thank the good  work of Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, and all the appropriators.  Passing these appropriations bills today is not just terrific news for  the country, but an affirmation of what I have said since the start of  the year: The only way to get things done in a divided government is  bipartisanship.   The House is going through a futile exercise in passing partisan  appropriations bills that have no input or support from Democrats. They  are going nowhere. The House ought to learn its lesson. The Speaker  ought to understand that the 30 hard-right people should not be  dictating what the entire House or the entire country does. Those bills  are filled with poison pills. They break the agreement and cut below  the agreement that we made when we wanted to avoid the debt from being  not fulfilled, and they are nowhere.   On the other hand, the Senate has bipartisan bills. And that is the  real difference here. Sooner or later, the House and the new Speaker  will learn the lesson: If you don't do it bipartisan, it ain't getting  done. The Senate has been a strong model for how bipartisanship can  work, even amidst the deep disagreement, and I thank my colleagues on  both sides for their work on these bills.                           Artificial Intelligence    Mr. President, now, we continue on our AI Insight Forums. Today, as  leaders gather in London for the first AI summit, the Senate will hold  our third and fourth bipartisan AI Insight Forums. This morning will be  focused on the intersection of AI in the workforce. We will hear from a  balanced group of leaders in labor, tech, civil rights, and business  about both the opportunities and risks that AI presents to the American  worker and to our economy.   People are worried. Many people worry, Will I still have my job as AI  kicks in? We want to make sure that we have guardrails that protect  workers, not make the mistake that was done with globalization, where  so many were thrown out of work through no fault of their own.   And then this afternoon, we will discuss AI's use in high-impact  areas like finance, healthcare, law enforcement. We will focus  especially on the potential bias in AI technologies in these high- impact areas and how Congress can create guardrails to protect our  civil rights in the age of AI.   The Senate is continuing to be all hands on deck when it comes to  trying to pass AI legislation. Yesterday our bipartisan AI gang-- Senators Rounds, Heinrich, Young, and I--had a great meeting with  President Biden at the White House on AI. So we are making good  progress, but we still have more to learn about AI as we work to  develop bipartisan legislation. And the world is paying attention.  There is a forum in London today where the Vice President will attend.  And, inevitably, they will be looking. The whole world will be looking  to the Senate to see whether and what kind of legislation we can pass.  We will work hard to get the best possible bipartisan legislation done.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, about the supplemental, on Monday, Speaker Johnson and  House Republicans released a totally unserious and woefully inadequate  package that omitted aid to Ukraine, omitted humanitarian assistance to  Gaza, had no funding for the Indo-Pacific, and made funding for Israel  conditional on hard-right, never-going-to-pass proposals. What a joke.   Yesterday afternoon, President Biden issued a veto threat on the GOP  proposal, and it is no wonder why: It needlessly politicizes aid to  Israel. It balloons the Federal deficit. Here the House is talking  about we need to pay for, to reduce the deficit, and they put in a  provision that actually increases the deficit. Why? Because they don't  want their superrich, megawealthy friends to be audited by the IRS like  every other citizen is.   As we know, when Trump was President, he almost exempted them from  auditing. Someone making $40,000 a year had a greater chance of being  audited than someone making $4 million a year.   It is amazing that the main focus as the world is in crisis--in the  Middle East, in Ukraine, in the Indo-Pacific--our House Republicans are  spending more time trying to further reduce taxes of those who don't  pay much tax at all. So I am so glad that President Biden issued a  strong veto message. I would urge every House Republican, every House  Democrat, every Senate Member to read the President's veto message. It  is strong and well thought out. He talks about it politicizing aid to  Israel, it ballooning the Federal deficit, and it failing to address  the national security threats America faces around the globe-- particularly our need to help Ukraine, provide humanitarian aid to  Gaza, and help in the Indo-Pacific.   So the House GOP proposal is not going anywhere. It is dead before it  even is voted on. The Speaker should start over--this time without  terrible, partisan poison pills; this time sitting down with Democrats  and working this issue through.   Israel has suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history. It  needs help. But House Republicans are asking a price for helping them  by cutting off funding that holds rich tax cheats accountable. That  ain't happening, House. It ain't happening.   Now, Speaker Johnson says that this supposed pay is needed because of  his concern about the national debt; but as I mentioned, every  independent estimate shows this partisan bill raises the deficit by  billions of dollars. So, what hypocrisy. It is not responsible. It is  reckless. It is utterly baffling--baffling--that at a moment that  demands maximum bipartisanship, when the country is in crisis and our  friends in Israel and Ukraine are in crisis, that the House GOP is,  instead, trying to pick an egregiously partisan fight over wealthy tax  cheats.   Years back, both parties would have come together for the good of the  country and the good of security in the world when crises like these  happen. But the House GOP--continuing the kind of recklessness, the  kind of inability to get their act together--continues to do these  kinds of things.   Their proposal is simply not a serious one. And, worse, it still  wastes precious time at a moment when we need to help Israel, Ukraine,  and send humanitarian aid to Gaza ASAP.   All friends of Israel should loudly and clearly say that any move to  make the United States-Israel relationship a partisan one, as the House  is doing, is a move that hurts Israel. That is what they do,  unfortunately: harming our partnership with Israel by politicizing  their aid package. I urge Speaker Johnson: Quickly change course,  Speaker Johnson, because this stunningly unserious proposal is not  going to be the answer. It is not going anywhere. As I said: It is dead  almost before it is born.                             Oil Industry Mergers    Mr. President, the FTC letter that we sent this morning--and I think  people should pay attention to this because this is a very serious  issue. Last month, America's two largest oil companies, ExxonMobil and  Chevron, announced two of the largest oil acquisitions of the 21st  century--in fact, some of the largest mergers in the history--in the  whole history--of the United States. And where are these mergers  occurring? In the heavily concentrated oil industry where the consumer  has almost no say whatsoever.   These deals have all the hallmarks of harmful, anticompetitive  effect. And if they are allowed to happen, Americans could see the  consequences through higher prices at the pump. People are complaining,  justifiably, that gas prices are too high, and these mergers inevitably  will make the price even higher.   So today, I am leading a group of 22 Senators calling on the Federal  Trade Commission to use the full powers of the FTC to investigate these  mergers. In our letter, we say that if any antitrust laws may be  violated, the FTC should step in and oppose the mergers.   We broke up Standard Oil's illegal monopoly in 1911. We are quickly  getting back to that place. The FTC should also investigate whether it  is time to break up today's anticompetitive oil conglomerates. When  America's largest oil companies can just buy some of their largest  competitors--here we have Exxon, the biggest oil company in America,  buying the largest oil driller in the Permian Basin, which is the  biggest U.S. oil field--it is outrageous. When the largest companies  can control the lion's share of the supply chain, when they are able to  act  [[Page S5271]]  with little accountability, the result is a raw deal for American  consumers, American workers, and the American economy.   And this isn't speculation. We have seen this happen before. In the  1990s, there were over 2,600 mergers across the petroleum industry. The  number of major oil companies was cut in half.   I will never forget the day. This was a Democratic President.  President Clinton, unfortunately, allowed the merger between Exxon and  Mobil--two of the biggest oil companies. I opposed it at the time. The  result of these mergers and lax accountability was market manipulation,  an unstable supply, and, ultimately, price hikes for Americans.   Well, why repeat that mistake? We cannot allow it.   With ExxonMobil's merger with Pioneer and Chevron's merger with Hess,  we are seeing history repeat itself. More consolidation and less  competition may be good for the shareholders and the big oil company  execs, but it ain't good for America, and it certainly ain't good for  the consumer, who will inevitably pay more for gas, oil, and so many  other things.   There is something deeply wrong about seeing the largest oil and gas  companies in the world manipulate their way to higher profits as  Americans are struggling at the pump. Last year alone, the world's five  largest oil companies saw record profits--$219 billion--more than  double the profits of 2021.   And where did the profits go? Did they translate to lower prices for  Americans? Did the companies invest in worker productivity or in  finding new, clean energy sources? No. The soaring profits fueled  soaring stock buybacks. Americans, meanwhile, saw higher prices every  time they filled up the tank.   And one other point about these mergers: At one point, the big oil  companies said: Hmm, we understand that the world is moving in a  direction of clean energy. We are going to move that way, too.   These mergers show they are not. They are not. They are simply  investing in the old carbon resources that we know, in the long run,  will do such damage to our world and our world economy. Yet they are  just moving headlong in that direction--short-term gain, long-term  loss.   Mergers will accelerate these disturbing trends of high gas prices  and less competition. So we are calling on the FTC to look into the  announcements made by ExxonMobil and Chevron and step in if necessary.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60- affirmative vote threshold for the adoption of the substitute  amendment, No. 1092, as amended, be withdrawn.    I know of no further debate on the substitute amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1092     Madam President, I am proud to say that today the Senate  becomes the first Chamber in Congress to pass bipartisan, responsible  appropriations bills: MILCON-VA, Agriculture, and Transportation-HUD.  These bipartisan bills deliver big wins for America's farmers, for our  infrastructure, for housing, and for our military bases and veterans  and more. And passing these bills affirms what I have said all year  long: The only way--the only way--to get things done in divided  government is bipartisanship.   I hope the Senate's success today shows Speaker Johnson and House  Republicans that bipartisanship is the way to go. The American people  won't support futile exercise of passing partisan, extremist  legislation that has no chance of becoming law, which is what the House  is doing right now. Their appropriations bills, A, are loaded with  poison pills that they know are not going to be accepted in this  Chamber or by Democrats in their Chamber, and they make cuts in the  budget that go against the agreement we made during the debt ceiling.   I told Speaker Johnson last week that if we can figure out how to  work on appropriations together, we can get good things done for the  country, which is what both sides, I am proud to say, in the Senate  want to do. I urged Speaker Johnson not to repeat the mistakes of  Speaker McCarthy's team, who pushed party-line funding bills that went  way below the agreement from June, without input from Democrats. Only-- only--bipartisan appropriation bills will be able to fully fund the  government.   I want to recognize my colleague. Chair Patty Murray has done  excellent work in her first year as chair of the Appropriations  Committee. She has been outstanding. I also wish to thank Vice Chair  Susan Collins for her terrific work, as well as all the appropriators  on both sides of the aisle.   Pursuing bipartisanship isn't always easy. Most of the time, it is  difficult--more difficult now than ever. But if you stick with it, we  can do it. And we have stuck with it, and we have done it. Thanks to  both sides, we are reaching a good outcome for the country.   I yield the floor.
