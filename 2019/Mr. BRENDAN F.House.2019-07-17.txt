 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank my  friend from Washington State for yielding.   More than anything, today is about fairness for America's workers. I  come to this issue with the experience of remembering on several  occasions when I was growing up, my parents, who were both hardworking  members of organized labor, going through a contract negotiation and  wondering, if they were going to go out on strike, what was going to  happen.   On more than one occasion, it would end like this. They would say:  Well, I think we got a fair deal. We are forgoing a pay increase, but  thank God we are able to save our healthcare and our benefits.   Time and time again, thousands--indeed, millions--of American workers  made that decision that they would forgo pay raises, forgo pay  increases, so they could save their healthcare. So then, decades later,  to face a 40 percent tax on that healthcare just is not right and not  fair to America's workers.   So I am proud to stand here today with my fellow Pennsylvanian on the  other side of the aisle, with colleagues  [[Page H5969]]  of mine on both sides of the aisle, in order to repeal this Cadillac  tax which never should have been passed in the first place.   Madam Speaker, I will enter into the Record a number of letters from  organizations all supporting this piece of legislation to repeal the  Cadillac tax.                                                            NRF,                                                      July 16, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: I write       to share the strong support of the National Retail Federation       (NRF) for H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax       Repeal Act of 2019. Please note that NRF may consider votes       on the strongly bipartisan H.R. 748 and related procedural       motions as Opportunity Index Votes for our annual voting       scorecard.        The National Retail Federation, the world's largest retail       trade association, passionately advocates for the people,       brands, policies and ideas that help retail thrive. From its       headquarters in Washington, D.C., NRF empowers the industry       that powers the economy. Retail is the nation's largest       private-sector employer, contributing $2.6 trillion to annual       GDP and supporting one in four U.S. jobs--42 million working       Americans. For over a century, NRF has been a voice for every       retailer and every retail job, educating, inspiring and       communicating the powerful impact retail has on local       communities and global economies.        H.R. 748, introduced by Representatives Joe Courtney (D-CT)       and Mike Kelly (R-PA), will repeal the Affordable Care Act's       40% excise tax on the excess value of employer-sponsored       health plans. Though portrayed as being targeted at rich       ``gold-plated'' benefit plans, the ``Cadillac Tax'' is       projected to hit much more mainstream plans covering low- and       middle-class families in the coming years because of how it       is indexed.        This legislation helps protect health insurance coverage       enjoyed by 181 million Americans. According to 2018 mid-term       election polling, 81 percent of voters oppose taxing       employer-provided health coverage.        NRF appreciates Congress' past two successful efforts to       delay the ``Cadillac Tax.'' We urge its full repeal, however,       because this tax forces the reduction of benefits well in       advance of its effective date. Employers generally craft       benefit plans two or more years in advance of the actual plan       year. Benefits are being reduced now (increasing employee       cost-sharing) to avoid the unfair tax on ``excess'' benefits.        We strongly urge your support for H.R. 748, bipartisan       legislation to repeal the ``Cadillac Tax.''            Sincerely,                                                      David French,      Senior Vice President, Government Relations.                                   ____                                                               NECA,                                        House of Representatives,                                                     Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Electrical       Contractors Association (NECA), I am writing in strong       support of H.R. 748--Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal       Act of 2019, introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Rep.       Mike Kelly (R-PA)        This critically needed legislation seeks to repeal the       ``Cadillac tax,'' which if implemented would levy a 40       percent tax on ``high-end'' employer-sponsored health       insurance plans with benefits valued at $10,200 per year per       individual or $27,500 per family. This tax ignores       significant demographic and geographic factors and applies to       benefits that help keep employees healthy, such as health       savings accounts. Most importantly, it penalizes employers,       including NECA contractors, for providing their employees       with quality health coverage.        NECA contractors work to provide quality, affordable health       coverage through self-insured, employer-sponsored group plans       to well over 500,000 employees across our nation. Employer-      sponsored health insurance provides affordable quality       coverage in the best interest of American businesses and       their workers. Although the tax does not go into effect until       2022, employers are already being compelled to reduce       benefits or implement increased cost-sharing to avoid being       on a trajectory to trigger the tax thresholds. If Congress       does not act now, the tax will hurt millions of Americans       with employer-sponsored health care.        Thank you for your consideration of these views. As the       nationally recognized voice of the $171 billion electrical       construction industry, NECA, and our 118 local chapters       nationwide urge you to vote yes on H.R 748. Please note that       we will include this vote in our NECA Legislative Report Card       for the 116th Congress.        Thank you for your consideration of our views.            Sincerely,                                    Marco A. Giamberardino, MPA,                                          Vice President, Government      and Public Affairs.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                             Health Underwriters,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The National       Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU) endorses the       passage of H.R. 748, a repeal of the 40% excise tax on       certain employer-sponsored health insurance plans, known as       the ``Cadillac Tax.'' NAHU represents 100,000 licensed agents       and brokers who are engaged in the sale and service of health       insurance and other ancillary products. NAHU members serve       employers and consumers around the country. Our members work       to help millions of employers of all sizes finance,       administer and utilize their group health benefit plans on a       daily basis, and they know firsthand how the 40% excise tax       on health benefits will hurt middle-class consumers.        H.R. 748 has received bipartisan support with 361 co-      sponsors with a majority of each party caucus supporting       repeal of the Cadillac Tax. The Cadillac Tax, set to go into       effect in 2022, will impose a 40% excise tax on health plans       that exceed certain cost thresholds beginning in 2022.       Specifically, the law calls for a 40% excise tax on the       amount of the aggregate monthly premium of each primary       insured individual that exceeds the year's applicable dollar       limit, which will be adjusted annually to the Consumer Price       Index plus one percent. The current threshold for when the       tax applies is set to $11,100 for individual coverage and       $29,750 for ``other than self-only'' coverage. Because of the       wide-ranging benefits that can be counted towards the tax,       including HSAs, HRAs, FSAs and other cost-containment       measures, many employers will find their plans exceeding       these thresholds when the tax takes effect. While designed as       a disincentive for employers offering the most benefit-rich       plans, in reality the tax will impact a majority of plans,       including those that aren't benefit-rich and were not the       intended targets of this provision.        All employers could be subjected to this tax, with various       factors determining the likelihood of a plan's costs       exceeding the threshold. These include family size, state       benefit mandates, high-cost geography, age, health status,       the size of the employer and other factors. In addition to       paying the tax, employers will be forced to handle onerous       compliance requirements on a monthly basis to record and pay       the tax to insurers. In turn, insurers will be required to       treat the tax as revenue and will be taxed on that amount,       which will increase the size of the tax for everyone.       Individuals and families who are already struggling to afford       existing plan premiums and higher deductibles will also be       hit by the tax, further increasing their costs.        We appreciate your consideration on this issue that is       important for businesses and their employees so that all       families can afford quality healthcare. We look forward to       working with you and your colleagues in enacting this       bipartisan legislation this year.        Best regards,                                                   Janet Trautwein,      Executive Vice President and CEO.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                                   Manufacturers,                                                      July 16, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Association       of Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association       in the United States representing 14,000 manufacturers in       every industrial sector and in all 50 states, I am writing to       urge you to support the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax       Repeal Act of 2019 (H.R. 748) introduced by Representatives       Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Mike Kelly (R-PA).        Manufacturers consistently rank the rising cost of health       care as a primary business challenge in the NAM's Quarterly       Outlook Survey. Despite the challenge, approximately 98       percent of NAM members continue to provide health insurance       to employees. The manufacturing industry is committed to       providing quality health benefits to employees to maintain a       healthy workforce, attract and retain talent and because it       is the right thing to do. Many are leading new health benefit       initiatives to provide quality care that reduces growing       health benefits costs. Additionally, manufacturers oppose       applying heavy federal tax burdens on employers' and workers'       health bills.        H.R. 748 would permanently repeal the 40 percent tax-hike       on ``high-cost'' health benefits, commonly referred to as the       Cadillac Tax. While this tax was initially intended to impact       high-cost employer-sponsored health care plans, it is       expected to burden a broad crosssection of small and large       employers across the country and to discourage employer       innovations that are improving benefits for manufacturing       workers. Manufacturers have been forced to begin plan       preparations even though the tax is scheduled to go into       effect in 2022. Fully repealing the Cadillac tax, health       insurance tax and medical device tax remain top health care       priorities for manufacturers.        The NAM urges strong support for H.R. 748 and appreciates       ongoing efforts to eliminate the looming threat of health       care taxes on manufacturers. Thank you for your       consideration.            Sincerely,      Robyn M. Boerstling,  [[Page H5970]]         Vice President, Infrastructure, Innovation and Human       Resources Policy.                                   ____                           National Taxpayers Union                       50th Anniversary, July 16, 2019         NTU urges all Representatives to vote ``YES'' on H.R. 748,       the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019. This       legislation would permanently repeal the flawed ``Cadillac       tax'' scheduled to go into effect in 2022, which could impact       up to one in five employers immediately. Congress should also       work to permanently repeal the medical device tax and the       Health Insurance Tax (HIT), both of which are scheduled to go       into effect in 2020.        NTU has noted before that the Affordable Care Act's excise       tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance (ESI),       popularly known as the ``Cadillac tax,'' is a poor solution       to a real policy dilemma--addressing the employer-sponsored       health insurance tax exclusion that has distorted markets.       Even though the intent of the tax was to reduce health care       costs and boost the economy, the Joint Committee on Taxation       (JCT) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have       estimated that the Cadillac tax will depress wages.        The Cadillac tax would also have a far-reaching impact on       ESI plans. The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) recently       reported that the Cadillac tax could impact more than one in       five employers (21 percent) in 2022, when the tax is       scheduled to go into effect. Since the cost of ESI plans is       expected to rise faster than inflation, a growing proportion       of plans will likely become subject to the tax over time.       KFF-estimates that nearly two in five ESI plans (37 percent)       will be subject to the tax by 2030.        When it comes to taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act,       though, Congress should not stop with Cadillac tax repeal.       Both the medical device tax and the Health Insurance Tax       (HIT) have been suspended by Congress, but are scheduled to       resume in 2020. The costs of these taxes will ultimately be       borne by consumers, in the form of higher health spending and       higher premiums. Additionally, Congress should examine the       tax treatment of health care in a holistic fashion and work       toward a minimally distortionary environment that empowers       consumers to make decisions about their own health care       needs.        NTU strongly urges Representatives to support H.R. 748, and       additionally to permanently repeal both the medical device       tax and HIT.        Roll call votes on H.R. 748 will be included in our annual       Rating of Congress and a ``YES'' vote will be considered the       pro-taxpayer position.
