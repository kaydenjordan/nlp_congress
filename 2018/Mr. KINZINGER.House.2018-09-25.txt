 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 1320, the  Nuclear Utilization of Keystone Energy Act, which I proudly introduced  with my colleague, Mike Doyle. I want to also share my compliments to  his staff and my staff working together very well on hammering out a  lot of the technical issues and getting this done. It shows that hard  work matters.   The United States is home to nine nuclear power plants--my district  has four of those--which provide reliable, carbon-free electricity to  thousands of American homes and businesses.   Unfortunately, nuclear power is at a critical impasse, and many of  these plants are facing early retirements, which means a loss of clean  energy, good jobs, and our global leadership on vital issues like  safety and nonproliferation.   This legislation, the NUKE Act, makes commonsense reforms to increase  transparency, predictability, and accountability at the NRC. Because  nuclear plants pay to be regulated by the NRC, these reforms, including  a predictable fee recovery structure, caps on annual fees, and keeping  overhead costs in line with similar Federal agencies, will not only  increase stability at our operating plants, but it will also pave the  way for the next generation of nuclear technology.   I also think it is important to point out that many times in the  energy battle, we sometimes find out we needed to do something when it  is too late and you spend a lot of time playing catch-up. This is a  proactive way to make sure we maintain this strong fleet of which  America is a leader.   In closing, I urge my colleagues to join me and Congressman Doyle in  supporting H.R. 1320, the NUKE Act, and help ensure a safe and strong  future for American nuclear power.
