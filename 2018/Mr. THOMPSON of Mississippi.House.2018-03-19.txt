 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5074, the DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams  Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me again support the chairman's  comments about Austin, Texas. We talked a little bit about it last week  in a hearing and, since that hearing, another incident has occurred.  Terrorism, whether it is domestic or whatever, has no place in this  country. I look forward to the capture of the person or persons who are  committing these heinous acts in Austin, as well as providing whatever  resources might go toward any future apprehensions.   Mr. Speaker, last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued a  technical alert with the FBI on the Russian Government's efforts to use  cyber tools to target our critical infrastructure--including our  energy, water, aviation, and commercial facilities, critical  infrastructure sectors.    DHS and the FBI released the alert amidst ongoing discussions about  the urgent need to better secure our election infrastructure against  Russian targeting and as the sophisticated cyber capabilities of Iran,  North Korea, China, and nonstate actors continue to evolve. H.R. 5074,  the DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams Act of 2018, would codify DHS'  Hunt and Incident Response Teams into law.   The Department deploys Hunt and Incident Response Teams to owners and  operators of critical infrastructure, upon request and free of charge  after a cybersecurity incident. These DHS teams provide intrusion  analysis, identify malicious actors, analyze malicious tools, and  provide mitigation assistance strategies. They are DHS' ``boots on the  ground'' in cyber incident response and, as such, play an integral role  in improving the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure  owners and operators.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, the President's decision last week to finally issue  sanctions in response to meddling in the 2016 election was long  overdue. Though it was a positive move, I believe it will do little to  deter the Russian Government from using cyber tools to target our  critical infrastructure.   The Trump administration has yet to put any meaningful strategy in  place to address ongoing efforts by the Russian Government--or any  other bad actor, for that matter--to undermine the stability of the  U.S. economy and government infrastructure in cyberspace. We must  ensure that organizations have access to high-quality cyber incident  response capabilities. H.R. 5074 would do just that, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4176, the Air Cargo  Security Improvement Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4176 seeks to improve the Transportation Security  Administration's ability to address air cargo-based security threats.   Last July, then-Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly,  identified such acts as a major concern, explaining that there are  people out there, very smart people, very sophisticated people who do  nothing but try to figure out how to blow up an airplane in flight.   Later that month, Australian authorities charged four men with  plotting to bring down a passenger plane on behalf of ISIS with a bomb  in the air cargo hold. This foiled terror plot underscores the need for  the TSA to give focused attention to this clear and present security  threat. The increased risk to air cargo comes at a time when the volume  of goods being moved by air cargo has multiplied, with 2016 volumes  nearly back to pre-recession levels.   If enacted, my bill would require the TSA to establish an air cargo  security division to carry out air cargo security policy and  stakeholder engagement responsibilities. Further, it would direct the  TSA to pilot emerging technologies for screening cargo, such as  computed tomography, for integration into current security programs.   I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this necessary and  straightforward Homeland Security legislation.   Mr. Speaker, while passenger and baggage screening efforts are the  most visible part of aviation security, protecting against air cargo- based threats is just as critical.   Enactment of H.R. 4176 will ensure that the TSA is positioned to stay  ahead of this ever-evolving security threat that face all who navigate  our skies.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4176,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5099, the Enhancing DHS'  Fusion Center Technical Assistance Program Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5099 would authorize the Department of Homeland  Security's existing fusion center technical assistance program.  Currently, there are 79 fusion centers operating in the United States.  Each fusion center relies on the DHS to help assist with intelligence  products and information-sharing activities, terrorism prevention  initiatives, and Homeland Security grant programs.   This bill seeks to solidify engagement between representatives at the  fusion centers with their partners in the departments like FEMA and the  DHS intelligence branch. Specifically, the program provides technical  assistance on topics like best practices for information sharing  regarding threats and operating a fusion center.   By codifying this existing program, H.R. 5099 seeks to strengthen the  DHS' partnership with fusion centers to ensure that they are well- positioned to address a wide range of diverse security threats that may  emerge.   The bill passed committee unanimously and would amend the Homeland  Security Act of 2002. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, the security and well-being of our country is dependent  upon the timely sharing of threat information between our law  enforcement and intelligence personnel.   Importantly, one of the key areas where the DHS will provide  expertise to fusion centers under H.R. 5099 is with respect to the  protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5099,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2018.  [[Page H1667]]    Mr. Speaker, terror groups have urged their supporters to carry out  acts of violence by any means necessary, including by ramming a vehicle  into a crowd. In fact, both ISIS and al-Qaida have published propaganda  encouraging such vehicle-based terrorist attacks.   Sadly, over the past few years, vehicle-based terrorist attacks have  been carried out at home and abroad, taking the lives and injuring too  many innocent people. One of the most shocking attacks was carried out  on July 14, 2016, when a truck plowed into a crowd celebrating France's  Independence Day, which resulted in the deaths of 86 people and injured  nearly 500.   More recently, in October of 2017, a driver took the lives of eight  people when he purposely careened his truck into a path in Lower  Manhattan that was full of pedestrians and cyclists.   This tactic has not confined itself to one ideological group. On  August 12, 2017, a self-professed neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd  of counterprotestors demonstrating the march held by alt-right  activists in Charlottesville, Virginia. The attack killed Heather D.  Heyer and injured 35 others.   Just this month, a former Marine Corps reservist rammed his pickup  truck into a convenience store in Watson, Louisiana. Later, we learned  that he mistakenly believed the store was owned by Muslims.   To address this emerging threat, H.R. 4227 would require the  Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress on support  provided to emergency responders and private sector partners to counter  the threat of vehicle-based attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I support this timely legislation and believe that  enactment would improve DHS' efforts to prevent and reduce impacts of  such attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the emergence of lone wolves who choose to ram vehicles  into innocent people to advance their violent ideologies is a modern- day homeland security challenge. As threats to our homeland continue to  evolve and as violent extremists continue to exploit soft targets, the  risk to innocent bystanders grows. We must do our part to ensure that  first responders in our cities, towns, and all places of living  throughout the country have access to the necessary resources to keep  themselves safe and secure. This legislation seeks to ensure that DHS  does all it can to support such efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I would also note that this bill complements H.R. 5131,  which is also being considered today and which directs DHS to  disseminate best practices to stakeholders regarding ways to enhance  transportation security against the threat of vehicle-based attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4227,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
