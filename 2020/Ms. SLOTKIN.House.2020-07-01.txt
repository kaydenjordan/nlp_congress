 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Moving Forward  Act as a critical investment in our Nation's infrastructure.   No matter where you stand politically, the state of our crumbling  infrastructure is something that all people, and certainly all  Michiganders, agree on.   The disastrous breaching of two major dams in my State last month is  all you need to know. It is a cautionary tale for everyone.   We are in need of generational investment in our infrastructure, and  this bill includes many of the priorities I have fought for for our  district, including major money for high-speed broadband for all  Americans, significant funds for upgrades to our schools, and $40  billion for clean water investment projects, including PFAS treatment.   I am also pleased that the House adopted two of my amendments which  protect Michigan's most precious gifts, which is our waters and our  water.   One of my amendments is directly related to an issue called Line 5, a  pipeline in our beautiful Great Lakes. It  [[Page H3026]]  will require the Federal agency responsible for pipeline safety to  share information related to pipeline leaks, damage, or disruption with  relevant State and local governments.   This is enormously relevant, given the recent disruption of  Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac. The people of  Michigan deserve to be sure of the safety of the pipeline. My amendment  would make sure they have the relevant information.   Investing in our country's infrastructure can and should be a  bipartisan issue. I urge my colleagues to support on both sides of the  aisle.
