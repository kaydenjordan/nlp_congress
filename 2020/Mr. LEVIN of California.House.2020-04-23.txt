 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   The American people are generous and strong, and we will get through  this if we stay united.   To the mom-and-pop businesses in my district that haven't received a  dime and the community health centers struggling to help their  patients, they are why I got on a flight last night, and they are why  we need to pass this bill today.   In the weeks ahead, it should be everyone's priority in this  government to help our heroes on the front lines and those most in  need, regardless of what State or city they are in. We are the United  States of America, and we must stay united.
