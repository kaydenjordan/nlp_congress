 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join our community in  celebrating the 200th anniversary of Colgate University's founding.  Located in Madison County in upstate New York, Colgate was officially  established by New York State in 1819.   For 200 years, the university has exemplified all the best American  higher education has to offer. It has produced many graduates of  national acclaim, including business professionals, community leaders,  Members of Congress--including two current Members of Congress--and  other government officials.   Colgate has taught some of the brightest minds in our country and now  educates more than 2,900 students each year in 56 different majors. I  am proud to represent this excellent institution in Congress, and I  join the Colgate community in celebrating their bicentennial.                            ____________________
