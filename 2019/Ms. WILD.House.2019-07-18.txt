 Mr. Speaker, there should not be anybody in this room  arguing that $7.25 an hour is sufficient for a worker's well-being.  When adjusted for inflation, $7.25 is less than the Federal minimum  wage of 50 years ago.   I support this bill because 98,000 workers in my district in  Pennsylvania deserve a long-overdue raise. We are now in the midst of  the longest period of time without an increase to the Federal minimum  wage.   I support this bill because, while corporations are making record  profits off the backs of workers, wage stagnation and increased cost of  living have bankrupted hardworking families across my district.   This bill would increase the minimum wage gradually.   This is not a ``bad for business'' piece of legislation, as my  colleagues across the aisle allege. It is a ``good for everyone'' bill  that puts more money into our workers' pockets.   Our colleagues of the past would be baffled by the opposition to this  bill.    The Federal Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938 for the  explicit purpose of protecting workers from substandard wages. That  landmark bill passed the House by a vote of 291-89.   By the letter of that law, the minimum standard of living necessary  for a worker's well-being is in Congress' hands. Members of both  parties chose not to leave it up to market forces because poverty-level  wages, sweatshops, and poor working conditions should not happen in the  United States of America in 1938 or in 2019.
