 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3922.  Listening to my Democratic friends, it was said right by Chairman  Walden. It is cynical, and it is amazing that they could vote against  this bill.   Not only does this bill reauthorize public health programs vital to  Americans who need them most, but it does so in a fiscally responsible  manner. Reauthorizing CHIP for a 5-year period was an important  priority of children's healthcare providers in my district, but doing  so while saving billions is an impressive feat.   On top of that, providing funding for community health centers will  drastically improve rural health in South Carolina's Fifth District.  This bill is proof that the American people can trust their government  to provide essential services to citizens who cannot provide for  themselves, without saddling our children and grandchildren with debt.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague, Chairman Walden,  for his impressive efforts in striving toward a greater government.                                time  1015
