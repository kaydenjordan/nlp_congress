 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2.   This country must have an immigration system that works.   If our Nation is going to compete with China, we have to have an  immigration system that works.   If our Nation is going to continue to feed the world, we need a  system that works.   If our Nation is going to continue to build its infrastructure,  roads, buildings, and structures that our economy needs, we need an  immigration system that works.   If our Nation is going to take care of its elderly, sick and retired,  we need a system that works.   If our Nation is going to compete at the highest level of AI and  computer chip manufacturing, we need an immigration system that works.   If our Nation is to have an economy that is not starving for workers,  we need an immigration system that works.   Mr. Speaker, to have an immigration system that works, we have to  have a border that works, and our border is broken.   Hundreds of thousands of people coming across the border every day do  not support an immigration system that works and does not reflect an  immigration system that works.   Mr. Speaker, we need to fix the border first and then we can fix our  immigration system.   This is the first step, the first absolutely essential and necessary  step to provide a foundation for a comprehensive revision of our  immigration system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 2, and I will be voting for it.
