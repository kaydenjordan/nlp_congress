 Madam Speaker, I, too, am honored to join my  colleagues here tonight to recognize the bravery and the sacrifice of  those who serve in our military. I also want to thank General Bergman  for his years of dedicated service and for his leadership tonight.   While May is Military Appreciation Month, it is important that every  month we continue to recognize those who are fighting and still putting  their lives on the line each and every day. Since the founding of our  country, there have always been brave men and  [[Page H4422]]  women who understood what it takes to protect our freedom and our way  of life. They are patriots who represent the very best of America.   I am especially grateful to the members of my family who served. My  father, James, served in the Army during World War II; and my two  brothers, Rick in the Navy and Reg in the Marines, served during  Vietnam. Like many of us, I recall seeing my older brothers go off to  war in Vietnam, and I vividly remember the difference between the Blue  Star and, tragically, Gold Star families during that conflict.   Throughout our Nation's history, we have paid a heavy price for  freedom. It has not been easy. One week from today, we will remember  those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. On Memorial Day,  we remember those who gave their lives in the service of these United  States. Our fallen soldiers were born in different generations, fought  in different wars, faced unique challenges, but they are all part of  the fabric and history of this great land, America.   Through their service and selflessness, our Nation's sons and  daughters have kept our country strong and free. Thank you to the  fallen. Thank you to the veterans and those currently serving here and  abroad. God bless America.
