 Mr. Speaker, last Friday the 25th of January, 2019,  was a day of celebration for 800,000 Federal workers. They joined me at  the Federal office building which my office is in, and we stood  together listening to their pain and their stories of trying to  survive. Many said: We don't want to be held hostage again.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that no Federal employee over a  policy question should not be paid. And as we have been saying, open  the government and pay the workers. That same day, I went out to visit  TSO officers and air traffic controllers.   When I came back today, I stopped to speak to air traffic  controllers, and I thanked them and said, America now knows for all of  the Federal workers what great patriots and servants of the Nation that  they are. We must thank them.   I want to say to the officer who asked me about his pay being frozen  that I hope Republicans will join Democrats in raising that pay to 2.6  percent. This is my answer to you, that we will pay you, and we will  increase your pay.   As I close, Mr. Speaker, I want to offer sympathy and concern for  five Houston police officers who have just been shot. I offer my  prayers and concern and sympathy for their families, and a speedy  recovery during this time.                            ____________________
