 Madam Speaker, throughout this process, the  American people have learned of bungling foreign policy decisions, but  we have not heard evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, of bribery or  extortion. Allegations of these two crimes aren't even mentioned in the  Articles of Impeachment being debated today.   Today, we have seen a rushed process divide our country. Today,  accusations have been hurled at each other, questioning one another's  integrity. Today, a dangerous precedent will be set: impeachment  becoming a weaponized political tool.   We know how this partisan process will end this evening, but what  happens tomorrow? Can this Chamber put down our swords and get back to  work for the American people?   This institution has a fabled history of passing legislation that has  not only changed our country, but has inspired the world. This feat has  been possible because this experiment we call America has one perpetual  goal: make a more perfect Union.   We can contribute to this history if we recognize the simple fact  that way more unites our country than divides us. Tomorrow, can we  start focusing on that?
