 Mr. President, I will be joined by a series of my  colleagues who are coming to the floor this afternoon to talk about the  November 2018 elections coming up and the steps we need to take to make  sure that the Russian influence effort that bedeviled our 2016 election  is not replicated in the 2018 election.   I guess the first question to answer is, Is this a realistic  prospect? Is this something we should concern ourselves with--that the  Russians would come back again in 2018 and try to meddle in our  elections?   Everyone in the Trump administration who has been asked about this,  perhaps outside of the Oval Office itself, has said: Yes, absolutely.  They are coming. The Director of the CIA, the Director of National  Intelligence, the head of the FBI, the Attorney General, the Department  of Justice--there is no contest. There is no disagreement. There is no  doubt, even among the President's senior national security and law  enforcement team that they are coming back, that they are going to do  this again. That leads us to the question of what we are doing about  it.   It seems that the silence from the Oval Office on this subject is  deafening. The White House doesn't ever want to talk about doing  anything about this. To the extent that we get signals from tweets and  things like that, they are usually nonfactual and highly politicized  challenges to the basic facts that all of the President's senior  Cabinet staff seem to agree with.   I don't know why they haven't sorted out why the President says one  thing and all of his Cabinet officials say something else, but that is  for them. What is for us is to review this in Congress, to do  oversight, and to do what legislation might be necessary to raise our  defenses to make sure that we can effectively counter what we have been  warned is coming at us.   We have no proposal from the administration. One would think with  something like this, where we have an election that has been attacked  by a hostile foreign country--one would think that would be the kind of  thing that would bring our country together and would get the  President's attention. He swore an oath to protect and defend the  Constitution, and last I heard, the elections are a part of our  Constitution. Yet there is nothing--crickets.   Where is the proposal? Where are the congressional hearings on our  proposals? Where are the markups? Where are the bills? We are seeing an  extraordinary lack of interest and initiative in something about which  we have been very forcefully warned.   The failure at the White House is very profound. Over and over again,  we have heard senior Trump officials say that they have not been  instructed by the President to take this seriously. My senior  colleague, Senator Jack Reed, asked Director Chris Wray of the FBI  about whether the FBI had taken specific actions to confront and blunt  Russian influence and disinformation activities. On February 13, in the  Senate Intelligence Committee, he said, ``not as specifically directed  by the President, no.''   To read the transcript more completely, Senator Reed asked:         So let me begin with Mr. Wray and say, has the President       directed you and your agency to take specific actions to       confront and blunt Russian influence activities that are       ongoing?        Wray: We're taking a lot of specific efforts to blunt       Russian . . .        Reed: . . . directed by the President?        Wray: Not--not as specifically directed by the President,       no.    Similarly, 2 weeks later, February 27, in testimony before the Senate  Armed Services Committee, the NSA's Director, ADM Mike Rogers, said  that he had not been granted the authority nor directed specifically by  the President to take action to disrupt Russian election hacking  operations.   Again, Senator Reed asked:         So, you would need, basically, to be directed by the       President, through the Secretary of Defense, to get--    Rogers interrupts:         Yes, sir, as I--I mentioned that in my statement.        Reed: Have you been directed to do so, given the strategic       threat that faces the United States and the significant       consequences you recognize already?        Rogers: No, I have not.    There is a lot of room for improvement here. You can also add to this  list the failures of activity at the State Department, which was  allocated $120 million to counter foreign efforts to meddle in  elections to sow distrust in democracy. According to the March 4 story  in the New York Times:         Not one of the 23 analysts working in the department's       Global Engagement Center--which has been tasked with       countering Moscow's disinformation campaign--speaks Russian,       and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to       recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian       efforts.    So when Congress provides $120 million to the State Department to  take steps to protect against Russian election interference, what we  get back is that none of that money gets spent, and a hiring freeze  prevents the people with the necessary qualifications from even coming  in to do the job. That is not taking the problem seriously--not at the  FBI, not at the NSA, and not at the State Department.   As far as I can tell, there actually is no formal executive branch  interagency process that is designed to examine what the Russians did  and put together legislative recommendations for Congress to follow up  on. In national security matters, that is the President's role; that is  the executive branch's role. We have the authority to make the laws,  but because they are doing the day-to-day work, we count on the  executive branch to put the proposals together for us. And again, there  is nothing.   There is one thing that we did do. We wanted to send a strong signal  to Vladimir Putin that there was a price to be paid for this kind of  misbehavior--manipulating our elections. We voted, virtually  unanimously, in this Chamber, 98 to 2. I don't know the numbers on the  House side, but it was equally virtually unanimous on the House side.   It was 98 to 2 here in the Senate. We passed tough sanctions to hit  Vladimir Putin where it hurts, which is right in the oligarchs. That is  what he cares about, the oligarchs who support him, the oligarchs whose  corrupt enterprises he has corruptly engaged with. That whole  racketeering enterprise that runs the Russian Government is what the  sanctions would go after.   Well, the administration has refused to implement them. The State  Department has said that they are not needed. Not needed? We are  hearing from all of the Trump administration's own senior executive  agencies that they are going to come and do this again in 2018. How are  they not needed if this is no deterrence for what they did in 2016? It  would be one thing to say they are not needed if the evidence was: OK,  they got the message. They are not going to do this again. We are fine  in 2018.    But that is not what Trump's own Cabinet officials and national  intelligence leaders are telling us. They are telling us that they are  needed because they are coming at us again. So this added bit of  deterrence would be very important.   When it came to something as simple as putting together the list of  targeted oligarchs to put maximum pressure on President Putin, they  didn't even put a list together on their own; they went to Forbes  magazine and took the list out of a public magazine. That doesn't look  like a serious or conscientious effort.   So right up and down the administration, you see failure to take this  seriously traceable directly to the White House, and that is very, very  regrettable.   The other thing that we don't know is what the White House has been  up to with respect to Congress. There was a lot of talk early on about  how we needed to have an independent committee to take a look at this,  to be independent, to put together a package of reforms, observations,  and recommendations, and we have had no  [[Page S1369]]  support for doing that. What we were told was: Don't worry. Work  through the committees.   Well, the committees aren't doing much, to tell you the truth. It is  like the gavels are made out of foam rubber around here. We could do a  lot better, and there is no independent commission.   It raises the question, what was the role of the White House? What  was the role of the President in stopping an independent commission?  How active were they in doing that? Those are questions that need  answers, but obviously, if there aren't serious investigative processes  going on in our committees, it is hard to get those answers.   Here is another question: What was the role of the White House in  coordinating or colluding with the House Intelligence Committee--with  Representative Nunez and/or his staff--in preparation for the so-called  Nunez memo?   We have learned a lot about that memo since it came out. We have  learned that it was essentially phony. It had a couple of basic  accusations. One was that the FBI had misled the FISA Court. They were  misled that one of the sources that supported the affidavit that got  the FISA warrant for the surveillance of Carter Page--that one of those  sources had been in touch with or had been funded by a political  campaign; that this was a phony effort cooked up on behalf of the  Clinton campaign and run before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Court.   Well, as it turns out, the FISA application stated specifically the  FBI's speculation that the source, Steele, had been hired to ``find  information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1's campaign''-- Trump's campaign. As somebody who has pursued affidavits for search  warrants and for surveillance warrants before, I can tell you that it  is common and standard FBI and Department of Justice practice to leave  out unnecessary names. So the fact that Mrs. Clinton wasn't mentioned  is perfectly consistent with longstanding Department practice.   The other thing that it omitted was that the Steele information was  actually corroborating information for a lot of other information that  had begun this investigation beforehand. So the theory that this all  depended on this particular source and that this source had an  undisclosed relationship with a political opponent was simply baloney.  The fact is that that was disclosed in the warrant, and there were  additional sources.   That leaves me with the question of why. Why would a legislative  committee apparently deliberately put together a report that contained  misleading or false statements but tried to create an erroneous or  false impression about something that had taken place? Well, did the  White House have any connections in that process? That is the question  we are entitled answers to. If this was just a botched job by a  partisan crew in a legislative committee, that is one set of problems.  If this is the Congress of the United States taking its oversight  authority and handing it over to the executive branch of government,  handing it over to White House operatives when the White House itself  is the subject of the inquiry, that is a very different problem. And we  are owed an answer as to what the communications were between the White  House, the Trump legal team, and the staff of the House Intelligence  Committee that prepared the Nunez report.   I have been joined by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, so  I will leave my remarks there.   I yield the floor    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Blumenthal's legislative fellow Mary Miller Flowers be granted floor  privileges until the end of June 2018.
