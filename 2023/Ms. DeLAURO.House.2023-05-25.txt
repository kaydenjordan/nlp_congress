 Madam Speaker, today's Los Angeles Times column: ``When  Kevin McCarthy's spending cuts get spelled out, even Republicans  balk.''   My friends, the Republicans do not have the votes to pass their  shameful cuts. What House Republicans have done is they have  manufactured a crisis and a false choice.   Inflict pain and harm on hardworking American people, on children,  families, seniors, veterans, or we will crash the economy.   Why? Because they believe it will help them politically.   In my State of Connecticut, cuts would lead to 2,800 kids losing  access to preschool and childcare and 12,000 mothers blocked from food  assistance.   This is my plea to the American people: Get on the phone. Call  Republican Members of this Congress. Tell them to raise that debt  ceiling and to stop hurting American families.   Let us make sure that they do not have the votes to pass these  shameful cuts.                            ____________________
