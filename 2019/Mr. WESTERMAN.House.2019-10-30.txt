 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1373, the Grand  Canyon Centennial Protection Act.   This bill is very cleverly named to imply that it is safeguarding the  Grand Canyon, something I believe that we all support. After all, who  wouldn't want to protect one of our Nation's most iconic natural sites?   But when we look at what this bill actually does, we quickly see that  it has very little to do with the Grand Canyon. Instead, it is a  Federal land grab that would lock up approximately 1 million acres of  public land in northern Arizona and permanently ban mineral  development.   Let me make this clear: H.R. 1373, the so-called Grand Canyon  Centennial Protection Act, focuses on land outside Grand Canyon  National Park, miles away from the canyon.   To hear this policy described, it sounds like we would be backing  backhoes and trucks right up to the canyon and chipping off the rim of  the canyon, but that is just not so. This is land very far outside of  the park.   This policy is progressive. It progressively increases outside  bureaucratic control over more Federal land.   The policy and the world view that supports it reminds me of the  story of the greedy farmer. He said he didn't want all the land; he  just wanted the land that bordered his land. Policy like this doesn't  claim to want all the land; it just wants to put the land in protection  that borders the land that is in protection. Someday, there won't be  any land left if we continue implementing policies like this.   As Mr. Gosar has already pointed out, the land up for debate is in  his and Mr. O'Halleran's districts, not Mr. Grijalva's, and closing its  development would result in hundreds of millions of dollars of lost  revenue for local schools and communities.   One of the common arguments against mineral development is that it  disrupts wildlife habitats and water supplies, but we have seen this  disproved time and time again. A strong economy and environmental  stewardship can coexist.   The Arizona Geological Survey published a report outlining uranium  mining in this part of Arizona, showing how mining here would not  contaminate the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon, or any of the  surrounding watersheds.   We have also seen how areas that were mined in the past have been  successfully reclaimed. As modern mining techniques and technology  continue improving, this process will only become more efficient and  advanced.   Finally, we cannot have a discussion about barring natural resource  development on public lands without addressing the far and wide-ranging  geopolitical repercussions. Our domestic uranium industry is currently  supplying less than 1 percent of the uranium necessary to fuel U.S.  nuclear reactors. Despite a vast domestic supply of uranium, much of it  is inaccessible due to laws like H.R. 1373.   This means the U.S. is forced to outsource its uranium supply from  countries like Russia, Uzbekistan, and  [[Page H8612]]  Chinese-owned mines in Namibia. With geopolitical tensions constantly  increasing, it is foolish for us to continue relying so heavily on  countries that have proven themselves to be unfriendly to the U.S.   If we permanently ban mineral development on another vast expanse of  land, we are overtly threatening American energy and economic security,  and I believe we are promoting less environmental stewardship around  the globe.   I have seen this story play out over and over again. My Democratic  colleagues claim to be concerned about environmental safety and  security, but their only solution is to lock up millions of acres and  throw away the key.   I ask: Wouldn't our time be better spent finding smart energy  solutions that are sustainable and environmentally friendly and that  provide American jobs?   If we want the U.S. to continue leading the world in long-term energy  solutions, this must be our approach.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2181,  the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2019.   This unnecessary bill would permanently ban oil and gas development  on about 316,000 acres of land in New Mexico. It would also incur $3  million in increased spending costs with no built-in mechanism to pay  for it.   H.R. 2181's proposed landgrab would surround Chaco Culture National  Historical Park. The park itself is already under Federal protections,  including a prohibition on mineral development. This bill would add 10  extra miles of protected area around the perimeter of the park. This  arbitrary addition could have long-term negative repercussions to the  State of New  Madam Chair, as much as I appreciate my colleagues'  desire to do something good, I must rise in opposition today to H.R.  823.    As we all know, wilderness designations in theory implement natural  management, meaning that man is to have a hands-off approach on the  management of the forest. But this is a farce, because when  catastrophic wildfires ignite, as they will under natural management,  we often rush to put the fires out, which is just as much human  management as thinning or other more recognized forestry management  processes.   We need wilderness areas in our country, and we need to manage them  as such if we want to be intellectually honest in claiming them as  wilderness areas. This works in areas like Yellowstone National Park  where the predominant species is lodgepole pine that naturally burns to  the ground approximately every century, like we saw when one-third of  the park burned in the 1980s.   The idea that we can preserve a forest is misguided. Forests are  living organisms, and there is only one way to preserve a living  organism: first you have to kill it. Take, for instance, a cucumber. If  you want to make a pickle, the first thing you do to preserve a  cucumber into a pickle is you boil it, you put it in vinegar, you put  it in a jar, and you preserve it. If you want to preserve human tissue,  you put the tissue in formaldehyde. There is a misnomer that we can  preserve our forests because forests are living organisms.   We should be discussing instead conservation. We should want to  conserve our forests, like Teddy Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot  proposed.   Colorado's forests are currently in an unhealthy state. They are  overstocked and infested with insects like the bark and pine beetle. I  say that based on a report from the Colorado State Forest Service 2018  Forest Health Report.   It says that, for the seventh consecutive year, Colorado's most  widespread and destructive insect pest was the spruce beetle. This  insect has now affected more than 1.8 million cumulative acres since  2000, with a total of 178,000 acres of active infestations occurring in  high-level Engelmann spruce forests in 2018. A 4-year trend of tens of  thousands of new acres infested annually indicates a continuing spread  of  [[Page H8651]]  spruce beetle into previously uninfested forests.   Moreover, more and more Coloradans are living closer to their forests  and closer to the risk of wildfire.   Again, from the report:         A recent update to the CSFS-administered Colorado Wildfire       Risk Assessment Portal indicated that the population living       in areas at risk to wildland fire in Colorado increased to       approximately 50 percent from 2012 to 2017, surpassing 2.9       million people.    Madam Chair, Colorado has some great places, some of which are  incorporated into this bill. However, as my colleague from Colorado,  Mr. Tipton, and others have alluded to, what the State needs is not an  attempt at preservation. What they need is the application of science  to the forests. They need conservation.   Colorado needs the utilization and management of their forests to  restore their health and well-being. These forests need thinning,  prescribed fire, and selective timber harvest to restore the  appropriate stand density and reduce the beetle epidemic.   What these acres do not need is inaction.   Wilderness prevents any action, which threatens not just the  surrounding acreage and the communities that lie within those  boundaries. Our congressional responsibility is to be good stewards of  our lands and ensure that they are there for future generations.   I have no doubt that was the sponsor's intent when writing this bill.  However, we cannot just claim vast swaths of land and call our work  done. Instead, we must be precise as to what we are designing and why.   Wilderness, in this case, is not the answer. Natural management will  not be followed because when life and property are at risk, we will  spend vast resources to extinguish nature's management tools.   Authorizing this action over the objections of State and Federal  representation is not wise. The future will be our judge if this land  is designated wilderness, and nature will deliver its verdict in time.  None of us may even be alive when the verdict is delivered, but I  desire for the Record to indicate that I argued on the side of sound  science, that I argued to be responsible and use science and management  to restore our forest resiliency, and that I argued to make our forest  carbon sinks instead of carbon emitters.    Madam Chairwoman, I argue for wildlife, for water, and  for a better environment, and it is because of these reasons that I  encourage my colleagues to vote against H.R. 823.    Will the gentleman yield?    I would be amenable if we did that, but then it  wouldn't be wilderness area.
