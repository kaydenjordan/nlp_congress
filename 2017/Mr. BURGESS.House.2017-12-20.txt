 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, late in June of 2012, like many Americans, I anxiously  awaited a ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States while they  were considering the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Of  course, we were  [[Page H10258]]  told during the run-up to that law, the Affordable Care Act law, that  the individual mandate was not a tax; it was, in fact, just a  requirement that everyone should buy the insurance.   It seemed unreasonable under the Commerce Clause that that  requirement, in fact, would be constitutional. Then, at the end of  June, the Supreme Court made the ruling. I was probably right that it  was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. But with some creative  work, the Supreme Court said: It is a tax, and the Congress has the  absolute power to tax; so, of course, it can stay in the law, and the  law stands.   So here we are today, considering tax reform for the first time in 31  years. And since the Supreme Court told us the individual mandate is  indeed a tax, it is appropriate, it is right that the individual  mandate be part of the discussion today.   The House bill, when we passed it, did not include anything on the  individual mandate; but the Senate, in their wisdom, sent it back to us  with the individual mandate repealed.   Now, make no mistake about it, the House has repealed the individual  mandate any number of times over the last several years. The Senate has  not. So the Senate has repealed the individual mandate for the first  time.   I say: Let's meet them where they are, let's pass this bill, let's  repeal the individual mandate, and get on with making America great  again.
