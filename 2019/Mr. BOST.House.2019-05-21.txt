 Madam Speaker, a question for those watching at home.   Do you have a cell phone?   Has your family dinner been interrupted by a local call, only to  realize that it was spam?   This is incredibly frustrating and becoming all too common. In 2017,  under 4 percent of cell phone calls were spam. In 2018, the number  jumped to almost 30 percent.   This year spam calls are expected to rise up to the point of half of  all cell phone calls. That is why I am cosponsoring the TRACED Act.  This bill gives the FCC broader authority to find scammers and increase  penalties for those who are caught.   If you have a cell phone, this legislation will save you a lot of  frustration and make those times at home with your family maybe a  little bit more enjoyable.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this commonsense  legislation.               The American People Don't Trust Washington, D.C.     Madam Speaker, the American people don't trust Washington,  D.C. And I know that shocks everyone, but it is a perception that every  one of us deals with back home, and after what the majority party  pulled last week, it is easy to understand why.   Three--get it, three--bipartisan prescription drug pricing bills made  it through committee and were ready to vote on.   Now let me say that one more time. Bipartisan healthcare bills, three  of them; that is unheard of around here.   But then politics got in the way. The majority decided to add an  unrelated poison pill to drive away the Republican support. This  healthcare package now has no chance of being considered in the Senate  and will never become law.   That is why I urge the majority to bring to the floor H.R. 2700. This  legislation includes only the three bipartisan prescription drug  pricing bills, no poison pills.  [[Page H4014]]    Let's come together to address the problem. The American people  deserve better than the cynical political games that we are playing.                        Celebrating the 19th Amendment     Madam Speaker, Susan B. Anthony once said: ``There will  never be complete equality until women themselves help to make laws and  elect lawmakers''--and serve as lawmakers and actually serve in the  chair.   One hundred years ago, Congress moved one step closer to equality by  passing a constitutional Amendment granting women the right to vote.   This week, we celebrate the 19th Amendment. To honor the courageous  women who ushered us toward a more perfect Union, we wear yellow roses.   I have two daughters. I have seven granddaughters. I am thankful that  they can shape their government because of the generations of women who  came before them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Roe and Chairman  Takano for allowing this piece of legislation to move forward.   As a veteran, first off, let me say this: I couldn't be prouder than  to serve on the Veterans' Affairs Committee with the men and women we  serve with because we get the opportunity to actually, hopefully, make  a difference in those veterans' lives.   Twenty veterans commit suicide every day, and as was mentioned a  while ago, that number hasn't changed much. So clearly, the current  situation is not good enough.   We need to think differently about veteran suicide. President Trump  recently took action on this issue. Now Congress is too, and it is  vitally important that we do. We are acting in a bipartisan manner.   I am honored to stand with the gentleman from New York in supporting  this legislation to improve the VA's suicide prevention coordinators.   Veteran suicide isn't a Republican or Democrat issue, and I am proud  of the work we have been doing to try to help our veterans. They  deserve our help, and, hopefully, with this bill, they are going to get  it.   We have to turn the tide on our veterans that are committing suicide  around this Nation at the level that they are. We have to do everything  we can.   This bill, I believe, was a step in the right direction. I believe  that we should pass it to the Senate as quickly as possible, and the  Senate should then move forward, and then it should be implemented.    Madam Speaker, this is a must-pass bill.   I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for moving this  piece of legislation forward as well.   Many disabled veterans and their families depend on their veterans  benefits to pay for things like food and medicine. For many of these  veterans, these payments are a lifeline. In some cases, the benefits  may even be the only income that the veteran has.   It is only fair that we ensure that the benefits paid to veterans who  were injured during military service do not lose value because of  inflation. If we don't, it could become hard for people who were  injured while serving our Nation in uniform to keep their heads above  water.   I want to thank Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee Chair Luria for her introduction of the bill.   Madam Speaker, this bill has always enjoyed bipartisan support. I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1200.
