 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamborn for leading this  important Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and celebration of National Bible  Week.   For multiple millenniums, the Bible has served as God's revelation to  His creation, providing an account of His divine plan. The future hope  of glory through the gospel of the Word of God renders guidance to us  so that we have the hope of eternal life offered by His grace through  faith.   The Bible is also the very reason we can live freely in the United  States of America. More than 400 years ago, settlers bound together in  search of the New World to escape religious persecution and establish a  free government.   Our Founding Fathers wove the Word of God into the very fabric of our  Nation, with the Bible playing a critical role in the unity and success  of these wise men as they forged a future that is free.   As John Adams once said: ``The Bible contains the most profound  philosophy, the most perfect morality, and the most refined policy that  ever was conceived upon Earth.''   It is because of these men that our Lord and Savior's guidance has  been key to the preservation of our Republic.   Now, more than two centuries later, I pray this body uses God's Word  as our guiding light. Because a government whose foundation is built on  God and His Word is a government that will have peace, freedom, and  liberty.                                time  1930
