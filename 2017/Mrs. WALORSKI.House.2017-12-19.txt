 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today of H.R. 1,  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   If you believe the rhetoric you hear, you may think this bill means  the world is ending. I guarantee you, it is not.   The truth is this tax cut bill means a brighter future for the  hardworking people and hardworking Americans who will have more money  in their pockets and a better shot at the American Dream.   Here are the facts: we are cutting taxes for Americans at all income  levels. We are doubling the standard deduction. We are doubling the  child tax credit and preserving the adoption tax credit. We are keeping  deductions for charitable giving, mortgage interest, medical expenses,  and student loan interest. We are improving 529 education plans and  leaving retirement savings alone. People will be able to keep more of  their money they earn and spend less time filing their taxes.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't just a good bill, this is a great bill. This  isn't the Apocalypse. It is a new day in America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to make history and support this  momentous bill.
