 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to my colleague and friend from  Texas that the specifics he is talking about are temporary as they are  applied to personal income tax, but they are permanent for  corporations. All of your tax cuts are permanent for the corporate  world, but not for individuals.   He talks about a family of four. Take it for $1,100 a year, divide it  by four, it is $250.                                time  1945    They are going to borrow $1.5 trillion. Divide it by 300 million, and  that is $5,000 per American. Do the math. They are spending the future  of our country to give the biggest tax cut to corporations and the  wealthiest--$4 billion alone to the Trump family. You do this on the  backs by double taxation in places like Pennsylvania, New York,  California, and New Jersey, where you are double taxing through the  SALT provision, State and local taxes.   This is going to have an incredible impact on the lives of your  constituents. How anyone with a conscience on the Republican side of  the aisle could support this bill in California, New York,  Pennsylvania, Illinois, and all the other tax States in this country is  unconscionable.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded that they should direct  their remarks to the Chair.
