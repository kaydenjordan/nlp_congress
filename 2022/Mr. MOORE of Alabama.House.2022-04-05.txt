 Mr. Speaker, President Biden is planning to  lift President Trump's successful title 42, a tragic decision that will  endanger every American's safety.   Recent reporting further exposes the devastating consequences of  President Biden's doubling down on his far-left, open-border agenda.  Not only will Biden's reversal welcome in countless new illegal  immigrants, but Biden wants Americans to pay to vaccinate them.   But it gets worse. According to this report, the Biden administration  is even considering pulling medical personnel from the Department of  Veterans Affairs to assist at the border, taking much-needed medical  care away from our veterans, our very own veterans.   I ran for office because of our veterans, because they are not  receiving the care they have earned. That is why I have asked to serve  on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.   These reports should outrage every patriotic American, regardless of  party, Republican or Democrat. We must never prioritize foreign  citizens illegally entering our country over our very own veterans.   I was watching this morning, and we see these unaccompanied males  coming into our country by the busloads. We have an invasion on our  southern border, and our administration, this President's  administration, wants to take our veteran care and our healthcare  workers to help treat the invading army.                            ____________________
