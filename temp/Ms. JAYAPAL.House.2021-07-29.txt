 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Teresa Leger  Fernandez. It has been a joy in Congress to have the gentlewoman's  voice, to have her passion, and to have her advocacy. This is what  makes me so proud to be the chair of the Congressional Progressive  Caucus because of the words, the passion, and the advocacy of  Representative Bowman, of Congresswoman Leger Fernandez, and of our 94  other members who are part of the Progressive Caucus. The Special Order  hour that we host for this Progressive Caucus is about the issues that  matter to the Congressional Progressive Caucus.   Let me be very clear, progressives have been at the forefront of  fighting for comprehensive immigration reform for a very long time. Our  Progressive Caucus is extremely diverse. We have members who are part  of the Hispanic Caucus, part of the Asian-American Caucus, and part of  the Black Caucus.   The reality is that we represent the diversity that is immigration  today in this country.   Madam Speaker, when I think about immigration, this is very personal  to me for multiple reasons. I am an immigrant myself. I am one of only  two dozen Members of Congress who serve in Congress who is a  naturalized citizen. When I came to Congress in 2017, there were  actually only six of us at that time. Then it moved to 12, and now it  moved to 24. It is good that we are here and that we are representing  the voice of immigrants who come from all over the world seeking refuge  because that is the identity that the United States has as a place to  seek refuge.   I came here when I was 16 by myself. My parents just had a few  thousand dollars in their bank account, and they used all of it to send  me, their child, across the ocean by myself at the age of 16 because  they believed that this was the place that I would have the most  opportunity.   But it isn't just that. It was 20 years ago that in Washington State  I started what was a grass-roots effort to organize against the Bush  administration at that time cracking down on immigrants, Arab  Americans, Muslim Americans, and South Asian Americans and curtailing  civil liberties. That was the moment that I got involved in grass-roots  organizing around immigration issues and ended up starting and founding  what became the largest immigrant advocacy organization in Washington  State and one of the largest in the country.   Madam Speaker, if John Lewis were here, he would tell you that the  first thing that I said to him when I came on to the floor is: You  taught me how to make good trouble.   The reason is because I, too, got arrested multiple times fighting  for immigration reform in civil disobedience that was about calling  attention to the pain of the country when we treat immigrants with the  cruelty that we have treated immigrants with both Democratic and  Republican administrations through the past to today.   Yes, Donald Trump did something to the immigration system that was  beyond anything that had been done before. But we should be clear that  much of the cruelty has existed prior to the Trump administration  coming in going back to the exclusionary history of immigration law in  America, but then also continuing through what was called welfare  reform. That was the so-called immigration reform that actually began  the criminalization of immigrants in the United States.   So the work that we do here in Congress as Representatives of our  communities on so many levels is incredibly important, because we get  to change the conversation about what the issue is and what we need to  do. We also get to change the conversation about where to put the  priority for legislative fixes to the issues that we are facing.    We have an opportunity coming up in the reconciliation package to do  the right thing for immigrants--not just for immigrants, by the way, to  do the right thing for America, because let's be very, very clear,  America would not survive without the labor and the toil of immigrant  communities. That is why I am so excited about the opportunity to  actually advance a path to citizenship for Dreamers, TPS holders,  essential workers, and farm workers in the upcoming reconciliation  package.   This is an opportunity for us to actually face the truth about who it  was that kept the country going during the COVID-19 pandemic. The  COVID-19 pandemic only underscored how our communities and our economy  rely on the work of immigrants. Throughout the pandemic, immigrant  workers have filled a broad swath of duties from picking and preparing  the food we eat, to cleaning our homes and community spaces, to serving  as front-line medical professionals and the heroic teachers who  educated our kids over Zoom.   We are talking about an estimated 5.2 million undocumented immigrants  who were serving as essential workers, nearly 15,000 DACA recipients  who have pivoted to remote learning as teachers, 1.7 million immigrants  working in the food supply industry to put food on our tables, and over  200,000 undocumented immigrants working as healthcare practitioners  including as registered nurses and home health aides.   That is why we put as one of our top five priorities for the  Congressional Progressive Caucus in the reconciliation package a  roadmap to citizenship for these essential workers.                                time  1930    One million of these undocumented essential workers are also  Dreamers. Just a few weeks ago, a judge in Texas cruelly ruled against  the DACA program, stopping the government from processing new  applications and, once again, throwing the status of hundreds of  thousands of DACA recipients back into limbo.   This is not what the American people want. It was yet another urgent  reminder about why we need to end the filibuster in the Senate and pass  the  [[Page H4282]]  Dream and Promise Act that we already passed multiple times in the  House of Representatives.   This, though, cannot wait. We cannot wait, and so it is time for us  to act in this upcoming package.   Further, over 7 million immigrant essential workers do have legal  status, but they only have temporary status or are waiting to adjust  their status. When we talk about immigrant essential workers, it is  crucial that we recognize that many of them do have legal status and  have been waiting--in some cases, in waiting lines projected to last  over 80 years to transition--to a roadmap to citizenship.   I know that when I became a citizen, Madam Speaker, it was after 17  years of being on multiple visas. By the time I became a U.S. citizen,  it was impossible for me to uproot my family, my parents, and bring  them to the United States to be with me. That is why they still live in  India, and I live here. I have not lived on the same continent as my  parents since I was 16 years old.   Every day, essential immigrant workers put their own health and the  health of their families at risk, showing up to work on the front lines  so that we and our families could stay safe. They do all of this  knowing full well that a simple traffic stop could tear them away from  their families and communities, and that should they get COVID, they  likely wouldn't have access to healthcare.   For instance, TPS holders have been serving on the front lines, even  as the former President rescinded their TPS designation and threatened  to rip them away from their communities.   Recognizing the tremendous contributions of immigrants, countries  like France actually acted to expedite citizenship for essential  immigrant workers. Not only is that the right thing to do, but it is  also good for our communities and for our economy.   Most of these workers have lived alongside us as friends and  neighbors for over a decade. They are deeply rooted in our communities.  Many have U.S. citizen children and family members, and tearing them  from their homes and their families would leave gaping, irreplaceable  holes in communities across the country.   Moreover, if doing the humane thing isn't enough for you, and if  doing the popular thing isn't good enough for you either, then look at  the economic benefit. In 2019, immigrant essential workers had an  estimated $860 billion in spending power, and that is after paying up  to $239 billion in Federal and payroll taxes, as well as an estimated  $115 billion in State and local taxes. So it is clear that immigrants  are helping to sustain our communities and bolster our economies.   Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman and Mr. Bowman were talking about the  importance of going to the border, and I just have to recall some of  the worst cruelty that I saw in the last 4 years. I was the first  Member of Congress to go into a Federal prison where mothers and  fathers who had been separated from their children, in many cases,  babies as young as 3 months old, under the previous administration and  the previous President, when they were imprisoned--these parents were  imprisoned and separated from their children.   When I went to see them, a couple of weeks into this crisis, and as  the first Member of Congress to do so, I met with hundreds of parents,  mothers and fathers who did not know where their children were.   Some of them were given slips of paper that had names of children on  them. But guess what? They weren't their children because DHS had lost  all trace of which children belonged to which parents.   What we know today is that there are still hundreds of children who  are separated from their parents. Their parents have been deported, in  some cases, and they will never be reunited. This was by design. This  was cruelty of epic proportions perpetrated by the last President and  everybody who went along with those policies. Not all Republicans did,  by the way.   I remember when Laura Bush spoke out against this and said this is  not who America is. Well, I have a different perspective on that  because we have had a lot of things happen in America that remind us  that we have a bad side to America as well.   But we have resilience. We have refuge. We have humanity. When that  trumps, that is the best of America.   The reality is, Madam Speaker, I went down to the border, as well,  multiple times. In fact, I see my colleague over here. I think he  called me--I forget what he called me, but I think he called me a  Congresswoman coyote.   No, I am not yielding to you, Mr. Gaetz. But I appreciated that  because I helped children across the border as a Member of Congress.   How could anybody be against that? These were children traveling  alone. Had I not been there, as a Member of Congress, they wouldn't  have gotten over and been able to be processed because the last  administration actually closed all the ports of entry.   When I went to Tijuana and met with so many of these people--I  remember a 15-year-old boy who had been shot in his knee. His mother  said to him to just go as quickly as he can because his brother had  already been killed by gangs. Just go. Just go. Just try to get there.   This was a strapping young boy, and he wept as he played me the  message that his mother had left him so that he could listen to it over  and over again in the shelter that he was in to get away from gangs and  violence.   This is what we are dealing with. That is why I have introduced the  Roadmap to Freedom resolution, which lays out a positive vision of who  America is, and who we should be, and who we can be if we continue to  embrace those roots by which everybody came here, unless you were  Native American. Either you came enslaved on ships against your will  and were forced to work and your labor was taken, or you came as an  immigrant in some category.    The reality is, Madam Speaker, there are many things that we have to  do. Thank goodness this new administration closed the Irwin Detention  Center, where women were being sterilized without their consent. Thank  goodness that for-profit, private detention center was closed in  Georgia.   We had that resolution--that was my resolution--on the floor. And do  you know what? It passed with bipartisan support. Members on the other  side of the aisle, as well, couldn't stomach that.   We have an opportunity here to do something really tremendous in the  next reconciliation package. I know firsthand that our immigration  story is one of struggle and resilience. Immigrants push boulders up  mountains, and we succeed because we have to. There is no other option  for us.   It is that strength of courage that comes out of struggle that is  what defines America, defines immigrants in America. So, I look forward  to doing everything I can to make sure that the Congressional  Progressive Caucus continues to push for bold, progressive immigration  reform and that we make sure that we get a path to citizenship for our  essential workers who have been taking care of all of us through this  pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Leger Fernandez for her  tremendous work, her leadership, her heart, and her passion.
