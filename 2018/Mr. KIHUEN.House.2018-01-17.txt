 Mr. Chairman, I rise to briefly speak about H.R. 3326,  the World Bank Accountability Act, which the House is voting on this  afternoon.   Mr. Chairman, last summer, I joined my Democratic and Republican  colleagues in supporting H.R. 3326 in the Financial Services Committee  to authorize the United States to participate in replenishing the  International Development Association, the IDA.   However, Democrats made it clear during consideration of this bill in  committee that our support depended on changes to certain provisions.  Specifically, we believe that prohibitions in the bill put the U.S.  funding at risk and make it too easy for the administration to cut off  funding for vulnerable nations.   Mr. Chairman, I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues have  chosen not to uphold our agreement and address these concerns. Given  the recent events and remarks by President Trump degrading developing  nations and the people who live in them, we should be concerned about  giving the administration this power.   It is critical that Congress provide moral leadership and demonstrate  to the world that the United States will not ignore or punish countries  that are struggling with poverty or conflict. We must send a strong  signal that the United States Congress respects people of all  backgrounds and nationalities.   Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   In closing, let me say that Democrats did view this legislation as an  important marker of international engagement from our committee, which  has not in recent times demonstrated a great deal of interest in global  economic leadership. We viewed this measure as an opportunity to  reinforce the importance of global economic cooperation. Given that, it  seemed to us a mistake to then reject the possibility of cooperation  with our own Republican colleagues. So we supported the bill for that  reason as well, and I regret we couldn't come to an accommodation.                                time  1545    On another matter, let me also say that I won't question the  sincerity of my Republican colleagues' commitment to reforming the  World Bank, but  [[Page H447]]  I do wonder why, if these reforms are as pressing and as urgent and as  critical as they say, why did they take so long?   Chairman Hensarling has been at the helm of our committee for over 5  years, and, during that time, the Obama administration requested  legislation to authorize U.S. participation in three other  replenishments, including the previous IDA-17. But the committee  refused to act on any of these requests, not only shirking its  oversight responsibility, but also missing a number of opportunities to  press for reforms which presumably were as urgent then as they are now.   In fact, in November of 2014, near the end of the 113th Congress, I  wrote to Chairman Hensarling urging him to turn his attention to the  three pending authorization requests before Congress adjourned. I made  a number of arguments in support of the multilateral development banks,  the MDBs, which apparently did not persuade the chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I include that letter in the Record.                                     U.S. House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                  Washington, DC, November 19, 2014.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: I write to urge you to turn your       attention before Congress adjourns to the Administration's       requests for authorizations for U.S. participation in the       replenishments of three concessional windows at the       multilateral development banks (MDBs)--namely, the World       Bank's International Development Association (IDA-17), the       Asian Development Fund (AsDF-11), and the African Development       Fund (AfDF-13).        As you know, these concessional facilities provide grants       and low-cost development financing to the world's poorest       countries. They support projects that combat hunger and       poverty while promoting private-sector growth and global       stability. Well-designed multilateral aid programs help       create more equitable societies and more stable democracies.       It is also crucial to U.S. interests that developing nations       continue to grow. Exports have been the most rapidly growing       share of our economy, and exports to developing countries       have been an important part of that.        America is also fighting a war on terrorism, and while the       forces that give rise to terrorism are complex, poverty and       despair provide a fertile feeding ground. Moreover, U.S.       contributions to the development banks also provide       tremendous value for the money. Every dollar we commit is       leveraged many times over by contributions from other donor       nations, as well as from the internal resources of the       institutions themselves.        Today, we have another very important, and potentially far-      reaching, reason why the U.S. should promptly meet its       commitments to the MDBs. The last few years have       unfortunately seen a weakening of the commitment to       multilateralism by the United States, which has led to       widespread doubt about U.S. leadership on global economic       governance.        In response, a number of developing countries, led by       China, have begun to act independently, with initiatives       viewed as the first serious, coordinated effort to reshape       the global financial architecture and challenge western       dominance in the world economy.        Last month, China announced an agreement with 21 other       developing countries to create a multilateral development       bank called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB),       which will focus on financing infrastructure development       projects in the Asia-Pacific region. A clear rival to the       Asian Development Bank, the AIIB will be led by China, its       largest shareholder, and headquartered in Beijing.        Separately, in July, the so-called BRICS nations (Brazil,       Russia, India, China and South Africa) announced plans to       launch an international development bank of their own, which       they hope will rival the strength and influence of the World       Bank. The ``New Development Bank,'' as it is called, will be       headquartered in Shanghai and focus on infrastructure       investment throughout the developing world.        Development experts agree that global infrastructure needs       in developing countries is tremendous, and there are many who       welcome the contribution that the new development banks can       make in helping to build sustainable economic infrastructure       both in Asia and elsewhere. But these new institutions also       reflect frustration by the world's major emerging economies       with the slow pace of governance reforms at the Bretton Woods       institutions, especially the IMF. In fact, the now-stalled       agreement to realign the quota shares at the IMF, negotiated       by the Bush Administration, was a critical effort to preserve       its legitimacy and keep emerging economies firmly anchored in       the multilateral system that the U.S. helped design.        U.S. inaction in meeting its commitments to the MDBs, as       well as its refusal to ratify IMF governance reforms, is what       led, in large part, to the creation of these new institutions       that will increasingly pose a challenge to the global       financial order created by western powers after World War II.       We should be mindful that a world in which countries such as       China and Russia are acting outside of the established       international financial institutions, or other global bodies,       is one that could drift beyond our control. Moreover, it       remains to be seen what values these new rising powers will       articulate and promote in their vision of a new global       economy.        I believe this makes U.S. leadership at the multilateral       development institutions today more important than ever. They       are directed at some of the most central challenges faced by       the U.S.--strategic, economic, political and moral--and, in       many ways, they are often our most effective means for       responding to those challenges.        I strongly urge you to take prompt action to affirm U.S.       support for, and U.S. leadership at, these institutions,       which have served both U.S. interests and the global public       good for so many years.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                    Ranking Member.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Nevertheless, here we are, at a  historic moment when U.S. credibility on the global stage is in serious  question.   We have the option of choosing to lead and show the community of  nations that the hateful words of the President will not be followed by  misguided and enabling actions by Congress.   Today, I speak on behalf of the world's poorest countries and their  people. Today, I stand with Africa, and I urge my colleagues to oppose  this legislation and its misguided, cynical approach to  multilateralism.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation as a  signal to the world that Trump doctrine is not the American doctrine or  a broader sign of American unreliability and indifference.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a moment to tell you what is being  said about us from some of these countries and around the world.   From Haiti, Trump comments saying that they were ``based on  stereotypes.''   ``In the spirit of the people of Haiti, we feel in the statements, if  they were made, the President was either misinformed or miseducated  about Haiti and its people.''   From Laurent Lamothe, the former Haitian Prime Minister: ``It shows a  lack of respect,'' he says, ``and ignorance never seen before in the  recent history of the U.S. by any President.''   Let's see what Jessie Duarte, Deputy Secretary General of the African  National Congress, has to say. He said, ``Ours is not a s----hole  country, neither is Haiti or any other country in distress.''   From the Government of El Salvador: ``We have addressed a note of  protest to the Government of the United States highlighting in this  document also the high value of Salvadorans.''   From Salvador Sanchez, President of El Salvador:         The statement by the President of the United States hits       the dignity of the Salvadoran people. El Salvador demands       within the framework of the principles governing relations       among states respect for the dignity of their noble and       courageous people.    Hugo Martinez, El Salvador's Foreign Minister, said:   ``It's always been a foreign policy priority of our government to  fight for the respect and dignity of our countrymen independent of the  immigration status.   ``Our countrymen are hardworking people who are always contributing  to the countries where they are living and, of course, also to our  country.''   And according to the State Department, Senegal also summoned the U.S.  Ambassador for an explanation. And so Macky Sall, President of Senegal,  said: ``I am shocked by the words of President Trump on Haiti and  Africa. I reject them and condemn them vigorously. Africa and the Black  race deserves the respect and consideration of all.''   And then there is John Mahama, former President of Ghana. He said:  ``Africans and Haitians come from s----hole countries? Isn't Trump  demonstrating that he is nothing but a racist and pursuing a policy of  `Make America White Again'? I congratulate Botswana for showing the  way. Our AU Presidents must respond strongly to this insult.''   I could go on and on about comments that are coming from our friends  and  [[Page H448]]  our allies. Some of them may be poor countries but who have had respect  for us in the past and who have stood with us in times of adversity.   I absolutely know that this country has demonstrated, time and time  again, that we are humanitarians, that we understand the importance of  giving support to the poorest countries in this world, and they  appreciate us so much. They honor us, they have respected us, and they  have done everything to show that they will stand with us when they  need us to do that.   And here we are at a time when we are willing to put them at risk  with a piece of legislation where we have some Members on the opposite  side of the aisle who think they know better than the World Bank, who  think they know better than all of the Members, Democrats and  Republicans, who have worked together for years in our support of the  World Bank; in our support of giving support to the 77 poorest  countries in the world; and giving our support to the 450 million  people, many of them who are living in abject poverty, many of them who  don't know where the next meal is going to come from, and many of them  whose lives are at risk every day.   How can we, the richest country in the world, turn our nose up at  them, talk about somehow they are not credible, talk about somehow they  are all corrupt? I reject it, and I ask the Members of this Congress to  vote ``no'' on this misplaced, misguided piece of legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members that remarks in  debate may not engage in personalities toward the President, including  by repeating remarks carried elsewhere that would be improper if spoken  in the Member's own words.
