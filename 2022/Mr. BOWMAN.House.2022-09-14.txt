 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, the remnants of Hurricane Ida  came through my district, resulting in catastrophic damage to our New  York-16 community. This hurricane originated in the Gulf Coast and  arrived in New York several days later, still so strong and dangerous  that it led to the tragic death of several neighbors.   Among those killed were Fran and Ken Bailie, who were professors at  Iona College. I stand here today in their memory, and in community with  families, friends, and neighbors who lost loved ones.   Hurricane Ida brought historic levels of flooding to New York-16. The  evening the storm hit was scary and chaotic. We were not collectively  prepared for the amount of rain we received, and people watched with  shock as their homes and neighborhoods flooded. At times in the night  we got tornado warnings, followed by flood warnings, and then followed  by more tornado warnings. This is not an area of the country that is  used to these sorts of hurricanes, and I remember feeling terrified and  confused as we all tried to stay safe.   In the days that followed, instead of a joyful return to New Rochelle  High School for its students, students found themselves with a  destroyed, completely destroyed library. Congregants in Bronxville were  left with a flooded synagogue during Rosh Hashanah. The First Baptist  Church in Mamaroneck was destroyed, and congregants are still picking  up the pieces.   I visited constituents' homes and small businesses in Yonkers,  Mamaroneck, Mount Vernon, Rye, and Pelham, and the sense of despair was  palpable. People could not even travel to check in with loved ones  because the Sawmill, Bronx River Parkway, Hutch, Sprain Brook, and  Cross County Expressway were deep underwater.   Our immigrant neighbors in Mamaroneck had to reckon with the damage  to their community resource center, and the Rye YMCA was left  completely destroyed.   For thousands of neighbors, Hurricane Ida fundamentally changed their  financial well-being and housing stability. The recovery process and  trauma from that storm continues today.   In the days following, our community showed an incredible amount of  [[Page H7793]]  resilience. And as I reflect, these moments of hope and solidarity come  to the forefront of my mind. First responders ensured everyone was  safe. The Rye soccer team, Mamaroneck volleyball team, and countless  others took to the streets to support our neighbors.   Teams like the Mamaroneck Tigers volunteered with the Fuller Center  for Housing of Greater New York City to help members of the First  Baptist Church remove pews that mothers would pray on and the hymnal  books that contained songs of strength and power.   Organizations like the Red Cross and Feeding Westchester provided  food to those in need. The incredible mayors, managers, councilmembers,  trustees, and community leaders in the Bronx, Ardsley, Bronxville,  Eastchester, Greenburgh, Hastings-on-Hudson, Larchmont, Mamaroneck,  Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Rye, Scarsdale, and  Tuckahoe, mobilized emergency resources to keep people safe.   We worked alongside County Executive Latimer, Bronx Borough President  Diaz, Jr., and Governor Hochul to expedite damage assessments. These  efforts led to President Biden declaring a state of emergency in New  York and the allocation of much-needed FEMA resources. From there, we  helped constituents with FEMA applications and hosted multiple visits  with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to plan long-term recovery.   Let me be clear: The climate crisis is here, and it is real, and I  refuse to let my district bear the brunt of inaction. We have worked to  secure flood mitigation funds, advance flood prevention studies in  Westchester County, and vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which  will help make our communities resilient and kick-start the clean  energy revolution that we need. But more needs to be done.   As a father and former educator, I am deeply concerned about the  impact that increased flooding will have on our children. That is why I  introduced my Green New Deal for Public Schools to ensure our school  buildings are resilient and that students can thrive.   As we mark this anniversary of Hurricane Ida, let's continue to  recommit to supporting one another, to healing our communities, to  confronting the climate crisis head on, and to ensuring that no one  gets left behind.                            ____________________
