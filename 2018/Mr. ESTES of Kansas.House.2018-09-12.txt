 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I want to begin tonight by offering  thoughts and prayers to the communities in the path of Hurricane  Florence. My home State of Kansas is no stranger to natural disasters,  and we are standing with those who will be impacted in the coming days.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about how we are all better off now.  There has been a lot of talk lately about our country's economic  recovery. Some of the debate recently has centered around when it  started versus how it started. But really, it indicates one thing is  real clear, that after years of stagnation, high unemployment, low wage  growth, today, there is no denying that America is better off now than  we were 2 years ago.   Tax reform and getting government out of the way has helped fuel this  economic recovery. For 8 long years, we had an administration working  against business growth. Now America has a President and Congress  working to grow the economy.   In addition to our economy, progrowth policies have been championed  that allow veterans, our Armed Forces, families, and small businesses  in every sector and in every community to be better off now.   During this Special Order, I look forward to highlighting all the  exciting things happening in my district in Kansas and around the  country that are returning America to a place of strength, security,  and prosperity.   Throughout the August district work period, I traveled my district  discussing how Kansans are better off now thanks to legislation that  enhances our economy, secures our community, and strengthens our  military.   During the past month, I met with multitudes of small businesses and  groups, some of which include: the Wichita Regional Chamber of  Commerce; touring a wind farm in Pratt County; meeting with  constituents at Dave's Pizza in Coldwater; learning about services  provided at Medicine Lodge Memorial Hospital; meeting with constituents  at Hibbard's Prescription Plus in Medicine Lodge; hosted a town hall  for veterans; participated in a roundtable with the Realtors of south  central Kansas; celebrated the ribbon cutting of two low-income housing  projects in Wichita, one specifically designated for veterans; met with  constituents at Tiger Town Pizza in St. John; toured the Golden Belt  Feeders in Stafford County; met with constituents at Carr Auto-Electric  in Larned; visited the Offerle Co-op; spent a day in Greensburg at the  Big Well Museum, the school, the senior center, the art studio, and the  media center; discussed the farm bill and several other issues related  to our agriculture community as I went to several county farm bureau  meetings; spoke at the West Wichita Sunrise Rotary Club; and toured the  Textron Aviation manufacturing facility.   I travel home to Kansas every week and during the district work  period to hear from constituents. Even though there is more work to do,  my latest district work period made it clear, as I spent time in the  district, that individuals, families, and small businesses across our  State and country are better off now.   From our economy standpoint, the numbers really speak for themselves.  The unemployment rate is near an 18-year low at 3.9 percent. Youth  unemployment is at the lowest level in 52 years. Female unemployment is  at the lowest level in 65 years. Black and Hispanic unemployment rates  are the second lowest ever recorded. Veterans recently hit the lowest  unemployment in 20 years.   Last quarter, our economy grew at 4.2 percent. For perspective on  that, during President Obama's term, the economy only grew at an  average of 1.9 percent.  [[Page H8165]]                                     time  2000    Last month, wages grew at the fastest rate in 9 years; consumer  confidence in our economy is the highest since October 2000; and just  yesterday, small business optimism surged to the highest level ever  recorded, passing the record that was set during President Reagan's  Presidency. Jobless claims are at the lowest rate since December 6,  1969, and this summer, the U.S. had more job openings than job seekers  for the first time in history.   These numbers are great news for the millions of families across  America, but these numbers didn't happen by accident. I look forward to  further discussion tonight about how we are working every day to make  America better off now.   At this time, I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Black).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas,  appreciate all of that information, talking about the positive impact  that is happening all across America with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   When we talk about are you really better off now, the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act is one of those great examples of something that has been  accomplished over the last 2 years.   The act itself just helped jump-start our economy. It repealed the  ObamaCare individual mandate penalty. The standard deduction was nearly  doubled, up to $12,000 for single filers, to $18,000 for a head of  household, and to $24,000 for joint filers.   The child tax credit for families was doubled from $1,000 to $2,000,  and individual along with business tax rates were cut across the board  for every tax bracket. That means this year a middle-class family of  four in Kansas will keep an extra $2,100 of their hard-earned money in  their pocket, money they can use, save for their retirement, save for  their children's college education, or maybe go out for a dinner and a  movie.   The law also cut corporate rates from 35 percent, which was the  fourth highest rate in the world and the highest amongst the developed  world, to a competitive 21 percent, encouraging businesses to expand  and to reinvest in America again. So far, more than 700 companies  around the country have done just that, benefiting millions of  hardworking families with bonuses, higher wages, and better benefits.   In Kansas, 24 businesses with more than 700 locations statewide have  [[Page H8166]]  boosted wages and benefits for tens of thousands of employees.                                time  2015    During the August work period, I was able to visit with employees at  some of those companies, including Legacy Bank. Legacy Bank is a  community-based bank based in Colwich, Kansas, with roots dating back  to 1885. Today, Legacy Bank operates eight branches throughout my  district and has 81 employees.   In July, Legacy Bank became one of the latest companies in my  district to announce a midyear bonus of up to $1,000 per employee.   In August, I met with employees and the board of directors, who told  me the bonuses would not have been possible without the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act.   Also, last month I met with workers from Textron Aviation Facilities  in Wichita. In an earlier meeting, Textron officials had said the tax  reforms of 2017 have strengthened the environment for aircraft sales in  the United States and the outlook remains positive. Textron now has the  largest backlog of orders in 8 years, supporting thousands of jobs in  our community, which we proudly call the air capital of the world.   Our district is also home to the largest tax cut bonus in the  country. After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed, Wichita Railway  Systems, a railroad car parts supplier, turned their tax cut into  $3,000 to $6,000 bonuses for its employees. The Wichita Business  Journal reported that these bonuses would have otherwise gone toward  corporate income tax and on to the government.   During a visit there, the CEO of the small manufacturing company said  employees receiving the bonus would turn right around and invest in the  economy, showing how these bonuses not only benefit the workers and  their families, but also the entire community.   Other employees who are better off now thanks to the tax cuts include  Fidelity Bank, which announced $1,500 bonuses for its 400 Wichita area  employees. Cox Communications announced $1,000 to $2,000 bonuses for  their 900 area employees. Mahaney Roofing in Wichita has been able to  hire more employees thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And Wichita's  largest employer, Spirit AeroSystems, announced new investments in  technology and training to help the rising demand in 2018.   These numbers show the economic growth and optimism happening in my  State and around the country because of tax reform. And, more  importantly, behind each statistic are people who are finally better  off now.   Recently, my colleague Representative Brad Wenstrup from Ohio pointed  out that the critics who proclaim that tax cuts only help billionaires  could not be further from the truth. Over $1.1 trillion in tax relief,  or 77 percent of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, goes directly to families  and small businesses. Over one-half of the 2019 individual tax cuts, or  $133 billion, go to those earning under $200,000.   Middle-income families see larger percentage reductions in their  taxes than wealthier families. A typical married couple with two kids  earning $73,000 would see a tax cut of over $2,000, a reduction in  their income taxes of nearly 60 percent.   The bill didn't just help the rich. Under the new tax law, the share  of taxes paid by millionaires actually increases from 19.3 percent to  19.8 percent.   Also, when American companies are doing well, workers do well. Just  ask one of the 4 million workers who saw a benefit or pay raise due to  the tax reform.   I would also like to point out that companies who had previously  stashed money abroad are bringing it back to the United States thanks  to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our Tax Code penalized companies that did  successfully operate overseas, and we wanted to tax them. Our Tax Code  wanted to tax them a second time for them to bring their money back  home. So, typically, these companies would only bring about $50 billion  in earnings abroad every quarter. In the first 3 months of this year,  they brought $158 billion back to the U.S. According to Bloomberg, that  is the biggest reversal on record since 1946.   In addition, dividends received from abroad totaled $340 billion in  the first 3 months of 2018, which is also a record. This money can be  put to work in the United States either investing in a new plant,  paying for bonuses or salary increases, paying dividends, or buying  back stock. But at the end of the day, America is richer because of it,  and we are all better off now.   Families from the heartland and throughout our country are also  better off thanks to lower utility rates that are a direct result of  the tax reform: expanded family savings programs for education and  retirement; in efforts to reduce crime in our communities, including  human trafficking. We have also invested $2 billion to address school  safety and mental health issues. A new Career and Technical Education  Act for the 21st Century is allowing more students to pursue career and  technical programs at institutions like Wichita State University Tech.   One of the things that I am seeing as I travel across the district is  that we have a drastic shortage of an educated workforce to help fill  these jobs, and we wanted to make sure that, in utilizing the Career  and Technical Education Act, we get more people to be supplied as  welders, auto mechanics, airplane mechanics, electronics technicians,  and sheet metal workers.   Provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also help promote rural  broadband expansion. Last month, I visited with Butler Rural Electric  Co-Op, which said they are now able to provide faster internet to  residents in rural parts of my district.   In June, the House passed a package of 58 bills to combat the opioid  epidemic. This was the most significant effort by Congress against a  single drug crisis in history, as we have invested $4 billion to  address this epidemic.   Just to talk a little bit about that epidemic, in 2016, 313 people  died from an opioid overdose in Kansas, leaving thousands of family  members and friends to cope with the loss. In 2018, more than 2 million  Americans will suffer from an opioid addiction.   In June, when the House passed the 58 bills, we wanted to focus on  this being the most significant effort by Congress to make sure that  this drug crisis is addressed and resolved. Last year's spending bill  that spends the $4 billion to address this epidemic is being used to  help law enforcement efforts, funding new treatment and prevention  efforts and increasing inspection and surveillance to stop the flow of  drugs into our country.    Human trafficking has become a major problem across the country. This  year, House Republicans have passed dozens of bills to fight human  trafficking, including the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act, the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign  Authorization Act, the No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act, and the  Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, which have been  signed into law. As a result, online advertising for commercial sex  trafficking has gone down by 60 to 80 percent.   In another area, in May, Congress sent the Trickett Wendler, Frank  Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2018  to President Trump. As Speaker Ryan said, terminally ill patients and  their loved ones deserve the opportunity, wherever possible, to take  advantage of an offer that may provide them a chance for a longer life.   For patients who may not qualify for certain trials or who have tried  other options of approved medication, this bill would allow them access  to experimental treatments and therapies. After all, it should be their  choice of what they do, to help them have that opportunity and the  right to try.   The good news doesn't stop with our economy and with our families.  Veterans and our armed services have been a priority in this Congress.   This year Congress passed the VA MISSION Act, which revolutionizes  healthcare for veterans by streamlining services and ensuring veterans  get the care they deserve from the VA or from their private doctor  closer to home.   This is the biggest improvement in veterans healthcare in 5 years and  will build on the Choice Act to fulfill our promise to veterans by  allocating $5.2 billion to pay healthcare costs through the Veterans  Choice Fund, expanding eligibility in the VA's caregiver program, and  improving healthcare delivery, including telemedicine, mental  [[Page H8167]]  health support, peer-to-peer support, and mobile deployment teams for  rural and underserved veterans for routine and specialized care.   Also for veterans, the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act that  we passed in Congress is helping establish affordable housing  communities for senior citizens and veterans, like the two that  recently opened in my district. Last month, I was able to join one of  those communities specifically designed for veterans for the ribbon- cutting ceremony.   One veteran who participated told local media:         This is a miracle right here. God has done a lot of       miracles in my life. This is one of the top ones.    Since President Trump signed the VA MISSION Act on June 6, 2018,  which happens to be D-day, it has helped revolutionize healthcare for  veterans by making sure that they get the options, the choices, and the  right to the care that they so richly deserve.   We have also focused on: How do we help our Active-Duty military  servicemembers?   We passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which invests $700  billion in rebuilding our military. It provides our troops the largest  pay raise in 9 years. It supports more aircraft, like the KC-46 tankers  from McConnell Air Force Base in my district. It shot down an increase  of fees in TRICARE for retirees. It allows former prisoners of war,  Medal of Honor winners, and service-connected disability veterans to  access the commissaries starting in 2020.   A sad note: There are 22 veterans a day who commit suicide. What we  have done is, as Congress, passed five comprehensive bills to address  this epidemic:   House Amendment 769 appropriates no less than $225 million for VA  mental health and suicide prevention programs;   H.R. 4635 directs the VA to emphasize peer support counselors for  female veterans who, among other things, are also at risk of suicide;   H.R. 4173 directs the VA to conduct studies on outcomes and efficacy  of the Veterans Crisis Line and report to Congress the results;   H.R. 2345 requires the FCC to coordinate with HHS and the VA in  studying the feasibility of designing a three-digit dialing code for a  national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system;  and   H.R. 918 directs the VA to furnish former members of the Armed Forces  an initial mental health assessment and mental healthcare services  required to treat urgent mental healthcare needs, including the risk of  suicide or harm to others.   There are many things that we have accomplished. There are still more  things to do.   This week, we are going to vote to give the VA the largest dollar  amount in history, which includes:   $206 million for suicide prevention outreach, for a total of $8.6  billion for mental healthcare programs;   $192 million for the inspector general, $25 million above fiscal year  2018, to provide the resources needed to investigate the overwhelming  number of allegations being reported with regard to waste, claims  processing backlogs, and general accountability;   Fully funds family housing at $1.6 billion, $173 million above the  fiscal year 2018 enacted levels for the families of those who serve;  and   $1.8 billion to homeless veterans programs.   Overall, there are just so many positive things that have been  accomplished over the last 2 years when we look at are we all better  off now.   I have talked a lot about some of the impacts of the various bills  that we have passed, some of the benefits that affect people in my  district and people in the State of Kansas.   I have here a list numerous companies throughout the State that have  taken advantage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am going to read  just a few of those and a brief description of what they did.                                time  2030    The Lawrence Paper Company in Lawrence, Kansas, gave $500 bonuses for  all 300 employees and spent $5 million for new equipment and expansion  at all three locations.   Spirit AeroSystems increased investment in training and technology.   Westar Energy filed a request before the Kansas Corporation  Commission to reflect that its electric rates ought to be reduced by  the full amount of tax savings from the change in the Federal tax law.   AT&T offered $1,000 bonuses for 1,500 Kansas employees.   Walmart employees at 75 different Walmart stores throughout the State  received tax reform bonuses, wage increases, and expanded maternity and  paternity leave.   Best Buy, which has 12 locations in Kansas, offered $1,000 bonuses to  their full-time employees and $500 bonuses to part-time employees.   And even small businesses like Taco John's, which has 19 locations in  Kansas, all full-time and part-time crew members received a $200 after- tax bonus.   Other companies that offered benefits--may not run the normal thought  of what you think about--but companies like Waste Management  Incorporated, which has multiple locations in Kansas, paid $2,000  bonuses.   I have a myriad of other companies that have taken advantage of the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that we have implemented, and reflect that not  only are they, as companies, better off now, but their employees are  better off now, as well.   In closing, altogether these actions have encouraged rapid growth in  our economy, security for our families, and support for our veterans  and military. Don't get me wrong. There is more to do.   Healthcare premiums increased $4,400 per family from 2010 to 2016. We  still have too many veterans needing healthcare and jobs. There is more  to do to help small businesses grow, help families save for college or  retirement, and support our farmers and our manufacturers.   In the coming weeks, I am glad we will debate tax reform 2.0 to  unleash another round of economic growth by protecting middle-class  individuals and small business tax cuts from going up in the future,  expanding educational and retirement savings options, and supporting  entrepreneurs.   But today, I am proud of what we have accomplished thus far because  of businesses like BG Products, Inc., based in Wichita, Kansas. The  automotive maintenance supply manufacturer was established in 1971 by a  group of World War II veterans and automotive industry experts. Over  time, BG Products, grew from an idea to an industry leader. Its  products manufactured in our community are used and sold in all 50  States, in more than 60 countries, by more than 40,000 shops,  dealerships, and technicians.   However, 2 years ago, BG Products was at a crossroads, determining  whether or not to expand based on the economy and the climate of  government regulations. Following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, BG  Products was able to push forward with plans to expand, putting new tax  savings directly toward new building projects and jobs.   In July, BG Products represented Kansas in an event honoring products  that are made in America. Following their White House appearance, I  visited employees at BG Products and toured their 400,000-square-foot  manufacturing facility in El Dorado where we discussed their plans to  expand. Finally, on August 24, BG Products broke ground on a 145,000- square-foot edition in El Dorado, investing $24.5 million in our  community and adding 21 new jobs.   This kind of expansion would not have been possible without our  growing economy. Like BG Products, Inc., today our economy and our  country is strong and is better off now.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of my fellow Representatives  who supported the various bills that we have passed over the last 2  years to help make my district, my State of Kansas, and my country  stronger and better off now.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who spoke  on the bill today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
