 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 957, the Dispose of Unused  Medications and Prescription Opioids Act, or the DUMP Opioids Act.   Last year, Congress passed legislation that would allow veterans to  dispose of excess prescription medications at VA medical facilities.  The DUMP Opioids Act would allow nonveterans to do the same thing. It  would also authorize a VA education campaign to make veterans and  nonveterans alike aware of their ability to dispose of leftover  medication at the VA.   This bill is sponsored in the Senate by Senator Kennedy and in the  House by Congresswoman Miller-Meeks. I am grateful to both of them for  their leadership and advocacy on this important issue.   Earlier this month, CDC released data showing that opioid overdose  deaths surged throughout the pandemic. In 2020, more than 93,000  Americans died of an overdose. This is an almost 30 percent increase  from 2019.   We have to do everything we can to help those suffering from  substance abuse disorder to overcome their addiction. One way we can do  this is by making controlled substances less readily available. By  making it easier for unused opioids and other prescription medication  to be disposed of, this bill would help do that.   I hope that every Member will join me in supporting the DUMP Opioids  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3884]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa  (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill  as well, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1910, the Major Medical  Facility Authorization Act of 2021.   This bill would authorize the VA's major medical facilities  construction projects in California, Washington, New York, and Texas.  Those projects include outpatient clinics, a specialty care building, a  spinal cord injury center, two community living centers, and more.   These projects are formally requested by the VA in the most recent  budget submission. They would benefit hundreds, if not thousands, of  veterans.   This bill is sponsored by Senator Jon Tester, chairman of the Senate  Veterans' Affairs Committee. I thank him for introducing it, and I urge  my colleagues to join me in supporting it today.   The VA healthcare system has a massive capital assets profile. It is  comprised of medical facilities that are, on average, more than five  times older than private-sector medical facilities.   In 2018, Congress passed the Asset and Infrastructure Review Act, or  the AIR Act, to bring the VA healthcare system into the 21st century.  It would lay the foundation to modernize the VA medical facilities to  better serve the veterans.   I am proud to support this bill to help deliver updated medical  facilities to the veterans in these four States, but we have much more  to do to deliver modern medical care to our veterans across this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can pass this bill today and then  continue working together to ensure the AIR Act lives up to the immense  promises that it has for the veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
