 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to introduce my  first piece of legislation, the JUST Act.   When the United States Department of Agriculture was established by  President Lincoln in 1862, it reflected a recognition of the strategic  importance of agriculture in the Nation's development. It aimed to  address the needs of farmers, promote scientific advancements in  agriculture, and contribute to rural development. However, racism  perpetuated by the rules and the laws of Jim Crow remained strong.   This was in the early years of the Civil War. Sixty-one years later,  we remember in 1923 the massacre, the removal of Black, prosperous  farmers in Rosewood, Florida, where Black farmers were taken off of  their land.   In the 1920s, 30 percent of America's families lived in rural America  on farmlands. The USDA was created to provide a safety net for  America's farmers, ranchers, and growers, which included assistance for  struggling industries, disaster assistance, crop insurance, technical  assistance, access to credit, and help for producers to implement  conservation practices.   For decades, the USDA has had an unfortunate and checkered history  regarding civil rights, manifesting most notably in discriminatory  lending practices, unequal program access, civil rights violations,  land loss, and  [[Page H5995]]  limited representation. Reports dating back to the 1960s have found  discrimination at the USDA in both program delivery and the treatment  of its employees of African-American descent.   Today, USDA continues to be the subject of a number of lawsuits  brought by minority farmers and ranchers alleging discrimination. This  reputation is so pervasive that the USDA has been called the last  plantation on numerous occasions.   When Secretary Tom Vilsack began his tenure as Secretary of  Agriculture in 2009, he promised a new era of civil rights at the USDA.  I applaud him for his recognition, honesty, candor, and willingness to  confront a very hard truth, not fixing the blame but trying to fix the  problem to make sure that America's agricultural access, resources, and  industry would be open to all.   At that time, there were over 14,000 unresolved discrimination  complaints in the Department of Agriculture. The discrimination  perpetuated through USDA's farm lending programs, undermining Black  farmers' ability to continue their operations during the 20th century,  resulting in over 900,000 Black farmers losing their lands from the  people who were originally the custodians of this land, African  Americans who had been kidnapped, captured, and enslaved and who made  cotton king. When they had the opportunity to farm, the USDA had turned  their back on these family farmers.    Between 1920 and 1997, African-American farmers had declined by 98  percent because of government policy. Right here, down Pennsylvania  Avenue, in 1925, we remember when the Ku Klux Klan was a mainstream  organization. We remember that when President Harding died in Indiana,  there was a Klan rally at the fairgrounds commemorating his death. That  ghost still lingered on.   Contemporary data shows that African Americans still account for only  1.4 percent of the country's 3.4 million producers. Equity issues  remain in program delivery to this very day.   An NPR analysis most recently found that, in 2022, only 36 percent of  Black farmers received direct loans from USDA while their White  counterparts received 72 percent loan acceptance. Perhaps some of the  biggest gaps in the loan demographics can also be seen in the rejection  numbers, where 16 percent of Black farmers are rejected. The highest  corresponding figure for White farmers was 4 percent. Forty-eight  percent of Black farmers withdrew their applications in frustration,  and that number corresponds with Asian Americans, compared to only 24  percent of those identifying as Caucasian.                                time  1115    While efforts are underway to address this current crisis through the  Inflation Reduction Act, and other measures, there must be a process in  place to clarify and bolster civil rights protections at the USDA.   The Just USDA Standards and Transparency Act of 2023, 100 years after  Rosewood, would correct this.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak on my  amendment, amendment No. 12 to H.R. 5961, the No Funds for Iranian  Terrorism Act.   My amendment is simple. It adds a 5-year sunset provision. My  amendment is in line with the majority leader's floor protocols for the  118th Congress. Specifically, the majority leader's floor protocols on  legislation call for sunset requirements to advance the policies  ``originally outlined in the Pledge to America to adopt a requirement  that programs end or `sunset' by a date certain.'' That should include  new sanction authorities, as well.   It is important for Congress to maintain its Article I powers over  foreign policy, and it does that by including a sunset provision. If we  are going to be consistent with the floor protocols that the majority  has established for new programs, if we want to reclaim our Article I  powers, this act should not go into force without a sunset provision.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Meeks), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
