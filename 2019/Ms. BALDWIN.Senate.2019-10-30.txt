 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator Mark  Warner and the entire Senate Democratic caucus to force a vote on his  resolution to protect Americans with preexisting health conditions and  stop the Trump administration from using American taxpayer dollars to  promote junk insurance plans that don't even have to cover people who  have preexisting health conditions.   The difference between the two sides of the aisle here is really  clear. The Senate Republicans have worked with President Trump to pass  repeal plans that would take people's healthcare away and allow  insurance companies to charge more for people with preexisting health  conditions.   When their effort failed legislatively, instead of working in a  bipartisan way to lower healthcare costs for working families,  President Trump and his administration spent 2 years working to  sabotage our healthcare system. The Trump administration's sabotage has  made it harder for people to sign up for quality, affordable coverage,  and there are more Americans who are uninsured today than when  President Trump took office.   The Trump administration is even in court to support a lawsuit to  overturn the Affordable Care Act completely, which will take away  guaranteed health protections and raise costs for Americans with  preexisting health conditions. If they succeed, insurance companies  will again be able to deny coverage or charge higher premiums for  nearly 130 million Americans who have preexisting health conditions.   Meanwhile, this administration has expanded what we call junk  insurance plans. These are plans that can deny coverage to people with  preexisting health conditions and don't have to cover essential  services like prescription drugs, emergency room visits, and maternity  care.   I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to think about this  for a moment. President Trump supports overturning the law that  provides protections for people with preexisting health conditions  while he expands these junk plans that don't provide those protections.  This is what the Senate Republicans support. This is their plan.   Last year, we forced a vote on my legislation to block President  Trump's expansion of junk insurance plans that don't have to cover  people with preexisting health conditions. The final vote tally was 50  to 50, with the entire Senate Democratic Caucus and one  [[Page S6267]]  Senate Republican voting in support of my legislation. Those who say  they support healthcare coverage for people with preexisting health  conditions should support the No Junk Plans Act. Today, I want to take  another vote.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration  of S. 1556 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, obviously, I am disappointed with the  objection.   I would point out that these junk plans are often called short-term  plans, but the change that was made by this administration was to go  from a 3-month sort of transition plan that, as my colleague indicates,  could be used when one changes employment or other short-term use, and  now they are available and renewable for up to 3 years. These plans do  not preserve the protections under the Affordable Care Act to cover  people with preexisting health conditions and essential health  benefits.   You don't have to take my word for it. We can read directly from the  fine print on the actual plans that are being debated.   One of these junk plans from Companion Life, which is currently  available in my home State of Wisconsin, reads: ``This plan has a pre- existing limitation provision that may prevent coverage from applying  to medical conditions that existed prior to this plan effective date.''   Another junk plan from Golden Rule says that the plan doesn't comply  with the guaranteed essential benefits provided by the Affordable Care  Act.    To quote directly from the plan, the description reads: ``Even if you  have had prior Golden Rule coverage and your preexisting conditions  were covered under that plan, they will not be covered under this  plan.''   It is abundantly clear that these plans don't cover protections for  people with preexisting conditions.   The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take away  people's healthcare. I want to protect the guaranteed healthcare  coverage that millions of Americans depend on. I want to help more  families get the quality, affordable healthcare they need.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1905    Despite the sabotage that I have described from this administration  against the Affordable Care Act, in Wisconsin this year, things are  getting better with the new Governor. Thanks to strong leadership from  Governor Evers and the investments his administration is making,  Wisconsinites will have more choices and more affordable rates for  quality health insurance plans this year. Wisconsinites in every corner  of the State will be able to find healthcare plans this year that  include essential benefits like prescription drug coverage, maternity  care, emergency room visits, and mental healthcare at more affordable  prices.   Governor Evers is providing funding for more health insurance  navigators and is conducting awareness campaigns in the State so that  families in Wisconsin will have the information they need to sign up  for quality and comprehensive healthcare plans. That is why enrollment  navigators are so important. We need to keep up the funding for  navigator programs so that more people can find affordable healthcare  plans that meet their needs. Navigators help millions of Americans,  including those in rural communities, sign up for quality healthcare  coverage.   The Governor of Wisconsin understands the importance of navigators,  but Washington has failed to step up. Unfortunately, since President  Trump took office, his administration has slashed Federal funding for  the navigator program by 84 percent. Trusted navigator programs, like  those in Wisconsin, have had their funding cut by nearly 75 percent  since 2017, meaning fewer people in Wisconsin have received the support  they need to obtain affordable coverage.   That is why I introduced the ENROLL Act this year with my good friend  from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey. This bill restores funding for the  navigator program and helps to ensure that Americans have better access  to the affordable healthcare coverage that they need and want. The  ENROLL Act passed the House of Representatives earlier this year. We  should also pass it in the Senate so that Americans can more easily  enroll in quality healthcare coverage.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration  of S. 1905 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am disappointed to see my Republican  colleague again object to the legislation that will help more Americans  access quality, private health insurance, Medicaid, or the Children's  Health Insurance Program. This is especially harmful to families in  rural communities who already lack access to in-person assistance for  shopping and enrolling in quality, affordable health insurance  coverage.   So let me lay plain for everyone what we are seeing here from the  Republicans and this administration.   Today, the Republicans objected to passing my ENROLL Act, which would  provide funding for healthcare enrollment assistance to help people  find high-quality, affordable plans that would actually meet their  healthcare needs.   Today, the Republicans objected to passing my legislation to stop the  expansion of junk insurance plans that don't even have to cover people  with preexisting health conditions.   The Republicans are working to make it harder for one to sign up for  high-quality, affordable healthcare.   This administration is encouraging Americans to buy junk insurance  plans that don't provide the health coverage  [[Page S6268]]  that they need and that can deny coverage to people who have  preexisting health conditions.   Finally, the Republicans and the Trump administration are supporting  a lawsuit that would overturn the entire Affordable Care Act and take  healthcare away from literally millions of American families.   The choice for the American people could not be clearer. I am working  with my Democratic colleagues to help make things better for the  American people. Sadly, the Senate Republicans are helping the Trump  administration make things worse. I will not give up this fight.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
