 Madam Speaker, I rise during this week to celebrate  school choice.   Americans lose their freedom when parents aren't allowed to decide on  their own where to send their children to school. A one-size-fits-all  approach doesn't encourage growth for the next generation of Americans.   In March, the Supreme Court will be hearing oral arguments for the  case of Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. The Court's decision  could have important ramifications for public funding of private and  public schools.   In my district, I am proud of the work being done by Steve and Joyce  Schuck, champions of the school choice movement in Colorado. Steven  Woodford is also doing great work for the homeschool communities of  Colorado.   These key leaders in our community are enabling students to have  educational opportunities they wouldn't otherwise have.   Colorado is making great strides in the school choice movement, and I  am proud to represent both the community leaders who facilitate it and  the talented students of this generation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  to provide for a motion to recommit on the Senate amendment to H.R. 550  so that minority voices can be heard on the critical issue of war.
