 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Colonel Anthony  Polashek on his retirement from the U.S. Air Force after 32 years of  service.   Colonel Polashek graduated from Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, an  officer training school, before commissioning into the Air Force.   During his long career, Colonel Polashek's deployments included  Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom  and Enduring Freedom. By the end of his distinguished career, he logged  more than 5,800 flight hours as a command pilot, more than 500 of which  were in combat.   Since 2016, Colonel Polashek has served as commander of the 934th  Airlift Wing, located at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport Air  Reserve Station, overseeing 12 squadrons with more than 1,400 airmen.   Minnesota has been fortunate to have such an accomplished member of  our Nation's Armed Forces lead the charge and train our airmen and - women of tomorrow.   Again, we congratulate Colonel Polashek on his retirement, and we  wish him the best as he moves to his next chapter.   Recognizing Nancy Libersky's Lifetime of Service to the Small Business                                 Community     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Small Business  Administration's Minnesota district director, Nancy Libersky, on her  retirement.   District Director Libersky has served our great State of Minnesota  for 28 years. She will be missed.   Nancy's time at the SBA in Minnesota began in 1994 as the regional  manager for SBA's Twin City's international trade programs. In this  capacity, Nancy helped hundreds of Minnesota businesses compete in the  global marketplace.   At the same time, Nancy also served as an adjunct instructor at Saint  Paul College and was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to sit  on the Minnesota District Export Council.   Mr. Speaker, we thank Nancy for almost three decades of service to  Small Business Minnesota, and we wish her the best in her retirement.      The Wall Family, Minnesota Family Business Award of 2019 Recipient     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Wall family  of Highland Bank in St. Michael, Minnesota, for receiving the 2019  Minnesota Family Business Award.   The Walls have proudly owned and operated the bank for more than four  decades, serving as a lifeline for their customers and their community.   As a small financial institution, the financial crisis took its toll  on Highland and families in and around St. Michael. Nevertheless, the  Wall family persevered and led their bank and their community during a  very difficult economic time.   The resiliency and community-focused nature of banks like Highland  are essential to helping Minnesotans  [[Page H8789]]  and Americans pursue and achieve their American Dream. Family-owned  institutions like the Highland Bank understand the needs of their  neighbors and business owners and, in turn, empower families and local  economies on Main Streets across our country.   I congratulate the Highland Bank and the Wall family on their  recognition and thank them for all they do for St. Michael and  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District.                                time  1015           Recognizing the Centennial of the Minnesota Farm Bureau     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish the Minnesota Farm  Bureau Federation a very happy 100th birthday.   For 100 years, the Minnesota Farm Bureau has been an ally and  advocate for growers, ranchers, and producers across the 87 counties in  Minnesota. Even after a century of work, the Minnesota Farm Bureau  remains the leading voice for farmers, their families, and the  agriculture community at large.   I want to give a special thanks to Minnesota Farm Bureau President  Kevin Paap and Vice President Dan Glessing, both of whom go above and  beyond to advocate for their members.   I would also like to recognize Amber Hanson Glaeser, the bureau's  director of public policy, who always keeps our office apprised of the  challenges facing our agricultural families and their community.   It has been an honor to work with everyone at the Minnesota Farm  Bureau throughout my time in Congress, and I am grateful for the  opportunity to wish them all a happy 100th birthday.    Honoring the Life of Stacy Manning and Her Legacy of Helping Families     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Stacy  Manning from Zimmerman, Minnesota.   Stacy tragically passed away earlier this year, leaving behind a  legacy of compassion and support for Minnesota families working through  the process of adoption.   Stacy and her husband, Pat, had three children of their own when they  decided to adopt three more. While working to meet the challenges that  adoption can bring with a family of six, Stacy realized that other  adoptive parents were experiencing many of the same challenges.   Stacy wanted to help, so she established Hope Connections, a support  network designed to connect with families for adoption coaching and  education.   Stacy's work touched the lives of thousands of families across this  country.   This week, Stacy's family is in Washington to honor her memory and  receive the Angels in Adoption award that Stacy earned for the work  that she believed in so deeply.   Stacy may no longer be with us, but her spirit and Hope Connections'  mission lives on through her son Andrew, who continues her legacy in  assisting those experiencing the challenges that adoption can bring.   Stacy's impact on so many Minnesotans will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
