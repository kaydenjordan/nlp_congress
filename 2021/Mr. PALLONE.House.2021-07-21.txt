 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 535, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2467) to require the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency to designate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as  hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act of  2021.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act of 2021, is a  comprehensive package of strategies to regulate PFAS chemicals, clean  up contamination, and protect public health. I am proud to support this  bipartisan bill which will deliver the tools communities across the  country need to get PFAS out of our environment and out of the pathways  that lead to our bodies.   PFAS are an urgent public health threat. They are toxic, persistent,  and  [[Page H3774]]  being found in the environment across the country.   Just how common are they?   A recent report from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease  Registry concluded that ``Most people in the United States have been  exposed to PFAS and have PFAS in their blood.'' That finding is pretty  astounding and incredibly concerning to families across the Nation.   After all, these forever chemicals have long been linked with adverse  health effects including cancer, immune system effects, infertility,  impaired child development, high cholesterol, and thyroid disease.   Industry has known about these dangers for decades, but we still have  no Federal protections from PFAS in drinking water, no limits on PFAS  air emissions, no Federal cleanup requirements on PFAS sites, and no  limits on dumping PFAS into our waterways. We don't even have labeling  of PFAS ingredients to allow consumers to protect themselves.   Right now, the Environmental Protection Agency is playing catch-up  after 4 years of little action by the Trump administration, but this  bill will help EPA tackle the complex challenge of PFAS by taking  direct action on the two most studied PFAS, PFOS and PFOA, right away,  while setting a reasonable timeline to study and evaluate other PFAS.  This approach puts the focus on following the science by tailoring  testing to relevant subgroups of PFAS and focusing regulation on the  riskiest chemicals.   Mr. Speaker, over a decade ago, PFOA and PFOS were voluntarily phased  out by industry. While no longer in use, they continue to threaten  public health because of widespread environmental contamination. This  bill will drive environmental cleanups of that contamination and  drinking water treatment, addressing the threat of PFOA and PFOS to  communities across the country.   Now, all other PFAS will be tested as appropriate. And where that  testing reveals risk, this bill will ensure that EPA takes timely  action to prevent and mitigate environmental contamination.   In the meantime, this bill will pause the introduction of untested  new PFAS while providing guidance and labels to help first responders  and consumers limit their risk.   Mr. Speaker, the longer we delay action on PFAS, the worse the  problem becomes. It is time for Congress to act and use every tool  available to stop the flow of PFAS pollution into our environment and  into our bodies.   A version of this bill was passed overwhelmingly last Congress with  significant bipartisan support. It is championed--and I can't  underestimate how much Representatives Dingell and Upton of Michigan  have worked on this bill. I commend them for their continued  leadership.   I also thank Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee Chairman  Tonko and Ranking Member McKinley for their continued support.   We can't delay any longer. We should pass this bipartisan legislation  today.   I urge my colleagues to vote for the PFAS Action Act so that we can  finally take action on these dangerous forever chemicals.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), who has done so much to protect our  environment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the chairman of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee who has always been so cooperative with us on  both this bill and so many others.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko), the chairman of the Environment and Climate Change  Subcommittee, who has worked very hard on this issue for a number of  years.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), who is the sponsor of the bill and who has  really brought our attention to this issue and prioritized it from the  very beginning.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), who chairs the House Select Committee on the  Climate Crisis.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  each side?    I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Miss  Rice), a member of our committee.   Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I can't believe I am about to  say this, but I think what I am hearing  [[Page H3780]]  from the majority of my friends on the other side of the aisle, with  the exception of my good friend Mr. Upton, is that they just want a  little more toxic chemicals in your water.   That simply cannot be true.   In my district on Long Island, we have long struggled with PFAS water  contamination, and many communities have already incurred substantial  remediation costs.   That is why I am pleased that the PFAS Action Act includes my  provision to reimburse these local communities for their past expenses.  Communities that could not wait for Federal action and redirected their  resources to address this health threat should not be punished for  doing the right thing.    This is a situation that the Federal Government has failed to address  for decades. We have the opportunity to do it now.   I want to thank my good friends, Representatives Dingell and Upton,  and the chairman of the committee for bringing this commonsense bill to  the floor. I urge my colleagues to support it.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This comprehensive bill reflects the hard work of many of my  colleagues. I want to thank some of the leaders in the House who have  made this bill possible.    Representative Dingell has led this bill for several years now, never  losing sight of the communities she represents who have been impacted  by PFAS in their environment and in their water.   The bill builds on legislation from Representative Sean Patrick  Maloney to require health effects testing on all PFAS chemicals. This  critical testing forms the basis of required decisions throughout this  package.   The legislation also sets a moratorium on new PFAS until EPA has the  science it needs to properly evaluate them and will ensure that all new  PFAS are properly reviewed before going forward. This provision was  authored and led through the committee process by Representative Kuster  and also reflects the hard work of Representative Dean.   Another essential piece of this bill builds on bipartisan legislation  from Representatives Boyle and Fitzpatrick to set a national drinking  water standard that protects public health, including the health of  pregnant women, infants, and children.   The legislation also takes important steps to address air emissions  of PFAS. It incorporates legislation from Representative Stevens to  address PFAS emissions under the Clean Air Act and legislation from  Representatives Khanna and Levin to restrict unsafe incineration of  PFAS wastes, including firefighting foam.   Next, the bill includes a provision by Representative Soto to create  a voluntarily PFAS-free label for cookware, so consumers can take steps  to protect themselves from exposure. I also thank Representative  Slotkin for her work to expand that label.   The bill includes a provision by Representative Fletcher requiring  EPA to issue guidance for first responders to both minimize the use of  PFAS in firefighting foam and turnout gear and also minimize their  risks. That provision was improved last year with input from  Representative Golden. Risks to first responders are also a very  serious concern, and I thank Representative Fletcher for her work on  that important issue.   Lastly, the bill incorporates two provisions related to the Clean  Water Act from Representatives Delgado and Pappas. Those important  provisions will protect our natural resources and stem the flow of  contamination into our waterways.   Madam Speaker, I include the following documents in the Record: A  letter from the Sierra Club; a letter from the United States Conference  of Catholic Bishops; a letter from the Coalition of NGO's; a letter  from Defense Communities; a letter from the League of Conservation  Voters; and an article from Environmental Health News titled: ``The  real story behind PFAS and Congress' effort to clean up  contamination.'' That is an op-ed.                                                    Sierra Club,                                                      July 15, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress, On behalf of our over four million       members and supporters, Sierra Club writes to express our  [[Page H3782]]       support of H.R. 2467 the PFAS Action Act of 2021. We ask that       you vote in support of this critical package and       strengthening amendments.        Communities around the United States are facing grave       threats to their drinking water and health due to Per- and       Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS). This class of chemicals is       widely used to make carpets, fabrics for furniture, Teflon       coatings for cookware, paper packaging for food and other       everyday materials. They're even used in firefighting foam       (aqueous film forming foam; AFFF) for both civilian and       military purposes.        PFAS chemicals can't be broken down in an environment and       effectively poison water sources. Right now, scientists       estimate that more than 100 million Americans are drinking       PFAS-contaminated water. This contamination is strongly       linked to cancer, immune system suppression, thyroid       problems, reproductive system damage and harming of       children's growth and development.        The PFAS Action Act takes critical steps in ensuring our       communities are protected from dangerous chemicals. There are       9 important amendments that extend important protections       against PFAS chemicals. However, two stand out as critical in       dealing with PFAS contamination. First, Rep. Andy Levin's       Amendment #8 to prohibit incineration of PFAS-based       firefighting foams. Second, Rep. Sarbanes and Fitzpatrick's       Amendment #15 which would require chemical companies to       provide the analytical standards that allow chemists to       measure new PFAS chemicals in people and the environment.        Everyone, no matter zip code, gender or race, deserves       clean drinking water and a healthy environment. We must       safeguard frontline communities from the damage of PFAS. We       need to stop emitting PFAS into the environment and protect       those populations most susceptible to chemical       contamination--like women, children and military service       members. The PFAS Action Act is an important step in that       process.        Sierra Club urges you to support the PFAS Action Act.            Sincerely,                                                     Michael Brune,      Executive Director, Sierra Club.                                   ____                                            United States Conference                                             of Catholic Bishops,                                      Washington, DC, July 19, 2021.      House of Representatives.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the United States       Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) Committee on Domestic       Justice and Human Development and Committee on Pro-Life       Activities, we write in support of the PFAS Action Act of       2021 (H.R. 2467). This bipartisan legislation aims to reduce       human and environmental exposure to toxic chemicals.        Per-fluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are       a diverse class of compounds containing thousands of       individual chemicals. Useful for non-stick and water-      repellent properties, certain PFAS have been integrated into       numerous household products. PFAS have also been employed in       firefighting foam across the United States.        PFAS are resistant to degradation and bioaccumulate in the       environment and the human body. Prolonged exposure to these       chemicals can cause cancer, thyroid problems, birth defects,       and reproductive, developmental, and immune system       disruptions. Of particular concern is a growing body of       research that indicates pregnant and nursing mothers, and       their children, are especially affected. Such exposure occurs       through polluted drinking water, food, soil, dust and the use       of consumer products manufactured using PFAS. The widespread       utilization of these ``forever chemicals'' has resulted in       significant environmental contamination.        The USCCB has consistently promoted integral human       development, where technology and human ingenuity are       directed towards the common good. Human and environmental       health concerns are interconnected, and we must not forget       that ``human life is itself a gift which must be defended       from various forms of debasement'' (Laudato Si', no. 5). The       PFAS Action Act of 2021 both upholds the dignity of human       life and preserves ecological health. It regulates PFAS,       enacts drinking water standards, and designates contaminated       sites as eligible for Superfund cleanup.        Access to safe, potable water is an indispensable human       right and government leaders have a moral responsibility to       safeguard society from poisonous chemical contaminations.       Addressing U.S. Congress in 2015, Pope Francis declared that       ``you are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your       fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the       common good.'' We pray for your efforts to protect the life       and health of mothers, the unborn, all of society, and God's       creation.            Sincerely yours,      Most Reverend Paul S. Coakley,        Archbishop of Oklahoma City, Chair, Committee on Domestic       Justice, and Human Development, United States Conference of       Catholic Bishops.      Most Reverend Joseph F. Naumann,        Archbishop of Kansas City, Chair, Committee on Pro-Life       Activities, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.                                   ____                                                      July 19, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      Minority Whip,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority Leader       McCarthy, Minority Whip Scalise and members of the House of       Representatives: On behalf of our millions of members and       supporters, the undersigned non-governmental organizations       write today to urge you to vote YES on H.R. 2467, the PFAS       Action Act.        Toxic PFAS chemicals have now been confirmed in the water       of nearly 2800 communities, including over 300 military       installations, and studies have linked PFAS to serious health       problems, including cancer. H.R. 2467 will build on the       progress made in the National Defense Authorization Act for       FY 2020 by restricting industrial releases of PFAS into our       air and water, setting a drinking water standard for PFOA and       PFOS in tap water, and by kick-starting the process of       cleaning up legacy PFAS contamination by designating PFOA and       PFOS as hazardous substances under the federal Superfund law.        The science is clear: PFAS have been linked to serious       health problems through decades of animal, worker, and human       studies. Unfortunately, EPA has failed to take steps to       restrict air and water releases, reduce PFAS in our tap       water, or clean up the nation's most contaminated sites. H.R.       2467 will set clear deadlines requiring EPA to do just that.       Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances, as       proposed by H.R. 2467, will not ban PFAS--but will instead       ensure that the most contaminated sites are finally cleaned       up.        We urge you to vote YES on H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act.

Dear Representative: Our communities host many of the       hundreds of military installations that are now contaminated       with the toxic ``forever chemicals'' known as PFAS. While       Congress has acted to end the use of firefighting foam made       with PFAS, Congress has not yet taken steps to ensure that       legacy PFAS pollution is cleaned up.        To protect our defense communities from toxic pollution, we       urge you to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances       under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Liability,       and Compensation Act. Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous       substances under CERCLA will ensure that the Defense       Department treats PFAS pollution at military installations as       a priority.        Some members of Congress have argued that designating PFOA       and PFOS as ``hazardous substances'' under CERCLA will ban       the use of these two chemicals from medical devices,       semiconductors, lithium batteries and even surgical masks.       This is not correct. First, PFOA and PFOS are no longer used       in commerce. Second, designation of a chemical as a hazardous       substance does not result in a ban of the chemical. Nearly 80       percent of the chemicals designated as hazardous substances       are still used in commerce.        CERCLA regulates the cleanup of chemicals, not the use of       chemicals. In particular, designating PFOA and PFOS as       hazardous substances under CERCLA will ensure that they are a       priority for clean up at military installations.        PFAS has been confirmed in the groundwater at more than 300       military installations where firefighting foams made with       PFAS were used, including installations in our communities.       We urge you to protect our communities from these toxic       forever chemicals by voting to designate PFOA and PFOS as       hazardous substances.

Re: Support H.R. 2467, a critical step in protecting our           health from toxic chemicals.       House of Representatives.        Dear Representative, The League of Conservation Voters       (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national       priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National       Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of       members of Congress on environmental legislation. The       Scorecard is the nationally accepted yardstick used to rate       members of Congress on environmental, public health, and       energy issues and is distributed to LCV members, concerned       voters, and the media.        LCV urges you to vote YES on H.R. 2467, the ``PFAS Action       Act of 2021,'' which would take important steps in addressing       the growing national PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl       substances) crisis threatening the health of millions of       people across the country.        PFAS are a class of chemicals used in many everyday       consumer products and industrial applications to make water       and stain repellant coatings, but communities continue to       discover that their drinking water, food, soil, and       surroundings have been contaminated with PFAS. Also called       ``forever chemicals'' in recognition of their persistence in       the environment and our bodies, PFAS have been linked to       numerous health problems like certain cancers, thyroid       disease, neurological development issues, weakened immune       systems, and more. The federal government has been slow to       take the actions necessary to protect our communities,       especially communities of color who bear a disproportionate       impact from this lack of response.        H.R. 2467 will take critical steps forward that are needed       to reduce PFAS use, clean them up, and hold polluters       accountable for the damage to our health and the environment.       The bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency       (EPA) to set a drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS       within two years, designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous air       pollutants, limit industrial discharges of PFAS into       waterways, and provide funding for water treatment.       Additionally, it would provide consumers with knowledge of       products containing PFAS by adding PFAS to the EPA's Safer       Choice Program. H.R. 2467 also would designate PFOA and PFOS       as hazardous substances and make a determination on other       PFAS within five years--key to holding polluters accountable       and ensuring that our nation's most contaminated sites are       finally cleaned up.        Again. we urge you to SUPPORT H.R. 2467, which will take       critical steps in tackling the PF AS crisis, as well as all       pro-environment amendments. We will strongly consider       including votes on this legislation in the 2021 Scorecard. If       you need more information, please contact a member of our       government relations team.            Sincerely,                                                    Gene Karpinski,      President.                                   ____   Environmental Health Sciences--The Real Story Behind PFAS and Congress'            Effort To Clean Up Contamination: Op-ed By Jim Jones         Former EPA official Jim Jones sets the record straight on       `the forever chemical' as lawmakers take up the PFAS Action       Act Jim Jones        When the U.S. House of Representatives takes up the       bipartisan PFAS Action Act this week, some members of       Congress may contend that the bill would ban some uses of       PFAS.        In particular, some members of Congress may argue that       designating PFOA and PFOS as ``hazardous substances'' under       the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Liability, and       Compensation Act, or CERCLA, will ban the use of these two       chemicals from medical devices, semiconductors, lithium       batteries and even surgical masks.        This is not correct.                    PFAS & PFOS no longer used in commerce         First, PFOA and PFOS are no longer used in commerce.        As an Assistant Administrator for the EPA, I was involved       in the implementation of a 2006 stewardship agreement with       the chemical industry to phase out the use of these two       members of this class of fluorinated chemicals. Simply put,       as a result of this agreement, PFOA and PFOS are no longer       used in these products or take make these products.                             Hazardous substance         Second, designation of a chemical as a hazardous substance       does not result in a ban of the chemical.        A quick review of EPA records reveals that nearly 80       percent of the chemicals designated as hazardous substances       by Congress since the law was passed in 1980 are still used       in commerce. That's because CERCLA does not force       manufacturers to stop using chemicals. Sulfuric acid, one of       the most widely used chemicals in commerce, has been       designated as a hazardous substance for more than 40 years.       Many other chemicals designated as hazardous substances are       used in many products, including medical devices.        CERCLA regulates the cleanup of chemicals, not the use of       chemicals. A different statute, the Toxic Substances Control       Act, or TSCA, governs the use of chemicals.                    Critical step to clean up PFAS & PFOA         Simply put, no one--not Congress, not the states, not the       EPA--is trying to ban PFOA and PFOS by statute.        So, if Congress is not trying to ban PFOA and PFOS, why       then does the bipartisan PFAS Action Act designate them as       hazardous substances?        Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances is a       critical step in efforts to accelerate the clean-up process       at contaminated sites, especially Department of Defense       installations.                       Firefighting foam contamination         PFAS has been confirmed in the groundwater at more than 300       military installations where firefighting foams made with       PFAS were used. Congress directed the DOD to end the use of       these PFAS-based foams in 2020, but efforts to clean up       legacy contamination at these bases has not yet been       undertaken.        Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances will       ensure that the DOD treats these contaminants as a priority       for cleanup.  [[Page H3784]]         That's not only reason Congress should enact the PFAS       Action Act. While EPA is now treating PFAS as a priority,       that has not always been the case. To guard against delay,       the PFAS Action Act sets deadlines for EPA to finalize a       national drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS and to       place limits on discharges of PFAS into the air and water.       The bill also sets a deadline for EPA to decide whether or       not to list other PFAS as hazardous substances.                          PFAS: Time to take action         A lot is at stake. PFAS has been detected in thousands of       drinking water systems and has been linked to serious health       problems. No wonder chemical companies and public health       groups agree that it is time to take action to address PFAS       pollution. Hopefully, members of Congress will agree as well.                              PFAS: Who to call         Editors note: The PFAS Action Act of 2021, by Rep. Debbie       Dingell, D-Mich., is set to be debated by the U.S. House of       Representatives sometime this week.        To set the record straight and voice concern that the       latest science is not being considered as lawmakers debate       effort to clean up our environment, contact Republican Reps.       Cathy McMorris Rogers and Buddy Carter.

You have heard today that this bill may not be that necessary because  the administration is already doing things, but I just point out that  the administration has sent a Statement of Administration Policy saying  why the President would sign this bill. So obviously, he feels that it  is necessary.   And this is a quote from that Statement of Administration Policy that  says, ``The administration led by the EPA is working to collaborate on  cross-cutting strategies, advanced new design, develop coordinated  policies, regulations and communications; and continue engagement with  affected States, Tribes, communities stakeholders, and H.R. 2467 would  further enhance those efforts.''   Madam Speaker, like the administration, I am proud to support this  bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.
