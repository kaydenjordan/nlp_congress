 Mr. Speaker, many of us know that the House could not  function without the professional nonpartisan personnel who ensure that  we can do our job. We do at times as an institution pause and thank  them, but now it is time for me to do it personally. I thank them for  their commitment, dedication, and their hard work.   It would be difficult to start without mentioning the Capitol Police.  They are here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. Since  my time here, some have fallen in the line of duty, others injured  protecting those placed in their care. These are only the events that I  know. I can only imagine the stories that they could tell. Thank you.   I owe thanks to the Office of the Attending Physician. This concierge  service helps us stay healthy and keeps us informed on how this job  affects our health. There have been many times when I have watched them  scramble to attend to the health needs of a Member or one of our  visitors.   In the Army we are fond of saying the Army moves on its stomach. So  does the House of Representatives. We and our guests can find food in  numerous locations. This morning, I picked up my breakfast right here  in the basement of the Capitol. Lunch, who knows, but I do not fret  that I will not be able to find something.   When we depart for the day, the cleaning crew comes in. They are long  gone by the time most of us arrive the next day.   Mail and newspapers are dropped off by couriers. Lightbulbs are  replaced. Pictures are hung up and, in my case, taken down. Photos are  taken of us and our guests in major events.   Audiovisual connectivity for Chamber and Committee activities, so the  public can observe our deliberations, is ensured. And, again, as I  observe this morning, the electronic voting system was turned on and  checked.  [[Page H5870]]    The recorder takes down every word, sometimes in the heat of a  rhetorical exchange, which eventually helps the Chamber sort out the  claims, reconcile them, and return to business.   I also want to point out the friendly faces and voices from the  Office of the Clerk of the House. Many of them are right in front of  me, Mr. Speaker. These nonpartisan employees record, file, keep in  order, track time, and help the Speaker or Speaker pro tempore identify  Members and call on them.    The wizard of the House is the Parliamentarian and his staff. I have  known four over my career. They are the keeper of the Jeffersonian  rules and precedents. Any Member who is smart and up to some trickery  best run their idea by the Parliamentarian. They will not only provide  great counsel, but will keep the discussion confidential.   My thanks go to the Office of Member Services. They processed me in  and are now processing me out. They are our office of human resources  and, as with everything, as time passes, so do your needs. I have  checked with them often over the years, and that has helped prepare for  my departure.   Also assisting me is the Office of House Ethics. The last thing I  want to do is screw something up as I walk out the door. They, too, are  24/7 and only a phone call away.   Any time you create a list, you risk forgetting someone or some  office. If I have done so, please forgive me. It has been a great ride,  and the nonpartisan professional staff who cover the everyday  activities deserve my thanks and, with that, I thank you.                            ____________________
