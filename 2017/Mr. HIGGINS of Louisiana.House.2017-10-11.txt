 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise unscripted to bring to the attention of the  entire Nation the plight of the good citizens of Louisiana who were  impacted by Hurricane Harvey last month. Beside me at this graph shows  the rainfall, the water event of Hurricane Harvey as it impacted Texas  and Louisiana.                                time  1830    As anyone can see, it was a tremendous water event, unprecedented  rainfall, that overwhelmed any water management system. And, as anyone  can see, the parishes of southwest Louisiana were impacted, as well as  many counties in Texas, yet, as we discuss disaster relief, Louisiana  is absent from our conversation. I point out, to all who would choose  to witness, the State line of Louisiana, as defined by the Sabine  River, and the impact of Hurricane Harvey.   Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey did not recognize the artificial State  boundaries that we have created as a Republic, nor should we as we  provide disaster relief for our citizens. Just after Hurricane Harvey  had impacted Texas and Louisiana, my office drafted a letter to the  executive branch to a President that I admire and respect, advising him  of the impact, and begging his expedited approval of the disaster  status once the formal request had been submitted by our Governor.   Sometime later, just 2 weeks ago, that formal request was submitted  by the Governor of our State. Just after that submission, my office  drafted and submitted a second letter requesting expedited approval of  disaster status for these citizens of Louisiana, who were clearly just  as impacted by this storm as many citizens in Texas.   Tomorrow, we shall send a third letter, this time signed by the  entire Louisiana delegation. I ask that the Nation recognize the plight  of the people I represent. The good and patriotic citizens of southwest  Louisiana are suffering.   I respect and admire my President, I support him, I have supported  him since day one, and I support him still. But it is important that  we, as representatives of we the people, communicate clearly our intent  and our service.   I beg that the leaders of the executive branch level would witness  this clear evidence of the need for disaster declaration of the  parishes of southwest Louisiana. And I beg that this message is  received with the spirit with which it is delivered, which is  respectful, yet in determined service of the citizens whom I have sworn  to represent.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding these precious moments  to me.
