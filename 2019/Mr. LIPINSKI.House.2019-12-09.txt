 Madam Speaker, today, the House passed a bipartisan  bill that Mr. Moolenaar joined me in introducing, H.R. 2051, the  Sustainable Chemistry Research and Development Act.   Chemical products are part of our everyday lives, from toothpaste, to  shampoo, cosmetics, dish soap, clothing, and  [[Page H9385]]  even Legos. Because these products are all around us, we need to  prioritize the development of chemicals that are affordable, meet our  needs, and are green, meaning that they protect our health and the  environment.   By supporting research and educational efforts in green chemistry, my  bill will ensure that American companies have the workforce and tools  they need to create safer and more environmentally friendly products,  while creating new American jobs.   H.R. 2051 is commonsense legislation that is a win for American  workers and our health and environment.   Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate to act quickly and pass this bill.                            ____________________
