 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4365, the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act, 2024.   As chair of the subcommittee last Congress, I understand fully the  difficult process required to put this bill together. That is why I  thank the minority staff here with me today, Jennifer Chartrand, Jason  Gray, Farouk Ophaso, Ben Peterson, and Mike Clark in my personal  office, and Johnnie Kaberle and the fabulous minority staff that gets  to work with the great majority staff, who work so hard for all of us.   I wish the bill before us was more focused on our job as  appropriators, on training and equipping our troops and ensuring that  our servicemembers and their families have their needs met at home.  That is why it is disappointing to see the majority use the  appropriations process and the Defense bill to push an extreme social  policy agenda.   The riders included in this bill divide. They do not unite. Here are  just a few examples.   The bill prohibits the Department of Defense's policy to ensure that  servicemembers and their families have access to leave and travel  allowances for basic reproductive healthcare. The Department's policy  is legal under Federal law. The Department of Justice has concluded  that fact: ``The Department of Defense may lawfully expend funds to pay  for servicemembers and their dependents to travel to obtain abortions  that DOD cannot itself perform due to statutory requirements.''   Why is it important that the DOD itself cannot perform due to  statutory requirements? Well, first, to be clear, I do not support the  Hyde amendment, but let me address it and what this prohibition does  even to services legal under the Hyde amendment. It prohibits the DOD  from using funds or facilities to perform an abortion except in the  cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger.  That is not in keeping with the spirit of the Hyde amendment.   What does that mean to the nearly 20 percent of our force who are  women? They do not get to choose where they serve. Eighty thousand of  those women are stationed in States that restrict reproductive  healthcare. If you serve in those States and are pregnant because of  rape or are on a base that does not offer obstetrics and gynecology  services, then you must travel. You must travel out of State for  healthcare that you are entitled to.   This bill interprets the Hyde amendment in a way that was never  intended. Many servicewomen and dependents will lose access to the  exceptions of the Hyde amendment if they are not allowed to travel to  seek the healthcare that they need.   This language, in fact, is a de facto national abortion ban, and I  believe using our servicemembers to do that is shameful. Young women  will refuse to serve. Women will exit the force because of this.  Husbands and fathers will not want to serve in States where their  families will be negatively impacted.   That is why I offered an amendment in the Committee on Rules to  strike this provision, but the majority chose not to make it in order.  I wish they had. I wish we all would have had the courage to bring this  to the floor and allow a debate that our servicemembers deserve.   The majority has also cut programs for diversity, equity, and  inclusion, which will discourage recruitment from all across America.  The private sector is embracing programs like this to keep a happy,  healthy, forceful workforce.   There is language in here that bans critical race theory, but it goes  far beyond that, Mr. Chair. In fact, the bill seeks to define what can  and cannot be taught in our military academies on whether or not  certain topics cause discomfort. This language reads like a ban on  teaching American history.   Sometimes facts are uncomfortable. As a former social studies  teacher, I want you to know, Mr. Chair, I find this outrageous.   How can our military academies tell the history of the Civil War  without teaching about slavery? That is uncomfortable.   How can they discuss the story and history of desegregation in the  military without talking about the Jim Crow laws that our Black  servicemembers had to struggle with when they returned home from war?  That is uncomfortable.   We should be celebrating that the DOD is about to be led by two  distinguished Black Americans for the first time in history, Secretary  of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General C.Q.  Brown, who is incoming to this position. Their service shows us how  building a diverse workforce can take us into a proud future.   There are provisions in this bill that are offensive to gay, lesbian,  bisexual, and transgender Americans, and that will impact who serves.  The ban on gender-affirming care will drive transgender servicemembers  out of the military.   Why, Mr. Chair, do we have an IRS provision on the tax treatment of  individuals who hold the belief that marriage is a union between one  man and one woman in this bill? It is not germane. Words matter.   Divisive riders will hurt the military, undermine readiness, and make  our national security weaker. They must come out of this legislation if  we are to gain bipartisan support for this to become law.   Now, turning to the numbers, the majority has funded this bill at  $826.4 billion, very close to the President's budget, but I am  concerned about cuts in two areas.   First, the majority has made a $714 million cut to military climate  programs and banned the assessment of climate impacts on the  Department. We know that climate change is a national security threat,  and it drives conflict. Ask our Indo-Pacific Commander. He will tell  you that climate change impacts how United States forces operate.   Our military installations also face threats from climate change  right here at home. Look at the $10 billion in damage from severe  weather events on installations, like Tyndall Air Force Base, Offutt  Air Force Base in Nebraska, and Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. This  spring alone, a typhoon seriously damaged Anderson Air Force Base in  Guam to the tune of $4 billion, and that is just the Air Force cost.    When we cut climate programs, we pay for it on the back end.   I also oppose the $1.1 billion in cuts to civilian personnel in this  bill. Ten years ago, Congress directed DOD to cut civilian personnel by  $10 billion over 5 years. We achieved no substantial savings. We  shifted the workforce from civilian employees to expensive contractors.   Mr. Chair, I have a long history of bipartisan cooperation, and I am  proud of that. I am confident that Chair Calvert and I can find a way  to get agreement in conference so that we can move the Defense spending  levels forward, but I have to say again how disappointed I am that the  majority has included these extreme social policy riders. They will  undermine the force of today, discourage building the force of  tomorrow, and leave us weaker as a nation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill at this time, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the  [[Page H4570]]  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies, which is so important to the defense of  our Nation.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Jacobs), who is on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs as well as a very important member of the Committee on Armed  Services.    As many military leaders have told us, diplomacy, defense, and  development go together. The more we don't spend in those venues, the  more bullets we have to buy.    Mr. Chair, everyone is welcome to serve in an All- Volunteer Army. We need everyone to feel that they are welcome to serve  in our All-Volunteer Army, and that sometimes means doing a little  extra outreach.   I had to do that with my military academies to let all the students  know that this was a great opportunity for them to get a great  education and serve our country.   It was outreach. It was inclusion. It reached out to diversity. It  has made our military academies stronger for that.   The bottom line for me is, if you are willing to take the oath of  office, if you are willing to put your life on the line for our  country, and you can get through boot camp and want to serve our  country, you are welcome to serve.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case),  who is a fabulous member of the Subcommittee on Defense and invaluable  in helping us understand our challenges in the Indo-Pacific.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close as we have no further  speakers.   I say again how sad I am to be disappointed to see these divisive  riders in the bill. They are all to gratify the extreme right of a few  people in the Republican Party.   I also don't make a habit of complimenting the Senate, but we should  take note that their appropriators are operating in a bipartisan  fashion. Their Defense bill was passed out of committee 27-1 because it  had no divisive language, and it made cooperation possible.   Go back and watch our markup of this Defense bill, and you just have  to ask yourself: Are we doing our job as appropriators? We are not  discussing our increasingly broken military healthcare system, which I  have heard from military family and servicemembers, both here at home  and when I have traveled abroad on bases; the lack of support for  mental health; the lack of access, even here in the United States, to  immediate healthcare concerns for themselves and their family members.   As I pointed out, we are solely now facing lack of obstetrics and  gynecology on our military bases right here in the United States,  making necessary the travel that the Department of Defense put in for  women servicemembers and women family members to get their full  healthcare needs.   We could be talking about the merits of supporting Ukraine and how  the democracies are coming together to show Communism and terrorism  that we stand united in our goals and principles; or we could be  talking about how to jump-start shipbuilding to compete with what China  is already doing in the Indo-Pacific, but we spent our markup arguing  about extreme social policies that have no place in this bill.   Now we are running out of time with the shutdown fast approaching.  Our servicemembers and their families have made a tremendous,  considerable sacrifice to serve our Nation. The least we can do is give  them a government that stays open and pays them on time.   Now, I know Chairwoman Granger and Chairman Calvert and I believe  that we can get this job done, but the majority must show that it can  govern in a bipartisan fashion and work with us to get these bills  done. That is what we have done plenty of times and what I am hopeful  we will do in the future. For right now, I have to ask my colleagues to  oppose this bill, and let's get the appropriations process back on a  bipartisan track.  [[Page H4572]]    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I support this amendment. It contains a  series of bipartisan amendments in support of Member priorities on both  sides. We have no objections, and we encourage the adoption of this  amendment, and I wish this in the spirit in which this bill had  originally been written.   If the gentleman from California has no other comments, I am ready to  yield back.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), in support of this en bloc, which I also  support.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to be clear, in this bill we  pay for our troops and our military to equip and do training, but in  this bill there is no funding for salaries for Ukrainian troops.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chair for working in such a bipartisan fashion  for these en bloc amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  for bringing this forward. I wholeheartedly support her amendment, and  I hope that it will be adopted in the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for sharing  his journey, and I am glad he is doing well.   I don't oppose the study of many of these drugs, but I am going to  lay out why, in this particular instance, I am going to oppose this.   On this floor we have had many a debate about whether or not medical  [[Page H4597]]  marijuana should be used for post-traumatic stress for veterans and  whether we should do research and all kinds of things, things I have  supported. Time and time again we haven't done that, in part because it  is a schedule I class drug.   The Department is concerned about a study involving Active-Duty  servicemembers. They acknowledge, and I am glad that they do, that the  benefits are being pursued by veterans. The implementation for Active- Duty servicemembers would be much more challenging at this time because  it involves questions around clearances, legal hurdles, and the  logistics that would just appear to hamper the success of a pilot  program or study with Active-Duty servicemembers.   As I said, schedule I--I gave the example of marijuana--under the  Controlled Substances Act means that they have a high potential for  abuse and there is no currently accepted medical treatment in the  United States for this right now. There is a lack of accepted safety  and there is no medical supervision in a way we can move forward.   For this reason, the Defense Health Agency does not believe it could  be implemented. I support working with the Department of Veterans  Affairs to look at anything we can do to help welcome our servicemen  and servicewomen home and to find the help that they need.   Currently, with the way that this amendment is written, I reluctantly  cannot support the gentleman's amendment. I look forward to working  with the gentleman in the future on this.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, Ukraine is a democracy. It is a democracy  fighting for its life every single day, and the world is watching. The  brave men and women of Ukraine are fighting to protect their democracy.   Vladimir Putin violated international law with his illegal invasion  of Ukraine. Putin and his thugs are committing war crimes on a mass  scale in Ukraine, including the senseless murder of civilians, even  while they are in the hospital.   He continues to violate international laws by deliberately targeting  marketplaces, supermarkets, daycares, and apartment buildings. Putin  has also broken other international laws by permitting--encouraging,  not just permitting--encouraging the abduction of Ukrainian children to  be taken from their families and their parents.   Democracies need to stand together, and that is what they have been  doing. It is the responsibility of the United States, the strongest  democracy, and all nations that respect democratically elected  governments to support Ukraine's fight against this unlawful Russian  aggression.   That is exactly why we have seen such a global response to these  atrocities. Our allies, our partners, our fellow democracies are also  supporting Ukraine in this fight by providing tanks donated by allies  and partners; air defense artillery rounds donated by allies and  partners; fighter aircraft donated 100 percent by allies and partners;  mid- to long-range air defense systems 75 percent donated by allies and  partners; counter unmanned aerial systems 69 percent donated by allies  and partners; 155-millimeter artillery systems 64 percent donated by  allies and partners; Armor, personnel carriers, infantry fighting  vehicles 63 percent donated by allies and partners; Stinger missiles 52  percent donated by allies and partners; Javelin command launch units 52  percent donated by allies and partners; Javelin missiles 46 percent  donated by allies and partners.   America is not providing support alone. The democracies are together  on this.   I would point out for a fact that when Ukraine decided to become a  democracy, to engage in the free world, they gave up their nuclear  weapons. They gave them up. What they are just asking for us right now  is to support a fellow democracy.                                time  1030    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this amendment.  Support Ukrainians in their struggle to defend their homeland.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have some disagreement with some of the, I  want to say, opinions put forward by the gentleman.   We do have oversight at our embassy on where equipment is going. The  chair and I have been in classified briefings asking these very tough  questions together because, you are right, we want accountability.   As we saw, when the President of Ukraine didn't think he was getting  the accountability he deserved from his military leaders and people in  his government, he very publicly removed them and said: No, this is not  acceptable to me. The oversight is taking place, and our allies are  also doing oversight.   As I pointed out earlier, this is an invasion that was brought on for  no other reason than a land grab. Putin is trying to put Russia back in  an image that he wants to see it in the future.   Who is watching him do this and who is watching who stands up to him?  Well, Russia is watching as to what we do, and we know China is with  all the chatter we are now hearing about Taiwan.   What does that mean? That means that democracies have to stand  together to support another democracy.   As I mentioned earlier today, I was previously a social studies  teacher. Take out a map and take a look at the emerging democracies in  the area who feel under threat from Russia. Take a look at our allies  that have suffered through World War II with aggression from Germany.  The democracies, Germany included, have learned from that lesson: We  cannot be silent. We have to be there for each other.   Mr. Chair, I will also point out that the money that is being put  forward, again, is for equipment and training, and we are doing that  with NATO. We are doing that together. As I said, I feel very  passionately about supporting Ukraine.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment to  have a discussion with the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, we have had this provision in the bill for  the last 2 years to prohibit funding for the work performed by  EcoHealth Alliance for research within China. As the gentleman is very  aware of, because he is very knowledgeable of this, it is a global  nonprofit organization that works to protect wildlife and public health  from the emergence of disease.   This is enacted in law, and we have worked in a bipartisan manner on  the committee on this.   The gentleman's amendment, if I understand it correctly, now seeks to  establish a full prohibition on funding to EcoHealth Alliance, Inc., in  this bill.   I thank the gentleman for the fact that his amendment preserves the  waiver option for the Secretary of Defense to make a determination that  working with EcoHealth Alliance remains a national security interest.  As we move forward, I would like to better understand any ramifications  as we move to this broader exemption that the gentleman wants to do as  we go to committee to make sure that it lives up to what I heard him  say on the floor, to my understanding, with the waiver.   I work a lot on the ICC, the International Conservation Caucus, so I  want to make sure that the wildlife work that we are doing is protected  as well as the research.   I thank the gentleman for bringing this forward, but I have a few  more questions, and we will work on it during conference.   Mr. Chair, I would also just reflect on something that the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Crane) said in our last debate, where he implied  fertilizer and other materials were being supported by the United  States Government. That is correct, but that is in the State Department  bill. What I said about what we were supporting and not doing in this  bill, I was factual with, and I just wanted the gentleman from Arizona  to understand that what he was talking about, I wasn't confused, it is  in the State and Foreign Operations bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the amendment by  the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett). We know that  these countries are seeking to influence our way of life, to find ways  to divide us and ultimately make us weaker. We know that China and  Russia are very active in this. They are even working to seek to  influence our elections and disrupt our democracy.   This amendment is necessary to ensure that we have the tools  necessary to fight against these nefarious actions. I support this  amendment, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.    Mr. Chair, I rise in the strongest opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, people deserve to be treated with dignity  and respect when being addressed.   Assistant Secretary Skelly has served in her role admirably, as she  has done as her time as a naval officer. Assistant Secretary Skelly has  been a naval fighter for over 20 years. I am a little upset because the  lack of respect that has been shown to Secretary Skelly by the last  speaker is surprising for me on this House floor, which we hold in such  high esteem.   She has been a naval flight officer for 20 years, including time  spent in the Pacific. While we are all aware of how important this  region is right now, there is absolutely no basis for this amendment.  The colleague who offers this amendment provides no real substantive  reason why Assistant Secretary Skelly should have her salary reduced.   There is only one reason why Assistant Secretary Skelly is being  targeted, because she is simply a woman. I have fought long and hard  with many women before me and with our allies for pay equity. We still  have a long way to go, but I am never going to vote to reduce a woman's  salary. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, when it comes to service to our country,  there are a couple of things we ask from people: To take a loyalty  oath, and they do that; to pass basic training and to be up and fit for  the job that they are called upon to do, and they do that. Secretary  Skelly qualifies in all those areas.   As far as the conversation that my colleague is having, I am not  going to engage in hateful rhetoric, Mr. Chair. Instead, I will focus  on the admirable service that our transgender, gay, bisexual members do  in an all-volunteer Army. They volunteer to put their lives on the  line. They deserve the dignity and respect this House can give them.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am just baffled here that we can pick and  choose what is science and what is not science, what is human rights  and dignity and respect and what is not human rights and dignity and  respect. I look forward to having a discussion on climate change based  on science  [[Page H4602]]  with the gentlewoman from Colorado at some point in time.   Mr. Chair, I thank all our servicemen and -women for their service,  and their families, who serve alongside them. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, Dr. Dillard has dedicated his life to  service to the United States. Commissioned in the United States Army in  1981, he served for 26 years and retired as a colonel after numerous  command and staff positions. I thank him for his service.   In his current position as director of diversity and inclusion, he  provides oversight and guidance to individuals working across the  Department of Defense on these issues, and he has the experience to  know where improvements can be made.   The goals of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion promote  the Department of Defense culture of dignity and respect that values  diversity and inclusion and readiness imperatives.   As the Department executes the Secretary of Defense's direction to  ``take care of our people,'' it is about supporting both the  servicemember and their family, regardless of who they are. It is about  having their backs while they put their lives on the line in the  defense of this country.   The chairman and others in this room are fond of Ronald Reagan, so I  offer a quote: ``Government's first duty is to protect the people, not  to run their lives.''   Rather than trying to run the lives of each servicemember into the  ground, let us concentrate on what should be the focus of this bill-- ensuring that our military servicemembers have the tools they need to  defend our Nation and to come home safely.   Need I remind everyone in the room that we are in the middle of a  recruitment crisis? The chair and I have heard why we are in the middle  of a recruitment crisis. Many companies and private businesses are in  the middle of a recruitment crisis. What are they doing? They are  opening up positions for diversity and inclusion to make sure people  know that they are welcome in their companies.   We want to make sure that people are welcomed in the Department of  Defense. We must find ways to attract young people to choose to serve  this country, to know that their service will be honored.   If they feel that serving in different branches of the Department  will open them up to ridicule, disrespect, or worse, why would they  volunteer to serve and put their lives on the line?   Mr. Dillard is trying to ensure that all feel welcome. He should not  be vilified for that. He should be applauded.   Let's stop the attacks on building a diverse force that represents  all of America.   Mr. Chair, I remember as a young high school student--I am not afraid  to admit my age with my gray hair--in 1972, all the discussions about  women in the military academy. That was a radical idea. You know what  the military had to do. They had to go out and recruit, and they had to  show that they wanted the diversity. They wanted the respect.   I am proud I do that with my military academies, where I have Hmong,  African Americans, and people from different sexual orientations apply  to serve our country. They put their lives on the line. It is duty  first for them.   Let's stop the attacks on building a diverse force.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, some of the remarks that my colleague made,  I am not even going to bother to respond to because I don't think they  are appropriate for this august Chamber which we are in.   The military only takes people who are qualified to serve. Then after  they have done their service for our country, they should still be  respected. This is a very sad conversation that we are having, and I go  back to the fact about diversity.   I will use the example of the Hmong in my community who fought along  with our soldiers in Vietnam and protected and rescued many of our  pilots. They came here, and they didn't have a written language. They  came here, and they didn't know about military academies. They wanted  to honor and serve our country, but they weren't quite sure how to go  about it.   What did we do? We created opportunities for diversity and inclusion,  and it is amazing when you put a hand out to somebody and say: We want  you to be part of this great Nation. You are willing to put your life  on the line, and we thank you for that.   The chair and I know why we have a recruitment problem. I understand  why we have a recruitment problem. I serve on the committee, and I am  doing everything I can to address it, and part of that is this office.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, in 2021, Congress passed the NDAA, creating  a naming commission with the intent of renaming military installations  and relocating memorials that celebrate the Confederate attempt to rip  apart the United States for the sake of maintaining slavery.   The NDAA was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. In fact,  the NDAA had so much bipartisan support that it defeated President  Trump's veto by a vote of 322-87.   The few remaining Confederate monuments at minor installations that  have already not been renamed or removed will happen soon.   As required by Congress and implemented by the Secretary of Defense,  Arlington National Cemetery is required to remove a Confederate  memorial and has initiated the process for careful removal and  relocation of the memorial located in section 16 of the cemetery.    Therefore, this amendment not only attempts to defy the overwhelming  bipartisan support and will of Congress, but it is likely too late to  even make a difference. Congress decided in a unified fashion that it  was time to move on from the regretful error of the Civil War and human  rights atrocities. This amendment will do nothing to stop that.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, 2 years ago, we passed the NDAA, which  established a bipartisan commission, including both civilians and  military, to rename installations that were associated with the  Confederate States of America. This amendment attempts to stop the  implementation of the commission's recommendations.   I am pleased to see that the administration has already started the  renaming process, officially renaming seven installations with two more  to go by the end of October. I will provide some context for these  renamings.   Fort Benning in Georgia was named after a Confederate general who  strongly supported slavery and was a leader in the secession movement.  Now that fort has been renamed Fort Moore after Army Lieutenant General  Hal Moore and his wife, Julia Compton Moore.   General Moore commanded the first large-scale battle of the Vietnam  war, and Julia Compton Moore was instrumental in setting up survivor  support networks and casualty notification teams.   Then there is Fort Bragg in North Carolina. That was named after a  former slave owner and one of the most hated generals in history. In  fact, he was hated by his own Army, and some of the Confederate  soldiers tried to end his life. He is also known to be a military  failure. That base has now been renamed Fort Liberty.   Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia, which was named after a failed  Confederate general, will be renamed Fort Walker after  [[Page H4605]]  Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, the first woman surgeon in the Civil War and  the only woman awarded the Medal of Honor.   Renaming these installations helps us remember that they deserve to  be remembered in a way that celebrates the true patriots of this Nation  who supported this country and who have contributed to its advancement.  Why would we continue to honor and celebrate traitors to this very  Nation? They were also involved in horrific crimes.   In my home State of Minnesota, we have been renaming several  buildings and schools and other areas that were named at one time  honoring who we thought were a great territorial Governor and State  officials, but as history was finally taught in its entirety, we found  out they committed atrocities. They were part of the genocide against  Tribal nations.   My State, my community, decided they should not be honored, and I  believe that is also true in the case of these military installations.  Congress and the administration set up an appropriate and fair process  to review and rename them.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, when we name something, whether it is a post  office, whether it is a road named by a local government, we do so to  honor something that is significant. We do that to show we are proud of  this person. We are proud of their actions. What we are doing with the  renaming in these commissions is saying: Let's reflect back. Why was  this named this way? Are we proud of people who led the secession  against this country? Should we look toward the new patriots, the  people who have served in the past and the people who are currently  serving to give them the honor, the privilege, of showing forward their  courage and actions as we strive to be a more perfect Union?   Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I support this amendment. This amendment  advocates for civilian personnel in the Department.   As I pointed out earlier in my opening remarks, we tried this once  before and we did not see substantial savings. People who work in the  civilian part of our Department of Defense do an admirable job. They  work very hard for all of us, and they are loyal to us.   They are loyal to the Department of Defense. They are not loyal to a  contractor or at the whim of a contractor if they decide they want to  change a pay scale or to do something different, or raise the price of  the contract and hold us hostage.   When it comes to the Secretary to determine what is necessary for  staffing, I am going to leave it to the Secretary at this time, and I  encourage my colleagues to support the amendment of the gentleman from  Virginia.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, let me be crystal clear. The United States  does not currently plan to deploy forces to Ukraine in the ongoing  defense against the Russian invasion. The United States does not  currently plan to deploy forces.   There is no current or future year funding for the deployment of U.S.  Armed Forces to Ukraine in this bill or any other bill that I am aware  of. Therefore, this amendment would not impact any current or planned  support to Ukraine. However, this amendment  [[Page H4607]]  would impede the ability of the Department to provide security aid to  American personnel in the region. I am not talking about in Ukraine,  just in the region, it would impede it.   For example, this prohibition would block the Department from  providing security forces to assist congressional or executive  delegation travel to Ukraine. I don't think that was the gentleman's  intention, but that is what this amendment does.   Additionally, it would hinder the Department's ability to provide  emergency security assistance to American personnel in the U.S. Embassy  if there was ever a threat or a need for an evacuation.   This amendment would not change how the U.S. is aiding Ukraine in  their war against Russian aggression. Meanwhile, it would change the  way we protect Americans abroad.   We put our elected and civil service in danger by doing that, so I  strongly oppose this amendment. I don't think this was the gentleman's  intention, but I have to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I understand what the distinguished chair of  the Defense Subcommittee just said. He doesn't support U.S. troops in  Ukraine. That would be a vote we would have to take here in Congress,  but this amendment does so much more than that, and that is why I was  clear that I don't think it was the gentleman's intention.   This amendment would impede the ability of the Department to provide  security and aid to American personnel in the region. It would block  the Department from providing security forces to even assist  congressional or executive delegation travel to Ukraine: the military  escorts that go with us.   Additionally, it would hinder the Department's ability to provide  emergency security assistance to American personnel at the U.S. Embassy  in Ukraine if there was ever a threat or a need for an urgent  evacuation.   I understand clearly the gentleman's intentions. This amendment does  more than that. I would possibly ask the gentleman to consider  withdrawing the amendment at this time and remove the things that I am  concerned about in it, and then I would be happy to look at supporting  not having U.S. forces go to Ukraine without Congress having a  discussion.   Mr. Chair, unfortunately, this amendment does so much more than what  the gentleman's, I believe, true and honest intentions are.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, once again, I want to be crystal clear.  This amendment does so much more than what the gentleman from Florida  refers to, and the gentleman from Arizona who offered it.   When we have Members who are doing oversight, this would prohibit the  military escorts that go on codels with us or with the executive branch  from taking us on those missions. I don't think that was the  gentleman's intention, and that is why I am asking for the amendment to  be withdrawn and written in a way that truly reflects what both my  colleagues just spoke to.   I think you will get a lot more support on that than saying that we  couldn't even bring troops in if we needed to do something at our  embassy to evacuate State personnel. The Marines on post wouldn't be  enough to do it by themselves.   Mr. Chair, I ask the gentleman to reconsider the way this amendment  is written so that we can have bipartisan support.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  request for a recorded vote on amendment No. 125 offered by the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) to the end that  the amendment stands disposed of by the earlier voice vote thereon.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, here again is an attempt to cut off any  support for Ukraine as they fight to defend their country from an  illegal Russian invasion.   As I said earlier, once again, Putin is attempting to rewrite the map  of Europe through the use of force. He is doing so in violation of  international law. He is deliberately targeting civilians, as I  mentioned: hospitals, daycare centers, apartment buildings.   While he is doing that, yes, he is destroying the economy and the  livelihood of Ukrainians in the process.   Putin and his thugs are committing war crimes on a mass scale. The  United States and the other democratic nations of the world must  continue to oppose him. If we do not, then he or another authoritarian  leader will try something like this again, yes, either in Ukraine or  elsewhere in the world.   Earlier, I laid out that America is not alone in the support of  Ukraine. Our allies and our partners are donating tanks, air defense  systems, artillery, vehicles, rockets, and infantry fighting vehicles.  This list goes on and on.   Let's not abandon our fellow democracies.   Let's not abandon the EU and our NATO allies now.   Let's not abandon Ukraine.   Faced with daunting odds against Russian forces, they have taken up a  mantle to defend themselves, defend their values, and our shared  democratic principles. They deserve our continued support.   Madam Chair, I understand my colleague has a different view than I  do, but I thank him for a respectful engagement in this discussion, and  I urge my colleagues at this time to oppose this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4609]]         Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas who  struck the last word and also spoke on behalf of the chair of the full  Appropriations Committee.   I had the pleasure of being with Mr. Womack in Poland where we did  oversight of the very money that we are talking about right now. I have  been in other theaters where we were supporting other troops, and what  we saw was the enthusiasm, the commitment, and the dedication from the  Ukrainians who were under our supervision getting ready to receive  training, and it was outstanding. It was like nothing else I have ever  seen before.   We do need to do our due diligence. That is one of the reasons why I  opposed an earlier amendment which would have actually restricted the  military from escorting us on those types of codels into the future.   In my years in Congress, I have worked on many international foreign  affairs issues. When I was in Germany just before the Ukrainian  invasion took place, I have never in my life seen the democracies so  united to work together because they know of the threat of what is  happening. They want to make sure--and we want to make sure--that we  continue to give the Ukrainians the support they deserve.   I have a friend who is returning home from just visiting, and her  cousin is going back after taking some R&R after being wounded. The  stories that she is sharing and the stories that I have heard from  other people in Ukraine is everybody is participating; 60-year-olds are  driving the tanks because they can't be out there on the frontlines.  They are doing that, and they are able to do that because of the  support and the equipment and the training that we have given them, not  only to fight against Russia, but to also maintain the equipment they  have.   I thank the gentleman for striking the last word and speaking to  this, and we need to do our due diligence to make sure that the  oversight is done right.   I do not support Mr. Gaetz's amendment as offered today, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for this respectful  debate, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   The decision by the Biden administration to transfer cluster  munitions to the Ukraine, in my opinion, was unnecessary and a sad  mistake.   Congress has been clear in prohibiting the transfer of any cluster  munitions with a dud rate greater than 1 percent.   The legacy of U.S. cluster munitions into the battlefield in Ukraine  undermines our moral authority and places the U.S. in a position that  directly contradicts 23 of our NATO allies who have joined the  Convention on Cluster Munitions.   The legacy of cluster bombs is misery, death, and an expensive  cleanup after generations of use, and I have been in Laos, and I have  worked with other countries to clean up this legacy.   As has been pointed out, the U.S. pays tens of millions of dollars  annually to remove cluster munitions from Laos and the Vietnam area.  These remnants of war continue to kill and maim civilians as we are  here today.   As a strong supporter of the Biden administration's policy in  Ukraine, I must state in the strongest possible terms my absolute  opposition to the U.S. transferring cluster munitions. These weapons  should be eliminated from the stockpiles.     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, we have seen several of these amendments.  I think, Madam Chair, you know how disappointed I am that these types  of amendments have been proposed by the majority, but especially this  one.   Secretary Austin has dedicated his life to service in the United  States. For 41 years, he served in the United States Army, which began  as an appointment to West Point and rose to the rank of four-star  general. He served as the 33rd vice chief of the staff of the Army and  completed his career as the head of Central Command.   Secretary Austin was awarded the Silver Star for his leadership in  the Army's 3rd Infantry Division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.   He didn't have to return to service for the Nation after giving 41  years of his life, but when called by President Biden, he served again.   You may disagree with the administration's policies as well as we  have done over our careers with different administrations, but  Secretary Austin has done nothing to merit this amendment.   Upon taking the job of Secretary of Defense, Secretary Austin has  outlined his priorities for himself and the Department:   First, defend the Nation, which included prioritizing China as a  pacing threat and address advanced and persistent threats.   Second, take care of our people, this includes growing our talent,  building our resilience and our readiness and ensuring accountable  leadership.   Third, and finally, succeed through teamwork. Focus on working with  allies and partners and building unity within the Department.   Each one of these principles should be policies and qualities that we  support in our Secretary of Defense, no matter what administration he  or she serves in.   Secretary Austin has worked tirelessly to ensure that our allies and  partners remain united.   Secretary Austin has personally pulled together the ministers of  defense from all over NATO to mount an unprecedented coordination of  equipment, training, and tools that the Ukrainians need to fight  Vladimir Putin's illegal invasion.   Upon taking office, our relationship with the Philippines was at an  all-time low. Secretary Austin reaffirmed our Visiting Forces  Agreement, which led to the creation of a rotational access to nine  total locations, strengthening our defense in the critical Indo-Pacific  area.   He has made historic breakthroughs through our cooperation with  Japan, leading to Japan updating their national strategy documents,  which increases security burden sharing in the region with a key ally.   He has worked to cement the principles of a trilateral security pact  between Australia, the U.K., and the United States, and that helps us  with our U.S. military position in the Pacific.   He has introduced programs that will help our military personnel, for  example. As pointed out, recruitment is at an all-time low, but it is  not because of anything Secretary Austin did.   Here is what he is doing to keep retention and attract military  personnel: introducing universal pre-K, which will cut daycare costs  for our military men and women; instituting increases in basic  allowance for housing for Active-Duty servicemembers in 28 military  housing areas that have experienced an average cost of more than 20  percent spike in rental housing costs; expanding military spouse  employment opportunities, strengthening support to our families; and  cutting the cost of food at commissaries.   Each one of these efforts help retain our servicemen and -women in  service to our Nation.   There, of course, is more work to do, and there always is, but  Secretary Austin is making the effort, and there is no need for us to  make such a personal drastic attack by eliminating his pay.   For these reasons, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to vote ``no''  on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will be brief. The loss of our veterans  to suicide is tragic. Coming from a family with many who have served,  and in going to military reunions, I know how serious this issue is. To  put this on Secretary Austin, to me, is just wrong, and it is  disrespectful. I have had these conversations with him personally about  this.   I remind Members that the Trump administration started the immediate,  quick, fast-paced withdrawal out of Afghanistan. When President Biden  came into office, he knew we were at a critical juncture to try to get  people out safely. He was able to negotiate a small extension, but that  was it.   It is a shared responsibility for what happened in Afghanistan.   Maybe the administration could have planned it better, but the Biden  administration's hand was forced by what the Trump administration had  put into action.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my colleague's  amendment. We all support funding for our national security, but should  any department, agency, or entity really get an opportunity to request  additional funding outside of the President's and administration's  request?   The service chiefs appear before the committee each year to discuss  how their budget needs are included in the National Defense Strategy.  Most of the combatant commanders testify before committees also.  Congress is able to assess, with strength and oversight, what we  believe the needs are for our country and its national security.   With the levers that we have in place, I support my colleague's  amendment, and I urge others to support it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    NewsGuard does a service that provides tools to counter  misinformation, and it has been around since 2018.   It uses tools to catalog and track all of the top false narratives  spreading online, which is effective in countering hostile  misinformation targeting Democratic governments like our own.   There is no doubt that China, Russia, Iran, and other bad actors are  trying to influence our country through its mis-, dis-, and mal-information.   We need every tool available to determine what is real and what is  not when it comes to what is being reported by the press.   The amendment does nothing but weaken our ability to do that, so I  oppose this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just a few facts about NewsGuard.  Journalists are employed by NewsGuard. They have technology people that  score websites based on their reliability and general trustworthiness.   It is not censored. People still have the freedom to read and to  believe whatever they choose to, but this analysis is designed to be  transparent.   It also includes the name of the staffer who analyzed the  information. If somebody has a dispute with it, they know exactly who  made the score system happen.   Let me just tell you a couple of things, Mr. Chair, about what they  do. They look at the frequency of publication that has inaccurate  information, the extent of sourcing and original reporting on  information, and the degree of demarcation between news and opinion  journalists.   Mr. Chair, I attended both public and private grade schools and  colleges, and I remember the good Sister saying, you are entitled to  your own opinion, it should be said so respectfully, but you are not  entitled to your own facts.   One of the things that they try to do is ferret out what is hard news  and what is somebody's opinion. We are entitled to read people's  opinions.   When opinions somehow get woven in and they become fact, it becomes  very confusing for people. What NewsGuard tries to do is kind of help  separate that out; the accuracy of headlines, including those that are  click-bait headlines and the degree of disclosure of the website's  owner.   If you are reading something and you want to know who owns it, is it  owned by your next-door neighbor? Is it owned by an American company?  Is it owned by a Chinese company? Is it owned by a foreign national? It  discloses all those kinds of things.   I am the daughter of a librarian. I am not about censorship, but I am  about people being able to sort out in this day and age what is  opinion, what is fact, and who is writing what, so we know what their  bias is.   That is why I strongly oppose this amendment and believe that  NewsGuard is a service that provides some tools to counter  misinformation, and they have been around since 2018.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would love to see the source for NewsGuard  working directly with the World Health Organization.   They might report things from the World Health Organization, but that  is different than working directly with them because that implies  something else.   I am going to close this up just saying there are many people, when  they are sorting through something, that just want to know that there  is a fact-checker.   I am sorry if the gentleman, Mr. Chair, feels that somehow or  another, some of the papers or the websites or the news programs he  wants to watch don't have as high a rating from NewsGuard. He is still  free to watch and do that.   For people who just want to make sure that things are fact-checked,  they want to know who owns the site, who is operating the site, where  they are getting their sources and cites from, that is what NewsGuard's  function is.   I yield back the balance of my time.    I rise in opposition to this amendment.    The Department took bold and effective action to  confront the COVID-19 pandemic, protect our personnel across the force,  and ensure that the U.S. military can fight and win wherever they are  needed.   In fact, the Department of Defense lost 96 servicemembers to COVID.  There were 96 servicemembers that died from COVID. More than 2 million  servicemembers have been vaccinated against COVID-19.   All the servicemembers in the Department of Defense are required to  comply with applicable medical readiness requirements. One such  requirement is when you go to boot camp--and a lot of us have seen the  movies and know people who have served--all servicemembers must  receive, if they have not already, inoculations and immunizations. They  usually are the same ones that we have had as children. They just want  to make sure they are up-to-date because you have to get your tetanus  redone and things like that that are required.   These vaccinations also include measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus,  diphtheria, pertussis, and chicken pox. In some cases, service  personnel are required to take certain medications if they are deployed  to an area, for example, to prevent malaria or maybe yellow fever. That  is to make sure that they are safe.   Applicants for military service and servicemembers may seek an  exemption--that has always been available to them and it continues to  be available to them. They can seek an exemption for vaccine  requirements based on qualifying medical or religious--so they can ask  for that, and they are often granted it.   Members of Congress should not be directing or deciding what vaccines  or medications are needed for our military personnel.   Madam Chair, I would ask my colleagues to take a second and for you  to come along with me. Just imagine you are on a submarine. My father- in-law served on a submarine in World War II, and he would tell me how  close those quarters are. I have been on a submarine, so I know how  close they are. There is no place for total privacy and germs are all  over.   Just think what would happen if there was a COVID-19 outbreak, how  that could possibly affect national security. All of our service  personnel are in close quarters with one another. We must try to  protect them from any disease that could inhibit their ability to  execute that mission.   At this point there are no COVID vaccine requirements. There aren't  for any members of the total force. There aren't any requirements  pending for this right now. The Department of Defense says, no, you  don't have to get this one, there are other ones you have to get.   Madam Chair, since there are no COVID-19 vaccine requirements  pending, I don't know why we are debating this amendment. For this  reason, I would ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, at some point I would like the gentleman  from Montana to show me his statistics. We might have had 60,000 people  who chose not to re-up. To attribute it all to COVID, I would like to  see that information. I am sure Chair Calvert would like to see that  information because that would be important to see. That is a statistic  I would like to see where it came from.   Madam Chair, I will state again that the COVID-19 vaccine currently  isn't required, but to ban it in such a blanket way in which we are  doing, takes away some of the ability for the Department. You volunteer  to be on a submarine. It takes away some of the flexibility that the  Department or commander or someone in the height of a pandemic--should  it come again--they should have every tool in their toolbox. Right now  there is no current reason for it.    Madam Chair, I am like you, talking to friends and neighbors. Some  are deciding to get it, some are deciding not to get it, just like  people do with the flu shot. There are certain times that the  Department of Defense says you need to take these certain medications.   The gentleman from Montana listed off a lot of them. We have had  them.  [[Page H4620]]  Our kids have had them. Our servicemembers have them. COVID-19 isn't on  a list right now of anything that is being required. This seems to me  to be superfluous and kind of creates more friction and anxiousness  about how we talk about medicine that is being provided. This is  medicine that should be optional.   Is this an option that would be available if a servicemember going in  said, hey, I want to get the COVID vaccine? I want to have it, and I  would like the Department of Defense to provide it to me.   I really think we should leave it up to the medical professionals at  the Department of Defense to say what is necessary. Right now they are  saying this isn't a mandated vaccine.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition only to have a  discussion.    Madam Chair, let it be said loud and clear, the chair  and I and all the members on the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee  have been bird-dogging, asking questions, wanting to have great reports  on what is happening with the money.   You are in lockstep with what your ultimate goal is and what we have  been doing on the committee. In fact, we fund a lot of this. In  general, I support the idea of this amendment, but the bill already  includes funding the oversight of all of the dollars we are spending to  support Ukraine.   I am kind of a penny-pincher, believe it or not. You are smiling, but  I ask people a lot of questions. I won't get into that. I ask a lot of  questions. I am kind of concerned about some duplicity and  inefficiencies in here, which I know is something we are striving to  make sure that that doesn't happen.   Madam Chair, keeping track of every dollar, especially when it comes  to DOD is something that when I was on the Oversight Committee during  the Iraq war and the way that we didn't have oversight over equipment  and dollars and cold, hard cash that was being delivered there is  something that I am very, very interested in and support doing.   I thank the gentleman for the amendment. The committee has it in  hand. I want you to know that this is a bipartisan, full Appropriations  Defense Subcommittee thing. We are asking these questions every time  somebody is in to see us.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, Cyrus Salazar, as has been pointed out, is  the director of the Department of Defense for Diversity, Equity, and  Inclusion, and is charged with promoting diversity within the DOD.   The Department has a responsibility to make sure all Americans are  welcome in the service of our Nation and that it reflects America's  defense.   I worked in the private sector until basically, I mean, I served  part-time in city councils and that, but I worked in the private sector  until I came here to Congress. I still have a lot of friends in the  private sector where I represent 3M. Right across the river in  Minneapolis, there are General Mills, Target, and I could go on and on  with the companies that we have.   These companies are competing for talent, whether it is the person  who is helping you at the Target store with the checkout or whether it  is the person that is being recruited to go into teaching or a person  who is going to become a CEO or a compliance officer or a bank auditor.  We are all competing in the workforce right now.   Our labor trades are competing for the workforce. There are fewer and  fewer people entering the workforce, so there is a great competition  going on. These companies have diversity offices. They are going out  and talking to groups that maybe have never been in the industry  before. I will use the building trades again.   In our building trades they are knocking down the doors going to our  high schools. They have people just working on diversity, saying, these  are great paying jobs, let me tell you about them. Maybe nobody in your  family has been a plumber, maybe nobody in your family has been an  electrician or a pipe fitter, or maybe you never worked road  construction. These are great jobs for you. They are going out and they  are recruiting these people.   We are up against the same challenge of recruitment and retention  that the private sector is. In fact, we are competing for the same  workforce. Of course, in my opinion, we need to be doing some of this  diversity and inclusion.   The gentleman from Texas, when he quoted what was said at West Point,  I totally agree, those are horrific statements and that person is gone  and they should be gone. But the DOD is struggling with a challenge.  Right now, our civilian workforce doesn't reflect the diversity of  other Federal agencies.   We are trying to get more women, more men, more everybody in this  country to know that the DOD is a great place to work and that once you  are there, you are going to love the job, and we are going to give you  the tools in the toolbox to do it.    Madam Chair, I will close with this. One of the things that I have  been working on is cybersecurity and IT and linguistics. I come from a  culturally rich district. If you come to University Avenue in St. Paul,  the diversity of the restaurants and small businesses that are there,  it will blow your mind away. It is rich in diversity.   But we still find, even all being in the same neighborhoods and  communities, we still have to do outreach to say you are welcome. One  of those places is cybersecurity. A lot of these businesses are being  hacked. They are having issues with it. We are going to the high  schools and to the community colleges, and we are looking at folks  like--there is a place for you in cybersecurity. They are like, me?  Yeah, you.  [[Page H4622]]  Sometimes people need to be welcomed in, they need to have the  opportunity to be recruited.   I really think that having someone that oversees opportunity, equal  opportunity, diversity and inclusion, making sure that disability  programs--we have our servicemembers who come back and sometimes have  to be relocated into another position or a job, that is what this  office can do.   I know we have gotten down this track of how we can divide ourselves  talking about diversity and inclusion. I want us to embrace it in a way  to have a more unified workforce and to recruit and retain the best and  the brightest to work in the Department of Defense.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time because I think we  have had this discussion over and over again today.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, we honor and celebrate many cultural events.  We celebrate Hanukkah on the National Mall. We light a Christmas tree  outside in front of the Capitol. When my father was with the DOD, he  served in many bases that the gentleman mentioned in Texas. I can tell  you about some observations that I had of celebrating Texas pride. Our  country has a history of celebrating a lot of things.   Black History Month was first observed in 1976 by President Ford.  Yes, we celebrate Pride Month, and we celebrate other cultural  awareness months. This is national Hispanic Pride Month. What they do  when the DOD does that is they show that they are committed to creating  and affirming an inclusive environment and that everybody is welcome  with their diversity. Everybody has somebody to offer.   At a time when the LGBTQ community, along with so many other minority  groups in this country, are facing attacks and threats--just think of  what happened, Mr. Chair, we had a moment of silence on this House  floor after what happened at the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida-- it is more important than ever that people know that we have their  backs when they are under attack.  [[Page H4623]]    Mr. Chair, I was in the chair that you are in when this floor ended  Don't Ask, Don't Tell in the NDAA, and that made our military feel open  and more inclusive. I think of a dear friend of mine who served in the  Navy, who served when he couldn't be who he was openly. He was serving  proudly in the Navy, but he had to hide who he was until he was  discharged, and then he felt he could come out. It was a burden that he  carried with him.   This amendment has no place in the Defense bill. I don't think it has  any place in the legislation that we do here. We are about coming  together as a country, not trying to fight what divides us. We need to  be focused on what unites us. One of the things that unites us is we  are a country that, awkwardly at times, not everybody agrees all the  time, but we are a diverse community. We celebrate that.   I mean, the people who came here when there were originally Thirteen  Colonies came here because they were looking for freedom to be who they  were. It was religious freedom at the time, but that is what they were  looking for.   The Federal Government recognizes these cultural awareness months.  The House of Representatives recognizes many cultural awareness events.  We do that because we honor the contributions and services of all  communities. Pride Month should be no different.   Mr. Chair, that is why I oppose this amendment, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will close in just a minute. I mentioned a  friend. I had several friends in high school--I graduated in 1972--who  were gay. They hid the fact that they were. They served when  recruitment was kind of down after the Vietnam war. They served  honorably and had honorable discharges. When we were in markup in the  full committee, Mr. Pocan shared this, and it was very moving to me, so  I am going to share it. It refers to the sacrifice that our LGBTQ  friends made before Don't Ask, Don't Tell. It is a quote on a tombstone  of Sergeant Leonard Matlovich. ``When I was in the military, they gave  me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time to strongly oppose this  amendment.  [[Page H4624]]     Mr. Chair, this feels to me like another attempt by the  majority to go after minority groups in the military.   Here is the history. The Reynolds Scholars Program was designed to  study women in the military and was named after Lori Reynolds, a  decorated female Marine Corps general.   The program was established to comply with the Peace and Security Act  of 2017, the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, the Department  of Defense Women, and the Peace and Security Strategic Framework, so  this is something that Congress has weighed in on.   Let me read the program description to you. The gentleman from Texas  has read some excerpts, and I didn't see them in full context. I will  take them at face value that he is upset with this, but I will read  some of the descriptions for you. I can cite the sources and put them  in the full remarks later for the committee to have.   `` . . . women account for the majority of individuals adversely  affected by today's armed conflicts, and it affirms the critical role  women play in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace- building.''   `` . . . advocates for the recognition of diverse perspectives that  increase military effectiveness, and [b] supports the empowerment of  half the world's population as equal partners in preventing and  managing conflict.''   Now, I have not been to the scholarship program, but I have traveled  with military, I have traveled with State, and I have been with women  who have been adversely affected by armed conflicts--raped, tortured,  bullied, harassed--and it is often our military and our military women  who sometimes in these conflicts are having conversations with them and  trying to get the facts if there have been war crimes committed. It  takes a very special person to do that.   It affirms the critical role, as I said, that women play in the  prevention and resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping. President  Bush, the Bush administration, when I was first serving in Congress,  actually had me go to Yemen and speak with our military at a graduation  of Yemen soldiers that we had been working and training with. Part of  the message that the State Department and the Bush administration and  our Department of Defense wanted to communicate was the importance of  young girls going to school.    In Chad, I witnessed, in the refugee camp after the Janjaweed had  attacked an area, not only what had happened to the women there, but  our military female leaders interacting with the troops there in Chad  that we were working with, peacekeeping troops reinforcing that women  needed to be treated with dignity and respect.   I will end this particular part of talking about this by saying:  Often when we go to build peace, whether it is sustaining the peace in  Northern Ireland, whether it is looking for peace in conflict in  Africa, whether it is working with terrible situations in Latin  America, it is the women whom we bring to the table who can get the  attention of the community, the community elders, because they talk  about their children and the need for peace.   I don't know if these people were graduates from this program, but I  have seen where women make a difference. The male members of our  military who are part of these programs are indispensable, and they are  very important.   As a woman who stands up for our women in the military and our allies  in the military, I have to tell you, I see nothing woke, I see nothing  woke about trying to understand the intersection of women and conflict.  I only see it as a benefit.   In my opinion, this amendment is antifemale in what it is purporting  to take away from the scholarship program moving forward. I oppose this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have nothing more to say except that I  don't think it is intentional sometimes some of the things that are  happening on the floor today, but one of the things that we chant as  kids is ``Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never  hurt me.'' Words hurt; they hurt.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, the fact is, our Earth is warming. The fact  is, our climate is changing, and it is unprecedented. I have been to  Alaska several times. The last time I was on some of our bases in  Alaska, they were dealing with permafrost now not being reliable to  land planes on the runways that we have constructed. The Army Corps of  Engineers is up there trying to figure out what they do about what is  happening with the permafrost and the thawing that they are seeing to  make our buildings be resilient and sustainable and how do we build  buildings in the future to address this.   That is just in Alaska. I won't even talk about what has been  happening with some of our radar facilities sliding off into the ocean.   The start of the hurricane season has begun, and it is historic.  Hurricane Hilary brought southern California its first tropical storm  watch. That is new. We know that these weather events are worldwide,  and we know that they know no boundaries, as evidenced by the recent  Canadian wildfires.   The U.S. has already set a new world record for the number of weather  disasters this year that could cost $1 billion or more. We have had 23  so far. I am going to refer again to what I had in my opening remarks.  This is Tyndall Air Force Base. We flew planes out of there because we  knew it was coming, but we weren't able to protect the infrastructure.  We are spending billions and billions and billions of dollars.   The other thing I mentioned was what happened in Guam with the recent  storms there. The Air Force alone in Guam is saying $40 billion. We  have to wake up here. We have to wake up and do what we can to mitigate  these costs.   The Department of Defense is the largest and most wide-reaching  government agency. It can make a huge difference by climate-friendly  changes in the way that they operate. I am proud of the fact that we  have worked on them in the Defense bill.   This amendment is needless, and it makes it difficult for the  Department of Defense to achieve its climate goals. It jeopardizes our  military readiness when we have bases like the one I just showed on  Tyndall and what has happened in Guam.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, testified  that climate change is a serious threat that is facing our country and  one that the military must take into account. He went on to say that  climate change has a significant effect on military operations:  ``Climate change is going to impact natural resources. It is going to  impact the increased instability in various parts of the world, and it  is going to impact migrations.''    Yes, it is a problem not only here at home on our bases with  resilience, but it is a problem with people fleeing climate change and  what has happened in their lives and in their countries.   Each of these situations increases the instability in different  regions, which could trigger more hostilities that we have to respond  to to protect ourselves. Each of these situations can impact different  regions in very, very different ways, even in our own hemisphere, so we  need to ensure that our military is aware of the problems climate  change can cause, and if they can play a role in either resilience of  buildings or different energy sources that they use so we are not  burning as much fossil fuel, I think we should do that.   Now, obviously, the gentleman disagrees, but I am looking to the  future. I am not looking to the past. I am looking for a stronger, more  flexible, more resilient and more economically empowered United States  because the dollars that we put into much of this climate resilience  and that is also transferrable into the private sector. The work that  the Department of Defense is doing to reduce its energy costs, whether  it is in materials that it is building, whether it is in use with all  the equipment that our soldiers are having to carry, ways in which we  can solar power some of the equipment that they use so we are not  bringing these huge oil trucks in that we all watched every night for  how many weeks of our soldiers, many of them dying in front of our own  eyes transporting fuel.   I think it can be a win-win, and we need to look at it as a win-win.  We can't always be looking at it as a loss-loss.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  oddly enough, as a social studies teacher who taught some geography.  The Department of Defense, the administration, and this Congress have  been pretty clear in its opposition to the unwelcomed Chinese  assertions of control over Taiwan.   This amendment will do nothing to prevent the Chinese aggression in  the Indo-Pacific, but it would prevent the Department of Defense from  buying or displaying a map on how China views the world. Now, if you  are going to have a discussion with students about geography and  China's ambitions, China has maps. China has maps which rewrite  history.   Whether they rewrite history including Taiwan, or whether they  rewrite history as they have done in Tibet or what they are looking at  doing in other parts of the world with their Belt and Road Initiative,  they have maps. We can't be blinded or not acknowledge how they view  the world physically and what the world really is.   This would force the Department to put its head in the sand or obtain  intelligence or something on what the Chinese have labeled as theirs.   Mr. Chair, I think we can all agree that it is important to know what  our allies and adversaries are thinking, and sometimes we have to  physically look at it.   Instead, I believe Congress and the Department should focus our time  and energy on being clear with China about the respect for  international boundaries and the rule of law. One way you can show that  is the international boundaries and the rule of law on a map that we  can all agree on that is correct and showing how China is coming up  with their own maps, reinterpreting the boundaries themselves.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I am certain that the gentleman from  Wisconsin does not think I appease China. I don't. I do not.   In fact, China, when we went to visit Taiwan at one point while I was  on a delegation, they were going to refuse us entry because they see us  as hostiles.   China doesn't see me as an appeaser. I want to be really clear. Maybe  it is not the intention of this gentleman, but I am going to say it  again: You are in a military college situation. You are talking about  how China views the world. You put up the real map and somehow or  another the Department of Defense can't even procure, create, or  display a map that shows how China sees themselves viewing the world.   We are in conflict with China right now in the South China Sea. Not  to show how China sees these islands as theirs when we are sending our  Navy in there to protect freedom of seas, a map which shows the freedom  of seas that they are protecting, that just doesn't make any sense to  me.   Mr. Chair, I am at a loss for words why we can't show how China views  the world when we are getting ready to defend our democracy, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the executive branch has the ability to  determine how the United States engages and manages our relationship  with Taiwan, just as, at times, this Congress has decided when and  where to travel. It is because Congress has left it to the executive  branch, however, to conduct the diplomacy and the recognition or  nonrecognition of foreign states and governments in this case.   Now, I believe, Mr. Chair, if we want to legislate on how the  executive branch should engage with Taiwan, then what we should do is  mark it up in a separate bill in the Foreign Affairs Committee that  deals just with that, either have the authorization handle it or if we  are going to have the Foreign Affairs appropriations bill on the floor  at some point, I hope.   In the absence of that, the executive branch needs to determine how  to handle diplomatic engagements abroad. It is their job to weigh  multiple equities and balance delicate factors that are simply not  considered by this amendment today.   The gentleman knows and understands that Taiwan is a sensitive  geopolitical subject with respect to our relations with the People's  Republic of China, and I appreciate that. However, Mr. Chair, we have a  select committee in this House, and I think it is something that we  should allow them, in a bipartisan fashion, to examine.   There is just too much at stake, in my opinion, to have this  amendment decide what guidelines of engagement will be here today on  the House floor.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, the Department of Defense appropriation  bill, we are sending a message, a clear message, and I support that  message. What the gentleman from Wisconsin is talking about, Mr. Chair,  is the Department of State, and that is not germane to this bill.   There are bills on the floor where it will be germane, and that is my  biggest concern with this amendment. I don't want to be a party to not  respecting the chairs of the authorizing committees or the chairs and  ranking members of the Appropriations Committee that oversees that  funding.   That is not what this bill is about today. For that reason alone, to  respect the different roles that we have in this body, this amendment,  although well-intentioned by my colleague from Wisconsin, is not  germane to this bill. We should not overstep our jurisdiction. We  should stay with what we are doing with China and Taiwan in the Defense  bill, which the chair has marked out clearly.   I support that, but I do not support starting to dictate what the  authorizing committee and the Appropriations Committee for State- Foreign Ops should be doing.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate what the gentleman from Montana  said about protecting medical facilities, but I am going to read the  amendment: ``At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the  following: Section,'' and the section will be numbered, ``None of the  funds made available by this act may be used to enforce any COVID-19  mask mandate.'' It says ``any.''   So, at a DOD facility or at a hospital or something like that, they  would not be able to enforce a mask mandate if they felt one was  necessary in a certain section of a hospital or clinic.   To the amendment in general, if this was enacted, the Department, as  I pointed out, would be limited in what they could do, but they  couldn't even purchase any masks in case of a COVID surge. The CDC and  the World Health Organization have recommended using a mask as a tool  to protect people, especially the vulnerable, in cases of a COVID-19  surge.   Here is why an option is necessary in the military, and I mentioned  this earlier, Mr. Chair. I, once again, ask you and my colleagues to  consider life in a submarine--the close quarters, the lack of privacy.  Think what would happen if there is a COVID outbreak in a submarine. It  would have the potential of impacting the ability of that submarine to  stay on station or deploy, putting our national security at risk.   If enacted, this amendment would take away a safety tool for the  commander, a tool that they have in their toolbox.   One person tests positive for COVID on a submarine. They are all  breathing the same air. They are in tight quarters. They are all going  to have to put a mask on so they can complete their mission.   Our commanders deserve our trust. They deserve our respect that they  are going to act in the best interest of their crew so they can execute  their mission.   I don't want to take any tools away from people in that circumstance,  and this amendment would do exactly that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
