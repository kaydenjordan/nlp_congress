 Mr. Speaker, last year in his concurring opinion in the  Dobbs case, Justice Clarence Thomas called for the right to  contraception to be reconsidered, encouraging extreme Republican State  lawmakers who have been attempting to restrict birth control for years.   Ninety percent of Americans believe there should be access to all  FDA-approved birth control, yet we continue to see States, including my  home State of North Carolina, attempt to restrict birth control. I will  not stand idly by and watch extreme politicians interfere with  Americans' private healthcare choices.   Birth control is essential healthcare. Access to birth control is key  to women's equality, bolstering education and economic opportunity, and  ensuring that people are in control of their futures.   That is why I am reintroducing my bill, the Right to Contraception  Act, to create a Federal right to access FDA-approved birth control. My  bill passed the House last Congress with bipartisan support. There is  no reason why that can't happen again.   I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  protecting access to birth control.                            ____________________
