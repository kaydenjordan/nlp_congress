 Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.  [[Page H5648]]    Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Yakym) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rutherford, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4664)  making appropriations for financial services and general government for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
