 Madam Speaker, as we begin this new Congress, I am  proud to introduce the Seniors Have Eyes, Ears, and Teeth Act, with 78  of my colleagues. My bill would  [[Page H552]]  reverse a longstanding Medicare prohibition on critical health services  for our seniors.   Since its implementation in 1965, Medicare has excluded coverage for  hearing aids and related audiology services, routine dental care, and  routine eye exams and eyeglasses, despite the large number of older  Americans who critically need these items and services.   The Commonwealth Fund reports that, among all Medicare beneficiaries  who needed a hearing aid, only 75 percent did not have one. Of those  who had trouble eating because of problems with their teeth, 70 percent  had not seen a dentist in the past year. And of those who had trouble  seeing, 43 percent had not had an eye exam in the past year. The reason  for many seniors was affordability.   According to the latest statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation,  more than half of Medicare beneficiaries live on incomes below $26,200  per year. For them to pay out of pocket creates extreme hardship.   Sadly, reliable data shows that neglect of all health, and even the  lack of routine dental exams and cleanings, can deteriorate overall  physical health and exacerbate serious and complicated health problems  that increase with age.   It is also increasingly well documented that untreated vision and  hearing loss diminishes quality of life and increases the risk of  costly health outcomes, such as falls and resulting disability,  depression, and dementia.   My bill would remove the restrictions currently prohibiting Medicare  coverage of these basic healthcare necessities such as eyeglasses,  hearing aids, and dental care. Expanding Medicare coverage for these  services is a cost-effective intervention that will prevent accidents,  falls, cognitive impairments, and increases in chronic conditions and  oral cancer.   Madam Speaker, if we do not address these gaps in health coverage  now, the overall health of our aging population will continue to suffer  and the need for costly and avoidable services will increase. But most  importantly, giving our older adults the gift of hearing, vision, and  oral health would go a long way toward helping our seniors enjoy their  golden years free from depression and social isolation.   It is time to recognize that total healthcare for our seniors must  include adequate access to vision, hearing, and dental services. I urge  my colleagues to cosponsor the Seniors Have Eyes, Ears, and Teeth Act,  and ensure a healthier future for all our seniors.                            ____________________
