 Madam Speaker, I rise today to read a letter from the  Dudykevych family, who are originally from Ukraine and are now living  in Tega Cay, South Carolina. They still have family who refuse to leave  their homes and their country which, as we all know by now, is under  brutal attack by the Russians.   The father of the Dudykevych family literally built their home with  his own hands, which is now being destroyed for one reason and one  reason alone--they desire freedom.   The heartfelt letter reads like this:   ``To President Biden and to Members of the 117th Congress of the  United States of America, we highly appreciate your legislative  initiatives and clear stance against the cruel and diabolic Russian  aggression against Ukraine.   ``Today, I am urgently asking you to actively support immediate  delivery of Eastern European fighter planes to Ukraine. The brave  Ukrainian Army and the country's heroic citizens are winning the war on  the ground.   ``The problem is that Ukraine's cities are being destroyed and the  citizens are being murdered from the air. I am requesting your urgent  help in convincing the White House that immediate delivery of MiG  planes to Ukraine should be the highest priority in support of a free  Ukraine.   ``What we are witnessing is a genocide against the Ukrainian people.  We have an ability in this country and in the allied bases in Europe to  stop these murderous attacks from the air. We have a moral obligation  to do so. Our words are meant to reinforce President Zelenskyy's urgent  demand for fighter planes.   ``Ukrainian cities are lying in ruins, and thousands of citizens are  dead and will keep dying because Ukraine's denial of fighter jets.  These planes will protect the Ukrainian sky from Russian air raids.   ``There are MiG-29 warplanes sitting at Allied bases in Europe ready  for an immediate transfer. Ukrainian pilots are well-trained on these  warplanes and can use them to stop the murderous attacks from the air  tonight.   ``We can no longer sit back and watch schools, hospitals, homes,  apartment buildings, bomb shelters, everyday people of all ages being  mass murdered on a daily basis.   ``The news that a mother in labor and her unborn baby died after a  maternity ward was bombed in Mariupol broke my heart. It is a tragedy  that could have been prevented if Ukraine had the planes to defend the  sky.   ``I know you deal with many requests, but this is an existential  need. Ukraine will not survive without your support. Nothing means more  to me at this moment. The world is in desperate need of American  leadership. Sincerely, Mila Dudykevych.''   This letter was emailed to me 12 days ago on Sunday, March 27, at  2:50 p.m. We all have seen the death and destruction that has occurred  since this date, all which could have been avoided if this President  had exercised leadership months ago by allowing for the release of the  fighter jets, which he failed then and continues to fail now by  refusing to honor the request of a desperate Ukrainian people whose  only desire is to live in a free country for which they are willing to  fight and die.   President Biden, the Ukrainian people and all the free people around  the world do not deserve this type of blatant incompetence and willful  neglect by the leader of the free world. Historians will record this  truly sad course of events for all the world to see in the coming  months and years. Mr. President, the words that will be recorded in the  annals of history will not be kind.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.    Well, first of all, thank you for organizing this  discussion to inform the American people what is going on. As Andy has  said, this President is willfully and directly causing this to happen  to the American people.   You are a businessperson. You run a restaurant. I am in the  development world. Who would let anybody come into your business or to  your home, not know who they were, not know why they were there?   It is insane what this administration is doing. By taking title 42,  as has been said, it prohibits--that is the only tool that President  Trump had at his disposal and President Biden has, but he is doing away  with it because that is what he is encouraging.   Lauren, think about this, how unfair is it to that law enforcement  agency,  [[Page H4393]]  that law enforcement official stopping a car not knowing who is in it,  not knowing what his background is, having no information, how safe is  that for that law enforcement officer?                                time  2045     Mr. Speaker, how unfair is it to the municipalities and  the cities that are going to have to pay for the hospital care, for the  schooling? How fair is that?   Well, it is not. It is intentional. It is willful.   As people ask me all the time, why is he doing this? He is burning  the house down before, I assume, the November elections, which the  House will turn over, and hopefully, we will elect Freedom Caucus  members who have got the steel and the spine to do something about it.   He sold out not only to the citizens; he sold out to China and those  that he is indebted to. We are going to find out more and more about  that as we move forward.    Mr. Speaker, it is not just the phones. What about the  gas cards that are in the latest budget that the President had? What  about that?   Just to put some context to this, Texas, I think you have about 15 to  20 million people. South Carolina has 5.3 million. That is the number  that is going to be coming into this country in the next 4 months if  the pace continues.   It is a travesty. It is something that Americans have to be aware of  and stop. God help us all if they do exactly what was said. To fund all  of this, America is at the breaking point.    Mr. Speaker, sign the petition.   Folks, have the courage to call your Congressman. And, folks, it is  time, as Winston Churchill said: ``Sometimes doing your best is not  good enough.'' We have to do what is required to close this border.
