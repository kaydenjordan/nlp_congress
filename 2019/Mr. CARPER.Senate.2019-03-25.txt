 Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon on the  upcoming vote on the majority leader's Green New Deal resolution, a  resolution that, ironically, he apparently does not support.   First I want to say this about the Green New Deal: Even our  Republican friends cannot deny that this resolution has sparked a  national conversation and generated a great deal of enthusiasm among  the American people, especially among younger Americans.   It reminds me of the time when I was a young naval flight officer  stationed at Moffett Field Naval Air Station just south of San  Francisco, waiting to be deployed to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam  war. I joined millions of Americans across our country that year and  celebrated our Nation's very first Earth Day.   As I listen to the rising chorus of voices calling for climate action  today, I hear the sounds of that day in Golden Gate Park. I remember  the urgency we felt then to address the environmental challenges facing  our Nation and our world, and I feel an even greater sense of urgency  today. That is why it is so disappointing to me that our Republican  colleagues--not all of them but a number of them--are trying to make a  mockery of the very real concerns and the passionate calls for action  we are hearing from people all across this country and, indeed, all  around the world.   This is not a time for derision. This is not a time for division. On  an issue as serious as this one, we ought to be serious about  addressing it. However, it has become clear that some--not all but  some--of our Republican friends would rather have some fun and talk,  maybe, about hamburgers and cheeseburgers and that kind of thing.  Worse, some have conflated meaningful action on climate change with  socialism.   With the death of our late colleague John McCain, I am the last  Vietnam veteran serving in the U.S. Senate. I served 5 years in a hot  war in Southeast Asia to oppose the expansion of communism. Shortly  after we celebrated that first-ever Earth Day in 1970, I was sent on  the first of three deployments in Southeast Asia before eventually  serving another 18 years until the end of the Cold War as a Navy P-3  aircraft mission commander in the Naval Reserve and retiring as a Navy  captain after chasing Soviet submarines in all of the oceans of the  world.   I am not a socialist. Like most of our colleagues here, I am an  American patriot and proud to be one. I care deeply about this planet,  and I know we can have cleaner air and water while creating jobs. Those  two things are not mutually exclusive. Our Republican colleagues know  better than that, and they owe our country better than that.   In recent weeks, our Republican colleagues have thrown around a $93  trillion number. That wildly overestimated number primarily refers to  provisions in the Green New Deal that are not directly related to  climate change.   At a time when our country is looking to Congress for leadership on  climate action, hiding behind political games, deception, and scare  tactics is irresponsible. It is cowardly when we ought to be brave.   Right now a clear majority of Americans want us, in Congress, to  address the growing climate crisis that is facing our country and our  planet. We should be having a fact-based, policy-driven conversation  about tackling this crisis, and we should be talking about the real  costs that confront us, including the cost of inaction.   I live in Delaware, the lowest lying State in our country. Our State  is sinking. The oceans around us are rising. According to our Nation's  leading scientists, climate change unchecked means more sea level rise,  costing coastal communities up and down the east coast--like my State-- trillions of dollars in economic damages over the next 80 years.   In the Northeast we are experiencing rain events in which we are  measuring rain by the foot, not the inch. Not too far from where we  stand today, Ellicott City, MD, has experienced not one but two 1,000- year floods. They have withstood not one but two 1,000-year floods in  less than 2 years.   Today, our hearts go out to our neighbors along the Missouri River  Basin as they are suffering through catastrophic flooding. As of  Friday, the cost of damage to Nebraska alone had already surpassed $1.3  billion, and the damage to Iowa alone was estimated at $1.6 billion.  Some cities are currently without fresh water. In Missouri, entire  communities have been evacuated. In Northwestern Missouri, roughly  40,000 acres of farmland was still underwater this past Friday.   Our Nation's scientists tell us that climate change unchecked means  more frequent and more intense storms, meaning bomb cyclones. I didn't  even know there was such a thing as bomb cyclones, but there are.  Intense rainfalls and category 5 hurricanes are becoming the new  normal.   Last year, we witnessed the tragic devastation caused by wildfires  fueled by drought and heat, like the California wildfires. Imagine what  we could face in 2050 when, according to our Nation's scientists,  wildfire seasons burn up to six times more forest area each year.   The extreme weather events we see are already taking a toll on  American lives, on American livelihoods, and our Nation's budget.  According to NOAA, in 2017 alone, extreme weather cost Americans $300  billion in economic damages--a new record. That same year, the Federal  Government spent $120 billion in Federal disaster spending for just  four extreme weather events--just four.   Earlier this month, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office  released its biennial high-risk list and once again identified climate  change as a significant fiscal risk to the Federal Government and, I  might add, to taxpayers.   According to GAO, since 2005, Federal funding for disaster assistance  has reached $430 billion--nearly one-half trillion dollars--and those  costs will continue to rise. GAO says: ``Disaster costs are projected  to increase as extreme weather events become more frequent and intense  due to climate change.''   NOAA and NASA tell us these numbers will be a drop in the bucket  compared to our new climate future if we do not act on climate change.  If we do not change course, just about every major economic sector in  the United States will be negatively affected by climate change by the  turn of this century. Some sectors could see hundreds of billions of  dollars of losses every year.   Add it all up, and climate change could slash up to 10 percent of our  gross domestic product, GDP, by 2100. I like to say, compared to what?  Well, for context, that would be more than double the losses incurred  during the great recession of the last decade. However, all of these  costs are woefully underestimated. How can we put a pricetag on the  toll of this destruction? What is the cost of our fourth-generation  farm family who loses their land and their livestock? What is the cost  of a bridge inundated by water, separating a community from a hospital  or  [[Page S1931]]  other emergency services? What is the cost of the family who loses a  child to an asthma attack on a high particulate matter day?    The circumstances I have laid out are dire because that is the crisis  we face, and we cannot evade it into oblivion. This poster says it all:  ``No matter where we live, we can't ignore the reality of climate  change or its effects.'' We have to accept and address this crisis.   As Albert Einstein once said, in adversity lies opportunity. The  opportunity before us is even greater. More than 3 million people have  gone to work in the clean energy sector in the United States in recent  years, and those jobs are in renewable energy generation, energy  efficiency, smart grid and storage, cleaner fuels, and lower emission  vehicles.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes to complete  my remarks.    Nearly 500,000 of these clean energy jobs are in the  solar and wind industries, and one out of every six construction  workers in this country now make their living in emergency and energy  efficiency. One out of every five companies involved in making motor  vehicle parts makes their money from products that make our cars,  trucks, and vans cleaner.   Our clean energy revolution did not happen by accident. We put smart  policies in place, and we had leadership that believed climate change  was a threat. During the Obama administration, starting with the  Recovery Act, the Federal Government provided economic incentives and  smart regulations to support market investments and clean energy. We  must build on this progress and continue to support policies that  reduce our Nation's carbon footprint, help create a more robust  economy, and support those most vulnerable to climate change.   Yet instead of pursuing any ideas to address climate change and  protect Americans from its effect, the Trump administration has sadly  decided to ignore climate change, decided to defund clean energy  research and roll back any meaningful climate action, decided to walk  away from provisions that would help protect Americans from rising  floods and other extreme weather events.   Our President's failed leadership on climate change threatens our  health, our economy, U.S. competitiveness, and our future. Sadly, most  of our--not all--but most of our Republican friends have been  applauding the President with every action.   In conclusion, let me just say to the American people, don't be  fooled or distracted by the political games. We cannot allow cynicism  to win. We can reduce our Nation's carbon footprint; we can strengthen  our economy; and we can support those most vulnerable among us--indeed,  we must. Climate change is real. Human activity is the dominant cause.  Congress needs to act. Stop the political theater and start to address  the climate change before us today while we still have time, and we do.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
