 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Millie Brother,  the founder of Children of Deaf Adults, also known as CODA. As the name  implies, CODA is an international group that works to support children  of deaf adults, including helping them pursue higher education.   Millie grew up in Palo Alto, CA, where I first met her in high  school. She was raised in a household with two deaf parents and a  hearing sister. Describing her life moving between the deaf and hearing  worlds, Millie said ``I felt comfortable in both but not fully immersed  in either. The CODA world would become my third option where I felt  balance between my Deaf and hearing cultural experiences.''   After Millie finished her graduate program at Gallaudet University,  she established CODA in 1983. It began its work to serve both the  hearing and nonhearing community.   Millie's vision and leadership has allowed CODA to grow from a small,  grassroots organization to a worldwide entity with strong familial  bonds reaching across global borders, international languages, and  societal boundaries. It has become a respected, well-regarded, and  vital resource for families that navigate both the hearing and deaf  world.   CODA works to connect children of deaf parents and support them by  organizing conferences and retreats, as well as providing scholarships  and financial aid. The Millie Brother Scholarship is an annual  financial award given to hearing children of deaf adults to help them  pursue their postsecondary education. Over the past few years,  scholarships have been awarded to students pursuing postsecondary  educational opportunities in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, England, New  Zealand, Zambia, and the United States.   I want to express my profound appreciation to Millie Brother for her  life's work, dedication, and advocacy for CODAs around the world. The  recent Academy Award-winning movie ``CODA'' underscored the numerous  challenges facing families with deaf parents and hearing children.  Millie Brother personally understood those challenges and used them as  fuel to create a global organization that provides support, compassion,  and friendship to CODAs everywhere.                            ____________________
