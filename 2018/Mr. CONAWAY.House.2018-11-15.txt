 Mr. Speaker, I rise also this morning to honor the life  and legacy of my friend, Damon Nelson.   A lot of wonderful, lofty things have been said about him this  morning in this Chamber. Every single one of those was true. I  certainly identify with each and every one of those remarks. I will not  repeat those but will walk a different path.   I did not realize the extent to which Damon impacted staffing across  the Hill. Once he passed, I began to get information about folks whose  lives had been touched and whose careers here in Washington had been  started as a result of being hired and mentored by Damon over the  years. There are people on my personal staff whom I did not realize had  a direct connection to Damon because he had started their careers here  in Congress and on the Hill through his mentorship and help.   I got to know Damon extremely well as a result of working on the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and his role as staff  director, particularly when I took over running the Russia  investigation. Damon was my direct contact with the staff. He did a  masterful job at trying to expeditiously conduct that investigation,  making sure that we dotted the i's and crossed the t's, making some  really difficult decisions as we walked that path.   In addition to that, Damon handled the rest of the business of the  Intelligence Committee, that important business that continues to go on  in addition to the Russian investigation, doing a masterful job of  shepherding all of that responsibility. He did it with class. He did it  with a calmness and a self-assuredness that made it work.   Damon's humor and, yes, sarcasm, which has been mentioned often  today, was a signature of his, but he used it well and in an  appropriate manner. It was never in a hurtful or harmful manner, but to  keep up the atmosphere.   Mr. Speaker, Damon's memory will live on in all our lives. Those of  us who knew him will not forget him. He was that kind of an individual.   Obviously, my heart and prayers go out to his wife, Dana, and his  family. He adored, loved, and worshipped his wife. She is in a hurting  place today, as is his family.   All of us who knew him as a friend will miss him. Mr. Speaker, I miss  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, we had an opportunity yesterday to share  with Dana, his wife, his mom and step-dad and hear the staff talk about  Damon. It was clear that Damon had created a family, that they loved  him, that they respected him as a professional, and that his leadership  was evident across this entire exchange. It was heartwarming to hear  those stories about Damon and the way he led the staff of the  committee.   We will miss him. I ask our Nation to continue to pray for his wife  and family as they walk this dark path, knowing that he made this world  a better place to live and that he helped mightily across a long period  of time to help protect us from some really bad folks.   We love you, Damon Nelson, and we will miss you.                            ____________________
