 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York  and the gentleman from Texas. We may have some agreements because,  frankly, I think there is not one person on this floor, in this House  and in the Senate, who does not believe that there has been enormous  violence in Yemen.   I have been to Yemen. I want to go back. I know that it is, if not  the poorest, one of the poorest nations in the world. The children are  suffering. There is a humanitarian crisis.  [[Page H3078]]    If the United States should be engaged in any aspect of this, let our  presence loom large in a humanitarian way.   I think it is important to remind my colleagues of the vicious  bombing of an innocent school bus where 40 children died and any number  of other incidences where children were involved and died.   Now, these children are suffering from malnutrition and are dying  from lack of access to healthcare, as well as no food. We can be a  major force, the United States, in providing that humanitarian aid.   But this is a resolution already passed by the other body, the  Senate, that indicates that, if we are to be engaged in a war, there  must be a debate under the Constitution about taking Americans into  war. Because the Americans who offer their sons and daughters clearly  are sacrificing. And those who put on the uniform--and we thank them-- are willing to sacrifice their lives.   This is a conflict between the Saudis and Houthis. It is a violence  that is going to go on and on. And if we are to prop them up--the  Saudis--they will never stop. They will never seek reconciliation. They  will never stop killing the babies because of an ``accident,'' they  declared: It was a mistake. We don't know how it happened.   We cannot allow Yemeni children, or any children, to be in the line  of fire.   So, this resolution indicates that the Congress must make a  determinative, if you will, assessment and engagement through the War  Powers Act and its powers to declare war under the Constitution.   Frankly, I believe that this is a must-pass resolution. It must be  signed immediately, and can be signed, by the President of the United  States, and we can begin to, in an effective manner, withdraw troops  and provide humanitarian aid to save the lives of children.   Madam Speaker, I support the resolution, and I thank the Senate for  sending it to us. We should vote on it and pass it now.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  S.J. Res. 7, which directs the removal of United States Armed Forces  from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized  by Congress.   The passage of S.J. Res. 7 would mark the first time in the 45 years  since the enactment of the War Powers Act that the House of  Representatives successfully invoked the statute's removal mechanism to  compel the Executive Branch to remove American troops from harm's way.   I support this resolution because, Congress has the sole power to  declare war under Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the United States  Constitution.   Madam Speaker, Congress has not declared war with respect to, or  provided a specific statutory authorization for, the conflict between  military forces led by Saudi Arabia, including forces from the United  Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, and  Sudan (the Saudi-led coalition), against the Houthis, also known as  Ansar Allah, in the Republic of Yemen.   Since March 2015, members of the United States Armed Forces have been  introduced into hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the  Houthis, including providing to the Saudi-led coalition aerial  targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and mid-flight aerial  refueling.   The United States has established a Joint Combined Planning Cell with  Saudi Arabia, in which members of the United States Armed Forces assist  in aerial targeting and help to coordinate military and intelligence  activities.   Madam Speaker, the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the  Houthis constitutes, within the meaning of Section 4(a) of the War  Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hostilities or a  situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly  indicated by the circumstances into which United States Armed Forces  have been introduced.   Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states  that, ``at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in  hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions  and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory  authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the  Congress so directs.''   Most importantly, no specific statutory authorization for the use of  United States Armed  [[Page H3080]]  Forces with respect to the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and  the Houthis in Yemen has been enacted.   Also, no provision of law explicitly authorizes the provision of  targeting assistance or of midair refueling services to warplanes of  Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates that are engaged in such  conflict.   For this reason, the resolution directs that the President remove  United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the  Republic of Yemen, except United States Armed Forces engaged in  operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces, by not later than  the date that is 30 days after the date of the enactment.   The resolution makes clear that the term ``hostilities'' includes in- flight refueling, non-United States aircraft conducting missions as  part of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.   Madam Speaker, Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world  right now. The Yemen crisis began in the Arab Spring of 2011, when an  uprising forced the country's long-time authoritarian president, Ali  Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour  Hadi.   Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has launched an estimated 18,000 air strikes  on Yemen, attacking hospitals, schools, water treatment plants,  funerals, markets and even farms.   The Saudis also imposed a blockade on food, fuel and medicine from  freely entering the country in what can only be described as a  deliberate effort to starve the civilian population into submission.   More than 14 million Yemenis are steps away from starvation and at  least 85,000 children under the age of five have perished from war- related hunger and disease.   The United States has supported the Saudi led air campaign with mid- air refueling support, intelligence and targeting assistance, and other  support.   Yemen is experiencing the world's worst famine in 100 years, with 12  million to 13 million innocent civilians at risk of dying from the lack  of food within months.   Madam Speaker, too many lives hang in the balance to allow American  involvement in Yemen war to continue.   I ask all members to join me in supporting S.J. Res. 37.    Madam Speaker, today, we finished one stop of a  journey, and that is the journey to pass the Violence Against Women  Act.   I have had the privilege to see and shepherd this bill throughout my  congressional tenure, having stood alongside senior Members many years  ago in the first reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.  This bill was started today in 2016. We began to work and reach across  the aisle to do what is right for the victims of so many horrific  crimes.   We wanted children to be protected, immigrant women to be protected.  We wanted to make sure that Native American women were protected.   We wanted law enforcement and prosecutors to have the tools. We  wanted to stop the backlog in rape kits that had not been processed.   We did that today with a collective group of Republican and  Democratic Members on a bill that should be nonpartisan.   We worked hard, and I was gratified that we wound up giving a bill to  the Senate and that they must ask the question: Are they not going to  support a bill that was bipartisan?   Madam Speaker, I thank Monalisa Dugue, Milagros Cisneros, Joe  Graupensperger, Amy Rutkin, and Chairman Nadler. I thank Karen Bass and  all those women who worked together, including the outstanding work  that was done on the MTR with Debbie Dingell.   Madam Speaker, we are thanking them because we are moving forward to  protect women in this country, including against sex trafficking, which  was in the bill.                            ____________________
