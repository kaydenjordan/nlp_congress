 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for  their model of good work and focus on our military.   I would speak now to any House conservatives who have apprehension  about voting for the NDAA.   If you vote against this NDAA or the rule authorizing it, you are  voting to continue critical race theory in our military.   If you vote against the NDAA, you are voting for the continued  embrace of DEI in the military.   If you vote against the NDAA, you are voting to keep the chief  diversity officer at the Department of Defense, and you are voting to  continue some of the strangest radical gender ideology that we have  observed, whether it is the trans ambassadors or the drag shows  intended for children that have been held on military bases.   This NDAA showcases a bold embrace of the technologies the United  States will need to hold the high ground, whether that is hypersonics,  whether that is AI. This NDAA moves us away from older legacy systems  that have been protected by political patronage and instead ensures  that we are making the investments to vanquish every foe every time it  is absolutely necessary to preserve America's interest.   So if you don't want your children and grandchildren one day having  to speak Mandarin as some purple-haired, genderless ideologue at the  Department of the Defense raises the white flag of surrender, I would  suggest voting for this bill.   Mr. Chair, I am grateful for all who have made that decision.
