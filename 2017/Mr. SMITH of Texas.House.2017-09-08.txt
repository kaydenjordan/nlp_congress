 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues may be aware of a  legal immigration reform bill that increases skilled workers needed in  America, reduces the chain migration of non-immediate relatives, and  saves jobs for American workers.   This is to alert Members to the welcome endorsement by many in the  national media. Even President Clinton liked the idea.   That was when similar legislation was recommended by the Jordan  Commission, chaired by the Texas Democrat, former Member Barbara  Jordan. Today, similar legislation is opposed by these same newspapers.  How time, or at least the political party of the authors, changes.   Most of the national media supports more open borders and increased  levels of immigration, contrary to a majority of the American people.   But Congress needs to approve an immigration bill that puts the  interests of Americans first.                            ____________________
