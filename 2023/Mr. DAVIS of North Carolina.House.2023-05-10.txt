 Mr. Speaker, I rise during Military  Appreciation Month to highlight an eastern North Carolina native and a  true American hero.   United States Air Force Technical Sergeant William H. Gonzalez of my  hometown, Snow Hill, North Carolina, was on the way home after picking  up his mother from the airport when he saw a woman lose control of her  vehicle and veer into a pond off Interstate 587.   Mr. Speaker, as a fearless airman with 9 years of service, Gonzalez  didn't hesitate and leaped into action. He dove into the pond, brought  the woman back to consciousness, and helped her safely escape from her  submerged vehicle.   This Military Appreciation Month, we salute all of our brave men and  women in uniform. Today, I ask for people across America to join me in  saluting Technical Sergeant William Gonzalez.                            ____________________
