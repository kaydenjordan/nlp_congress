 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concerns  over the leadership coming from our Nation's White House.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote the words of a White House staff  member that was recently published by The New York Times in an op-ed:         The dilemma--which the President does not fully grasp--is       that many of the senior officials in his own administration       are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his       agenda and his worst inclinations.    This comes directly from a staffer at the Trump White House.   It is scary to think that the policies that have come out of the  White House already publicly aren't even the President's worst  inclinations.   It is scary to think that separating children from their mothers, as  young as 9 months old, is not the President's worst inclination.   It is scary to think that the rhetoric being launched at immigrants,  hateful rhetoric launched against immigrants from all parts of the  world--this is a nation of immigrants--that that is not part of the  President's worst inclination.   It is scary to think that arming teachers not with a book, not with a  laptop, but with weapons is not the President's worst inclination.   There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people  choosing to put country first. That is what the staff member said in  that op-ed. People before party. Country before party.   That is what the staff member has said in this op-ed, and I stand  here today to say to my Republican colleagues: Where are you? Will you  put country before party?   Where is your courage to do what is right? Will you put country  before party?   Where is your courage to hold the President accountable, to exercise  the checks and balances that are given to us by the Constitution?   Trump's circle of chaos runs deep within the administration. To my  colleagues: Where are you?
