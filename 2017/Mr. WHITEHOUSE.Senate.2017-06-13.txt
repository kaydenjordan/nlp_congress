 I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 53, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 143 Leg.]                                  YEAS--47       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Heller      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lee      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Paul      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--53       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Manchin      McCain      McCaskill      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Nelson      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Warner      Wicker   The motion was rejected.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for up to 10 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                Climate Change     Mr. President, however loud, persistent, and powerful  the climate denial operation has been, we have to remember that it has  always been built on lies. It is a huge fortress of lies stacked upon  lies--lies about the science, lies about the scientists, lies about  doubt, lies about costs, lies through phony front groups, and lies  about where the money comes from and who is pulling the strings.   This fortress of lies protects a subsidy to the fossil fuel industry  that the International Monetary Fund puts at $700 billion per year. For  big, big money, you can do big, big lies, and they do. These have been  the biggest lies of our generation. But to paraphrase the great reggae  singer Jimmy Cliff: ``The bigger you lie, the harder you fall.'' To  paraphrase the ``Game of Thrones,'' ``The fall is coming.'' In the last  few weeks, there has been news that has shaken this fortress of lies  and moves us toward that fall. Shareholders are rising up.    For as long as there have been shareholder resolutions to fossil fuel  companies about climate change, there has been resolute opposition from  management to every vote. Hundreds of shareholder resolutions went down  to defeat until now.   Occidental Petroleum shareholders last month won the first victory  against management, and a week later mighty ExxonMobil was defeated by  its shareholders. This new reporting that shareholders have demanded  will help clear away the lies. The fall is coming.   There are even lies within the lies. To fend off this latest  shareholder resolution to try to make the company look less  irresponsible, ExxonMobil's CEO repeated the company's claim that it  knows climate change is real and supports a carbon fee--but it doesn't.   As everyone in this building knows, ExxonMobil maintains a massive  lobbying apparatus in Washington, and that massive apparatus is and  always has been resolutely opposed to any such thing as a carbon fee or  any serious climate action whatsoever, for that matter, unless maybe  ExxonMobil doesn't know what its own vast lobbying apparatus is doing.  Maybe ExxonMobil spends that enormous amount of money to exert its  influence in Washington to stop any climate action, and the CEO is  unaware of that going on. I doubt that. You be the judge of whether  that is credible.   It is not just shareholders rising up; attorneys general are starting  to win. The attorney general of New York has just filed pleadings in  State court in New York asserting that ExxonMobil's climate reporting  has been a ``sham''--to use the word from his filing; that, in the  oldest of accounting tricks, ExxonMobil kept two sets of books  assessing carbon pollution risk. After fierce opposition by ExxonMobil  lawyers using every trick in the book to delay and snarl the New York  attorney general, it looks now as if ExxonMobil may have lied to its  investors and its shareholders. If ExxonMobil has lied to its  shareholders, that is a violation of law, and that fall comes hard  indeed.   Secretary of State Tillerson evidently knew of and approved the two  sets of carbon pollution books when he was CEO of ExxonMobil. We will  see where this goes, but of all the people around Trump who might be  indicted, now we might add the Secretary of State.   The Attorney General of Massachusetts is also pursuing ExxonMobil  against equally fierce tactics by ExxonMobil lawyers. To try to get  away from the Massachusetts attorney general, the lawyers even went so  far as to claim--get this--that ExxonMobil was not doing business in  Massachusetts; that it didn't have the minimum contacts with the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts necessary for the State even to assert  jurisdiction. Well, the judge virtually laughed that argument out of  court, but it shows how desperate ExxonMobil must be feeling as it  tries to wriggle away from having to answer questions under oath.   Nothing turns a big lie into a hard fall better than having to put  that right hand up and give truthful testimony and face cross- examination under penalty of perjury.   Will the Securities and Exchange Commission take a look at this sham  reporting, too, or has the Federal government, under Trump, degenerated  into such a fossil fuel banana republic that no Federal agency will do  its job against that industry or might it even chime in on the side of  industry Pruitt-style?   Do you remember the question of whether the fossil fuel climate  denial operation merits investigation under Federal civil racketeering  laws? The tobacco industry was sued under Federal civil racketeering  laws by the U.S. Department of Justice so there is a model. You may  remember that the question as to the fossil fuel climate denial  operation was referred by Attorney General Lynch to the FBI--or so she  testified.   One wonders, did the FBI ever take an honest look? What was the  outcome? Was there ever a report? Are they still looking at it?   Remember that the Department of Justice won its civil racketeering  case against the tobacco industry, they won it at trial, and they won  again on appeal. The woman who won that case for the Department of  Justice, the lead trial attorney for the Department, has said publicly  that this climate denial operation also merits investigation as fraud.  That would seem to be a knowledgeable opinion from the woman who  [[Page S3447]]  won the last case, an opinion perhaps worth heeding, but did anything  happen? Will anything happen?   Forget too big to fail or too big to jail. Is the power of the fossil  fuel industry now so great that it is too big even to investigate, even  by the Department of Justice? Does it now take State attorneys general  to do the job because the Federal government is so owned now by the  fossil fuel industry?   Think about it. What if the FBI reported to the Attorney General that  there was a meritorious fraud case arising out of all the lies propping  up climate denial? Who believes Attorney General Sessions would allow  that case to go forward against his party's biggest backer?   Well, the bigger the lie, ultimately, the harder the fall. One way or  the other, this fact remains constant and true. There always will come  a day of reckoning. With these shareholder victories and with these  attorneys general victories, that day of reckoning is closing in--the  day when they have to put that right hand up and testify truthfully and  under oath, not just send out spin through front groups and operatives  but testify truthfully under penalty of perjury.   It is long overdue for truth to have its day.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.                        Amendment No. 232, as Modified
