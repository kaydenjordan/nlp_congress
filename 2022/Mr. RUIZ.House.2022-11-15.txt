 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the House passage  of my bipartisan bill to designate the Palm Desert VA Clinic in memory  of Seymour ``Sy'' Kaplan.   Sy was a decorated World War II veteran with a relentless passion for  service. He enlisted in the U.S. Army at just 17 years old and served  our country bravely in the 2nd Army, 2nd Corps Division. For his  heroism, he earned three battle stars and two Purple Hearts.   When his military service ended, his service to our veterans began.  For 25 years, Sy served as the commander of the Disabled American  Veterans, Chapter 78, in the Coachella Valley.   His leadership helped countless veterans find healing, community, and  a sense of purpose. He also served as a member of my veterans advisory  board, where I looked to him as a trusted adviser.   We lost Sy 3 years ago at the age of 95. I can think of no better way  to honor his legacy than to ensure his name is forever etched into our  desert's history at a place where our veterans receive quality care at  the Palm Desert VA Clinic, the clinic he championed to create.                            ____________________
