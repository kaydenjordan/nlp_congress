 Mr. Speaker, this morning, we lost one of our greatest  Americans, and today, I rise along with my colleagues representing all  of Arizona, Republicans and Democrats alike, to honor the life and  legacy of the most influential Arizonan in history, Justice Sandra Day  O'Connor, who passed away this morning at the age of 93.   Justice O'Connor spent her life breaking down barriers in pursuit of  a more just society. She blazed every trail she set foot on, defying  the odds stacked against women in the legal profession to rise to  become Arizona's assistant attorney general, our first female majority  leader in the State senate, Maricopa County Superior Court judge, and,  ultimately, the first female Justice on the United States Supreme  Court.   She brought her Arizona brand of pragmatism and independence with her  to the Supreme Court and was often the swing vote on deeply  consequential decisions.   In the years since her retirement from the Supreme Court, I have  admired her steadfast commitment to preserving our democracy through  objective, fact-based, and collaborative civil discourse through her  creation of the Sandra Day O'Connor Institute and, of course, through  the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.   Her work will inspire future generations to follow her example to  become engaged and thoughtful civil participants.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in a moment of  silence.                            ____________________
