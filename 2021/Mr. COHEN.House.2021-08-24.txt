 Madam Speaker, we were here until about 12:15 this morning  trying to work out the votes for a rule to move America forward. I hope  we have them. We will find out soon.   We are trying to get the Build Back Better bill passed, the  resolution to provide the opportunity for us to have that bill come  forward, and the infrastructure bill as well. They will provide for  needed infrastructure for American companies, businesses, and families;  child care tax credits to be made permanent; prescription drug costs to  be reduced; water lines improved and corrected; wastewater, which was  so inadequate in Tennessee, where we had dozens die from floods.   Hopefully, we will get this passed, it is important business. I thank  Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer for their long hours and their work in  trying to build back America better.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the Republicans say we don't need this  voting rights bill, that we should leave the power with the States. My  subcommittee had 13 hearings over 2 years, and the professors and the  attorneys told us that every time Black and Brown people gain in  population and start to take power, there start to be changes in the  laws to stop them from having power.   Just this year, 18 States have enacted 30 laws restricting the  ability to vote. There were at least 495 voter suppression bills  pending in the States as of yesterday.   For them to say we don't need a bill in the year that this Capitol  faced an insurrection, when they tried to overturn the electoral  college and overturn a free and fair election, and after that happened,  two-thirds of the Republicans voted to overturn the election by  throwing out the results in Arizona and Pennsylvania. And then we  wanted to study that insurrection, and a very thin number of  Republicans even voted to study it.   Democracy is on the line. The right to vote is on the line. What we  learned from our hearings is that we need to pass the Voting Rights Act  and protect people's rights to vote because that is what America is  about. I support this John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
