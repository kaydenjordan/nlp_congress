 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3587) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct  a study on the accessibility of websites of the Department of Veterans  Affairs to individuals with disabilities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3587         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Website Accessibility Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON THE ACCESSIBILITY OF WEBSITES OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO INDIVIDUALS                     WITH DISABILITIES.         (a) Study.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall conduct a study of all websites of the Department of       Veterans Affairs to determine whether such websites are       accessible to individuals with disabilities in accordance       with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.       794d).        (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after completing the       study under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report on such study.  [[Page H5745]]         (c) Elements.--The report required by subsection (b) shall       include the following:        (1) A list of each website described in subsection (a) that       is not accessible to individuals with disabilities in       accordance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973       (29 U.S.C. 794d).        (2) For each website identified in the list under paragraph       (1)--        (A) the plan of the Secretary to bring the website into       compliance with the requirements of section 508 of the       Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d); and        (B) a description of the barriers to bringing the website       into compliance with the requirements of such section,       including any barriers relating to vacant positions at the       Department of Veterans Affairs.        (d) Website Defined.--In this section, the term ``website''       includes the following:        (1) A file attached to a website.        (2) A web-based application.        (3) A kiosk at a medical facility of the Department of       Veterans Affairs, the use of which is required to check in       for scheduled appointments.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials to S. 3587.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3587 will require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to conduct a study on the accessibility of VA websites to our veterans  and VA employees with disabilities and to ensure that these websites  comply with the accessibility standards established by section 508 of  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.   Section 508 ensures that disabled Americans have equal access to  electronic and information technology. As it stands today, the VA has  not brought all of its online services into compliance with this  existing law. This bill forces the VA to take a closer look at all of  its websites and electronic services, identify the ones that are not  legally compliant, and develop a correctional plan to make those  services functional for the disabled. This will be particularly helpful  to our blind veterans.   According to a 2018 study conducted by the Veterans Health  Administration, our country has an estimated 131,500 legally blind  veterans, though that number is projected to grow in the coming  decades. Because these individuals depend on screen readers and  magnification software when using websites, apps, kiosks, and  telehealth tools, it is imperative that all VA programs be compatible  with accessible communications technologies. That way, every veteran  has equal access to the essential information and services that the  Department provides.                                time  1700    Mr. Speaker, not only will this legislation better assist veterans  seeking care and benefits from the VA, it will also assist the  Department's own disabled employees. Far too often, the VA utilizes  inaccessible PDF formats when conducting internal operations, hindering  its own employees who rely on screen readers in their work and in their  service to our veterans. This legislation will identify and improve  these barriers for services to the public.   Last year, I met with a group of blinded veterans, and they explained  the structure of the VA websites and how it makes it difficult for them  to learn about treatments and schedule doctor appointments. To remedy  this problem, I introduced the House companion to this bill, H.R. 1199,  the VA Website Accessibility Act.   Blinded veterans deserve equal access to all VA services, and I am  honored to champion their cause. Our heroes should not have to wait a  day longer. Today, we can help thousands of veterans receive better  access to healthcare resources. I urge support of the VA Website  Accessibility Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 900) to designate the community-based outpatient clinic of the  Department of Veterans Affairs in Bozeman, Montana, as the ``Travis W.  Atkins Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 900         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF TRAVIS W. ATKINS DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC IN BOZEMAN, MONTANA.         (a) Designation.--The community-based outpatient clinic of       the Department of Veterans Affairs located in Bozeman,       Montana, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be       known and designated as the ``Travis W. Atkins Department of       Veterans Affairs Clinic'' or the ``Travis W. Atkins VA       Clinic''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       community-based outpatient clinic referred to in subsection       (a) shall be considered to be a reference to the Travis W.       Atkins Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous materials on S. 900, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the life of Army Staff Sergeant  Travis Atkins, who was killed in Iraq on June 1,  [[Page H5746]]  2007. I thank my colleague, Mr. Gianforte from Montana, for bringing  this bill before us so we may all pay tribute to a selfless public  servant.   Travis was born on December 9, 1975, to parents Jack and Elaine.  Growing up in Bozeman, Montana, he was an active outdoorsman, spending  most of his time fishing, hunting, and snowmobiling. After high school,  he worked as a painting and concrete contractor but soon felt called to  serve.   On November 9, 2000, 24-year-old Travis joined the Army. He deployed  to Kuwait with the 101st Airborne Division in March of 2003 and was an  infantry team leader during the invasion of Iraq later that month.   After that deployment, he decided to pursue college and was honorably  discharged in December of 2003. But as his father put it, the civilian  life just didn't do it for him, and he rejoined the Army in December of  2005 as part of the 10th Mountain Division and was again deployed to  Iraq.   Mr. Speaker, on June 1, 2007, during a route clearance in a town  outside of Baghdad, Atkins' unit noticed two men trying to cross a road  that they were securing. Atkins asked the men to stop. When trying to  search one of the men, a fight broke out. Realizing the man was wearing  a suicide vest, he fought to keep him from finding the trigger.  Eventually, he did. Without hesitating, Staff Sergeant Atkins bear- hugged the insurgent, threw him to the ground and pinned him there,  shielding his fellow soldiers only a few feet away. Staff Sergeant  Atkins saved three men that day.   In every account of his character from his battle buddies, the word  most used to describe him was a ``leader,'' and a fine leader he was,  right up until his final moments.   Surviving Sergeant Atkins are his parents and his son, Trevor. Trevor  said that he wants his father to be remembered as the best dad and the  best soldier that anyone could ask for. At the White House, on March  27, 2019, Trevor accepted his father's Medal of Honor.   The legacy of Staff Sergeant Atkins--of loyalty, of dedication, of  leadership--must never be forgotten. As the citizens he protected, we  honor him by trying to live by his example to care deeply and lead  well.   While we will never be able to fully convey the depth of our  gratitude to the Atkins family, I hope that this bill, the naming of  the clinic in his hometown, will offer some fraction of that comfort.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing S.  900, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3147) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit  to Congress reports on patient safety and quality of care at medical  centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous materials on S. 3147.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3147, the Improving Safety and  Security for Veterans Act, introduced by Senator Manchin and Senator  Capito of West Virginia. Representative McKinley introduced a companion  measure, H.R. 5616, here in the House.   This bipartisan bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to  submit to Congress two critical reports relating to patient safety and  quality of care at its medical facilities.   This bill was introduced in the wake of a disturbingly tragic series  of patient deaths that occurred in 2017 and 2018 at the Clarksburg,  West Virginia, VA Medical Center.   This past July, a nursing assistant who worked at the Clarksburg VA  Medical Center pleaded guilty to seven counts of second-degree murder  and one count of assault to commit murder after unnecessarily injecting  several veteran patients with insulin with the intent to cause death.   There are no words to adequately express the sorrow we feel for the  families of veterans whose lives were tragically cut short in  Clarksburg. There are countless questions about how this could have  happened and what the Department of Veterans Affairs is doing to better  protect veteran patients in the future, not only in Clarksburg, but in  other VA facilities nationwide.   The first report outlined in this bill and mandated by S. 3147, which  is due within 30 days of enactment, requires the VA to outline the  Department's policies and procedures related to monitoring patient  safety and suspicious deaths, ensuring proper storage and access  controls for high-risk substances, trafficking employees' contact with  veteran patients, and removing from patient care employees who are  implicated in suspicious deaths.                                time  1715    The Improving Safety and Security for Veterans Act also requires the  VA to submit to Congress an after-action report on the events that  occurred in Clarksburg. Among other things, the report will detail the  timeline of events at Clarksburg and the actions taken at the facility  level and throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs in response to  these tragic and suspicious deaths.  [[Page H5748]]    We can only hope that S. 3147, the Improving Safety and Security for  Veterans Act, will serve as a first step toward better understanding  what gaps in VA management existed and what actions the Department  still needs to take to protect our veterans.   We also hope that this measure will serve as a foundation for helping  to restore veterans' confidence in the safety, security, and quality of  the care delivered at VA medical facilities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in passing S.  3147.   I want to thank Mr. McKinley for introducing this bill in the House  and Senator Manchin for working very diligently in the Senate to bring  this legislation before us today because, as Mr. McKinley said, we do  need to provide assurance to our veterans about their safety in our VA  health centers, both in Clarksburg and across the country.   I also want to thank Mr. Bilirakis, my colleague on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, for his work on this and all the bills that we have  reviewed today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing S. 3147, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
