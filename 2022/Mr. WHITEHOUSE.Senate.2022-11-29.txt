 Madam President, I rise today to honor an  important advocate for environmental preservation and addressing  climate change, Greg Gerritt. Mr. Gerritt has worked for the past 20  years for the Environmental Council of Rhode Island, retiring in  January of this year. He served as the coordinator for the Compost  Initiative, which earned a 2012 EPA Region 1 Merit Award, and founded  the Rhode Island Compost Conference. Last year, the Environmental  Protection Agency awarded him an Environmental Merit for Lifetime  Achievement.   Mr. Gerritt grew up in New York City before earning a bachelor's  degree in anthropology from University of Maine. He organized his high  school's first Earth Day and has since continuously engaged across  communities to support a sustainable green economy in Rhode Island. He  founded and served on the board of the Environmental Justice League of  Rhode Island, began the Buy Nothing Day Winter Coat Exchange, which has  occurred on the day after Thanksgiving for over 20 years, and ran for  mayor of Providence as a Green Party candidate. Mr. Gerritt also  founded and is the watershed steward for Friends of the Moshassuck, an  organization dedicated to preservation, restoration, and revitalization  of the Moshassuck River. He created a wetland habitat by restoring a  small stormwater drain in the North Burial Ground in Providence and,  for over a decade, has produced about 1,500 videos documenting wildlife  in this urban landscape and at locations around the Seekonk River.   I am pleased to recognize Mr. Gerritt's accomplishments in  environmental advocacy, justice, and preservation of natural resources  and extend my appreciation for his work for our State and  environment.                            ____________________
