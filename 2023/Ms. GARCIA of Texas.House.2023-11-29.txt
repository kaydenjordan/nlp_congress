 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition  to this bill.   If MAGA Republicans want a real, bipartisan solution for our broken  immigration system, they should sign up and support my American Dream  and Promise Act.   Today, our country is home to millions of Dreamers. These are people  who were brought to the United States as children and grew up here. In  their heart, in their mind, and in their soul they are Americans except  on paper.   This is their country. This is their home. If Congress does nothing,  we will lose our neighbors, our family members, and friends. We will  lose fellow Americans.   With the American Dream and Promise Act, House Democrats have a  plan--with bipartisan support--to finally create a pathway to  citizenship for Dreamers and immigrant families.   Make no mistake, this is not a partisan issue. Over 70 percent of  Americans favor a law providing permanent legal status to Dreamers.  This is a real solution. The American Dream and Promise Act will have a  life-changing effect on every single district in this country.   Take it from me, I was born and raised in south Texas. I recognize  the importance of securing our border to protect the integrity of our  Nation.   Extreme MAGA Republicans have introduced a pitiful excuse to spread  anti-immigrant rhetoric. Their bill fails to protect this country. It  will not make us safer.   Their bill weaponizes the Federal Government against those who have  the least. It mocks what this country stands for.   The gentlewoman from New York should look out into the New York  Harbor to the statue that embodies the American promise: ``Give me your  tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''   In America, we welcome those fleeing harm. We welcome those who  believe in the American Dream. Americans support Dreamers and Dreamers  support America. I am opposed to this bill.
