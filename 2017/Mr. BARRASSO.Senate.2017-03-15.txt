 Mr. President, joining my colleague here on the floor,  I agree with all of the comments the Senator from Arizona has made.  They are interesting because as to the history of the State of the  Senator from Arizona and his family history, Judge Gorsuch has a  similar history, to the point that his great-grandfather built a hotel  in Wyoming called the Wolf Hotel, in Saratoga, WY. I found a picture of  that hotel from 1878, which was 12 years before Wyoming became a State.  I got that picture from the American history museum at the University  of Wyoming and got a copy of the picture and gave it to Judge Gorsuch.   In front of the hotel in 1878, there was a stagecoach with six horses  lined up ahead of it. The Wolf Hotel was a halfway stop on the  stagecoach line between a couple of communities in Wyoming. They were  about 40 miles apart. So that is the heritage from which Judge Gorsuch  comes.   I think that western heritage is important. But I think that  additionally important is what the Senator referred to--his judicial  temperament, being such a mainstream member of the judiciary, and this  general belief inherent within him that the role of a judge is to apply  the law, not to legislate from the bench.   We have seen so much legislating from the bench. I think you just  don't get that if you take somebody from the Rocky Mountain West who  has this view of the Nation and an understanding of the rule of law and  the Constitution.   So I think we are going to see that when the Senate Judiciary  Committee begins its hearings next week on Judge Gorsuch's nomination  to the Supreme Court. I visited with him, reviewed his writings, and  then compared it to what I saw when I visited with Justice Scalia when  he came to Wyoming. The Senator from Arizona mentioned the picture of  the two working together, fishing together.   I just think he is the right person to continue that incredible  legacy of Justice Scalia.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well, it is about 50-50. But when you talk about the  heavy hand of a bureaucratic government and the impact on the lives of  the people who live there, it is dramatic. It can be very punishing, as  we have seen over the last 8 years with regulations that have come out  of agencies--sometimes, I believe, in defiance of the law, sometimes  reversed by the Supreme Court.   That is why I think it is critical to have Neil Gorsuch on the  Supreme Court, because he is someone who realizes that the Constitution  is a legal document--not a living document, not built for flexibility,  but really a rigid legal document. That is where I believe he stands.  That is what his writings indicate. It is the sort of thing we have  seen from him. I visited with him, and other Members have. These are  the things we read about.   With regard to his writings over the years, this is a judge who has  faithfully applied the law--applied the law, focusing on the  Constitution. He has not been afraid to rule against the government or  for unpopular parties when the law demands it because he is going to go  right back to the law. I believe his opinions show great reverence for  all of the Constitution--a key respect for the importance of the  separation of powers.   I support his nomination completely. It is interesting, because when  he was nominated for the position he currently holds, the Democratic  Senator from Colorado--and I am expecting Senator Cory Gardner to be  here in a little bit to talk about the quote from Ken Salazar, the  former Senator from Colorado, who talked about what a wonderful man  Judge Gorsuch was and how he should be put onto that bench. He was  unanimously confirmed here in the Senate.   I have full confidence in Judge Gorsuch as a son of the West, as the  only Justice from the Rocky Mountain West who would be on the Court.  Specifically, though, I would support him no matter where he was from  because of his belief that it is the role of a judge and a justice to  apply the law, not to legislate from the bench, which I think goes  above and beyond where someone is from, what their background may be.  But I will just tell you that his background, combined with his  philosophy and mainstream approach to the law, is exactly what we need  now in 2017 on the U.S. Supreme Court. I believe he deserves an up-or- down vote. I believe he will be confirmed as people get a chance to see  him, get to know him better.   I see I am joined on the floor by another colleague, also from the  Rocky Mountain West, the Senator from Montana. You have heard from  Arizona, Wyoming, and now Montana. I would ask him about his thoughts  about this nomination by President Trump of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme  Court.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.  [[Page S1823]]         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Coats  nomination?    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk called the roll.
