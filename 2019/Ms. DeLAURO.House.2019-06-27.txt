 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this emergency  supplemental bill.   Madam Speaker, the principles guiding this bill were clear from the  outset. It is a response to a humanitarian crisis.   By increasing the housing capacity at Health and Human Services to  moving these vulnerable children from the detention centers at Customs  and Border Protection as quickly as possible to Health and Human  Services, because we know what the conditions are at CBP. They are  deplorable. In fact, it is government-sponsored child abuse.   We wanted to build in the protections for children that have been  nonexistent in the past, and we uncovered those abuses. They have been  reported in the press. The Miami Herald just recently said they are  ``prison-like conditions'' at Homestead.   And we wanted to place children with a sponsor in a safe placement, a  safe environment, as expeditiously as possible to reverse the  administration's policy of frightening sponsors to come forward.   This bill includes strong protections and safeguards for these  vulnerable children; it extends to the influx shelters' enhanced  standards of care. And, my friends, it is for the first time ever.  These protections have never been required of these influx shelters.   It continues to prevent the waiving of core standards and protections  after 6 months.   It continues to hold influx shelters accountable by requiring HHS to  remove an operator if they do not comply with these core standards.                                time  1245    If the shelter is not in compliance, then HHS is required to award  the contract to a new service provider, and the bill continues to  protect sponsors and potential sponsors by extending a provision that  prohibits funds from being used to put anyone into a removal proceeding  based on information from HHS' sponsor-vetting process.   The bill continues to require HHS to maintain the directives that  they issued in December that removed bureaucratic barriers and have  helped to place these children with sponsors as expeditiously as  possible. And the bill continues to require HHS to report to Congress  within 24 hours if an unaccompanied child dies in HHS custody.    Madam Speaker, a child did die in HHS custody. No one  knew about this for 8 months, and it was only the news media that  uncovered it. A child died.  [[Page H5236]]    This bill continues to ensure that Members of Congress can conduct  oversight visits of shelters without being required to provide advance  notice, and the bill continues to protect taxpayer funding by  prohibiting funds from being diverted to programs outside of Health and  Human Services. This bill provides clear direction, legal guardrails,  about how our emergency funds should be used, and this bill wages the  battle for the vulnerable.   Madam Speaker, I urge every Member of this House to support this  bill.
