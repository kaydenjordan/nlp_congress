 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I rise  today in opposition to S. 613, legislation that would ban transgender  women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their  gender.   My Republican colleagues falsely claim that allowing transgender  women and girls to play sports is harmful to cisgender women and girls.  They continue to hurl insulting lies about transgender girls dominating  sports. But what is true is that these bans are deeply harmful to  transgender girls, particularly transgender girls of color, girls who  are gender nonconforming, and cisgender girls as well. These ``sex  tests'' invade every girl's privacy and open the door to harassment for  anyone who is perceived as ``different.''   If my Republican colleagues were actually worried about women and  girls in athletics, they would join in our efforts to address unequal  athletic opportunities in school, unequal pay, sexual abuse and  harassment, and more. But this isn't about supporting women and girls;  this is about power and control. My Republican colleagues are obsessed  with controlling women's bodies and our lives, as we are seeing yet  again today.   But instead of being honest about what they are doing, many on the  other side claim that this bill is somehow a defense of title IX. That  couldn't be further from the truth. Title IX says:         No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,       be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of,       or be subjected to discrimination under any education program       or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.    As someone who knew and was friends with Patsy Mink, the author of  title IX, I can tell you she would be standing right next to me to say  title IX in no way or shape supports what my colleague is attempting to  do. Patsy spent her entire life fighting to advance equal opportunity  for women and girls. It would pain her to know that the bill she fought  so hard to make law is being twisted by Republicans to discriminate  against the very people it was designed to protect.   Republicans have the wrong priorities. We shouldn't be banning anyone  from playing sports. We should be fighting the discrimination that all  women and girls--trans, cis, or otherwise--continue to face in  athletics, in the classroom, and in the workplace.   For these reasons, I object.
