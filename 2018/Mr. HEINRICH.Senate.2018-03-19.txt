 Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent due to a death  in my family for rollcall votes Nos. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55. Had I  been present I would have voted nay on all the rollcall votes in  relation to S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and  Consumer Protection Act. I would have also voted nay on the motion to  invoke cloture on the nomination of Kevin McAleenan to be Commissioner  of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, rollcall vote No. 55; PN1373.                            ____________________
