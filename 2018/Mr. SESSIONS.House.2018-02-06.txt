 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 727 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 727         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for       the flying of the flag at half-staff in the event of the       death of a first responder in the line of duty, with the       Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,       without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his       designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment with       an amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-58 modified by the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The Senate       amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without       intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Rochester, New York  (Ms. Slaughter), my dear friend and ranking member of the Rules  Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H822]]  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and  the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1892, the Further Extension of Continuing  Appropriations Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, the House amendment will extend government funding until  March 23, 2018, while simultaneously funding the Department of Defense  for a full year. This will ensure our Nation's defense and pay for our  proud servicemen and -women who will no longer be in jeopardy during  ongoing discussions on funding for the long-term spending caps, until  we agree to that.   Mr. Speaker, we just have come out of Rules Committee where we had a  hearing for several hours where we detailed not only the parts of this  bill, but also the agreement and disagreement between the two parties.  I want you to know that I am pleased to report today the Rules  Committee favorably reported out this bill, and we will be talking  about the substance of that today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague for being here  so that we may move forward on this important funding for the  government.   Mr. Speaker, from time to time, there are Members of Congress who  distinguish themselves in ways that draw not only attention upon an  organization more than just themselves, but also distinction. Our next  speaker is a gentleman who served for 14 years in the United States Air  Force. He holds the record for the fastest nonstop flight ever in the  world in one of the United States Air Force planes that is called a B-1  bomber. This gentleman not only served with distinction and honor but  is here today to speak about the importance of funding our United  States military.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge, also, Mr. Stewart's service  to the United States Air Force and this country.   Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to talk with a security officer  from Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Kevin Fahland. Lieutenant Fahland  essentially told me: We are out in the middle of the Pacific faced with  danger every day, and we represent the greatest Nation in the history  of the world. Please do us a favor and recognize that we need the  funding to continue what is an aggressive race against us.   He is a lieutenant in the Navy, a security officer, who sees  firsthand the attack, all sorts of ways, at Pearl Harbor that happens  every day, and it is his job to protect this great Nation. I want to  thank the lieutenant and other members of the United States Navy and  the United States military for their service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess) from the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is amazing how the President, by honing the message and focusing  his ideas on Congress, has brought this entire issue to a forefront.   Last year, the President said: I am calling on Congress to please  resolve this issue with the DACA people who are in this country. I am  asking Congress to please do this by next March.   Now he is being treated--instead of like a firefighter, he is being  treated like an arsonist; and he is not. He is the person who has the  ability and the desire to lead Congress, on a bipartisan basis; lots of  meetings down at the White House. For months now that has been  happening, with the date of March.   What happens?   Somebody gets frustrated and they want not what we agreed to do in  March, but they want it in January--actually, December, rather than  attempting to work with the President, who, I believe, forthrightly,  has held lots of meetings.   So, Mr. Speaker, what I would say to you is that it is a moving  target. There is never something that this President can do that will  satisfy our colleagues on the other side. If it is not DACA, it is  going to be the caps issue. If it is not the caps issue, it is going to  be the military issue. If it is not the military issue, it is going to  be Children's Health Insurance Program.   Mr. Speaker, we are addressing those. We are trying to bring those  issues professionally, on a bipartisan basis. Just a week ago--10 days  ago, we respectfully did not include yearlong funding for the United  States military.   What did we hear back over and over and over from the other body?   They said: Well, I would have voted for this bill, but the funding  for the military is not in there for a 1-year basis for the remainder  of the year.   So that is what we have done. We are trying to bring forth ideas of  agreement that say we need to find a deal. We need to come to an  agreement. We recognize this is not the last funding agreement for the  year, but what we are trying to do is to avoid a government shutdown.  The way you do that is by voting ``yes,'' and that is what we are  asking people to do today.   That is why we had Dr. Burgess. That is why we had Major Chris  Stewart, the United States Congressman from Utah. That is also why we  have the gentleman from Waterford Township, Michigan, here, a member of  the Republican leadership, a bright, young, thoughtful, articulate man.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a year or so ago, I received a rather urgent phone call  from Dr. Shelley Hall from Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas  and Dr. Rick Snyder from Medical City in Dallas, which are hospitals,  and they spoke with me about a change in the law some year and some ago  that would change infusion therapy.   What is infusion therapy? It involves administering medication  through a needle or a catheter, which is prescribed when a patient's  condition is so severe that it cannot be treated effectively by oral  medications, meaning, through this needle or the opportunity for a  catheter. What happened was there was a change in the law that did not  fully fund this effort.   ``Home infusion'' means, instead of having to receive this in the  hospital, which is more expensive, they would be able to do this at  home, and the doctor would manage that. As a result of the change in  some law and funding levels, that stopped the patients from being able  to do this at home.   I want to congratulate Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee, for working not only with these doctors, but also with  me on this insistence that we go and review this,  [[Page H827]]  an opportunity for more effective healthcare and cost effective from  the perspective of not only the patient, but also to make sure that  physicians would stay involved in the health of their patients.   I would like to thank Dr. Shelley Hall of Baylor University Medical  Center and Dr. Rick Snyder, both from Dallas, Texas, for working with  me to make sure that this change happened today.   This is one of the pages of the changes that we are making today, to  go in and offer some corrections and to update and extend the  privileges that we have in this country to have the greatest healthcare  system in the world.   I want to thank Chairman Brady for his work, and his staff, to make  sure this was involved in this change today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentlewoman's advocacy because, in many respects, I  feel the same way. But I would offer, in speaking to you, Mr. Speaker,  that you made sure this House passed the $81 billion spending bill on  October 12 last year. The House of Representatives, through the  leadership of not only Speaker Ryan, but also the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) were tasked with the duty of making sure  that we would take feedback from States, from cities, and came up with  a figure of $81 billion. That is not in any way not living up to our  responsibility, Mr. Speaker.   We are the ones who did this--this whole body. It is stuck in the  United States Senate, and the President and this administration have  not been authorized to spend more than what has been appropriated.  [[Page H829]]         I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    And continue to right now.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time because the gentlewoman  is going to switch subjects.   I would tell the gentlewoman that the House, respectfully, before we  got to any tax cut bill, made sure that we did a constitutionally  responsible thing, and that was to make sure that we measured three  times, sawed once, came up with the $81 billion. It is, in my opinion,  something that the United States Senate needs to solve.   I would also add that I don't know what the Democratic Party is doing  over there to push this issue. I think it needs to be an important  attribute. But we are waiting for the Senate, Mr. Speaker. And for us  to blame both houses, I think, is not fair to the leadership that Paul  Ryan has provided, to the leadership that Rodney Frelinghuysen has  contributed to this effort, and most of all, Mr. Speaker, to the people  who voted for the bill in the House. They did the responsible action.  And I think that if we are going to do anything, we need to look to the  United States Senate, which is constitutionally required.   President Trump and Vice President Pence not only visited the ravaged  areas, but they tried to provide the leadership. But it is up to the  constitutional provisions of the United States Senate, and that is  where the problem lies.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman, my dear friend from Rochester, New York, not  only for her working together, but for her long hours that are a  requirement of being on the Rules Committee; for her leadership not  only of her team, but each of the individuals who represent not only  her team, but, really, Members of Congress, and the collegial activity  that she brings to the table. I thank the gentlewoman very much for  that.    Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to ensure our Nation's servicemen  and -women are adequately trained for missions and to support this  great Nation. We have talked about several members of the military  today. My son is at Pearl Harbor also and is on duty as we speak today.  He is proud of his service to the United States Navy.   There are proud parents all over the country, patriots, veterans,  people who deeply believe in our military. We have got to get this  funding done. That is what we are doing here today.   This rule and the underlying legislation provides funding for the  Federal Government and fully funds our Nation's military. But I will  tell you that the discussions we have had here today are similar to  what we had at the Rules Committee.   The gentlewoman gave us credit. The Republican Party is the party of  fiscal responsibility. But also, I would say to you, we are trying to  do the right thing across the board, not just what we do today. But  what we are faced with is similar to a changing viewpoint about how  someone justifies a ``no'' vote; a ``no'' vote that they know means  that while they are for something, they can't vote for it because of an  issue.   Just an hour ago at the Rules Committee, we had a Democratic Member  who came and wanted more money for a specific project. And I asked that  Member how much money were we going to spend in the budget this year.  They didn't know. I asked: How much do you want to add to that?   They said: Well, I don't know.   It is a continuing drumbeat that we, as Republicans, are puzzled by.  And that is: Why do we fund the government fully for the entire year?   Let's know how much we have agreed to, and then let's make a  determination if we are not meeting the needs.   Mr. Speaker, this Congress must ask the tough questions, but this  Congress must be up to tough decisionmaking also. I was sent to  Congress to make tough decisions, not just popular decisions. So I  think I would recalculate each of us today and say the bill that we  have on the floor today and the rule are designed to fund the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year.   We would ask that all Members really look deep within them and let's  end this mess that we are in. Let's fund this effort and let's look to  March 23, when we can finalize all that we have done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying legislation.    Mr. Speaker, when the Committee on Rules filed its  report (H. Rept. 115-547) to accompany House Resolution 727) the  Committee was unaware that the waiver of all points of order against  consideration of the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment to H.R.  1892 included:   A waiver of section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which  prohibits consideration of legislation providing new budget authority  in excess of a 302(a) allocation of such authority.   A waiver of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, which  prohibits consideration of legislation that would cause the level  [[Page H830]]  of total new budget authority for the first fiscal year to be exceeded,  or would cause revenues to be less than the level of total revenues for  the first fiscal year or for the total of that first fiscal year and  the ensuing fiscal years for which allocations are provided.   A waiver of clause 10 of rule XXI, which prohibits the consideration  of a bill if it has the net effect of increasing mandatory spending  over the five-year or ten-year period.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 727 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . . . [and] has       no substantive legislative or policy implications       whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said.       Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . . . When       the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of       the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to       ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then       controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or       yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
