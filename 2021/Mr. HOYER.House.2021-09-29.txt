 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee for yielding. As you can tell, he is a good friend of mine,  and he uses hyperbole in introducing me. I appreciate that.   The ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee just made a  comment. I don't think anybody has clean hands on this issue. I tell  the ranking member, I don't think anybody has clean hands. I don't know  the exact voting pattern of the ranking member. I think he probably has  been on both sides of this issue himself. I think I have been.   But I will tell the ranking member, if I am here when there is a  Republican President--and I do not wish for that end, of course. But if  I am here, I want to guarantee you that I will vote to lift the debt  limit--guarantee you.   I said 3 years ago, I would never vote against raising the debt limit  and keeping America's creditworthy status, never. In my view, it is  intellectually dishonest to do so.   This is a phony issue, and anybody who is intellectually honest with  themselves knows it is a phony issue because it has no relationship to  what the debt is. The debt relates to when we cut revenues or spend  money, not some arbitrary limit that we theoretically put on our debt.  We ought to be honest with the American public because too many people  demagogue about this issue.   Madam Speaker, on Monday, Senate Republicans voted against keeping  the government open and paying the bills that our Nation has already  incurred. That was not a reflection of responsible opposition in a  democracy.   We talk about the loyal opposition. The loyal opposition ought not to  be loyal to the majority, but they ought to be loyal to the country.  Instead, their vote is a reckless and irrational action that signaled  very clearly to the American people, the financial markets, and the  international community that Republicans would choose to precipitate an  economic catastrophe for American businesses and families to score  political points against President Biden and Democrats. That is what is  happening here today.   Three times over the past 4 years, House and Senate Republicans voted  to suspend the debt limit when President Trump asked them to do so. I  have no idea what President Trump is asking people to do at this point  in time, but my experience is it is not the responsible thing.   Madam Speaker, when they asked Democrats for our help taking that  needed step in order to prevent a catastrophic default, we joined with  them to vote for it.   When Speaker Boehner could only get 78 of his colleagues to vote with  him to maintain fiscal responsibility in this country, only 78--I guess  77 because he was the 78th--would follow. And how did those bills  carry? Because we, in the minority, joined with Speaker Boehner.   When Speaker Ryan did the same thing, couldn't get the majority of  his own colleagues to back him, we gave the necessary votes to pursue  and to ensure fiscal responsibility. Why? Because it was the right  thing to do, because it was the necessary and responsible thing to do.   Treasury Secretary Yellen told us yesterday that we will run out of  extraordinary measures to forestall a default on October 18. That is  fewer than 20 days from today.   Yet, we talk about partisanship, and we accuse others of not doing it  one time or not doing it another time. This is the one time. This is  our time. This is the time that the vote presents itself to us to keep  America's creditworthy status and to prohibit a national and  international crisis.   There is an urgency to our action, and we twiddle our partisan  thumbs.   Leader McConnell, I am sure, has been quoted frequently. I haven't  heard all the debate, but frequently. ``Let me make it perfectly clear.  The country must never default. The debt ceiling will need to be  raised.'' That is his quote.   Now, what he didn't add was: But I am not going to help. But I am  going to ask my party to be irresponsible. But I am going to ask my  party not to do what I say should never happen and allow the country to  default.   I don't know how you rationalize that. I don't know how anybody with  intellectual honesty rationalizes that, Madam Speaker, that you think  we must never default, but by the way, I won't vote for it.   What does that mean? What kind of language is that? What kind of lack  of principle is that?   In order to give him and his fellow Republicans one last opportunity  to prevent a default at a time when our recovery from the pandemic is  not yet complete and still quite fragile, today, we are considering a  clean debt limit suspension, not a number, just a date, which is, by  the way, what both Republicans and Democrats have used in the past.   The bill before us simply says the United States of America will pay  its bills on time. What a radical proposition.   Yet, our Republican friends cannot summon the intention to do just  that. If Senate Republicans still cannot be consistent with their own  votes from the past 4 years, they can stand aside and, as Leader  McConnell has suggested, vote for cloture to allow Democrats to pass  the bill with 51 votes. At least do that. At least have the courage to  allow others to display the courage of standing up and voting for what  they know is absolutely essential and what they have said is absolutely  essential.   But if you believe that the full faith and credit of our country is  worth safeguarding, that our businesses and working families deserve to  be spared unnecessary economic pain, then vote ``yes'' on both sides of  the aisle.   This is not a partisan vote. This is an American vote. This is for  our country. This is for our fiscal responsibility. This is for fiscal  stability. This is for families.                                time  1530    Don't twiddle your thumbs and say it is a partisan vote. It is not.   A ``yes'' vote on this bill is not a victory for Democrats or for the  President. It is the responsible thing to do and a victory for our  country. Although we ought never to get to this place, we get to it all  time, because we  [[Page H5534]]  play these silly, partisan, pedantic, weak, meritless arguments.   Everybody knows we have to do this. To sit there and say, ``Well, I  am not going to do it'' is not fulfilling the oath to defend and  protect this great Nation and this great democracy.
