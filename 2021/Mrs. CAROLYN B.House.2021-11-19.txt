 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the Build Back Better Act.   The Oversight Committee, which I chair, authored several key sections  of this bill, which together will allocate nearly $14 billion.   My committee's sections are more than just numbers on a page--they  represent a substantial and genuine investment in our future.   We have no future if we don't get serious about combatting climate  change, and my committee's title would make the federal government a  leader on combatting climate change by electrifying the federal  government's vehicle fleet, and building the fleet of the future.   Our title includes nearly $3 billion for GSA to purchase tens of  thousands of electric vehicles and build the infrastructure necessary  to support them.   It also includes nearly $6 billion for the Postal Service to purchase  electric vehicles for its new fleet, and to build the infrastructure  necessary to charge these vehicles.   EVs are a sensible and cost-effective investment that will reduce  emissions and keep the federal government competitive.   The title also includes $4 billion for GSA to expand the use of  emerging green technologies and ensure that federal buildings are  modernized with greener construction materials and modern environmental  systems.   I'm especially pleased that we've included dedicated funding for OMB  to support implementation of the Act and track labor, equity, and  environmental standards and performance.   Our title also includes funding to ensure proper oversight of these  programs.   It is critical that the House pass the Build Back Better Act as  quickly as possible so that we can get this to the President's desk  without delay.   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.    MALONEY of  New York, Messrs. STANTON, CARSON, MOULTON, and MFUME changed their  vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''   Messrs. GRAVES of Louisiana, HOLLINGSWORTH, DAVIDSON, GOSAR, PALMER,  and EMMER changed their vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''   So the motion to recommit was rejected.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
