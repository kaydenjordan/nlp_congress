 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of California  State Senator Robert Presley. His life's work represents some of the  best of what Riverside can produce.   He was a war hero and was awarded the Bronze Star in World War II. He  was an honorable law enforcement officer, and earned the reputation of  being a fair truth seeker, even during times of unrest in Riverside. He  was an honest public servant. He accomplished great things for  Riverside, and moved our State forward as a California State Senator.   When I was in my twenties, Bob gave me a chance. He named me as his  alternate to the Central Committee of the Riverside County Democratic  Party, which allowed me to follow my passion for public service, and  for that, I will always be grateful.   Bob will be dearly missed, but his name, his work, his Democratic  spirit, and the legacy he left behind will be cherished by our  community forever.                            ____________________
