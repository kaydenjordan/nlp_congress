 Mr. President, today, I want to discuss legislation I am  introducing, the School Infrastructure Modernization Act.   To claim the Federal tax credit for historic preservation, a building  renovation must be for a different purpose than that for which the  building was previously used, a requirement known as the ``prior use''  rule. This bill waives that requirement for renovations of K-12 public  school buildings. This will make it easier to restore historic-but- dilapidated school buildings across the country so our children have  safe, modern spaces in which to learn.   As a Richmond City Council member and later mayor, I faced challenges  familiar to many municipalities: overcrowded schools, aging buildings,  and limited dollars in the budget. But in one particular case, I and a  group of local stakeholders identified a creative solution. On one  hand, we had an overcrowded Thomas Jefferson High School with in-zone  and magnet students. On the other hand, we had a closed Maggie Walker  High School that needed renovations. We put together a financing  package that made use of Federal and State historic tax credits to  renovate Maggie Walker High School and satisfied the prior use rule by  consolidating the magnet program from Thomas Jefferson into a new  Maggie Walker Governor's School for Government and International  Studies. Today, some 20 years later, this is one of America's highest  performing public high schools. Without the Federal historic tax  credit, this would have been too expensive to make happen.   This bill will make it easier to do similar projects around the  country. More modern school buildings will bolster the quality of  public education, and carrying out these projects will generate private  sector infrastructure investment and jobs. In Virginia alone, according  to a 2013 study, more than 800 K-12 schools are at least 50 years old,  representing some 40 percent of all the K-12 schools in the  Commonwealth.   As the Senate considers tax reform and a comprehensive infrastructure  package, I encourage my colleagues to support this common-sense  incentive that is good for education, good for infrastructure, and good  for jobs.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself and Mr. Schatz):   S. 2884. A bill to amend the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and  Trade Act of 1990 to provide research and extension grants to combat  plant pests and noxious weeds that impact coffee plants, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
