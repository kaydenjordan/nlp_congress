 Mr. Speaker, every day, we wake up and we have a choice of  how we can look at the world: through the murkiness of fear or through  the clarity of truth. I challenge you to choose clarity, choose a  perspective that is grounded in truth and in love.   Today, President Trump announced the opening of the Victims of  Immigration Crime Engagement Office, or VOICE, an office that will spew  propaganda highlighting crimes committed by immigrants as opposed to  equally harmful crimes committed by nonimmigrants. It is a waste of  taxpayer money that will manipulate law enforcement data in an attempt  to play on fears and anxieties.   I am countering the opening of VOICE with the Saved By American  Immigrants National Task Force, SAINT. The SAINT task force will  collect and share stories of the countless immigrants who have saved  Americans lives through heroic acts.   I am calling for stories like the story of Maytham Alshadood, a  Coloradan who grew up in Baghdad. He aspired to be veterinarian and  began his studies, worked with the American Army as a translator, and  had to leave because of the increase in violence. He came under a  special immigrant visa. He started school in America. He is now a  registered nurse, saving and transforming lives in America every day,  including those of veterans.   Let us reject attempts to fearmonger and tear apart American  families, families that are just like ours, families that are ours.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to begin by wishing my colleague from Georgia a happy  International Copyright Day, right up there with Thanksgiving and  Christmas as great American holidays.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying  bill. Look, first of all, 60 hours; we have less than 60 hours before  the Federal Government of the United States will shut down, and here we  are filling time with a bill. Of course, the concept deserves to be  debated and fleshed out, but is it really what we should be talking  about when we are 60 hours away from the shutdown of our Federal  Government?   Now, it feels like we have been here before. Now, sometimes it is  because, unfortunately, we have been brought to the brink of economic  disaster, just as Republicans seem to do every time government funding  or the debt ceiling is about to expire. We know it has happened before.  We know it will happen again.   Maybe it is time for a short-term CR; maybe it is an omnibus, but,  look, that is what we should be doing right now. There will be plenty  of time, plenty of time to figure out the intricacies of copyright and  the oversight of the Office after we make sure that the basic functions  of government are able to continue after 60 hours.   And even if we do keep the government open, all we are doing is  kicking the can down the road and not allowing American businesses or  individuals to plan for the future.   Can you imagine if your family didn't know if you would have a job or  what salary it would be at every few months?   Now, look, congressional salaries, they are exempt from government  shutdowns, of course. If they weren't, perhaps we would be discussing  the government shutdown with 60 hours to go until other Federal workers  are prevented from coming to work.   Even at this moment, we don't have a full-year appropriations bill.  We have a continuing resolution that expires midnight on Friday. Those  are the priority issues that the American people want us to focus on.  When we deal with what is urgent, that will allow us the time and the  space for thoughtful consideration of Copyright Office oversight.   We need to get past this bitter partisanship and this brinksmanship.  Even the rule we are considering today is problematic and partisan,  which is why I am in staunch opposition. It doesn't allow all the  amendments to come to the floor, including one from my colleague, Ms.  Lofgren, that I tried to amend the rule to allow, and it was turned  down in Rules Committee by a partisan vote.   We don't have an open rule, as Speaker Ryan promised to provide as we  got back to what was called regular order, allowing our Democratic and  Republican colleagues to improve and enhance bills, offer their ideas  up for consideration. If a majority adopt them, they can be included in  the overall bill.   Instead, we are considering a rule that effectively stops debate on  important amendments that were omitted and brings forward a politically  motivated bill about the head of the Copyright Office.   Simply put, this bill would take the authority of hiring and firing  the Copyright Register, who is the head of the Copyright Office, from  the Librarian of Congress, and give it to the President, with Senate  approval. It effectively politicizes the Office of the head of the  Copyright Office.   Now, it sounds innocuous, but what it means is that special interests  will be involved with picking the person to make decisions over who  receives a copyright. Yet, again, through this bill, Congress is  choosing the big, powerful interests over the consumers, over  innovation, and over the little guy.   As the Electronic Frontier Foundation said: this bill is ``designed  to . . . allow powerful incumbent interests to use their lobbying power  to control this increasingly politicized Office. And while the  Librarian of Congress still oversees the Copyright Office, the  Librarian of Congress would not be able to remove the Register no  matter how poorly they perform their job.''   Under this bill, the position of Register of Copyrights will be yet  another political position and will, frankly, stall one of the great  projects they are embarking on, the modernization effort that is  desperately needed at the Copyright Office. The last thing we need is  political cronyism in the Copyright Office.    Let's talk a little bit about the history of the position of the head  of the Copyright Office. Most of the first century of America, U.S.  District Court clerks processed copyright applications themselves. Now,  that was obviously inefficient to foist on the judicial branch, and, in  1870, Congress centralized the power of copyrights at the Library of  Congress. Seven years later, the Copyright Office was created as a  separate department within the Library, and the Register of Copyrights  was established as the head of that Office.   Why depart from history so radically now? Why give in to increasing  executive authority in a time when many of us are concerned about the  growing powers of the Presidency? Frankly, some of this seems to be  about the personal dislike of the Librarian, Dr. Carla Hayden, or the  general situation with the most recent Register who departed last  October, Maria Pallante.   It appears that some believe that Dr. Hayden should not have  reassigned Ms. Pallante, so there is a micromanaging of particular  personnel issues, but an inspector general's report stated that Ms.  Pallante was clearly deficient in her duties, especially around those  of modernization of the Office.   As just one example, the inspector general discovered that the  Copyright Office wasted 6 years and nearly $12 million attempting to  implement an Electronic Licensing System. Based on the IG report, it  would seem that the Librarian had a valid reason to reassign the  Copyright Register last October, and she definitely had every right to  do so, as the head of the Library. The last thing we want is  politically motivated decisionmaking in a personnel process around  performance at the Library of Congress.  [[Page H2863]]    Since the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was appointed in  2015, she has been pulling the Library of Congress and the Copyright  Office into the 21st century. And if we move the appointment into the  hands of the President, we are taking away the ability for the  Librarian to supervise the Office of Copyright and continue to do this  work. We are going to stop progress dead in its tracks.   With hundreds of Presidential appointees who haven't even been  nominated, no less approved, and the glacial pace of Congress, it could  be years before a Librarian is confirmed under this new scheme.   Look, we all understand and agree that there are problems that we  need to work on together with regard to the copyright process to bring  it into the 21st century. Again, with 60 hours away from a government  shutdown, now might be a time to focus on keeping government open and  perhaps having a more thoughtful debate, removing the passions around  the personnel involved after we continue to keep government open.   This bill, unfortunately, does not solve the problems with  copyrights. It makes the situation worse because it slows down a  desperately needed modernization indefinitely and would hurt the public  and consumers.   The last thing we need is a more autonomous Copyright Office. After  the obscene wasting of taxpayer dollars, do we really want to provide  for more politically motivated decisionmaking within the Office of the  Copyright? I think the answer is no; that is why I oppose the rule. I  oppose the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished ranking member on the  Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.    I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), who is the ranking member on the  Subcommittee of Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet on the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today President Trump plans to unveil a tax cut proposal  that would vastly reduce the business tax rate for international  corporations and even for his own real estate empire. We have no way of  knowing how many millions he personally might save through this so- called Trump loophole--no idea--unless he releases his tax returns.  Democrats have been calling on the President to release his tax returns  for this reason and so many others. We cannot allow the White House to  be used as a tool to enrich the President and his family.   Up until now, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax  return information. These returns have provided a basic level of  transparency to help to ensure the public's interest is placed first.  The American people deserve the same level of disclosure from this  administration. If they continue to refuse to provide it, then we, as  the people's elected Representatives, should hold the executive branch  accountable.   If not us, who?   Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, which  would require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to  simply release their tax returns.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our excellent proposal, I yield 4  minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What I really think this bill is about is President Trump wanting to  put a Big Business friend in charge of an office that can do personal  favors for him and his family. We know that the President and his  family have, or are seeking, dozens of copyrights. Here is a great  one--here is a copyright on his book, ``Trump: The Best Golf Advice I  Ever Received.'' Now, don't get me wrong, he probably deserved a  copyright. I am sure a ghostwriter wrote it for him and he had a strong  contract with that ghostwriter. Since it seems that all the President  spends his weekends and our taxpayer dollars doing is golf, the last  thing we want is want him to put one of his golfing buddies in charge  of the Copyright Office.   Who is to say the next copyright application from Donald Trump won't  be disputed?   Placing his friends, business associates, and, yes, golfing partners  in high places could help tip the scales in his favor, providing  profits for him and his family at the expense of the American people.   I would like to take a moment to speak to a few of the defenses I  have heard about the need for this bill. There is the one stating the  President would pick the Register from a list of experts provided by a  group, including the Librarian.   But guess what?   That list is nonbinding, so the President can easily ignore the  recommendations and do whatever he wants, which is what this President  usually does anyway.                                time  1315    I have also heard the argument that the Register will be more  accountable and somehow transparent as a Presidential appointee.  Hogwash. That is the opposite of the truth. There is as much  transparency for a non-Presidential appointee once in their position;  and it is much less likely that a President is going to demand the  resignation of the Register than the Librarian is going to reassign  them, as the Librarian did last year when the Register was failing, as  confirmed by the inspector general report.   Finally, there seems to be the argument that there were a large  number of hearings in the committee on this issue and that somehow this  is the work product of those hearings. Well, if you look at the record,  there was not one hearing on this bill. There were hearings about  general copyright reform. There was no hearing on how this bill might  have a devastating impact on the need to modernize the Copyright  Office, creating huge delays for important efforts. There was no  hearing on whether this bill could profit the President and his family  at the expense of the American people.   This is a problematic bill under a problematic rule that doesn't  allow good ideas to come forward and be debated. We aren't even able to  debate helpful amendments.   I know of at least one important amendment that isn't being allowed  to be debated on the floor, which is Representative Lofgren's amendment  that would allow the current Librarian to fill the existing vacancy at  the Copyright Office, and when that Register leaves, the new process  would then apply. It seems like a commonsense transition process. Why  can't we get a simple vote on that amendment?   I say again, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. Frankly,  this bill makes the problem worse by giving the President the chance to  put his business associate and golf buddies in charge of his own  copyrights.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure the President's personality is perfectly  charming. I certainly wouldn't disparage his personality. What I am  talking about is him putting a golf buddy or a business associate in  charge of an office that he receives a direct profit from. That is  called conflict of interest. That is what we are debating here today.  It is not about the President's personality. Obviously, he is perfectly  charming in person. I would be happy to have dinner with him. I am  still waiting for the invitation.   The Copyright Office has an important function. In order to fulfill  that function of registering copyrights, it needs to be a neutral  arbiter. By making the head of the Copyright Office a political  advocate, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, it  will increasingly politicize copyrights, the basic protection Americans  [[Page H2866]]  rely on regarding the tradeoff between payoffs for innovation and the  right of consumers for dissemination. There is no chance a political  appointee will be neutral, by nature of them being a political  appointee.   A political appointee will likely be the puppet of big corporations  and the administration in their decisions around registration of  copyrights. That doesn't help the budding author, it doesn't help the  budding musician in a dispute, and it certainly doesn't help anyone  trying to navigate an outdated and archaic system that needs to be  modernized. This bill will indefinitely delay the modernization  process.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and  ``no'' on the bill. The last thing we need is President Trump's golf  buddies to be in charge of his own copyrights to further profit the  President and the First Family, who have pleasant personalities.   Do we really want to give more power to the administration so they  can do favors for themselves and their own business interests? I hope  not. Let's vote ``no.''   We should be considering a funding bill to keep the government open  instead of waiting until the absolute last second, hurting businesses  and Americans with the huge amount of uncertainty created.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule,  ``no'' on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
