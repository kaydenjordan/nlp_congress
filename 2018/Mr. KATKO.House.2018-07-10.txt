 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5729) to restrict the department in which the Coast Guard is  operating from implementing any rule requiring the use of biometric  readers for biometric transportation security cards until after  submission to Congress of the results of an assessment of the  effectiveness of the transportation security card program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5729         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Worker       Identification Credential Accountability Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. RESTRICTION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF TRANSPORTATION                     WORKER IDENTIFICATION CREDENTIAL BIOMETRIC                     READER RULE.         The department in which the Coast Guard is operating may       not implement the rule entitled ``Transportation Worker       Identification Credential (TWIC)-Reader Requirements'' (81       Fed. Reg. 57651), and may not propose or issue a notice of       proposed rulemaking for any revision to such rule except to       extend its effective date, or for any other rule requiring       the use of biometric readers for biometric transportation       security cards under section 70105(k)(3) of title 46, United       States Code, before the end of the 60-day period beginning on       the date of the submission under paragraph (5) of section       1(b) of Public Law 114-278 (130 Stat. 1411 to 1412) of the       results of the assessment required by that section.       SEC. 3. PROGRESS UPDATES.         Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, and every 90 days thereafter until the submission       under paragraph (5) of section 1(b) of Public Law 114-278       (130 Stat. 1411 et seq.) of the results of the assessment       required by that section, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall report to the Committee on Homeland Security and the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science,       and Transportation of the Senate regarding the implementation       of that section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5729, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to comply with the Maritime Transportation Security Act  of 2002 and the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006,  the Coast Guard is establishing rules requiring electronic readers for  use at high-risk vessel facilities.   The intent of the rule is to ensure that, prior to being granted  unescorted access to a designated secure area, an individual will have  his or her Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or TWIC,  authenticated.   The Coast Guard issued a proposed rule to this effect in March 2013.  The proposed rule limited the scope of the TWIC authentication  requirements at facilities to secure areas that handle certain  dangerous cargos in bulk through a vessel-to-facility interface. This  was consistent with existing Coast Guard policy.   Industry commented on the proposed rule, and the Coast Guard also  held four public meetings across the country and worked with the  Transportation Security Administration to conduct a pilot program.   The Coast Guard issued its final rule in August of 2016, with an  implementation date of August 23, 2018. The service noted that the  final rule made a number of changes from the proposed rule, including  flexibility with regard to purchase, installation, and use of  electronic readers; clarifying that the rule only affects risk group A  vessels and facilities; and eliminating the distinction between risk  group B and C for both vessels and facilities.   However, industry was surprised by the expanded scope of the final  rule where facility areas subject to the TWIC reader requirement went  beyond what was included in the proposed rule and regulatory analysis  accompanying that rule.   The Coast Guard has acknowledged the discrepancy between the proposed  and final rules. To date, the service has not been able to identify any  security benefits to the expanded scope of the final rule or  definitively state how it will address industry concerns.   The Office of Management and Budget recently completed its review of  a proposed rule to delay the implementation date of the TWIC reader  requirements. The text of the proposed rule was released on June 22,  2018, 2 months prior to the implementation date.   Unfortunately, the rule proposed only partially addresses industry  concerns. It delays implementation of the requirements until August 23,  2021, for two categories of facilities that handle certain dangerous  cargo in bulk but do not transfer it. However, for facilities and  vessels that handle certain dangerous cargo in bulk and transfer that  cargo to or from a vessel or from facilities that receive large  passenger vessels, the final rule requirements go into effect on August  23, 2018.   Industry has been involved and willing to address security concerns,  but facilities should not have to bear the burden of implementing a  final rule proposal that has not yet been fully vetted to understand  the impacts of the requirements.   H.R. 5729 requires the Secretary to submit to Congress the  comprehensive security assessment of the transportation security card  program, as required in section 1(b) of Public Law 114-278, before  implementation of its final rule. Doing so will provide Congress and  stakeholders further information on any deficiencies in the  effectiveness of the program.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague  from the District of Columbia.   H.R. 5729 is a very straightforward bill. It fixes something that  needs to be fixed quickly, and I urge Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
