 Madam Speaker, reports of clandestine flights taking  thousands of illegal immigrants across the country on behalf of U.S.  taxpayers are extremely concerning.   In his 45 years as a United States Senator, and Vice President, and  now President, Joe Biden has sworn to defend the U.S. Constitution from  all enemies, foreign and domestic, on eight separate occasions,  presumably including invasions of our border. Nowhere in the  Constitution does it describe using taxpayer dollars to transport  illegal immigrants to every corner of this country.   Employees of the airline in question are fearful that they may be  participating in human trafficking as unaccompanied minors are on many  of these flights.   Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas must answer  whether American taxpayers are paying for these secret flights and, if  so, why. All parties involved should be held accountable, including  President Biden.   None of this would be an issue if we had just followed through on  President Trump's plan to build a wall at our southern border and  secure our borders. Instead, President Biden seems determined to make  every town in America a border town.            Honoring the Life and Legacy of Millard Vaughn Oakley     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the late Millard Vaughn  Oakley, one of the greatest Tennesseeans I have every known. His legacy  will live on in our State's history for generations to come.   He started life as a shoeshine on the Livingston, Tennessee, square,  and checked out as a multimillionaire, chasing the excitement of the  next great business deal or opportunity or challenge. He was a faithful  husband, a loving father, and grandfather, an exemplary public servant,  and a passionate believer in his small town and the surrounding region.   If you took a trip to Overton County, Tennessee, you wouldn't have to  look far to find someone directly blessed by Millard Vaughn Oakley.  That is certainly true for me.   We come from opposing political parties. I am a conservative  Republican. He was a southern Democrat, having served as a State  Representative and State Insurance Commissioner under a Democratic  Governor. But that never impeded his willingness to encourage me or  hear me out. Our debates and disagreements were always cordial. There  was never a time when I did not glean something valuable from a  conversation I had with him. He cared and believed in me, and that  meant the world.   Countless Tennesseeans would say the same about this mighty man.  There was not a person in the town who Mr. Oakley did not endeavor to  know. Whether you were the gas station clerk, a sheriff's deputy, or a  student, you mattered to Millard Vaughn Oakley.   What I will always miss is his most sincere compassion. He gave life  to the dreams of many. His generosity will live on through the numerous  funds and scholarships to multiple schools and foundations.   As you venture down Interstate 40 in Cookeville and exit to State  Route 111, you will find yourself on Millard Vaughn Oakley Parkway.  That is the main thoroughfare into the town so dearly loved by this  treasure of a Tennesseean. Up that State Route, you will find an  impressive public library giving children and adults access to  thousands of books and a new magnificent county building, each made  possible by the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Oakley.   There is no replacing Millard Vaughn Oakley, only honoring him by  being better, doing better, and leaving this world a little better in  memory of a great Tennesseean who did it better  [[Page H4516]]  than anyone I have ever known. I pray that we will all take up the  mantle and leave our communities a little better than we found them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, last week Customs and Border Protection  released their monthly report detailing how bad President Biden's  border crisis has become.   The numbers are quite startling. In March alone, CBP confirmed  221,303 migrant encounters at our southern border. This number is up a  whopping 33 percent from February and an incredible 542 percent since  2020.   Making matters worse, the numbers show that 42 people on the  terrorist watch list tried to enter our country illegally since  President Biden took office. Thankfully, due to the hard work and  diligence of law enforcement officers on the southern border, they were  arrested.   Although this begs the question: If we found 42 people on the  terrorist watch list since January of 2021, how many more are in our  country today out of the more than 200,000 illegal immigrants whom we  know evaded law enforcement?   Unfortunately, we will probably never know until it is too late.  Thanks to President Biden's open border policies, Americans must come  to terms with the fact that until Republicans regain control of  Congress and the White House, potential terrorists continuing to file  through our borders is just a way of life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, inflation is an invisible tax that Americans  pay every day. Everywhere you look, inflation is wreaking havoc. At the  gas station, gas is up 48 percent; at the grocery store, beef is up 20  percent; chicken, up 15 percent; butter, up 14 percent; fruits and  vegetables, up 7 percent; coffee, up 12 percent.   At home, electricity is up 11 percent; furniture is up 15 percent;  and even the rent is up 5 percent.   What about a vacation? You still won't be able to escape inflation,  as hotels are up 29 percent and airplane flights are up 23 percent.    Recent graduates entering the workforce will be forced to pay record- high rent and other expenses as they enter adulthood. New mothers and  fathers will pay 10 percent higher prices for baby food. Many Americans  who saved their entire lives to retire comfortably are now faced with  the brutal realization that they may not have saved enough.   Even the Nashville airport, which is renovating and expanding, was  hit hard by inflation when the price of a new satellite concourse  jumped from $92 million just last March to over $134 million today.   As you can see, inflation affects every aspect of our lives. It is  costing the average American family an extra $433 per month, and it is  expected to cost each household over $5,000 extra just this year alone.   Inflation isn't something you can easily turn off, but President  Biden and congressional Democrats proved that their reckless,  progressive policies can certainly turn it on. Since President Biden  took office and Democrats gained control of both Chambers of Congress,  inflation has increased every single month.   They borrowed from future generations and spent trillions of hard- earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful government programs and assured us  that it wouldn't cause inflation, even though we all knew it would.  That is why it is so disingenuous that the President, his  administration and Democratic allies in Congress, and the mainstream  media are blaming inflation on the invasion of Ukraine. To use one of  the President's favorite words, that is pure malarkey.   Meanwhile, as my constituents feel more pain each day from the  growing inflation disaster, the President and his administration hardly  even mention it, much less offer solutions except to propose spending  trillions of dollars more that we don't have, which will, of course,  only make things worse. Just look at President Biden's budget proposal,  where inflation is not mentioned even one time. Instead, it calls for  spending a whopping $75 trillion over the next decade.   There is no denying that the massive deficit spending got us into  this harmful mess, and doing more of the same certainly won't get us  out of it. I and my fellow conservatives have pushed back as hard as we  can against the reckless approach to governing that our Democratic  friends have taken, but we have been outnumbered and outvoted.   Even though we are outgunned for now, I will nevertheless continue to  work hard with my fellow Republicans to do all we can to fight back on  every wasteful spending bill the Democrats bring until our commonsense  conservative reinforcements are elected in the fall and arrive in  January.
