 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier today, my friend from South  Dakota, the Republican Senator John Thune, came to the floor and  discussed the filibuster. It has been a topic of discussion not only  this week but even before. I hope that Senator Thune will concede that  whether you are for the filibuster or against the filibuster, we should  certainly be dedicated to the proposition that the U.S. Senate should  be a deliberative body that actually considers amendments and  legislation on the floor.   Now, what I just said sounds very routine and normal. It is radical  when you look at the record of the U.S. Senate. Last year, under the  Republican leadership of Senator McConnell, we had 29 amendments on the  floor the entire year--29. That was really an improvement over the  previous year, 30 percent better than the previous year--22 amendments.  What that says to those who may not be familiar with Senate procedure  is that the floor is empty and no one is here because we aren't taking  up legislation. Why?  [[Page S1630]]    So far this year, we have done three things in the Senate: the  impeachment trial; the reconciliation bill, the American Rescue Plan by  President Biden; and nominations. What do those three things have in  common? None of them, not one of them can be stopped by a filibuster.  Why aren't we taking up other legislation? Because looming over us is a  supermajority requirement of 60 votes to get anything done.   What I have said to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle  is, show me that we can make the Senate function. If we can show that  with the filibuster, so be it. If we can show it by changing the  filibuster, so be it. But let's do something.   We were elected to do things. We were elected to pass an  infrastructure bill for America. It has been years since we have done  that. We were elected to deal with issues that are fundamental to this  country. What about all the student loan debt in this country? Are we  going to do anything about it, say anything about it? Nothing is coming  to the floor, is it? There are so many issues that we should be taking  up that we are not taking up because of the looming specter of the  filibuster. That is a reality.   Let me bring that reality close to home. Twenty years ago, I  introduced the DREAM Act. I said if you were brought to America as an  infant, toddler, child, young person--your family brought you here, you  grew up here, you went to school here, and you pledged allegiance to  that flag in your classroom every single day--at some point in your  life, you ought to have the opportunity to earn your way to be a legal  person in America, a citizen in America. I don't think that is a  radical idea. In fact, the overwhelming majority of Americans support  the idea.   So, Durbin, let me ask you a question. It has been 20 years. You are  supposed to be a legislator. Why haven't you passed this, something  that simple and that direct? I haven't made it a law of the land  because of one thing: the filibuster. The filibuster. Five times I have  brought this measure to the floor of the U.S. Senate and have been  stopped by the filibuster; a majority vote every time but never the  magic 60, the magic supermajority.   So do I have a problem with the filibuster? Yes, I do. I challenge  those who are defending it to show me it can work, to show me we can  create bipartisan votes on the floor, actually debate on the floor,  amendments on the floor, legislation on the floor. That is not too much  to ask. I think that is why we were elected.   I come today to address this issue because the House is expected to  vote on the Dream and Promise Act and Farm Workforce Modernization Act.  If the Senate is able to join the House in passing these bills, we  would be able to make significant immigration legislation progress.   But I want to add that I support comprehensive immigration reform. I  believe it is the only honest answer to what we face in America today.  I will do my best to do everything I can. There is no excuse for  inaction. This broken immigration system needs to be addressed on a  bipartisan basis, and an answer is long overdue for Dreamers in this  country. I have told you who they are.   When President Obama created DACA for them, some 800,000 came  forward, registered with the government, and received legal status to  work and freedom from fear of deportation because of DACA.   President Trump eliminated the program. The battle ensued in court.  The Supreme Court said that Trump did it wrong, and we are now in the  middle ground.   President Biden supports DACA. He has made it clear that it is open  for new people to apply. Yet we don't have the final law.   We are dealing with Executive orders when it comes to this important  issue. That is why I have decided to come to this floor and to continue  to raise the issues of the people who are involved and to introduce my  129th Dreamer story on the floor of the U.S. Senate, which I have done  for years.   Diana Andino. She was born in Ecuador. She came to the United States  when she was 11 years old. She grew up in Houston, TX. She was quite a  student. She graduated in the top 10 percent of her high school class  and went on to earn a bachelor's degree with honors from the University  of Houston, in biology with a minor in chemistry.   She wrote me a letter, and here is what she said about her dream of  becoming a physician:         I found my calling in medicine after volunteering at a       local county hospital while I was in college.    Here is what she said about the difference that DACA made in her  life:         I graduated from college in 2011, and my dream of becoming       a physician was truncated by my lack of citizenship status.       However, DACA came in place a year later. I was able to apply       to school and was accepted at the Loyola University Stritch       School of Medicine in Chicago.    Let me just say, hats off to Loyola and their medical school. They  have led the Nation in accepting wonderful students just like Diana.  They were the first in the Nation to accept DACA applicants. More than  30 have since attended their medical school, and many of them are  practicing in underserved areas.    Diana graduated from Loyola Medical School and now is a third-year  resident at Loyola University Medical Center. She treats COVID-19  patients with serious complications, such as stroke or major bleeding.   Here is what she said about the COVID-19 pandemic:         It's been a challenging year not only physically but       mentally. Patients with COVID-19 developed multiple       neurological complications that we have encountered and       continue to learn about. As a neurology resident, I've       learned to be flexible as there are so many unknowns we       encountered almost daily.    How many times have we said in the last year: Thank God for people  just like this woman, who risks her life as a doctor for COVID-19  patients. Our brothers and sisters, our family members, people whom we  love are kept alive because Diana is skilled enough and brave enough to  go into their rooms and try to save their lives.   We think so much of Diana that we have to debate in the Senate  whether she should be a citizen of the United States. There is no  debate, as far as I am concerned. She is exactly the kind of person we  need in America's future. Send her back to Ecuador? No. Let her stay in  her home country of America.   Make the Dream Act a reality. Make it the law of the land. Don't let  a filibuster stop it again. When we receive the Dream and Promise Act  from the House of Representatives, we will have an opportunity to see  if 10 Republican Senators can join us in an effort to finally pass it-- I hope more.   As I said at the outset, I support comprehensive immigration reform.  I want to try to sit down and have a conversation about the farm labor  bill, about those who are here in temporary protected status, about  essential workers like Diana who ought to be given a chance to become  citizens in this country. That is what the debate is all about.   This empty floor, with no conversation among Senators, is testimony  to the fact that this is an aspiration--an aspiration that we can  overcome the filibuster, pass the Dream Act and more and do it soon.  Lives depend on it. Futures depend on it. The dreams of America are at  stake.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono) is  necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 125 Ex.]                                  YEAS--50       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--49       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Hirono           The nomination was confirmed.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, the exchange which took place between  myself and the junior Senator from Texas has been analyzed from many  different directions. The conclusion of CNN based on what he said on  the floor and I responded to is as follows:         Cruz said ``every illegal alien in America'' would get a       $1,400 check. Durbin responded that Cruz's statement is       ``just plain false'' because, he said, ``Undocumented       immigrants do not have Social Security numbers, and they do       not qualify for stimulus relief checks, period.''    According to CNN:         They were both wrong. Cruz was inaccurate when he said       ``every'' undocumented immigrant will get a $1,400 relief       check.    Then they go on to say there are people, a discrete class of people,  who might have a Social Security number, be undocumented, and receive a  check. And because of the clarification and my own investigation  afterwards, I will concede their point. I overstated my case.   Here is what it boils down to. In this situation, people have applied  for a work visa--not a tourist visa, a work visa to come to the United  States. Because of that work visa, they also received a Social Security  number. Then they overstayed their visas and still could continue-- could possibly continue--to be on the rolls with their Social Security  number and receive a check.   I might quickly add, this was a provision that was included in both  of the relief bills for COVID-19 signed into law by President Trump,  one of which the Senator from Texas voted for, one of which he did not.   So I would ask, how many people are we talking about? Ten? A hundred?  A thousand? Ten thousand? I can't find out. They can't give me the  number because there isn't a calculation.   So here is the situation. You had to apply for a work visa, be  granted the work visa and come to the United States, get a Social  Security number, overstay your visa, and then continue to file income  tax returns because that is the only way you could qualify for help  through these relief packages.   I don't know if that group is ten or a hundred or a thousand, but I  have carefully read the provisions that are offered by the Senator from  Texas today, and I will tell you he basically says to the American  Government, when it comes to cash payments: Stop the presses. Stop the  presses. I want to know who these people are, and I don't want you to  send them a check.   I don't believe that is reasonable. We have sent out 90 million  checks. To stop this while we go through this debate is, I think,  unfair.   I don't want these checks to go to people who do not qualify for them  any more than he does, but I am not going to stop the issuance of  checks to people living in Texas or Illinois in the meantime. I object.    I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 873         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
