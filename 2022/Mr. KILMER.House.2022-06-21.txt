 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Flight Officer Roscoe Perkins, a distinguished aviation pioneer who  helped pave the way for racial integration in the United States Armed  Forces and whose service has inspired generations of aviators.   Flight Officer Roscoe Perkins served our country in World War II as a  military pilot and was one of the first Black-American pilots to serve  in the United States Armed Forces.   Flight Officer Perkins was among the nearly 1,000 men, referred to as  the Tuskegee Airmen, who trained at the United States Army Air Corps'  Tuskegee Army Airfield in Alabama.   The Tuskegee Airmen were citizens who wanted to fight for their  country but were originally barred from doing so due to segregationist  policies at the time. This led to the creation of the Tuskegee  Institute to train Black Army personnel to become pilots.   Despite facing many obstacles, the Tuskegee Airmen beat the odds.  Even in the face of significant barriers, they showed skill and  patriotism. They fought valiantly in World War II by flying more than  15,000 combat sorties over Europe and North Africa.    For his part, Roscoe Perkins logged nearly 400 hours of flight during  his years of service between January 31, 1944, and February 10, 1946.  He flew P-47s and B-25s for the U.S. Army Air  [[Page H5688]]  Corps in the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group.   Congress voted in 2006 to award the Tuskegee Airmen with the  Congressional Gold Medal, which is the most prestigious award the  Federal Government can award to servicemembers.   President George W. Bush presented the surviving airmen with the  medal at a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol rotunda in March of 2007. Since  then, Congress has begun posthumously awarding medals to the families  of deceased airmen once they are found.   Flight Officer Perkins died in 1978. After years of effort, his  surviving family members obtained the bronze replica of his medal in  2017.   Flight Officer Perkins' service to our Nation has helped break down  countless barriers for those who have followed in his footsteps, and we  should all be inspired by his service.   In a time when our world was threatened by fascism, Flight Officer  Perkins stood among the many to ward off its force.   In a time when our world was quick to define the quality or character  of a person based on their skin, Flight Officer Perkins' service  demonstrated that character is about living true to your values,  working toward the common good.   At a time when we were fighting in the air, Flight Officer Perkins'  service illustrated the struggle at home and the need to end  segregationist policies.   Following his service in the military, Flight Officer Perkins was  unable to become a commercial airline pilot due to the color of his  skin, so he continued his passion for flying by getting in a cockpit  any chance he could get and by working as an aircraft mechanic.   During his 20-year career after the military, he worked his way up  from apprentice mechanic to crew chief and then to crew supervisor.   Flight Officer Perkins' passion and skill for flying may have  inspired an entire Nation, but close to home, he also inspired his  family. All five of his children went to college and completed degrees.   His daughter went on to be one of the first Black flight attendants  for a major airline. His great-grandson is now an Air Force pilot and  flies an F-15 Strike Eagle. Before retiring, his son worked as an  electrical engineer for NASA.   Today, Madam Speaker, we honor and celebrate Flight Officer Roscoe  Perkins, whose service to his country and to his community is greatly  appreciated and will long be remembered.                            ____________________
