 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to honor the memory of a  legendary Kentucky statesman, a baseball Hall of Famer, a man of this  House, and a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great- grandfather, Senator Jim Bunning, who recently passed away at the age  of 85.   The Members who are joining us tonight, many of them who hail from  Senator Bunning's home in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, extend our  deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Mary, who was his best friend for  many years; his nine children; his 35 grandchildren; and his 21 great- grandchildren.   Those who met Senator Jim Bunning walked away with an impression, and  that impression was: That has to be the most competitive person I have  ever met.   In a recent op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader, providing a great  tribute to Senator Jim Bunning, one of his very best friends, sports  marketing executive Jim Host, wrote that Jim Bunning was ``full of  integrity'' and, ``the straightest arrow I ever met.''   In that op-ed, he recounted a story where a reporter of the  Louisville Courier-Journal wrote that former U.S. Senator Jim Bunning  was ``one of a kind,'' and Jim Host, in remembering his friend, said,  ``I agree, but more than that, he was an original. No one in politics  in Kentucky or, for that matter, nationwide has been or ever will be  like him.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman Hal Rogers, the dean of the  Kentucky delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to John Yarmuth, my friend from  Louisville in the Third Congressional District of Kentucky and a good  Kentuckian who will demonstrate that Jim Bunning's appeal crossed party  lines.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman Brett Guthrie, my  friend from the Second Congressional District of Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from the First  Congressional District of Kentucky, Congressman James Comer.    Mr. Speaker, when you think about U.S. Senator Jim Bunning  and when you think about his remarkable baseball career before  politics, Jim Bunning could have gone anywhere and he could have done  anything, but it is important to remember that those early days during  his baseball career--and I will have to recount a story that was in  that tribute that Jim Host wrote about the Hall of Famer Jim Bunning.   And he said that, after his career had ended, it had been about 15  years, and he had not yet been named to the Baseball Hall of Fame by  the baseball writers, though when he retired, he was second in  strikeouts to the famed Walter Johnson, he had won 100 games in both  leagues, he had a perfect game in one of those leagues, and he had a  no-hitter in the other league.   He had never pitched for a pennant winner.         A prominent sportswriter told me, quoting Jim Host, that       the writers would have never elected him because he never       developed relationships with most of them.        But this wrong was corrected the first year that the old-      timers committee of the Hall could vote on him. Probably his       greatest thrill, other than the birth of his nine children,       was the call he got from Ted Williams and others saying they       were correcting a tragic wrong by voting Jim Bunning into the       Hall of Fame.        When he called Jim Host to tell him the news, his voice was       filled with emotion unlike any that he had heard from him       before.    And here is what Jim Bunning said to Jim Host:   [[Page H5101]]              I am glad those writers--he used another word--did not vote       me in, being voted in by the players means more anyway.        In his acceptance speech, he attacked the ills in the game       he loved so much that the commissioner and others were not       addressing. The officials of Major League Baseball sat on the       stage quite uncomfortable. Vintage Bunning.    But you know, after that remarkable baseball career and after that  wrong was corrected and he was ultimately voted into the Hall of Fame  by the players, he chose to come home to Kentucky where he dedicated  his life to his family and to public service.   He served on the Fort Thomas City Council and in the Kentucky State  Senate before serving in this body, in the House of Representatives, as  a Congressman from Kentucky's Fourth Congressional District, and he did  so for six terms in a very distinct fashion.   And he capped off his remarkable career in public service by serving  two terms and very consequential terms in the United States Senate.  Throughout his entire career, he remained a principled conservative,  and he was an unrelenting fighter for the causes he believed in and for  the people of the commonwealth. Just as he was unafraid to face the  boos and the jeers of tens of thousands of opposing fans in Major  League Baseball stadiums around the country, Jim Bunning was unafraid  to stand alone in Congress for the causes that he felt were right.   And a great example of this--and I like telling this story as the  current chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee in this  House. Jim Bunning was a fighter for accountability and transparency of  the Federal Reserve. And when so many just took the Fed for their word,  Jim Bunning stood up and he challenged then-Fed Chairman Alan  Greenspan. And many of his colleagues looked at him in dismay because  they believed that the Fed just deserved deference, and this great  economist should always be taken as being right in what he was doing.   But Jim Bunning, in the end, was right, as Fed policies ended up  being one of the causes of the Great Recession of 2008. Senator  Bunning's legacy lives on in his amazing wife, Mary, and their many  children and grandchildren, including his grandson Eric Bunning, who  has been an important part of my team since I first took office.    And I just have to tell one story from the campaign trails. Many of  my colleagues have told these stories, but I have got to tell one that  is personal to me. Jim Bunning was a legend, and we all revered him.  And when I made my first run for Congress, it was kind of coming down  the home stretch, and we were the underdog, but I really respected  Senator Bunning, and I wanted his political experience and his advice.   And as we were going down the home stretch of the campaign--it was a  tight election--Jim Bunning approached me at an event, and he said:  ``Andy, how are you doing?''   And I said: ``We are doing great. We have got the momentum. We are  moving forward, and it is really tightening up, and I really feel like  we have got the momentum, and we are going to get over the top.''   And in his way that only Jim Bunning could be, as honest as he was,  he said: ``That is not what I hear. I hear you are down by 10 points,  and you are going to lose in a landslide.''   Well, as it turned out, a few weeks later, it was a close election,  and we only lost that campaign by a few hundred votes. But you know  what? Just a few days after that concession speech that I had to give,  you know who called? It was Senator Jim Bunning.   And even though he was certainly candid in that conversation a few  weeks before election day, he said: ``Andy, you ran a great campaign.  You are a tenacious campaigner. Don't give up. Keep fighting. Be  persistent. Do it again. The next time you are going to win.''   And you know, that embodies the character of Jim Bunning: tenacious,  persistent, determined, principled, a man of integrity.   And so, Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in  praying for the extended Bunning family as we remember a respected  former member of this House and a great Kentuckian.   Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor to join many of my colleagues from  Kentucky, and all of the other fellow members of this body, to  celebrate the life and the legacy of Senator Jim Bunning.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
