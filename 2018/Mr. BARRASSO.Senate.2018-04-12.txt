 Mr. President, the Senate will vote on cloture on the  nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be the Deputy Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency.   The Deputy Administrator is critical in developing and implementing  policies that fulfill the EPA's mission of protecting America's water,  land, air, and communities.   He is the right person for the job. He has spent 25 years working in  environmental policy. In that time, he has served as a career employee  of the EPA; a staff director on the Hill for the committee I now chair,  the Environment and Public Works Committee; and, most recently, as a  consultant in the energy policy space.   Andrew Wheeler is well qualified to fill this critically important  job. I urge all Senators to support the nomination.    Mr. President, I am here with my colleague from  Oklahoma to speak in favor of Andrew Wheeler. I support Andrew Wheeler  to serve as the Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency.   During the previous administration, the Environmental Protection  Agency issued burdensome regulations that harmed American workers and  American communities. Since President Trump took office 15 months ago,  the EPA has rolled back many of these punishing regulations, including  the so-called Clean Power Plan and the waters of the United States, or  the WOTUS, rule.   Under President Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, this Agency  is now working for commonsense environmental policies--policies that  don't harm the American economy and don't punish American families.   Administrator Pruitt needs his full team at the Environmental  Protection Agency in order to accomplish these goals. So today, the  Senate is going to consider the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be  Deputy Administrator of the EPA. The Deputy Administrator is critical  in developing and implementing the policies that fulfill the EPA's  mission of protecting human health and the environment.   Mr. Wheeler is very well qualified for the position. He spent over 25  years working in environmental policies. At that time, he served as a  career employee at the EPA, working as an environmental protection  specialist. This experience makes him uniquely qualified to serve in  the role of Deputy Administrator.   He has spent over a decade here on Capitol Hill, shaping  environmental law. He served as the staff director of the Senate  Environment and Public Works Air Subcommittee from 1997 to 2003. This  was followed by another 6 years as a Republican staff director and  chief counsel for the full committee, 2003 to 2009. Most recently, Mr.  Wheeler has been a consultant for a variety of energy and environmental  clients.   Andrew Wheeler's commitment to sound environmental policies has  received recognition from across the aisle as well. The ranking member  of the Environment and Public Works Committee said this of Mr. Wheeler:         I think having worked in the agency, he actually cares       about the environment; the air that we breathe; the water we       drink; the planet on which we live.    Stuart Spencer, the president of the Association of Air Pollution  Control Agencies, said this of Mr. Wheeler:         Mr. Wheeler has exemplified excellence in his professional       endeavors, in his previous government service and private       sector experience. In short, he is keenly qualified to hit       the ground running at EPA.    I agree. His nomination has garnered the support of a broad base of  organizations, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the  United Mine Workers of America, and the Chamber of Commerce.   Andrew Wheeler is well qualified to fill this critically important  role at the EPA. He is the right person to serve as  [[Page S2095]]  Deputy Administrator of the EPA, and I urge every Senator to support  this nomination.   With that, I recognize my colleague and friend from Oklahoma, who has  been a mentor to me on the committee, the former chairman of the  Committee on Environment and Public Works, Jim Inhofe.
