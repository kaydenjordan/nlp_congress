 Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, Chairman Goodlatte, I  start by expressing my appreciation to Chairman Goodlatte for  acknowledging the actions that were taken by the Governor of New Jersey  when he was the U.S. attorney back in 2006 to 2007.   By the way, the former Justice Department was not even in existence  yet.   I agree with much, on both sides, of what has been said here, but I  think we are missing the point. The legislation is needed to prohibit  this from happening again.   Congressman Poe, the gentleman from Texas, wants to take the  political preference out of the Justice Department. He is absolutely  correct, I agree, but not just about where the money is going to go.   We have a major problem here. I have been shouting from the rooftops  about the need to reform the Justice Department's settlement agreement  process for almost a decade on this floor.   When we talk about lawsuits being settled, deferred prosecutions are  to get rid of the defendant so that the defendant, at the cost of doing  business, pays a fine. That is how it is done. This bill does nothing  about that--zero.                                time  1545    Many of the corporations that stood before the courts--and I am not a  lawyer, as most of you guys and gals are--they stood before the courts  for 15 years, representing those corporations, and what they got out of  it was: Look, we are going to slap you on the wrist. We are going to  give you a little fine. At that time, you can give the money to whoever  you wish. And then you go away. Nobody is prosecuted. Nobody goes to  jail. Nobody is going to go to jail with these banks that cheated  middle class folks. Nobody. Guaranteed.   But under the guise of ``ensuring accountability,'' H.R. 732 is a  political exercise missing real reprimand for these practices, reforms  to the system, or redress to actual victims.   For years, we have known deferred prosecution agreements get out of  hand, regardless of whether there is a Democrat running the Presidency  or a Republican. So for anybody to stand up there and just say this was  Obama's problem, they don't know history.   I suggested a modest reform to improve the transparency of these  agreements. I was rebuffed by some of the very people who are in this  room.    There is much to be said here, but if we remember the  Bristol-Myers Squibb case, they avoided prosecution for securities  fraud in exchange for $5 million to the Governor's law school alma  mater. Now, that is what is going on.   Mr. Chairman, you don't accept that. If you are on the Judiciary  Committee, you can't accept that either. You have got to be kidding me.  To allow the courts to do something like this--and any administration,  Democrat or Republican, to go along with this--no wonder the people  have little faith in the justice system in the United States of  America.   I simply want fairness, Mr. Chairman. I have asked for it many times.  This is not a new subject to me, and I will be back talking about it  again.
