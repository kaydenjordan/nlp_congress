 Mr. Speaker, the events of September 11,  2001, and the courage of the first responders who ran into danger are  forever etched in our minds and our hearts. Nearly 3,000 people were  killed, thousands more were injured, and for many who were at Ground  Zero, their pain and suffering endure.   This year we finally made the 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund  permanent so that we can always take care of our first responders,  volunteers, and their families. We learned many lessons on that day.  Lessons in sacrifice, sorrow, and bravery, as well as lessons in  national security preparedness and foreign policy.   As we pause today to remember the victims and all those who were  impacted by the attacks, let us also remember the lessons and maintain  constant vigilance in our shared national commitment to never forget.                            ____________________
