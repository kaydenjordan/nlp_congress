 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 101 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 101         Resolved, That Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 is hereby       adopted.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), my colleague from the Committee on Rules, pending which I  yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 101, providing for adoption of S. Con. Res. 5, setting  forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for  fiscal year 2021 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for  fiscal years 2022 through 2030.   Madam Speaker, I am, once again, on the floor today to urge my  colleagues to adopt the rule and to support passage of this budget  resolution.   Across our Nation, Americans are facing a dire crisis. Many have lost  loved ones. Even more have lost livelihoods. Small businesses are  shuttering their doors, hospitals are being pushed to their limits, and  students are falling behind.   In the past year alone, Congress has taken steps to respond to the  needs of struggling Americans, but I know that each and every one of my  colleagues can agree that we have a long road yet to travel.   Passing this budget resolution is a necessary step to fast-track  essential COVID relief, the American Rescue Plan.   I know the gentleman from Texas and many of his colleagues on the  other side of the aisle have aired complaints about the process begun  earlier this week. If these were normal times and if we were dealing  with more mundane issues, I would share their concerns. I am a strong  believer in bipartisanship, in compromise, and in regular order in the  House and Senate. But these are certainly not normal times, and we are  not dealing with mundane issues. We face the greatest crisis in our  lifetime. Americans are counting on us, relying on us, and we have a  moral imperative to save lives and families from destitution.   As of yesterday afternoon, 454,272 Americans have died from this  tragic disease, a disease which has ripped a hole in millions of hearts  that can never be repaired.   The victims of this disease have left spouses, children,  grandchildren, parents, friends, neighbors, and people who needed them,  who relied on them, and who loved them. Nothing we can do now will fix  that. But we face the prospect of losing thousands more, and we can and  must fix that.   This isn't just appropriate, this isn't just wise; this is a moral  imperative.   Even families who have not lost a loved one have faced the disastrous  consequences of the pandemic. Nearly 11 million Americans are  unemployed, more than double the number before the spread of COVID-19.  As a result, one in three American families have faced difficulty  covering their regular household expenses, an estimated one in five  adults are behind on rent, and 10.3 million homeowners are behind on  their mortgages.   This isn't just desirable, this isn't just sensible; this is a moral  imperative.   Parents in my district and in so many communities are struggling to  put food on the table for their family. Nearly 24 million people, or  nearly 11 percent of all adults in this country, have reported that  their households sometimes, or often, didn't have enough to eat in the  past 7 days. Before the pandemic, the Department of Agriculture found  that number was fewer than 3.5 percent over the full 12 months of 2019.   This isn't just advisable, this isn't just constructive; this is a  moral imperative.   So let's talk about what we are going to do to rise to this  challenge. We are moving forward with the budget reconciliation process  to ensure that Congress can pass meaningful coronavirus relief without  delay or partisan gridlock. The budget resolution before us provides a  framework for reconciliation with a target of up to $1.9 trillion. It  is designed solely to respond to the ongoing crisis and to deliver  critical relief as quickly as possible.   This will enable us to finally beat this virus and continue on the  path of a national economic recovery. We will mount a national  vaccination program, setting up vaccination sites in communities across  the country. We will invest in reopening schools and provide direct  housing and nutrition assistance to families in need.   The American Rescue Plan will also provide direct assistance to  Americans, stimulus payments, including assistance for dependents. We  will also provide crucial support for the hardest hit small businesses,  as well as first responders and frontline workers, who have done so  much to turn back the tide of this virus.   But without the reconciliation directives in this resolution, any  bold action could languish indefinitely in the Senate, putting the  health and well-being of millions of American families at risk.   For those concerned about the national debt or possibility of future  inflation, I urge them to heed the advice from Federal Reserve Chairman  Jerome Powell, a Republican appointed by President Trump to the Federal  Reserve chairmanship, when he warned us to be more worried about  falling short of a complete recovery and losing people's careers and  lives and the damage that will do to our economic future.   Moving forward with budget reconciliation does not preclude a strong  bipartisan agreement on a relief package that can gain wide support in  both the House and the Senate. In fact, there is no need for  partisanship on this issue.   While it seems we may be divided today in this Chamber, the American  people clearly are not. The overwhelming majority, including a majority  of Republicans across this country, support passage of emergency  legislation, including stimulus payments, vaccine funding, and other  pandemic responses in this plan.   This is not a partisan issue because it is not only red or blue  families, but families of all political persuasions that are  struggling, and I am certain my colleagues in the minority know that  all too well.   I urge Members of this House to support this budget resolution so we  can immediately get to work on this desperately needed American Rescue  Plan. It is our moral imperative.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just a couple of brief points. First, as it relates to the amount of  discussion about this, we debated this resolution with few changes  earlier this week on Wednesday. We had a lengthy conversation. We are  discussing it again now.   If we are successful in passing this resolution, it will go to the  appropriate standing committees for their markup on the various  allocations in this resolution, and then it will come back here for  passage again.    So I think it is fair to say from a process point of view that we  will have plenty of opportunities to make our arguments in front of the  American public and let them decide on the appropriateness of our  actions.   But I would hardly say that there isn't going to be ample time to  have these conversations and make these distinctions if that is what we  choose to do.   Just a brief word on the minimum wage. I hope we come back to it. I  had the privilege of leading the debate on the rule when we increased  the minimum wage in this House last year. If you make the minimum wage  in the United States--the Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. So if  you work an entire 40-hour week you will make $290 gross. If you work  52 weeks out of the year at that level, you will make $15,080 for a  year gross income.   So do we think Americans who work 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year  should make more than $15,000 a year? Yes, we do. Guilty as charged.  And we can have that conversation either in reconciliation, should that  be the desire of the committees and the Senate, but we will certainly  have it again on this floor because it is part of what we believe and  the values that we hold dear as the majority in this House.   As it relates to the bipartisanship, we have said before, I said it  earlier, Chairman Yarmuth said it repeatedly, we are happy and want to  have a conversation about a bipartisan agreement. But whether we have a  bipartisan agreement or not, we are going to move forward.   President Biden met with the 10 members of the United States Senate  just earlier this week to talk about compromise. He has signaled  repeatedly his willingness to do it. But we are going to do it with or  without a bipartisan agreement because leadership is what this moment  requires.   I dare say, I imagine there are not many families in America who  really at the end of the day care more about how we put this deal  together than they care about getting a stimulus check to pay their  rent; that they care about their children being safe when they go back  to school; that they care  [[Page H443]]  about unemployment benefits, if they happen to be one of the nearly 11  million Americans who was out of work through no fault of their own but  because of a deadly virus which doesn't care whether you are a Democrat  or a Republican.   So we are going to provide leadership and, frankly, I think it is  probably surprising to some to see a President engaged in the daily  activities in the life of his government and the life of our country,  someone who cares deeply about the future of America, who cares about  the families who are in need, who cares about those who are sick, those  who are dying.   So that may be surprising. It is a little out of the norm in recent  years, but we have a President who is fully engaged. Bipartisanship is  what he has asked for. Bipartisanship is what he has talked about. It  is what we seek here. But absent it, we will lead because too many  Americans are suffering and in crisis.   With that, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I first welcome the gentlewoman from Florida to the House, and I look  forward to many opportunities to work together in a bipartisan fashion.  I would note that one of the very first things we did in this House was  the bipartisan passage of Public Law 117-1, which was paving the way  for an historic appointment of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. So we  have worked together, and I think we will find common purpose on so  many things facing the American public. And I certainly hope we find  commonality and purpose in this work that we will do over the next  several days to work on support, in the most difficult of times, for  American families.  [[Page H444]]    Because I have heard this now said so many times in the last few days  about a trillion dollars that the Biden administration has not spent, I  would say, first of all, if anyone in a period of 2 weeks could spend a  trillion dollars, I would find that remarkable.   The second is, this is in the pipeline. And we don't wait for every  dollar to be spent and then think about having another debate about  further support.   There is nothing about this that I find extraordinary. What I do find  extraordinary is that you point out that money that has been  appropriated, is earmarked, and is moving out the door in appropriate  ways and going through the proper channels, and that would be a point  of debate and argument.   This is necessary. We have heard it from so many leading economists  around this country. We have heard it from the American public. So I  think the case is clear, and I look forward to further discussion on  this.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great  State of New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. To the new Member, I also welcome her to the Chambers and I  look forward to working with her on important issues, such as  education.   It should not need to be said, but I will say it: This package has  billions of dollars that will support education and schools. So pass  this resolution. There is no need to substitute it.   I would look just to my home State of New York, which has lost $15  billion in revenue as a result of this pandemic. And I know a little  bit about this. I served in that State legislature for many years. The  State of New York provides the highest level of support per capita of a  State to its local school districts of any State in the Union. So not  helping local school districts, not helping our States provide lost  revenue in support, damages, irreparably, the children in our K-12  across our country.    So pass this resolution. Work with us to make sure that we can  provide support for our local school districts.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  the State of California (Mr. Bera).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would note, and I am sure the gentleman knows this,  he mentioned appropriations in this bill. Obviously, there are no  appropriations in this bill.   This sets up a reconciliation process, and we would certainly welcome  his input and welcome the support and partnership of Members on his  side of the aisle.   But I do want to make clear this is a process resolution. It begins  the process. We will come back and have conversations in the standing  committees and, certainly, again on the floor as we move forward.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. Though from time to  time we may disagree on questions before the House, I always find him  very thoughtful, committed American. I am pleased to serve with him on  the Rules Committee and pleased that we have had an opportunity to have  this conversation this morning.   Madam Speaker, budgets are not exclusively about numbers or process.  They are, most importantly, a statement of our priorities and our  values.   Our priorities are clear. Stop this virus. Help our families. Our  values are to respond to the critical needs of the American people, and  that is what we do today.   We will continue to work through this over the next several weeks,  and I very much appreciate all of my colleagues for their words in  support of the rule before us today.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote  on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 101         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       682) to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-      person instruction at elementary and secondary schools, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the       Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on       the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 682.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
