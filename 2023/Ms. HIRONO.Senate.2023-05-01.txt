 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to express my strong  support for Julie Su's nomination to serve as our next Secretary of  Labor.   As we continue working to rebuild and strengthen our economy, it is  critical that the Department of Labor is led by someone committed to  protecting the rights of all workers, and that person is Julie Su. From  combating wage theft to expanding workforce training, Acting Secretary  Su has spent her life fighting for workers. For the past 2 years, she  has served as Deputy Secretary of Labor alongside Secretary Walsh.  Together they helped make life better for workers across the  [[Page S1434]]  country. Thanks to their hard work, our country has added a record 12.6  million jobs over the last 2\1/2\ years. What is more, unemployment is  at its lowest level in more than 50 years, a testament to the hard work  of Secretary Walsh and Deputy Secretary Su.   And before coming to Washington, Julie spent decades fighting for  workers in her home State of California as Secretary of Labor in  California, Commissioner of Labor, and as a civil rights attorney.   Beyond her stellar professional track record, Julie's personal  history informs her commitment to building an economy that puts workers  first. Like me, Julie is a daughter of immigrants. Her mother came to  America from China on a cargo ship, unable to afford a passenger  ticket. After arriving in the United States, she got a good job with a  union with predictable hours, paid sick leave, and a reliable income.  That job helped Julie's mother and father go on to become business  owners themselves, ultimately running a franchise pizza restaurant and  a laundromat.   Thanks to her parents' hard work, Julie went on to attend Stanford  University and Harvard Law before receiving a prestigious MacArthur  Genius award for her work fighting for undocumented garment workers in  California.   Julie Su is a relentless advocate for workers, and she also knows how  to build consensus. It is no wonder, then, that she enjoys broad  support from business and labor alike, garnering the endorsement of  groups including the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Small Business  Majority, the AFL-CIO, and dozens of labor unions across the country.   She has the support of leaders like Cecil Roberts, president of the  United Mine Workers of America, who said last month that Acting  Secretary Su is ``straightforward, very knowledgeable and a passionate  advocate for workers and their families. President Biden has made the  right choice for Secretary of Labor''--and Secretary Walsh himself, who  said that he has ``the utmost confidence in [Julie's] ability to  sustain the work of the department and advance the President's vision  of an economy that puts workers first and leaves no one behind.''    I couldn't agree more. Confirming Julie Su should be a no-brainer,  just like it was 2 years ago when every Democrat in the Senate voted to  confirm her as Deputy Secretary of Labor. But special interests are  working hard to block her nomination, lobbing unfair attacks and  intentionally misrepresenting her record.   In States like West Virginia, Montana, and Arizona, massive  billboards have been erected suggesting that Deputy Secretary Su's  confirmation would harm our economy. They claim--outrageously--that she  is somehow working to destroy franchise businesses like the one her own  family ran. In reality, she has worked to ensure workers at all  franchise businesses have basic protections so that those businesses  and their employees can thrive.   They claim that she has worked in the so-called gig economy--another  lie. What she has done is crack down on corporations like Uber,  exploiting hard-working Americans for their own profit, because Deputy  Secretary Su understands that our economy can thrive only if workers  have the dignity and support they deserve.   What we are witnessing is a coordinated campaign by those on the  right to discredit Julie Su and her impressive record, but her  credentials are as clear as can be. And as we enter Asian American,  Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, I would be remiss  not to also mention the important role Acting Secretary Su will play as  the only AAPI Cabinet-level Secretary in the Biden-Harris  administration.   Confirming Julie Su as Secretary of Labor is one of the most  important things we can do to support workers, strengthen small  businesses, and ensure our economy works for all of us--for working  people.   I look forward to voting for her nomination; and, for our country and  our economy, I hope this body will confirm Julie Su without delay.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
