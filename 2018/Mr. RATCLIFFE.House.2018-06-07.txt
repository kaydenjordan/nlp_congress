 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and celebrate  the life of ATF Senior Special Agent Scott Ragsdale from Fate, Texas,  who tragically passed away on May 24, 2018, at just 41 years of age  during an ATF training exercise.   Agent Ragsdale is survived by his wife, Erin, and his two children,  Aidan and Riley; his mother and father, Patti and Roy Ragsdale; his  sister, Kelly Novikoff, her husband, Lee, and their two children; and  many aunts, uncles, and cousins who loved him dearly and will miss him.   Those who knew Agent Ragsdale best say that he will most be  remembered for his incredible sense of humor and, of course, for his 17  years of dedicated service to his fellow man.   He will be greatly missed in our northeast Texas community for his  brave and selfless service as a member of our law enforcement.   On behalf of the three-quarters of a million Texans whom I represent  across the Fourth Congressional District of Texas, I offer my most  sincere condolences to his family and loved ones.   I wish you Godspeed, Special Agent Scott Ragsdale.                            ____________________
