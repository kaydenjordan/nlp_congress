 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my neighbors in  Alabama and Florida who bore the brunt of destruction from Hurricane  Sally when it made landfall on September 16. We keep all those who were  affected in our prayers as they rebuild.   Mississippi was lucky to be spared this time, but tragedy comes with  an important lesson. We must be prepared. I will be the first to say  that even I could have been better prepared for this storm after seeing  the devastation throughout lower Alabama and the panhandle.   September is National Natural Disaster Preparedness Month, and  hurricane season is still well underway. I encourage everyone who calls  the Gulf and Atlantic Coast home to review the FEMA hurricane  guidelines. From knowing your evacuation route to having all the  essentials to leave, if necessary, when a storm is headed our way, we  will be better prepared to weather it together.   Natural disasters are inevitable, and it is our responsibility as  elected officials and as individuals, to prepare for them and recover  responsibly. For those impacted by Hurricane Sally, I wish you a swift  recovery.   Don't just build back, build forward.                            ____________________
