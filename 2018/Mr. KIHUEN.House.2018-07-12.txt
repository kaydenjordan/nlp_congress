 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6135,  the Keep Families Together Act.    Mr. Speaker, it is immoral, it is inhumane, and it is un-American to  separate children from their parents. You know, I was at the border  just a few weeks ago, and I got an opportunity to see firsthand and  talk to these children. And these are children who are in jail cells.  These are children who should be out in a playground, not in a prison.  These are parents who left their home country because they were being  persecuted because gangs and cartels were looking to assassinate them,  and they were coming to America to say: I need help. Me and my children  need help.   They were coming to America, the most powerful country in the world,  asking for help, a country that has traditionally been made up of  immigrants. Because let's face it, unless you are Native American, we  all come from somewhere else. This country is made up of immigrants.  These folks, all they wanted was an opportunity to succeed and to  achieve the American Dream, and, today, they are in prisons.   These parents are away from their children. That is immoral. It is  inhumane. And now we have an administration who made a promise to  reunite these families, and the deadline passed, and yet these children  are still not reunited with their parents. And those few children who  are having that opportunity to see their parents again, the parents are  complaining that their children don't even recognize them anymore. That  is inhumane, it is immoral, and it goes against all American values.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6135, the Keep Families Together  Act.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Susan  Smith.   Susan attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   Susan was a wife and a mother of two. She worked as an office manager  at Vista Fundamental Elementary School in Simi Valley, California.   Susan loved traveling, scrapbooking, and documenting countless  memories for her family.   Susan had a contagious laugh and a great sense of humor. She was  patient, strong, and kind.   Susan is remembered for her love of her family, her drive, and the  beautiful way she treated others.   Mr. Speaker, I extend my condolences to Susan Smith's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
