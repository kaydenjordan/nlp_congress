 Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak in  support of the nomination of Dr. Rita Baranwal to be Assistant  Secretary for Nuclear Energy at the Department of Energy. Dr. Baranwal  was reported from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee without  opposition in both the 115th and 116th Congresses, and I am glad we  will vote to confirm her today.   Over the past several years, the United States has lost influence in  nuclear energy to countries like Russia and China. That is not a  positive development, but advanced nuclear technologies have the  potential to reposition the United States as a leader in the world  market.   To achieve that, we will need strong, experienced, and consistent  leadership at the Department of Energy. Dr.  [[Page S4151]]  Baranwal's experience as the director of the Gateway for Accelerated  Innovation in Nuclear, also referred to as GAIN, provides her with an  informed perspective to push forward the research, development, and  deployment of advanced reactor technologies.   Congress began to demonstrate its strong support for advanced nuclear  through the enactment of two bills in the last Congress, the Nuclear  Energy Innovation Capabilities Act and the Nuclear Energy Innovation  and Modernization Act. These new laws are intended to facilitate  reactor development and streamline the licensing process at the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission.   In addition, legislation I have sponsored, the Nuclear Energy  Leadership Act, has garnered 17 bipartisan cosponsors in this new  Congress. Our bill provides for the next steps on advanced nuclear  technologies, including the need to ensure high-assay, low-enriched  uranium fuel is available for them.   We need a strong leader in the Office of Nuclear Energy, someone who  recognizes the potential of these technologies, who will move forward  so that we can realize that potential and who will work to restore the  United States' leadership in nuclear energy. I appreciate Dr.  Baranwal's willingness to serve in this role and urge my colleagues to  support her nomination.                            ____________________
