 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in  support of the confirmation of Julie Rikelman to the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the First Circuit.   In just a few minutes, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on  Julie Rikelman's nomination, and, soon after, we will vote on her  confirmation.   Julie Rikelman has a distinctively American story. In 1979, her  family emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union--Ukraine,  to be specific--settling in Massachusetts. Like so many Soviet  immigrants in the 1970s, her family sought freedom, and especially, as  Soviet Jews, they sought religious freedom.   As a child, Ms. Rikelman and her family left behind the only home  they knew. They endured the challenges of beginning anew in an  unfamiliar country, as refugees, mastering a new language and a new  culture. They embraced their new home and became naturalized U.S.  citizens. Ms. Rikelman's experience as a Soviet political refugee  shaped her lifelong commitment to the American legal system as well as  her commitment to true ``justice for all'' and to the fundamental  principles of the rule of law.   With 25 years of experience, her legal career has been nothing short  of stellar. Julie attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School. She  clerked for Justice Dana Fabe on the Alaska Supreme Court and for Judge  Morton Greenberg on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.   She has worked in private practice and in public interest law,  litigating a range of issues, from reproductive rights cases across the  country to civil and criminal cases at both the trial and appellate  levels. She has experience in securities law, antitrust law, election  law, and constitutional law. Ms. Rikelman's Federal and State court  cases have involved defamation, intellectual property, and employment  discrimination claims. She is a brilliant legal mind and brings deep  experience to issues commonly before the First Circuit.    Julie Rikelman has dedicated her career to the protection of  Americans' fundamental rights, including the rights to liberty and  privacy, distinguishing herself as one of our Nation's leading  reproductive rights attorneys. In 2021, she argued the Supreme Court  case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a seminal case in  the history of our highest Court's considering that issue.   I have complete confidence that Ms. Rikelman will bring a broadened  perspective, steadfast integrity, and deep knowledge to the bench. And  I am not alone in my enthusiasm. My office has received letters in  support of Ms. Rikelman's nomination from dozens of individuals and  organizations, including members of the Alaska State Bar, current and  former prosecutors, law enforcement officials, the National Council of  Jewish Women, and many of her former colleagues.   Colleagues describe Julie Rikelman as ``brilliant, committed to the  rule of law, and deeply devoted to honoring the Constitution and  protecting our civil rights and civil liberties.''   These are precisely the qualities we are looking for in a nominee to  a Federal appeals court. We have them in Julie Rikelman.   It is essential that our Nation's courts reflect the diversity of our  country, and Ms. Rikelman, when confirmed, would be the first immigrant  woman and the first Jewish woman to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the First Circuit. That is what this Nation is all about.   Senator Warren and I are proud and enthusiastically recommend Julie  Rikelman's nomination to President Biden and are proud to speak in  favor of her nomination before the full Senate today. She will make an  exceptional addition to the First Circuit.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on cloture and then on her  confirmation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week, the Senate confirmed Dilawar  Syed to be the Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Small Business  Administration with a bipartisan vote. Mr. Syed was the longest pending  nomination in the Biden administration, waiting 827 days to be  confirmed.   The Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration should  not have been a controversial nomination. Mr. Syed has served our  Nation admirably as Special Representative for Commercial Diplomacy at  the State Department, where he has helped American companies compete in  international markets throughout the world. He has extensive background  as an entrepreneur and business leader with an inspiring immigrant  success story that is only possible in America. Now that he has been  confirmed, he is the highest ranking Muslim American in the Biden  administration.   Mr. Syed should have been confirmed unanimously years ago. But  regrettably, Senate Republicans chose to play politics with changing  excuses designed to obstruct the nomination. Obstruction and delay  resulted in the position being vacant for over 5 years. With record  numbers of entrepreneurs starting new small businesses, we need a fully  staffed SBA.   Senate Republicans criticized pandemic loans that were taken out by  Mr. Syed's company, Lumiata, and accused Mr. Syed of being slow to  disclose the loans. Mr. Syed testified before the committee that the  board of his company had taken out Paycheck Protection Program--PPP-- loans from SBA, funds that they were legally eligible to receive. And  to his credit, Mr. Syed and his company repaid those PPP loans when  they secured an additional round of venture funding. All of this  funding was disclosed to the White House during the vetting process,  and Mr. Syed was transparent about his financials, even beyond the  information asked by the Senate committee questionnaire. Critics tried  to claim that he had misled Congress or outright lied. That is simply  not true.   Despite his unfair treatment, justice ultimately prevailed, and his  nomination passed with bipartisan support from five Republican Senators  who were able to judge Mr. Syed on his character and business acumen  rather than false attacks.   Many nominees would have given up and decided the attacks were not  worth it. With his background, Mr. Syed could have taken a lucrative  positions in the private sector. But our Nation is fortunate that Mr.  Syed did not let this long process deter him from serving the public  interest. I join Mr. Syed's family, friends, and colleagues in  congratulating him on his perseverance throughout this process and look  forward to working with him, Administrator Guzman, and the leadership  team at the Small Business Administration.                            ____________________
