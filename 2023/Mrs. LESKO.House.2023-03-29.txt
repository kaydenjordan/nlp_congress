 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1. This bill  will unleash American energy and reduce gasoline and energy prices for  all Americans.   Look at this chart. Since Biden has taken office, gasoline prices  have gone up 51 percent, utility gas prices have gone up 44 percent,  and electricity prices have gone up for Americans 24 percent.   H.R. 1 is here to help Americans with these outrageous cost-of-living  increases.   I am honored that my legislation to disapprove of President Biden's  decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline was included in this  package. President Biden's decision to cancel the pipeline was a  terrible decision that led to increased gasoline prices and the loss of  thousands and thousands of jobs.   Now is the time to stand up for the American people. Now is the time  to help reduce the cost of gasoline, utility gas, and electricity. Now  is the time to support H.R. 1.
