 Madam Speaker, I rise today because it is time to cut  through the noise and recognize the opportunity at hand.  [[Page H5556]]    Last month, the Senate passed the bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act with the support of 19 Republican Senators,  including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Since then, I have heard the  loudest voices in the room say a lot about this bill, except for  calling it what it is, a once-in-a-generation investment in our  Nation's physical infrastructure.   For myself and so many others, a bill like this is the reason we came  to Congress.   We have heard from the mom or dad who hit a pothole and had to pay  out of pocket to fix the family car.   We have seen our children struggle and fall behind in school without  reliable internet access.   Our communities are the ones where basic access to clean drinking  water has been jeopardized by aging pipes.   Our workers and businesses are the ones calling for investments that  will help them compete on the world stage.   So, the question is: What will we, as Members of Congress, do about  it?   Will we allow blatant partisanship on both sides of the aisle to  stand in the way of legislation that is objectively good for the  American people?   Will we ignore the very real crisis that is facing infrastructure  systems in communities like the one I represent in central New York?   Will we simply disregard the pleas from the most significant labor  and business advocates in the country?   I, for one, will not. I strongly support the bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and I urge the Speaker to bring  the bill to the floor as a standalone vote today.   This long-overdue legislation delivers comprehensive investment in  our roads and bridges, ports and waterways, clean water systems,  broadband networks, electrical grids, and airports.   The bill takes essential steps to streamline Federal permitting  processes and undertakes the crucial work of improving the resiliency  of our hard infrastructure.   Critically, this legislation includes responsible pay-fors in  addition to its $550 billion in new spending for physical  infrastructure. The CBO estimates that the Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act will have a 33 percent return on investment because of the  economic benefits of long-term infrastructure projects. Experts from  the American Enterprise Institute have argued that spending under this  legislation would not contribute to inflation because the spending  would be spread out over a decade and focus on improving long-term  productivity.   To be sure, no legislation is perfect, but this measure is the  product of an honest, good faith, and bipartisan effort to reach  consensus and deliver for our constituents. I know that because I have  spent many years working with my colleagues in the Problem Solvers  Caucus to reach this moment.   Since 2017, our group has worked on a framework that would move the  ball forward on infrastructure and present real policy solutions for  the challenges we face.   In presenting our work to a bipartisan group of Governors, Senators,  and Members of the House in Annapolis, Maryland, earlier this year, we  helped lay the framework for the bipartisan infrastructure bill the  House is now considering.   I am grateful to all of my colleagues who worked on this, and I  sincerely hope that this work will not have been done in vain. I hope  that we can see through the cloud of misinformation and partisan  efforts to hold this bill hostage. I hope my colleagues will look at  this bill objectively, on its own merits, and consider the benefits  that it holds for the communities they represent.   I would also remind my colleagues who are unsure of where they will  fall this one simple thing: The world is watching.   Our Nation's adversaries, like the Chinese Communist Party, would  like nothing more than to see this body yield to partisan interests and  refuse to invest in its own people. These adversaries would cheer our  decision to ignore the crises of the past year and decide not to invest  in cybersecurity for our infrastructure assets. They would be relieved  if we continue a status quo that erases our economy's competitive edge  and allows malign actors to gain the upper hand.   Simply put, with this bill, Congress is taking a critical step in  deciding who will build the future. I will back a future built by  American workers, ensuring opportunities for American families and  American businesses.   I sincerely hope my colleagues will put down their swords just this  once--just this once--and join me.                            ____________________
