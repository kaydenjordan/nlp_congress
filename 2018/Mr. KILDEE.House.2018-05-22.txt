 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I am here to protest what has been the most closed  Congress in American history. I know the other side will recite the  number of amendments that have been allowed, but the fact remains, this  is the most closed Congress we have ever had: 84 closed rules and not  one open rule.    We are sent here by our constituents to advocate for their interests,  and in the minority, one of the few tools we have is the ability to  offer amendments and have those arguments heard on the floor of this  House. Knowing that we may not win every fight, knowing that we may not  win a majority on each idea, we ought to at least allow the power of a  good idea to have a fair hearing.   Twenty-eight times I have offered amendments, thoughtful amendments  that were crafted with the idea that we could actually improve policy,  and 28 times those amendments have been blocked.   These are not messaging amendments, just to give two examples:   One would have increased the amount of funding available to local  governments that are struggling to improve their drinking water  systems. Think about my hometown of Flint and the hundreds of other  communities that would have benefited from that.   Another would have directed the Federal Government to do more to deal  with this issue of PFAS, perfluorinated chemicals, that is poisoning  groundwater. In fact, while the EPA is having a conversation today  about this very dangerous chemical that is affecting human life in this  country, I offered an opportunity for Congress to do something.   Why didn't we do it? Because up in the Rules Committee, it was  blocked.   The ideas ought to have a chance on the floor of the House. That is  what we are sent here to do. We ought to open this Congress up.
