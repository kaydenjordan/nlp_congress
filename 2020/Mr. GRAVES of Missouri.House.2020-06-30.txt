 Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say to my  colleagues that we were putting our time to good use today, but we all  know that we have an incredibly important obligation, and we have got a  lot of work to do when it comes to infrastructure.   We need to pass a long-term surface transportation bill to provide  States and local communities the certainty to plan and execute highway,  bridge, and transit projects across this country.   If we don't do that, or if we pass short-term extensions, it throws  their plans into chaos and it jeopardizes needed improvements.   But that is exactly what we are going to do because the  infrastructure bill in this entire process got highjacked by a partisan  agenda that has more to do with pushing the Green New Deal than it does  fixing our infrastructure.   During all my time serving on the committee, Republicans and  Democrats have always been able to work out their differences and find  common ground to pass a surface transportation bill. We have always  been able to do that.   It is the most important legislative product that we produce on the  committee, and members have always treated it as such.   Time and again, that has been our committee's hallmark because that  is the only road to actually getting something done for the good of our  infrastructure, for transportation workers, and for the economy.   But on this bill, that didn't happen. And I can assure you that  wasn't my choice. This highjacked process began with a $500 billion my- way-or-the-highway bill developed exclusively by one party.    At a time when entire industries, workforces, and our States still  face incredible uncertainty over the COVID pandemic, our committee  passed a partisan bill to completely upend the functions and programs  of the transportation system.   Then immediately after the committee approved the majority's bill  along party lines just over a week ago, the Speaker took the bill and  tripled the size with so many air-dropped provisions that the only  thing that isn't included is the kitchen sink. But, please, don't quote  me on that, Mr. Speaker, because as far as I know the kitchen sink  could be funded in this, as well.   Although we do know one green thing that is not in this bill, and  that is the money to pay for it. This $1.5 trillion climate bill,  camouflaged as an infrastructure bill, piles another mountain of debt  onto the backs of future generations.   This irresponsible bill very well might pass the House, but that is  as far as it is going to go. The Senate is never going to take up this  unserious, progressive wish list. The Speaker may earn praise of her  most liberal Members for this bill, but she is failing the American  people and wasting the House's time on an issue that we all know could  garner bipartisan support.   We could be getting something done to improve America's  infrastructure and provide the stability and certainty that workers and  stakeholders need right now, if only the Speaker of the majority hadn't  unnecessarily chosen partisanship over partnership throughout this  entire process.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are here to talk about improving America's  infrastructure, something that we all agree needs to be done. If we  were serious about doing that, we would be taking up a bipartisan bill  to fix our highways, our bridges, and our transit systems.   Let me remind everyone that 3 months from now highway and transit  programs are going to shut down if we do not act. Every Democrat and  every Republican participating today knows that a bipartisan agreement  is the only way that we are going to get this done. That is why H.R. 2,  which is nothing more than an enormous partisan wish list, is going  nowhere. If this were a serious effort, then we wouldn't be talking  about passing a $1.5 trillion debt to future generations. We would be  talking about real proposals to fix the finances of the highway trust  fund.   Instead, the majority is pointing fingers at the President and  Republicans despite the fact that they wrote the entire partisan  proposal in the Speaker's Office. But they want the American people to  believe that it is Republicans' fault that they couldn't figure out to  how to pay for their bill.   If this were a serious effort, we wouldn't be talking about tacking  on a multitude of unreasonable Green New Deal mandates onto our  transportation programs. We would be talking about bipartisan climate  solutions that address resiliency and actual, identifiable, and serious  solutions like those contained in the Republican alternative bill, H.R.  7248.   If this were a serious proposal, we wouldn't be talking about  creating more uncertainty and instability for States, transportation  businesses, workers, and our economy when everyone is crying out for  certainty and relief right now.   But that is exactly what we are considering today in H.R. 2. This is  a bill that was formed by the Speaker's partisan agenda from the  beginning and continued to balloon from there. Just over a week ago the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the majority's  $500 billion my-way-or-the-highway bill along party lines. Afterwards  the Speaker airdropped in enough new and unvetted proposals and  provisions to triple the size of the bill before rushing it to the  floor.   I am going to highlight just a few of the concerns with this bill.   First, 2 out of every 5 surface transportation dollars--that is $200  billion--is spent on heavy-handed Green New Deal requirements. This  bill widens the gulf between rural and urban infrastructure by putting  programs and policies that benefit urban areas ahead of rural  communities. If you follow the money in the bill, this is made very  clear. H.R. 2 directs the largest funding percentage increases to those  programs. This bill also puts restrictions  [[Page H2921]]  on building new roads, which further hamstrings small communities that  are looking to grow.   How can a bill that prevents States from building the roads that they  need be called an infrastructure bill?   These are just some of the ways this bill limits State and local  flexibility to make decisions that best fit their own priorities. This  bill fails to provide commonsense streamlining reforms widely supported  by transportation businesses and workers, including reforms that were  unanimously approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works  Committee. Projects that take years and even decades to get approved  cost more the longer they are delayed, so that means reducing delays  has the same impact as additional funding. But this bill does nothing  to make reviews more efficient.   Finally, this bill relies on yet another general fund bailout, and  with the irresponsible spending proposal that is in this bill, the  trust fund bailout would cost more than every extension and bill  combined since 2008, and it doesn't even attempt to fix the solvency  issues with the highway trust fund. This is completely irresponsible.  If this messaging bill passes the House, that is as far as it is going  to go. It won't do a single thing to improve America's infrastructure.   There has been so much uncertainty and unpredictability created by  the COVID-19 pandemic across our Nation. What transportation businesses  and workers need right now is stability. But this partisan process and  seismic upheaval of our Federal transportation programs robs them of  that.   This bill does nothing to move us forward, and it is truly a shame.  It really is. I will go on more later, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    The mace indicates we are in session. Are we  in session or in the Committee of the Whole?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who is the ranking member  of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), who is the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Aviation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Speaker, I might point out that, yes,  there are discretionary grants in here for electrical vehicles. What is  interesting is electric vehicles don't pay for the use of that road  either, because the highway trust fund still has yet to be addressed,  has yet to be determined how we are even going to move forward, which  is a huge frustration in this bill. There are absolutely no pay-fors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the ranking member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the ranking member of the  Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the ranking member of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, before we consider amendments to add to this already  massive partisan wish list, I want remind members how we got here.   Just over a week ago we marked up the majority's $500 billion my-way- or-the-highway bill in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  That was a partisan bill from the beginning, and aside from maybe a few  Republican amendments, it remained a partisan bill, and absolutely  partisan bill, coming out of markup.   After our markup, the Speaker added in provisions under our  committee's jurisdiction, some of which completely upended previous  bipartisan legislation to fit their partisan agenda. Others are issues  that we could have found bipartisan agreement on if the majority had  even tried to work with us.   And now we are about to consider yet another broad swath of  provisions in a partisan amendment process that is cut short because  the majority doesn't believe Members should be here when they conduct  the American peoples' business.   The majority believes it is acceptable to put together a massive bill  that is going to turn our transportation system upside down, add $1.5  trillion in debt, add more items to it with an absurd partisan  amendment process, and pass it all by proxy.   All for an infrastructure bill that is not really an infrastructure  bill at all, it is a climate bill that doesn't even attempt to include  consensus solutions to these issues, but instead, bludgeons our  transportation system, industries, and workers into submission.   Republicans have been ready and willing partners throughout this  process, but it takes willingness on both sides of the aisle to work  toward that mutual goal. This bill doesn't offer any solutions, only  more delays, more costs, and more partisanship that really doesn't help  any of our communities or our economy.   Mr. Speaker, for these and many other reasons, this is the first  surface transportation bill, although this bill barely resembles one,  but this is the first transportation bill in all my years of Congress  that I am going to oppose, and I urge my colleagues and fellow Members  to join me in rejecting this partisan messaging bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the surface transportation law expires in just a few  months, and States and workers in transportation businesses are already  facing some uncertainly over the next two construction seasons due to  COVID-19. This bill is going to lead to greater uncertainty by  proposing a seismic shift to our transportation programs by moving us  farther away from a long-term bill.   You know, I fought for a seat on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee because of its track record of working across  the aisle to legislate and get things done. But what we are doing today  is not legislating. We held a partisan markup in which 112 Republican  amendments were rejected, and afterwards, the Speaker essentially  amended it again outside of regular order, by airdropping another $1  trillion of new provisions in the middle of the night, in addition to  the provisions that never went through any committee process.                                time  1600    Several of the added provisions upended previous bipartisan  agreements. So here we are now considering another set of 45 amendments  en bloc, and the majority isn't even giving enough time to allow 1  minute of debate for each amendment. This isn't a serious deliberative  legislative attempt, which is sad considering just how serious and  important it is that we address our Nation's infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address the rural aspects of this bill.   Although it claims to help rural infrastructure, if we just follow  the money, all we have to do is follow the money, we can clearly see  that this bill is going to leave rural America further behind.   The largest percentage increases by far go to transit and rail,  programs that tend to benefit the urban areas much more than rural  communities.   Transit receives a 72 percent increase in funding and Amtrak an  incredible 450 percent increase, yet 71 percent of public road land  miles are in rural America. Crashes and fatalities on rural non- interstate roads occur more than double the rate of all other roads.   But between policies and programs that favor urban areas and weave in  the Green New Deal mandates and other requirements throughout all the  Federal transportation programs, critical resources that could be used  to go directly to fixing and building roads and bridges, pouring  concrete, and laying asphalt in rural America, those are going to be  diverted.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that we just heard about the  rhetoric and the confusion over how this bill is bipartisan. And if you  look at the first three en bloc amendments, they have 107 Democrat  amendments in there and not a single Republican amendment, so where is  the bipartisanship in that?   I also find it interesting, too, and the last speaker just added,  that they were adding $150 billion to the Rebuild Rural America bill,  which supposedly, according to her, already takes care of  [[Page H2948]]  rural America. So why do we have to add more money to it?   So there is a lot of confusion and a lot of misrepresentation on the  other side, particularly when it comes to the rural areas. People can  claim all they want that this takes care of the rural areas when, in  fact, it doesn't. It absolutely doesn't.   The bottom line is this shifts a large percentage of dollars into  those transit programs that help the urban areas, not the rural areas,  and a vote for this is going to be a vote for just that: against rural  America. That is what will come out later.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to rise in opposition to this amendment. Just  as H.R. 2 weaves climate policy throughout the bill, climate provisions  are woven throughout this en bloc amendment as well.   These amendments make local pollution reduction a goal for the  National Highway Freight Network, expand eligibilities for the new  Gridlock Reduction grant program--a program that only benefits the 10  largest cities in the country--and it requires us to figure out whether  autonomous vehicles impact air quality, climate, and energy  consumption.   And still, the bill has no way to pay for these items and just adds  to our debt.   The underlying bill promotes policies that favor urban areas over  rural infrastructure, which leaves our smaller communities farther and  farther behind.   Some members of the majority clearly agree since an amendment  included here felt the need to find more money for the bill's Rebuild  Rural grant program, the lone new program meant to pay lip service to  rural America.   The underlying bill also doesn't provide meaningful streamlining of  the project review process--we talked about this before--even though  there are commonsense bipartisan reforms in the bipartisan Senate bill  that were offered by Republican Members on the committee in markup.   One very narrow amendment in this package acknowledges some need for  relief from burdensome project reviews. Unfortunately, this represents  the only attempt to streamline the review process in the entire bill,  despite near-universal calls for reform.   We could have come together and written an infrastructure bill that  would easily clear this Chamber with an overwhelming bipartisan vote,  and I am disappointed that Republicans' word to work across the aisle  on an infrastructure bill wasn't taken in good faith by the majority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume in opposition to the en bloc package of amendments.   This package contains 34 amendments. As has been the case throughout  this unprecedented process, not a single one of these amendments has  come from Republicans.   I find it interesting. I keep hearing time and time again from the  other side about how bipartisan this bill is. But yet here we are again  with 34 amendments and not a single Republican amendment. Many of the  provisions were stuck in this giant, expensive bill after markup and  without any opportunity for the committee to review and consider them.   The en bloc amendment includes expensive and burdensome new mandates  on the railroad and airline industries even as they strive to keep our  economy moving and workers employed in the middle of the current health  pandemic.   I would like to note that when Republican Members offered aviation  amendments during markup, the majority refused to consider them.   Do you know why?   Because at least at that time they said the bill didn't include any  aviation provisions. Yet this en bloc also contains amendments that  authorize hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending for broad and  vague programs without any plan on how to pay for them. It also  contains more costly Green New Deal mandates that offer no relevant or  beneficial gains to our Nation's infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this package of  amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline).    I reserve the balance of my time, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).  [[Page H2961]]         Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise again to express my disappointment at the  partisan nature of the amendments in this package. For example, it  includes an  [[Page H2963]]  airdropped rail amendment that imposes unreasonable mandates on freight  rail carrying waste by attempting to force an impractical, one-size- fits-all solution that would create more problems than it attempts to  solve.   It includes a significant change in the Economic Development Agency's  revolving loan program and new requirements on public buildings that  the committee never had a chance to consider under regular order.   It also includes an amendment that requires the Department of  Transportation to share protected security and business information on  pipeline incidents with State and local governments, creating  unintended safety and security risks.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is full of partisan amendments meant to  fulfill the Speaker's messaging agenda of unchecked spending and  unserious, one-sided Green New Deal excesses. These provisions are  going to create difficult, impractical, and unreasonable mandates on  the rail and aviation industries at a time when we should be doing what  we can to help them just survive.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to very much oppose this en  bloc amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
