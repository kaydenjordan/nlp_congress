 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Democrats' $3.5  trillion spending spree that favors green special interests over  American wages and livelihoods.   This legislative package is pushing amnesty, adds trillions to our  already historic levels of debt, expands the welfare state to  disincentivize work, and enacts Green New Deal policies that will drive  up utility bills for Americans across the Nation and destroy our  American energy industry.   Additionally, the crippling tax hikes could cost up to 4 million jobs  nationwide, with the middle class and our Main Street businesses  burdening much of the cost.   One proposal pushed by Democrats, the elimination of the stepped-up- basis, effectively creates a new, second death tax that would  eviscerate over 1 million jobs and hurt farmers and ranchers across the  country.   While some of these proposals may not currently be in the House bill,  we must remain vigilant until Senate Democrats and the administration  take these harmful policies off the table entirely.   Folks in my district, and I believe most Americans, do not want a  top-down, one-size-fits-all, job-killing agenda that will completely  reshape our society.   Everyday working-class Americans are hurting, not the rich. I will  oppose any measure that results in higher taxes, lower wages, higher  prices, more government control, and less economic growth.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2022  National Defense Authorization Act, and I applaud the efforts of  Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers to bring this bipartisan bill  to the floor.   This bill boosts defense funding in line with the recommended 3 to 5  percent real growth needed to maintain our competitive edge over China.  The debacle in Afghanistan has weakened our position on the global  stage and is a propaganda boon for our adversaries seeking to dismantle  the democratic world order. There is no doubt that China and Russia are  eyeing this opportunity to cast doubts on U.S. resolve and our  commitments. It is imperative that we reassure our allies and partners  of American strength at every turn.   China is building its military and technological capabilities, and  these investments will help achieve the next-generation joint fighting  force, specifically of air and sea power.   I am an F-22 pilot and have flown against some of the world's most  technologically advanced weapons systems. Now is the time that we need  to take this seriously. Every threat around the world is looking at our  vulnerabilities, and it is this body's work that will help us maintain  those competitive advantages.   To meet these challenges head-on, we must fully embrace the whole-of- government approach to counter any malign intentions.   Congress is integral to this concept, and we must recognize these  challenges and respond with strength at this time. We should not let  perfect be the enemy  [[Page H4933]]  of good, and we cannot delay this legislation at all. The strength of  our military is at stake.   The readiness and lethality that the warfighters so desperately need,  which this bill includes, is absolutely imperative to making sure the  United States can meet any challenges and defeat any enemy around the  world.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the underlying bill, and I look  forward to ironing out our differences through the conference process.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the abortion on demand  act.   This week, Democrats have brought the so-called Women's Health  Protection Act to the floor for a vote. This grotesque bill would  dismantle all efforts by State lawmakers who work on behalf of their  constituents to protect the unborn.                                time  2015    The passage of pro-life laws in Texas, such as the heartbeat bill,  has broad support in the States in which they are enacted. Voters elect  Republican legislators to ensure that their values are protected and  defended. Out-of-touch Democrats are overriding the consciences of  millions of Americans who support the right to life.   Most egregiously, this bill would legalize abortions up through the  last trimester. Late-term abortions are not a healthcare issue; they  are a human rights issue.   With this bill, pro-choice colleagues fail to address one crucial  element, the choice of an unborn child to live out their God-given  destiny.   Republicans stand ready to give our voice to the voiceless and to do  everything in our reach to ensure that this bill never becomes the law  of the land.
