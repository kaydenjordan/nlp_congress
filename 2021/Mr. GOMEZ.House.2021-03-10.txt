 Mr. Speaker, I represent Los Angeles, California,  considered by many as one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic.   In my district working families are struggling to pay bills, small  businesses are trying to stay afloat, and countless others are doing  everything they can to keep a roof over their heads.   They need us to pass the American Rescue Plan.   Throughout California, essential workers, many of them Black and  Latinos, are keeping our economy running. Frontline healthcare workers  are exhausted from caring for their patients day after day, month after  month during this pandemic, and local organizations are distributing  food every single day to those in need. They need us to pass the  American Rescue Plan.   Across the country people are terrified that they or a loved one will  get COVID-19 before being vaccinated and end up in the hospital or  dead. They are scared that the American Dream is drifting further and  further away. They need us to pass the American Rescue Plan.   That is why 75 percent of Americans support this plan. Democrats,  Republicans, independents from red States and blue States, they are  urging us to pass this plan, and they are urging their Representatives  to listen to them. They are urging my colleagues on the Republican side  of the aisle to not turn a deaf ear to their cause and do the right  thing and vote with Democrats to pass this bill.
