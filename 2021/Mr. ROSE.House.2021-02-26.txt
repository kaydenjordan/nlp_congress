 Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise before you today in honor of  National FFA Week.   As an eighth-generation farmer and former member of the Future  Farmers of America myself, I have seen firsthand the positive  difference that FFA makes in the lives of students by developing their  potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success  throughout agricultural education.   FFA members know that American agriculture truly is one of the best  traditions of our national life and that service to one's community is  a pillar of good leadership and citizenship.   I am confident that the future of our Nation's agriculture is in good  hands because it is being shaped by members of the National FFA  Organization.   I wish a happy FFA Week to the 28,000 members in my home State of  Tennessee and to the 760,000 members across the country.                            ____________________
