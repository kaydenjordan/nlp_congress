 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend, for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that  information.   Mr. Speaker, throughout the last year, we have continually run up  against deadlines on how we were going to keep the government of the  United States operating properly.   The omnibus is currently being discussed. The negotiations for the  omnibus were made possible by the fact that a significant number of  Democrats voted for it, while a significant number of Republicans voted  against it. It was a bipartisan statement proceeding.   That omnibus needs to be passed by March 23. We are not scheduled to  be here, Mr. Speaker, on March 23. That does not mean that we might not  go over, but it means that it needs to pass the House and the Senate  and be sent to the President prior to or on March 22.   Negotiations are, unfortunately, not proceeding as effectively as I  would hope they would. I am hopeful that there will be a clean bill  from either  [[Page H1490]]  side without any riders that would lead either side to oppose that  bill.   Mr. Speaker, let me talk about an issue. First of all, let me say  that the leader has announced a number of bills for consideration next  week. I venture to say that an extraordinarily infinitesimal amount of  the American people have any ideas what those bills do or are urging  those bills to be passed. I do not mean that they are without  substance. I mean that they are not the issues on the mind of the  American people. This is the people's House.   Mr. Speaker, the Speaker appeared on television at a townhall on CNN  some 14 months ago. He made a promise at a CNN townhall to a Dreamer  that asked him a question.   House Speaker Paul Ryan strongly suggested to that young woman that  ``revocation on protection for the Dreamers brought here as children  will not be carried out.''   Notwithstanding that, the President of the United States put that  Dreamer and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers--indeed, close to 2  million Dreamers--at risk by withdrawing their protections, which  Speaker Ryan indicated would not happen: ``Will not be carried out.''   That was some 6 months ago, Mr. Speaker. Not the CNN; that was 14  months ago.   I have talked to the Speaker, I have brought it up continuously on  this floor, and I have been told by the Republican leadership: Don't  worry, we have got until March 5 to do something.   I was told that in October, I was told that in November, I was told  that in December, I was told that in January, and I was told that in  February: Don't worry, we have got until March 5.   March 5 came and went. No action. None.   That Dreamer to whom the Speaker spoke is still at risk, still  worried, and still twisting in the wind. Eighty-six percent of the  American public, Mr. Speaker, say that that young woman should not be  kicked out of the country that she knows: brought here as a child, went  to elementary school, middle school, high school; some to college, some  practicing medicine, some practicing law, some being social workers,  many being teachers.   I was told: Don't worry. They were told: Don't worry, March 5 is a  long way away.   It has come and gone.   And we are told this week that we will consider H.R. 1116, the TAILOR  Act. I am not sure that any of my constituents have talked to me about  the TAILOR Act.   H.R. 4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement Act, I doubt that a single  one of my constituents has talked to me about that act.   They are fillers, Mr. Speaker. They are fillers while we fiddle,  while Rome burns.   I have asked, Leader Pelosi has asked, frankly, and leaders of the  Catholic Church and other denominations have asked to put the Dreamer  bill on the floor in the people's House.   The Speaker of this House, when he became the Speaker, said: We will  not duck the tough issues. We will take them head-on. Don't worry, we  have got until March 5.   March 5 is behind us, and we consider these bills, which I think are  filler bills, and controversial bills at that.   We have asked, Mr. Speaker, that the majority party put on the floor  three bills on an issue of vital importance to the American people,  that every American knows about, that the people's House ought to have  the right to speak on, and express the views of the American people and  establish policy they support--86 percent of them.   So I will, again, ask the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, to put the  Dream Act on the floor; to put Mr. Goodlatte's bill on the floor; to  put the bipartisan bill, sponsored by Mr. Hurd from Texas and Mr.  Aguilar from California; put them on the floor.                                time  1100    Take the issues. I know they are tough. The Speaker said he wants to  take the issues head-on, Mr. Speaker, not duck. Show some political  courage. And not only that, respect this institution and every Member  in it who wants to express their opinion on this legislation of  critical importance to at least 1.8 million Americans, vital to their  future, to their life.   And 86 percent of Americans believe they ought to be protected, just  as Speaker Ryan pledged they would be 14 months ago when he said  revocation of protection for the Dreamers brought here as children will  not be carried out. Mr. Speaker, that bill ought to be brought to the  floor to carry out that representation and that assurance.   I have been patient. I have talked. I have worked. I have come to  meetings. I met with the President of the United States, Mr. Speaker,  with my colleague and friend, the majority leader, and Mr. Durbin and  others, 25 of us sitting around the Cabinet table, Mr. Speaker, when  the President said we will take care of DACA, and he said: You send me  a bill; I will sign it, and I will take the heat.   He was not telling the truth, Mr. Speaker, because we had a bill,  called the commonsense crowd, about 25 United States Senators brought a  bill to the floor. It took care of a couple of the things the President  wanted to take care of, but it wasn't good enough for him,  notwithstanding the fact he said: You send me a bill. You decide, i.e.,  the Congress, the coequal branch of government that now stands  suppliant in the face of saying we will pass something only if the  President will sign it.   That is not what the framers meant, Mr. Speaker. We are a coequal  branch, not a subservient branch of the government of the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, if we brought those three bills to the floor that I just  referred to--the Dream Act, cosponsored by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a  Republican, and Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat; and the Goodlatte  bill, sponsored by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and a  bipartisan bill sponsored by many Republicans and many Democrats, Mr.  Hurd, a Republican from Texas, and Mr. Aguilar, a Democrat from  California--if we brought those bills to the floor, the problem is they  know the Hurd-Aguilar bill would pass, which would reflect the views of  86 percent of the American people.   No, Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the fact that the American people  are overwhelmingly for that, we are going to be considering H.R. 1116,  H.R. 4545, H.R. 4263, ignoring that 1.8 million people, ignoring that  promise that the Speaker made to that young woman that she would be  protected.   The Speaker has told me over and over again: Oh, I want to do this. I  want to do that. I am going to have some task force. I am going to do  this, that, and the other.   March 5 has come and gone. Nothing has happened.   I used to be the majority leader. I could bring a bill to the floor.  If I said something was going to happen, I tried to make sure it  happened.   If I sound angry, it is because I am angry. If I sound frustrated, it  is because I am frustrated. The people's House ought to be given the  opportunity to express the will of the American people on this issue.   There is another issue, and we do have a bill, the so-called  Rutherford bill that we are bringing to the floor on suspension. We are  probably all going to vote for the Rutherford bill.   But we are going to ignore a bill, as we have been ignoring for years  under Republican leadership, a bill that is supported even more than  the DACA, Dreamer bills, and that is comprehensive background checks,  which clearly will save lives, which will close the loopholes, which  will make sure that those with criminal records don't get guns, will  make sure that those with mental health issues don't get guns, will  make sure that terrorists who can't fly on airplanes can't get guns.   Mr. Speaker, we have been urging and pleading for that bill to be  brought to the floor over and over and over again. The National Rifle  Association is not for that bill. I can't understand why. Rather, we  bring a bill to the floor that will help schools--I think that is  positive--do what they can do right now.   Should we help them? Of course. But we ought not to pretend that we  are doing something to make our children safer in their schools, to  make concertgoers safer at their concerts, to make churchgoers safer in  their church, to make people who go to a nightclub safer in that  nightclub, to make people who go to shopping centers safer in those  shopping centers. We ought not to pretend the Rutherford bill is going  to do that.  [[Page H1491]]    Will comprehensive background checks do it all? It will not. There  are other things I think ought to be done. But at a minimum, the  American people think that we ought to make sure that everybody who  purchases a weapon has a background check to make sure that they are  not a criminal, somebody with a substantial mental health problem that  makes them unsafe to own a gun, spousal abusers.   Mr. Speaker, the bills we are going to consider next week I am sure  have some merit from some perception, from somebody's perception, but  the two bills that I have just discussed are on the minds of the  American people, and millions are at risk if we do not pass legislation  dealing with that issue.   I do not criticize the Rutherford bill, but it will not solve the  problem, and everybody knows it will not solve the problem; nor,  frankly, will universal background checks in and of itself solve the  problem, but experts say it will save thousands of lives over time. It  would have saved lives in Charleston, South Carolina, the nine people  killed in Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I like to work in a bipartisan way, but that requires  respecting one another. My Republican friends wrote a book in which  they were very critical of the way we ran the House because it wasn't  open and transparent. I would ask them to reread that book. I have read  it.    My friend is smiling.   In that book, they really wanted to change the way this House runs,  make it open and transparent, take the tough issues head-on. That is  what the Speaker said.   Mr. Speaker, they are not taking the tough issues head-on. They are  hiding from the NRA. They are hiding from some of their hardline people  who want to kick people out of America, who want to take that lamp that  the Statue of Liberty holds high and bring it down.   Yes, I am disappointed. Yes, I am angry. Yes, I am frustrated. I came  to this body to express my opinion on the important issues confronting  my country and to try to make it better.   Mr. Speaker, I would plead with the majority leader to perhaps delay  those four bills. Rutherford's could be on suspension. It won't take  much time. Delay those three bills that a miniscule amount of  Americans, there may be 100, there may be 200 Americans who would be  concerned those bills aren't brought forward, and put on the floor the  three bills I referred to--the Dream Act, the Goodlatte bill, and the  Hurd-Aguilar bill--and let the people's House express its opinion. That  is not an unfair request.   And let the background check, universal background check bill come to  the floor, and let the House vote. I know that there are some  Republicans who don't want to vote on that bill because the public is  so overwhelmingly for it and they may upset the NRA. That is what this  business is about, Mr. Speaker, expressing openly and clearly what we  think the policies of our country ought to be to make our public  better, to make our country safer.   Mr. Speaker, I would end on those two issues, and I yield to my  friend, the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time to just make a correction.   I said a significant number of Democrats voted for it and a  significant number of Republicans voted against it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, the majority leader talked about a lot of  issues, one of which was NICS. What he didn't say was they put a poison  pill in the Fix NICS bill, which is why so many of us voted against it  on concealed carry. There is a disagreement in this House on that. We  disagree, for the most part, on that provision. We don't think that  makes America safer. There are differences of opinion on that.   My suggestion to the majority leader is, the Rutherford bill is on  the floor. By unanimous consent, let's put the Fix NICS bill in the  Rutherford bill without the poison pill in it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman to see if he will be agreeable  to doing that.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, my question was, will you  agree--you talked a lot about NICS and where it is failing, and we can  fix it. We agree with that.   So what I am asking you--you put the Rutherford bill on. I think most  of us are going to vote for the Rutherford bill. Maybe all of us will  vote for the Rutherford bill, which says let's help schools make  themselves more safe.   Why should anybody be opposed to that?   What I say to you is: you just spent a significant amount of time  talking about how we could make the NICS process work better, but that  many of us voted against it and it hasn't moved in the Senate.   I guarantee you--I don't know that I can guarantee you, but my  thinking is: if you do the Rutherford bill, and if you add in the Fix  NICS bill--not with concealed carry, but the Fix NICS bill that you  talk about in the Rutherford bill--  [[Page H1493]]  I will work with you to get that passed in the United States Senate,  and I think we will be successful.   My question to the majority leader: Will you agree to a unanimous  consent request to add the Fix NICS bill into the Rutherford bill on  the suspension calendar?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    The answer is no, Mr. Speaker. The answer is no, because  we want to continue to have that on which we agree defeated by that on  which we do not agree. That is the pattern. And when the gentleman says  all those bipartisan bills, there were some, obviously, Democrat votes  on many of those bills, I am sure.   Mr. Speaker, I didn't hear a word about a bill that has the  majority's support on the floor of the House of Representatives that I  spoke about, and that is Hurd-Aguilar. Mr. Goodlatte, the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee said if Goodlatte was put on the floor, it will  lose 50, 60, 70 Republicans. Mr. Goodlatte said that, and that was  passed out of the Judiciary Committee. It hasn't been brought to the  floor because it would fail.    Hurd-Aguilar, which has not been considered by the committee, but  which has the majority of votes on this floor, that bill has not been  brought up; just as the bill that passed the United States Senate 5  years ago, to deal with so many of the problems that immigration  confronts us with, including security at the border, 5 years, has not  been brought up. March 5, nothing happened. Come and gone.   The majority leader spent a lot of time, Mr. Speaker, talking about  things that are important but were not on the subject because he  doesn't want to deal with the subject. Apparently the Republicans don't  want to deal with the subject and they won't put it on the floor. They  are obstructing the will of the American people and they are putting  thousands and thousands and thousands of people at risk.   The majority leader, with all due respect, is wrong. All of the DACA  recipients are not protected, and many of them are not signing up again  because they are afraid their government will come after them. They  feel they were flim-flammed.   I disagree with the majority leader, Mr. Speaker. Many of us believe  what the President did is absolutely legal. It is consistent with what  Ronald Reagan did, with what George H.W. Bush did, with what Bill  Clinton did, and what George W. Bush did.                                time  1130    Every President, since I have been serving here, has modified  immigration consistent with their executive authority. There was  nothing mentioned about the quote of the Speaker that was clearly  directed at this young woman to say that revocation of protections for  the Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out.   Nobody can sign up for DACA protection now under the court order-- nobody. You can re-up, but you can't sign up--1.8 million. The  President of the United States, Mr. Speaker, sent a message down here,  or maybe he tweeted it, they would agree to 1.8 million and a pathway  to citizenship, parenthesis, if you agree with this, if you agree with  that, if you agree with the other.   That is not what was said at the White House, Mr. Speaker. I agree  with the majority leader. He brought up some other points, said we need  to agree to discuss those. I agreed to discuss them. I didn't agree to  agree to them, nor did anybody else in that room. And the President of  the United States, 25 Members of the House and Senate sitting around  the Cabinet table, said: Are we agreed that we are going to solve the  DACA issue first?   Not a single Member demurred. Not a single Member said no--not a  single one, Mr. Speaker, yet we can't get that bill to the floor. And  the majority leader says: Oh, well, we are bringing up a bill that will  create jobs.   I am for doing that. And, frankly, if we do that the week after or  the week after that--frankly, I don't know the bills well enough to be  speaking about them with much depth of information as to how they were  voted on in committee, but my inkling is that the majority Democrats--I  don't know what is in there, in these bills--may well have voted  against them. Most of those bills coming out of committee are pretty  partisan.   We didn't discuss the three bills that I brought up. The majority  leader didn't mention them. They have bipartisan support on two; and  one, the chairman of the committee admits, does not have the votes on  this floor. He would get no Democratic votes, and he would lose a  substantial number of Republican votes, and the majority leader knows  that, Mr. Speaker.   And we talk about NICS. I want to fix NICS. I don't want concealed  carry to be part of that. And I regret that the majority leader would  not agree to let's fix NICS and put the Rutherford bill through. That  would pass the Senate, but he has got a bill over there he knows won't  pass the Senate but maybe it makes a good talking point.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know what we have to do. We have been waiting a  long time, not just the 6 months since September, waiting for March 5  to come and go. We have been waiting for a long time to have bills on  the floor with an open amendment process so we can, in fact, do the  people's will on immigration and on protecting our students and our  families and our citizens from the irresponsible use of guns.   We are not against the responsible use of guns. We believe the Second  Amendment protects people on owning handguns and hunting guns; but the  Supreme Court, in the Heller decision, said there are things that the  community could do. There are things that the government can do to  protect its people and to make sure that gun use, within the framework  of the Second Amendment, is responsible.   I don't know what we have to do, Mr. Speaker. I don't think anybody  doubts that the Hurd-Aguilar bill has the majority votes in this House.  I would urge people to, if they believe in this issue, sign a discharge  petition. They refused to bring the Export-Import Bank bill to the  floor for 1\1/2\ or 2 years. Some of the leadership weren't for it. As  a matter of fact, the two highest weren't for it. But 127 Republicans  to 117 Republicans, they were for it, and over 300 votes were for it,  and they would not bring it to the floor short of a discharge petition.   That is not transparency; that is not openness; that is not taking  the tough issues head on. That is obfuscating. That is undermining  democracy in the people's House. If the gentleman wants to respond, I  will yield to him. If not, I will yield back the balance of my time.    I did not.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. With all due respect, Mr.  Speaker, I indicated to the leader what I said, and I knew what I said,  and I know what the facts are. The Republicans could not pass that bill  on their own. There were over 60 Republicans who voted ``no'' on that  bill, and they got 167. You may have given me--or 170.   That is, Mr. Speaker, almost 50 short of passage. Mr. Speaker, I will  tell you, when I was majority leader, we didn't get much help from the  other side, and we always had 218 to pass what we wanted to pass on our  side. Seventy-three of our Democrats voted for it, which is why it  passed. Not the majority, because the majority of us were so  frustrated.   Again, the majority leader has not spoken to the bills. He has spoken  about what we have passed. And the CHIP bill, by the way, was brought  up weeks after its authority expired. Weeks after it expired.    He says it was because of our committee. I will tell you,  Mr. Speaker, we can't stop anything in committee. They have a majority  on every committee and can bring a bill up tomorrow--the next hour if  they decide to do so.    No, after.    It expired on September 30. You didn't bring it up until  weeks after that.    I have consulted with the staff person for whom you have  great respect and affection, and she says that I am right. Now, she is  my staffer, so maybe she is somewhat biased, but I will tell you that  we believe we are right on that.   But that is not the point, Mr. Speaker. The point is not what we have  done in the past--particularly what we have done. And we all are for  CHIP. That is not the point. The point is we have two critical pieces  of legislation this House must address and that the overwhelming  majority of the American people think we ought to address and think we  ought to pass and are for. And I don't mean 51 percent or 52 percent of  them. I mean 86 percent of the people or more. It is not a close  question.   And rather than talking about, well, we did this, we passed 5,950  bills, I am not talking about those bills. I am talking about bills we  haven't brought to the floor, Mr. Speaker, that we haven't allowed the  House to consider; that we have hundreds of thousands of kids, young  people who we respect and who are teachers, are doctors, are workers in  our factories making a difference, working in restaurants and hotels.   I was with the Chamber of Commerce in Maryland just the other day,  and three different CEOs came up to me and said: We have got DACA  people working for us and doing an excellent job, and they are worried  that they are going to be kicked out of the only country they know.   But we talk about NICS, and we talk about this, that, and the other.  Bring those bills to the floor. That is what we are asking for. We want  that respect. We want that respect for this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to the majority leader again. It is  those two bills that we believe would pass with significant majorities  in this House--the three bills, and we can choose between them. We have  offered the queen of the hill, with the explanation for those who may  be watching and not bored stiff. One of those three bills that I have  mentioned, one a Republican bill, the other two bipartisan bills, Ros- Lehtinen-Roybal-Allard bill and the Hurd-Aguilar bill, both of those  bills are bipartisan. Certainly one of those will get a significant  majority of this House, and I am not denigrating the bills.   I may or may not be for them that are on the schedule, but there are  no issues that the country feels are more important right now than  background checks, and there is no issue more timely than fixing--as  the Speaker pledged to do 14 months ago, putting at risk that young  woman and hundreds of thousands of other individuals in our country  similarly situated. That is what we ought to be doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, the leader spoke in a very calm and reasoned  way. I will do the same.   As an aside, I will tell you the CHIP bill passed on November 3, over  a month after its authorization expired.   Mr. Speaker, the majority leader talks about coming to compromise. I  went down to the White House. Mr. Durbin and I talked about whether we  would go to the White House. We went to the White House out of respect  for the Presidency, out of a hope that the discussions that we had at  the White House would lead to resolution of a serious issue threatening  hundreds of thousands, indeed, close to 2 million individuals who know  America as their country and who 86 percent of Americans think ought to  stay here in America.   In that meeting, Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States  said--and he said it on television. You don't have to take my word.  There is a video record of what the President said. What he said is we  would take care of the DACA issue, consistent, Mr. Speaker, with what  Speaker Ryan said to that young woman when he said that the revocation  of protections for Dreamers brought here as children will not be  carried out.   There was no parenthetical addition, if we do X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D, W.  There was no parenthetical phrase. He said: We will not put you at  risk, young woman, and those similarly situated.   We have a bipartisan coalition on this floor, but the leader speaks  about going into a room--if you want to have a pejorative, a back room,  privately--to try to resolve issues not directly related to the DACA  protectees.   They are here. The President said they ought to stay here. And the  President made a representation, Mr. Speaker, that if we passed a bill,  he would sign it. But as the Senate considered a compromise piece of  legislation, agreed to by Republican Senators and Democratic Senators,  just a few hours before it was brought to the floor, the President said  he would veto it. That was not what he said on television in the White  House. He said that he would take the heat, if heat there is, and sign  the bill that we sent down.   Now we have a Speaker of the House and a majority leader of the  Senate who say we won't send something down to the President unless he  agrees to sign it, meaning that the House and Senate will not act  independently of the President's imprimatur. How sad a position it is  that the people's House and the United States Senate have subjugated  themselves to the President of the United States.    I presume, Mr. Speaker, that prolonging this discussion apparently  will make no difference. But, Mr. Speaker, our side of the aisle  represents just short of 50 percent, maybe 48 percent, of the American  people. Mr. Speaker, we are saying let us consider. Let us have on this  floor--not in a back room, not in somebody's office, not somewhere  privately--on the House floor, the people's floor, let us vote.   Let the American people see who raises their hand ``aye'' and ``nay''  on propositions that have been worked on in committee, the Goodlatte  bill, and for months between Republicans and Democrats, bipartisan  bills. Let the people speak through their Representatives. Don't bottle  it up in somebody's office. Let the people's House work its will. Have  the courage to pursue that which you said you would do and take the  tough issues head-on, not duck them.   Mr. Speaker, I would hope, on behalf of that 86 percent of the  American people who support the Dreamers, and even more who support  comprehensive background checks, that we have the ability to consider  those bills and consider them next week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
