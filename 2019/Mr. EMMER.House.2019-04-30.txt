 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rice Elementary  School for being authorized to teach the Primary Years Program as an  International Baccalaureate World School.   The International Baccalaureate program takes an interdisciplinary  approach, allowing children to learn and collaborate in the classroom.  This program provides a unique learning experience to students,  expanding their horizons and teaching them about our larger world  beyond our own borders.   I congratulate the teachers and administrators at Rice Elementary. I  thank them for always going above and beyond for their students and  their families.   I am proud to recognize Rice Elementary School as a leader in  education in our great State of Minnesota, the Education State, and in  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District.   Congratulations again to the teachers, administrators, and most  importantly, the students and their families.               Tribute to Retired Chief Petty Officer Alan Dix     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor retired Chief Petty  Officer Alan Dix from Elk River, Minnesota, for his service to our  country.   After serving 24 years in the Navy and being stationed in Iraq, he  continues to serve in our community. Chief Petty Officer Dix is  responsible for creating the Spirit of Minnesota Tribute Bell.   In partnership with Wells Fargo, Alan and the Minnesota Assistance  Council for Veterans led the effort to create the Tribute Bell to thank  and honor our servicemembers and veterans for their sacrifices to our  great Nation.   Alan currently serves as the chair of the Minnesota Veterans Team  Members Network, which is part of the Minnesota Assistance Council for  Veterans. The council helps veterans and their families access  employment, housing, and legal assistance.   Through this organization, Alan made the Spirit of Minnesota Tribute  Bell a reality. The bell embodies the symbolism of respect that our  community has toward our military. Because of their courage and valor,  we are safer and stronger as a country.   We are thankful for Alan. He reminds us of how important it is to  remember and honor those who gave so much to our Nation.   His service and all of his work on behalf of our veterans and their  families is greatly appreciated.       Recognizing Mitch Eickhoff, 2019 Sauk Rapids Citizen of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mitch Eickhoff for  being named the 2019 Sauk Rapids Citizen of the Year. Mitch is a  lifelong resident of Sauk Rapids and the Sauk Rapids community. He is  also a lifelong public servant.   Through his foundation, FGHC Active, Mitch raises money by organizing  5K runs and other community events for organizations like the Sauk  Rapids Fire Department, Tanner's Team Foundation, and Anna Marie's  Alliance.   Mitch's charitable efforts also extend well beyond the borders of  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District and the State of Minnesota.  Mitch has raised money to support the Burn Violence Survivors--Nepal,  which helps with the recovery process for burn victims in South Asia.  He has also supported communities in Malawi, Africa, raising money for  healthcare, education, and the environment.   Mitch's work to serve people in our community and beyond deserves  recognition. Our district and our constituents all benefit from his  passion to serve others.   I thank Mitch for making an exceptional impact on our community.                            ____________________
