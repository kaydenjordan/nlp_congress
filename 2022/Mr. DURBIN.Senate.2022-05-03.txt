I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet)  and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, Americans across the country today woke  up to a rare occurrence in the history of our American democracy.   The highest Court in our land is preparing to eliminate a federally  protected constitutional right--a woman's right to choose. I am an  amateur historian, but I can't think of a precedent in history where  the Supreme Court has taken away a constitutional right after it has  been in place for 50 years. Women in America may soon live in a country  where they have fewer rights than their parents and grandparents.   Let me be clear. The leak of the majority draft opinion in Dobbs v.  Jackson Women's Health Organization is a breach of the Court's  confidential deliberations. But the opinion which--draft opinion, which  has been authenticated by the Chief Justice, is very real.   It is a peculiar political event this afternoon. Senator McConnell,  the Republican leader, who has focused more of his energy and efforts  on reshaping the Federal judiciary to reflect his political point of  view, was virtually silent on the issue of this Alito draft opinion on  the Dobbs case. He couldn't be pinned down as to whether he would  acknowledge it or even say something good about it. Supposedly, it was  the answer to his political prayer.   He went so far in trying to reach this goal as to protect a vacancy  on the Supreme Court for almost 10 months. Antonin Scalia died while  Barack Obama was still President, in his last year of his second term,  and McConnell--Senator McConnell made the argument that he did not have  the authority, since he was a lameduck President, in Senator  McConnell's words, to fill the vacancy.   So the Supreme Court was there with 8 members for 10 months until  Senator McConnell's political prayer was answered again and Donald  Trump was elected President and could appoint a Justice of Senator  McConnell's political liking. So he has been very successful in his  approach to filling vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court with people who  agree with his political philosophy.   Now, one of them, Justice Alito, is about to hand down an opinion  which eliminates Roe v. Wade, a position which is consistent with  Senator McConnell's belief that has been stated on the floor many  times. And yet, when he was asked today whether he was in favor of this  opinion, he refused to even answer. He wanted to focus on  [[Page S2261]]  who leaked this opinion. Well, of course, that is an important  question. The Court is working on it right now with the Chief Justice  turning his U.S. Marshal on the case.   But he would--Senator McConnell insisted on avoiding even taking a  position on this draft opinion that has now been spread across America.  It makes no sense at all.   Women across America are grappling with the very real concern and,  yes, you could say fear, that they may lose access to reproductive  freedom and choice in a matter of weeks. If true, this decision will  end a 50-year guarantee that reproductive rights are protected by our  Constitution.   If this radical decision becomes the law of the land, it would deny  tens of millions of Americans their bodily autonomy. In an instant,  abortion would be rendered illegal in more than a dozen States.   In this land of liberty, the government has no business interfering  with a woman's right to her own reproductive healthcare. It is her  right to choose, plain and simple. But for the past several decades,  the far right has fought relentlessly to eliminate this constitutional  right. They have waged a harsh campaign to, in some instances, actually  punish the women seeking abortions.   Here is what I am describing: In Texas last year, lawmakers passed a  law that has turned bounty hunters loose on anyone who even helps a  woman receive an abortion.   And that Mississippi law that the Court is poised to uphold, it makes  no exception for women seeking abortion in the case of rape or incest.   At a certain point, you have to ask: What is the real goal here?  These restrictive laws won't stop people from getting abortions. We  know that from history. They only make the procedure dangerously unsafe  and, in some cases, prohibitively expensive for low-income Americans.  Women's lives are literally at stake.   Furthermore, we have hardly begun to reckon with the consequences of  this decision when it comes to other fundamental liberties.   I read Justice Alito's draft opinion. It is hard for me to describe  it in a few words, but when it comes to issues as fundamental as  privacy and personal choice, Justice Alito takes a pretty harsh point  of view.   He acknowledges that cases that are often cited in the name of  privacy, such as Griswold--I can vaguely remember that before the  Griswold decision in the 1960s, the decision of selling contraceptives  was subject to strict State regulation, and in many States, they  prohibited the sale of any forms of contraception. It is hard for  America to even believe that, when you see forms of contraception being  advertised on television these days, but there was a time in the  fifties and before when State regulations prevailed.    Griswold v. Connecticut was a Supreme Court case that took a look at  the regulation in Connecticut and said: It is fundamentally wrong. We  believe that individuals have a right of privacy to make their own  decision on contraception.   That was a privacy right, which I respect. And yet, if you are  careful and read every single word, you will never find the word  ``privacy'' in the Constitution. The Supreme Court found the right to  privacy by combining the rights of several other different amendments.   That wasn't good enough for Justice Alito on the basis of this draft  opinion we have been given. He said since he can't find the word  ``abortion'' in the Constitution, he doesn't believe there is a right  to it. And he goes on to compare it to privacy rights, like the one I  just described in Griswold v. Connecticut, and he said that is just a  matter of saying privacy is your right to choose your own personal  lifestyle, or words to that effect.   Well, it is more than that. It gets down to the fundamentals. And if  you are going to be making a decision with something as basic as a  family--a husband and wife deciding how many children and when you will  have children--it really is one of the most basic things that  frequently you would define freedom in this country.   That is not the way Justice Alito defines it in the Dobbs decision.  If we apply Justice Alito's reasoning behind this draft decision to  other rights, the implications are staggering. The Supreme Court could  turn back the clock on a whole host of civil liberties.   What is next--the return of State bans on contraception? bans on  same-sex marriage? bans on the permissible conduct of LGBTQ people and  their different sexual orientation situation? All of that can be on the  table.   Now that the Supreme Court has confirmed that this draft opinion is  authentic, the Members of this Senate cannot delay. We need to hold a  vote codifying the right to abortion into law. Let's show the American  people where each Senator stands.   Senator McConnell ducked the question at a press conference today. I  still don't understand why. But he can't duck the vote. We are going to  make sure that there is a vote and that his Members, as well as the  Senator, have an opportunity to express themselves on the record.   Will we allow our children to inherit a nation that is less free than  the one their parents grew up in? That is the question which presents  itself to this Senate.                                    USICA    Mr. President, last month, on the evening of April 5, a drone whizzed  through the skies of Shanghai, China. The city had been shut down for  nearly a week following a recent uptick in COVID. China's government  forced Shanghai's nearly 26 million residents into a strict lockdown.  Nobody was allowed to leave their home, not even to buy groceries or  medicine.   By the evening of April 5, many residents were running out of food.  Panic was starting to set in. In one housing complex, the residents  began shouting from their windows, demanding that the government  provide them with the basics.   As they shouted, the drone stopped flying and began hovering over  their housing complex. It blinked a white flashing light as a robotic  voice issued a command--a command that would send chills down the spine  of anyone.   The voice instructed the residents of that Shanghai apartment complex  to comply with the lockdown and then said: ``Control your soul's desire  for freedom.''   As government drones patrol Shanghai's skies, robotic dogs are  patrolling the city's empty streets, barking commands for citizens to  ``remain civilized.''   These methods of enforcement and control did not appear out of thin  air. For years, the Chinese government has poured its treasure and  talent into developing next-generation technology, like dystopian  drones, robotic dogs, and the most sophisticated surveillance apparatus  in the world.   Technology, of course, by itself is neither good nor bad. The same  technology can be used to advance freedom and democracy as they use to  suppress it. For instance, facial recognition technology is built into  our smart phones to protect our sensitive data. In China, this  technology is also used to monitor their citizenry and tabulate their  ``social credit scores.''   The Chinese government also uses artificial intelligence, AI, for the  troves of data it collects on its own citizens every day, particularly  on ethnic minorities like the Uighers, against whom the Chinese  government is committing human rights abuses.   Scientific and technological innovation are critical to America's  future economic prosperity and standard of living, but innovation is  also critical to our national security and to the future of our  country.   Who do we want to take the lead in shaping the future, the United  States or the other democracies of the world or authoritarian states  like China and Russia?   China's technological clout is a product of decades of investment.  This chart shows the annual growth of research and development  expenditures since 1995. Note that leading the path is China; Korea is  second, Taiwan is third, Israel is fourth, and the United States, five.   From 1995 to 2018, China increased its investment in research and  development by more than 15 percent on average, reaching $463 billion  in 2018. Since then, they have accelerated the pace. China's  investments were nearly double the increase we have seen in Korea,  which has the second highest R&D. During that same period, America grew  by less than 5 percent, leaving it only $89 billion ahead of China.  [[Page S2262]]    Last December, a report from Harvard warned that China is now a  ``full-spectrum peer competitor'' when it comes to advanced technology  like AI and quantum computing.   For years, I have been working on the Senate Appropriations Committee  to address this gap--to boost federal investments in science,  technology, and medical R&D. For America to remain the scientific and  technological leader of the world, we need to now act significantly to  increase investment.   The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA, will enable us to  make these investments. It is a down payment on a more secure America.  USICA will mark our Nation's largest investment in science and  technology since Apollo 11. It will strengthen our national security in  the age of cyber warfare. It will harness American innovation to drive  economic growth.   It includes a provision I led with Senator Shaheen that requires the  U.S. to increase exports by 200 percent to African, Latin American, and  Caribbean markets where China is already making considerable  investments. This provision is going to help American workers. And,  importantly, USICA will also reinvigorate American manufacturing by  bringing microchip production back to our shores. It devotes $50  billion to expand our U.S. microchip industry--a critical component in  our future economy.   Microchips, computer chips--the small pieces of silicon that power  everything around us from smartphones to appliances like refrigerators  and microwaves--even our cars have dozens of microchips.   Right now, there is a serious global shortage. It has disrupted  virtually every industry. It is leading to higher prices for all types  of products. America actually invented the microchip, and we used to  make them here, too--nearly 40 percent of the world's supply. But we  let that manufacturing production get away. Now we have got to bring it  home. Today, we produce only 10 percent of the world's supply of  microchips. Also, microchip production has massive consequences for our  economy. When a disaster like COVID hits that causes a microchip  factory in Malaysia to halt production, American businesses and  consumers suffer. We have become dangerously dependent on China and  other competitors when it comes to securing our supply chain with  microchips.   With USICA, we can rebuild America's manufacturing and solve supply  chain shortages. It will incentivize American companies to hire more  American workers to make their products right here at home. In addition  to shoring up America's supply chain, USICA will help protect American  consumers.   The House has a counterpart bill, the America COMPETES Act. Included  in that is something known as the INFORM Consumers Act. I introduced  this with Senator Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, and it was led  in the House by Congresswoman Schakowsky and Representative Gus  Bilirakis. This bill will help prevent counterfeit goods from China and  stolen goods from our retail stores from being hawked by shady sellers  on online marketplaces.   It was 10 years ago or more, Home Depot came to see me and said: We  got a problem.   And I said: What is it?   They said: Our drills are being sold on an internet marketplace.   I said: What is wrong with that?   They said: We are not selling them. They are the drills which are  made in our sole manufacturing facility in China. Somewhere after they  are made, they are stolen, and someone is stealing enough of them that  they can offer them for sale on the internet.   I said: Well, that explains a lot of what is going on.   Go into a drugstore today and try to buy a deodorant, and you will  find it is under lock and key. And you think to yourself: Wait a  minute. That only costs a couple bucks. Why is it under lock and key?  Because it is so frequently stolen and bought. Whether it is Home  Depot's drills or deodorants sold at Walgreen's, people are stealing  them in volume not for personal use or personal sale, but because there  are gangs that are peddling these goods on the internet.    So we put together a bill, Senator Cassidy and myself, that prevents  these counterfeit goods and stolen goods from being sold without  disclosing the name of the seller. We had some resistance from some of  these internet marketplaces. They didn't want to disclose the name of  the seller. We told them: That seller is selling stolen goods on your  marketplace.   ``Well, that is their business. They have a right to  confidentiality.''   It took a long time to persuade them otherwise.   Our bill is being supported by a broad coalition: the National  Association of Manufacturers, the Fraternal Order of Police, the AFL- CIO, and Consumer Reports.   I think it is about time. You look at these gangs that are running in  and doing all this shoplifting in massive amounts and pulling it into  garbage bags. It isn't for them to go out and sit on the sidewalk and  try to sell what they have stolen. They have got a syndicate--a  gangland operation which filters all these goods into an internet  marketplace. Now, if we can start to identify the sellers of these  illegal and stolen goods, perhaps we can start to bring justice to this  situation.   Finally, USICA is going to make crucial investments in America's  capacity to innovate and pioneer groundbreaking technology. It  authorizes billions of dollars to the National Science Foundation to  help America's scientists unlock the potential of AI, quantum  computing, and other advanced technology. These investments will make a  difference.   Just 2 weeks ago, I was at the University of Illinois Urbana- Champaign, where Dr. Panchanathan, who heads up the National Science  Foundation, made a visit. I am proud to report that many universities  in our State do Federal research, but the University of Illinois may do  more than most, and they receive many grants from the National Science  Foundation.   We welcomed the Director of that science foundation to Illinois, and  he made a point of looking at the projects that were being funded.   I can't even start to describe to you what some of them are. I am  just a liberal arts lawyer. I heard these descriptions about the next  generation of computing and technology.   Let me tell you about one of the products which I did understand. It  was led by Professor Girish Chowdhary, along with a CEO of his company,  Chinmay Soman.   The project they started is called EarthSense. Picture this, if you  will: Their goal is to combine machine learning with smart agriculture  to build robots that our farmers can use to grow crops more efficiently  and improve the environment.   So I watched the little robots go to work. They are powered by  batteries, and if you can picture a cornfield--and we have got a lot of  them in Illinois--these robots go between the rows of corn. And while  they are going down the rows, they are gathering data and information:  moisture in the ground; pictures of the soybeans and corn above them to  determine whether or not they are being successful and most productive;  and, at the same time, they are spreading seeds for a cover crop that  is going to be growing following the harvesting of the corn. They are  guided remotely by computer. And that is the future of farming, I  believe.   I think getting a picture of a farmer on a tractor is something you  want to hang onto as a souvenir. The farms of the future are going to  be managed by autonomous machines--robots and the like--and it is going  to be a lot more efficient. It kind of breaks the hearts of our farmers  to talk in these terms, but that is the reality, and we better be on  top of it. EarthSense at the University of Illinois is a good  illustration. Every State is home to institutions that support  researchers working. Let's give them the tools and resources they need.   Do we want a future in which flying drones overhead demand that  hungry citizens suppress their soul's desire for freedom or a future in  which robots help grow more food to feed the planet?   Which nations and which values shape the world's future will be  informed by the decisions we make in Congress and in Washington.   Let's send this competitiveness package to President Biden's desk and  invest in America.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet)  and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are necessarily  absent.
