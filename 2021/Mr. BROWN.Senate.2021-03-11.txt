 Madam President, I rise to talk about the passage of the  historic American Rescue Plan. This monumental legislation will help us  get this pandemic under control and help families and small businesses  weather the economic crisis. It includes critical funding for vaccine  production, testing, and additional PPE. It includes the resources we  need to help kids get back to school safely, enhanced unemployment to  help workers who are suffering during this pandemic, food assistance  for low-income families, and stimulus checks to help make ends meet  with hours cut and expenses rising. It also makes long-overdue  enhancements to EITC and CTC that will help lift millions of children  out of poverty. And it provides resources to keep families in their  homes during this pandemic.   First, it provides critical assistance for renters and people  experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Before the pandemic, an  estimated 568,000 people, many with underlying health conditions, were  already experiencing homelessness. One out of four renters was paying  more than half of their income in rent, leaving too many making  impossible choices between essential expenses or even at risk of  eviction. COVID-19 has both revealed and exacerbated these housing  problems. One out of five renters reports being behind on rent, and  renters were an estimated $57 billion dollars behind on rent as of  January.   I am pleased that the Senate-approved bill includes new resources to  assist people experiencing or at risk of homelessness through emergency  housing vouchers and homelessness assistance and supportive services  administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as  well as emergency assistance for rural housing for residents of  properties financed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural  Housing Service.   In addition, the American Rescue Plan provides $21.6 billion in  emergency rental assistance through States, localities, and  territories, including $2.5 billion reserved for high-need grantees.   This funding supplements the $25 billion in emergency rental  assistance funding provided by Congress in December, Section 501 of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Public Law 116-260, Section 501,  but includes additional flexibilities to ensure grantees can better  stabilize renters. The Biden administration should again extend the  Federal eviction moratorium that expires on March 31, 2021, so that  grantees have time to distribute assistance to renters in need to  prevent evictions and displacement.   With the emergency rental assistance provided in this bill, renters  will be able to receive up to 18 months of financial assistance,  including future rent and utility payments, including pad rents in  manufactured housing communities, and unpaid rent or utility bills that  have accumulated. Renters can also receive assistance for  [[Page S1497]]  other housing-related expenses necessary to promote housing stability,  such as but not limited to security deposits; relocation and rental  fees for displaced households; late fees related to a former or current  rental unit; and internet service provided to the rental unit. Section  3201 does not preclude grantees from continuing payment processes  provided in section 501. These processes are the provisions that govern  payments of rent and utility assistance either to property owners and  utilities or directly to tenants and the application for assistance by  landlords and owners under subsection (f). Additionally, funds can be  used to provide housing stability services, such as but not limited to  case management; tenant-landlord mediation; legal services related to  eviction and housing stability; housing counseling; fair housing  counseling; and specialized services for people with disabilities,  people with chronic health conditions, seniors, or survivors of  domestic violence or human trafficking. Similar to section 501, section  3201 permits grantees to use a certain percentage of their funds on  administrative costs to support eligible program activities, including  the provision of financial assistance and housing stability services.  After deducting the amount grantees may use on program administration,  grantees may also use up to 10 percent of their funds on providing  housing stability services. As in section 501, funds are provided to  States to assist renters throughout the State, including in rural  communities, as well as cities and counties that receive a direct  allocation.   Given how badly these resources are needed, the Department of  Treasury and grantees must do all they can to implement this rental  assistance program quickly and successfully and not create any  artificial barriers to assistance. With some benefits provided by the  CARES Act, documentation requirements to prove eligibility have erected  artificial barriers that have cut people off from the benefits Congress  intended them to receive. Indeed, diverse stakeholders, including  tenant advocates, landlords, and State and local government agencies,  have raised concerns that such requirements that have been applied in  existing emergency rental assistance programs have prevented renters  from completing applications and are overly burdensome for program  staff. It is critical that any renters who are struggling to pay their  rent during the pandemic are not barred from accessing this assistance  due to cumbersome documentation requirements or other barriers. An  applicant's simple attestation should be the only documentation  required to meet program eligibility requirements. Additionally,  grantees may continue the income assessment procedures pursuant to  section 501 to determine eligibility.   The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impacts on individuals, families,  businesses, availability of government services and supports, and  throughout our economy. It has changed where and how many people work.  It has made it more difficult not just to keep a job but also to find a  new job, to get enough hours, and to find childcare or someone to care  for a sick loved one. All of these challenges brought on by the  pandemic have made it more difficult for families to make ends meet.  These effects are likely to exist for months and years to come. Given  these factors, Treasury and grantees should broadly read the  requirement regarding the connection between a renter's hardship and  the coronavirus pandemic when determining the eligibility of the  renter. As the language states, the hardship must have occurred  ``during or due, directly or indirectly, to the coronavirus pandemic.''  The economic effects of the pandemic will be felt long after the virus  is contained. Certain industries and communities have been particularly  hard-hit from the pandemic and will likely take years to recover.  Treasury should issue guidance that makes this point clear to ensure  renters are not cut off from needed assistance as they try to recover  from economic downturns caused by the pandemic.   Section 3201 also provides that after October 1, 2022, certain  grantees may expend funds on ``other affordable rental housing and  eviction prevention activities'' that benefit any very low-income  renter household. Such activities can include but are not limited to  affordable housing development, preservation, or acquisition, and other  forms of rental assistance and eviction prevention activities targeted  to very low-income renters.   To ensure continuity in monitoring funds provided by section 3201 and  section 501 and ease of grantee implementation, Treasury should  maintain the same reporting requirements that were included in section  501.   The committee encourages the administration to create and maintain a  central public repository of information on State and local rental  assistance programs, which at a minimum identifies the program's  administering agency and contact information, so that renters and  landlords can more easily identify available assistance.   Finally, to the extent there is any confusion with regard to the  taxability of assistance, Treasury, in consultation with the Internal  Revenue Service, should provide guidance to clarify this for grantees  and program participants.   The American Rescue Plan also provides vital home ownership  assistance to families across the country. This much-needed assistance  would not have been possible without the dedication and diligence of  our colleague, Senator Jack Reed, who is the author of the Homeowner  Assistance Fund we have enacted. For nearly a year, he has been leading  the charge to keep families in their homes and avoid another  foreclosure crisis, and I am grateful to him for his leadership on this  issue.   There is no question that homeowners are struggling as a result of  this pandemic. In January, more than 3.3 million homeowners were more  than 30 days behind on their payments or in foreclosure. More than 2  million households are more than 3 months behind, putting them at risk  of foreclosure. Many of these households are in forbearance, but others  are not. And the number of homeowners behind on mortgage payments  doesn't account for other costs, such as utility and insurance bills,  that are building up not just for homeowners with a mortgage but also  for the more than one-third of homeowners who own their home outright.   Black, Latino, and Asian households are more likely to report that  they have fallen behind on their mortgages. As with so much else in  this health and economic crisis, the burden is falling the heaviest on  the communities of color and low-income communities.   We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. We cannot allow this  pandemic to become a housing crisis that exacerbates economic  inequality and widens the racial home ownership gap. This time, we must  give communities the tools to help homeowners weather this crisis and  remain in their homes.   Many homeowners who are in forbearance have loans backed by a Federal  agency or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Throughout this pandemic, these  agencies have extended forbearance and post-forbearance options to help  borrowers resume making regular payments at some point or get an  affordable loan modification. Many borrowers in forbearance today will  also be able to get back on track with these existing options. But  these options won't help all homeowners. Many homeowners do not have  the benefit of the loan workout options that come with a federally  backed or Fannie Mae- or Freddie Mac-backed loan, have accumulated  other utility or housing costs, or have a manufactured home loan that  is not a mortgage. And still other homeowners have a federally backed  loan but, given the severe disruption to our economy, just need more  help than is available through their mortgage program. These homeowners  will need direct assistance, and they will need it quickly.   That is exactly what the Homeowner Assistance Fund will do. The  American Rescue Plan Act's Homeowner Assistance Fund creates a nearly  $10 billion fund at the Department of the Treasury to provide resources  to States, Tribal governments, and Tribally designated housing entities  to help homeowners staying in their homes. Treasury will allocate funds  among the States and other eligible recipients, taking into account the  number of individuals in a State who have been unemployed in recent  months, as well as the number of homeowners who have fallen at least a  month behind on their mortgage, regardless of whether they are in  forbearance, or who are in foreclosure. States and eligible recipients  [[Page S1498]]  will use the funds Congress has provided in this bill for direct relief  to eligible homeowners and to set up, staff, and administer the  programs providing that relief.   As Congress has established in the bill, direct relief through the  Homeowner Assistance Fund can include help with missed mortgage  payments, financial help to make a mortgage modification viable,  assistance with broadband and utility costs; and other relief that  homeowners need to get back on track financially. At least 60 percent  of a State or other eligible entity's funds must go to households at or  below 100 percent of area median income or households below 100 percent  of the national median income, whichever is higher, to ensure that help  reaches those homeowners who need it most. Including homeowners with  incomes of up to 100 percent of the national median income when that is  higher than the area median income will ensure that funds adequately  reach homeowners in Tribal areas and rural areas, where localized  incomes may be lower. Remaining assistance funds are targeted to  socially disadvantaged individuals, including homeowners of color, who  too often are left behind in our economy and who data indicate are at  disproportionate risk of foreclosure.   While Congress has authorized the program, the intent is for Treasury  to play a vital role in making this program a reality by administering  the Homeowner Assistance Fund prudently and flexibly to keep the  greatest number of families in their homes. In the days ahead, Treasury  must provide States and other eligible entities with the certainty they  need to accept and distribute these funds efficiently. Treasury must  set clear expectations for the types of eligible programs States can  administer and the guidelines States must follow to administer these  programs equitably and in accordance with the law. That includes  ensuring States and other eligible entities understand up front that  they can use a portion of the funds provided through the Homeowner  Assistance Fund to establish and administer their programs, so that  States can immediately get the systems and staffing in place to put  funds into the hands of the people who need them. And if there is any  uncertainty among States or individuals who might apply for assistance,  Treasury should immediately clarify that any assistance received  through the Homeowner Assistance Fund is not income for a homeowner.   Treasury must also establish reporting to ensure that funds are  reaching the households who need them most. Both to comply with the law  and to ensure funds are being used equitably, Treasury must establish  periodic public reporting by State of key metrics, including the amount  of funds disbursed, the acceptance rate of applicants, reasons  applicants are denied, the number of individuals assisted, the number  of households assisted by income range, the types of assistance  provided, the average amount of assistance per household, and household  outcomes. These data should also be assessed by race, ethnicity,  gender, and other factors to determine compliance with all laws,  including the Fair Housing Act. While Fair Housing Act enforcement  remains the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development and the Department of Justice, this program and all housing  programs must be developed and administered to comply with this  foundational civil rights law.   States and other eligible recipients will also be vital partners in  getting relief out quickly. Too many homeowners have been struggling  for nearly a year. We need to get them relief now. Following the 2008  economic crisis, State housing finance agencies in select States were  great partners in providing direct relief to homeowners through the  Hardest Hit Fund. In my home State of Ohio, the Ohio Housing Finance  Agency helped tens of thousands of people with mortgage payment  assistance, modifications with assistance, and more. We need all States  to be prepared to get these funds out quickly and without unnecessary  barriers. Treasury can help facilitate this with clear guidance and  templates that allow States to put out funds without delay.   I will continue to fight for the assistance people experiencing  homelessness, renters, and homeowners need to stay in their homes. I  also look forward to working to successfully deploy the historic  resources provided in this bill.                            ____________________
