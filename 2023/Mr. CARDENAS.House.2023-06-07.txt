 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bert  Boeckmann, one of the San Fernando Valley's most treasured community  members. We lost Bert last month at 92 years of age.   A catalyst in the prosperity of the San Fernando Valley, Bert was a  beloved friend, husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, great- great-grandfather, and my friend.   Bert's impact began as a Galpin Motors salesman in 1953, when he was  only 22 years old. Determined to succeed, he was the general manager by  1957. Bert was named president by 1964 and became sole owner in 1968.   As a salesman, Bert's desire to put the customer first by  demonstrating his honesty and integrity was seen as an unusual  practice, but it soon became the trait he and Galpin Motors were known  for. Even as the company continued to grow, Bert always said that his,  along with every employee's of Galpin Motors, goal was to serve the  customer first. Employees who did not agree with this message were  told: ``Go work for the competition.''   Galpin Motors expanded from a tiny, three-car dealership to an  automotive enterprise with a large showroom, retail store, restaurant,  and other amenities.   Since 1989, Galpin Motors became the number one Ford auto dealership  in the world for both cars and trucks. Dedication to customer service  helped the company grow, eventually expanding to include 12 brands.  Today, Galpin Motors has more than 1,000 employees and earns more than  $1 billion in annual revenue.   Bert has always been on the cutting edge of customizing cars at the  dealership level for his customers. He called it Galpinizing, which  included custom paint jobs and bodywork, interiors, and van  conversions.   Bert would push for innovative concepts, such as the introduction of  European sunroof technology to America, which was hugely popular in  sunny southern California.   Innovation and customization are central concepts of Galpin Auto  Sports, which designed and built custom vehicles for enthusiasts and  celebrities alike. Galpin Auto Sports would go on to be the home of the  famous MTV show ``Pimp My Ride,'' hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit,  which was viewed by millions of people across the globe.   Bert served on various national and regional boards, such as the Ford  Motor Company's Performance Advisory Committee, National Dealer  Council, Dealers Advertising Association, along with the California and  the Greater Los Angeles New Car Dealers Associations.   His efforts to innovate the business culminated in his induction into  the Ford Hall of Fame.   Bert was equally renowned for his work as a devoted civic leader,  having worked with nearly every organization in the San Fernando  Valley. Bert and his wife, Jane, received the Fernando Award,  recognizing them as citizens who have contributed enormously to the San  Fernando Valley.   Bert served on the Los Angeles Police Commission for over 16 years,  for three mayors and six police chiefs.   He was a fierce advocate for the valley and worked to help us receive  our fair share of resources.   Bert was known for his dedication to his company and his community.  However, Bert's greatest commitment was to his relationship with his  family, especially his wife, Jane. The two were married for 50 years,  sharing their passion for spreading kindness to everyone who surrounded  them.   While we greatly miss Bert, he is reunited with his wife, Jane, on  the second anniversary of her passing. Jane was an amazing  businesswoman and civic leader in her own right. She had many talents.  She was a gifted interior designer, skilled golfer, licensed airplane  pilot who flew across the country, and a driver for the Galpin Motors  24-hour endurance land race. Jane was the longtime publisher of Valley  Magazine and was involved in various community groups.   Bert and Jane inspired us to practice kindness at all times.   Bert and Jane are survived by his daughters, LaVerne and Denice; his  sons, Brett, Brad, and Beau; their 12 grandchildren, Dascha, Jacob,  Amie, Brandon, Blake, Brooke, Amelia, Logan, Bliss, Brielle, Beau, and  Blair; as well as 11 great-grandchildren, Phillip, Dennis, Brody,  Violet, Anna Bell, Brayson, Brynlee, Bailee, Bronson, Pate, and  Thatcher; and three great-great-grandchildren, Natalie, Mia, and Alice.   For all of this and more, we miss and honor the incredible life of  our friend, Bert Boeckmann.                            ____________________
