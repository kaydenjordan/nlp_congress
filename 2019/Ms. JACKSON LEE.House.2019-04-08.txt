 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1331,  ``The Local Water Protection Act'', which provides 200 million annually  to support the nonpoint source management grants program administered  by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).   I support this legislation because it is necessary to counteract the  current crisis of water pollution in our country.   As an Energy and Environment Task Force Co-Chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus, I understand the necessity of this bill and its funding  to managing sources of water pollution.   It is unsustainable to think we can continue to allow runoff that  carries pollutants, fertilizers, and sediment from fields; toxins from  abandoned mines, and oils and heavy metals from roads, into lakes,  rivers, and other bodies of water.   As pollutants in our waters increase, human exposure to toxins will  follow in step, toxin exposure is directly linked to cancers and heart  disease.   Before the pollutants reach people they reach our waterways,  adversely affecting a whole ecosystem, putting 1 to 11 percent of  marine species in to extinction every decade.   The strain on the marine life is not the only adverse effect to  nature, global warming is also worsened when we turn a cheek to  decreasing the pollution of our waterways.   Water pollution is not a topic to be taken lightly and we are  reminded of our current privileges of clean water when we look at  cities that have experienced the unimaginable, such as Flint, Michigan.   Flint, Michigan has lived in a state of fear, having to drink from  bottles of filtered water in order to completely avoid lead poisoning  and contamination.   Citizens of Flint, Michigan had to abandon their homes and the  residents had to be compensated for their property and their current  and future health conditions that arise from the contamination by  polluted water.   Water pollution poses a threat in every state, including my home  state of Texas.   It was found just recently that in 938 instances, Texas companies  released pollution that exceeded the levels permitted by federal clean  water laws according to researchers who examined Texas Commission for  Environmental Quality data.   Texas was found in 2018 to have the most widespread radiated drinking  water contamination affecting more than 3,500 utilities serving 22  million people.   The contamination in Texas included detectable levels of radium-226  and radium-228 in a study conducted by the Environmental Working Group  (EWG).   Currently, it is required by law for states to submit reports to the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the current sources of  water pollution within their state, as well as plans to manage those  sources of pollution.   EPA provides grants for states to carry out their plans to manage  water pollution.   Mr. Speaker, we must not wait to take action when the health of our  marine life, the state of Global Warming, and the health of our people  are being affected.   H.R. 1331 would allow instrumental programs to continue serving as a  step in the right direction in protecting and healing our home.    Mr. Speaker, it is well known that the Department of  Homeland Security, established after the heinous and unspeakable acts  of 9/11, is one of America's most important departments.   It is tragic that during the tenure of this administration, it has  been in the midst of confusion and dishevelment. The Department needs  long and strong leadership. Secret Service, Customs and Border  Protection, Border Patrol, many other departments that are crucial,  those dealing with domestic terrorism, those dealing with  transportation security, it needs someone that can make an independent  decision that separating children from families is not the right thing  to do; that the border crisis is a humanitarian crisis; that the fences  that have been built are still being built through funding that has  come from previous administrations.   I wish well the Acting Secretary that is now in the position, but I  will tell you that I wish more well to the hardworking employees every  day that work to keep this Nation safe.   Leave the Department alone, and let its leadership work its will on  behalf of the security of the American people to do the right thing and  to act accordingly to the decency of the rule of law.                            ____________________
