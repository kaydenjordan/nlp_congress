 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  outstanding work of Mayor Becky Ames, the 41st mayor of Beaumont,  Texas.   Since being elected, Mayor Becky Ames has spearheaded several  initiatives to better the Beaumont area, such as establishing the One  Stop Shop in city hall to help businesses and homeowners with their  various needs.   Becky has also helped develop the 311 call centers to help residents  with nonemergency issues.   Mayor Ames' most significant contributions to our district include  the emergency preparation and management before and after several  tropical storms and hurricanes that have impacted Beaumont. Mayor Ames'  experience and leadership during these storms were instrumental to  recovery efforts and restoring Beaumont's infrastructure. I have seen  them up close and personal.   I recognize and I thank Mayor Becky Ames for her many years of  selfless service to Beaumont and our 14th Congressional District of  Texas.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Becky on her well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
