Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend and colleague from the Committee on  Rules, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, this morning, the Committee on Rules met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 567. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 4346, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act,  under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations or their designees.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Ryan,  makes in order 12 amendments, provides en bloc authority for Chairwoman  DeLauro or her designee, and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration H.R. 4373, the Department of  State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act,  under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations or their designees.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairwoman Lee,  makes in order 36 amendments, provides en bloc authority for Chairwoman  DeLauro or her designee, and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 4505, the  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,  under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations or their designees.   It self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Cartwright,  makes in order 61 amendments, provides en bloc authority for Chairwoman  DeLauro or her designee, and provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise and speak in favor of critical  investments that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have  worked tirelessly to secure for the American people. First, I would  like to congratulate Chairwoman DeLauro on her exemplary leadership in  bringing us a package of legislation that we can be proud to support  and as well commend Chairs Cartwright, Ryan, and Lee on their  dedication to ensuring America's greatest needs are reflected in this  year's appropriations bills.   The underlying package we are considering today includes fiscal year  2022 funding for the Commerce, Justice, and Science; Legislative  Branch; and State and Foreign Operations appropriations bills that  invest in the future of America's hardworking families and America's  engagement around the globe.   These investments are more than just a commitment to our districts,  they are firm action items that will help Americans throughout our  country grow and heal as we emerge from this pandemic.   The Commerce-Justice-Science bill supports good-paying American jobs,  fosters groundbreaking scientific research, and helps to make our  communities safer. These critical programs include investments in  economic development in distressed communities with support for small  businesses, including small- and medium-sized American manufacturers.   This package also increases funding to address gender-based violence  in our communities, supports programs to reduce gun violence, and helps  us tackle the opioid crisis.   I, for one, know that my community in Rochester, New York, will  benefit greatly from the priorities secured in the CJS appropriations  bill, and I look forward to delivering on our promise to support safer  communities with funding for local law enforcement while bolstering  police and criminal justice  [[Page H4097]]  reform, increasing funding for community-based violence intervention  initiatives, and expanding gun violence prevention efforts.   The Legislative Branch appropriations bill strengthens congressional  capacity to recruit a diverse and talented workforce while investing in  efforts to protect our Capitol. After hearing firsthand yesterday from  the brave officers who protected all of us on January 6, it is our duty  to return the favor by doing our job and showing full support for our  Capitol Police force.   The insurrection on January 6 left widespread physical damage to the  Capitol Complex and emotional trauma for Members, congressional  employees, and Capitol Police. This measure is essential to protecting  the Capitol and ensuring that we can continue to do the work of the  American people. It provides funding to support training, recruitment,  retention, and readiness of the Capitol Police force.   The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bills supports the  world's most vulnerable with foreign assistance to meet urgent  humanitarian needs, many of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19  pandemic.   This appropriations bill will promote democracy with funding to  support allies and partners of the United States, particularly to  counter governments that undermine the core values of our democracy and  of democracy around the world.   Additionally, it confronts climate change with funding for global  efforts to reduce emissions, advances women's rights by increasing  funding for family planning, increases United Nations Population Fund  funding, and repeals restrictions on safe and legal abortion.   This is a package I am proud to take home to my constituents, and I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reflect on whom we are  here to represent and support, make good on our promises to the  American people, and pass this rule and these critical appropriations  bills.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to in response, and I appreciate the  comments from my friend, include in the Record a 2013 American Progress  article titled, ``How the Hyde Amendment Discriminates Against Poor  Women and Women of Color.''                               [May 10, 2013]   How the Hyde Amendment Discriminates Against Poor Women and Women of                                   Color                  (By Jessica Arons and Lindsay Rosenthal)         In 1973 the Supreme Court decided in the landmark case Roe       v. Wade to recognize the constitutional right to abortion for       all women. Forty years later, however, this guarantee remains       an empty promise for thousands of poor women and women of       color thanks to the Hyde Amendment, an annual appropriations       measure first passed in 1976. This provision intentionally       discriminates against poor women by prohibiting Medicaid, the       health-insurance program for low-income individuals and       families, from covering abortion care.        Because of the intersection in our country between race,       ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, this restriction also       has a disproportionate impact on women of color. Due to a       number of root causes related to inequality, women of color       are more likely to qualify for government insurance that       restricts abortion coverage, more likely to experience higher       rates of unintended pregnancy, and less likely to be able to       pay for an abortion out of pocket. The Hyde Amendment       therefore does not only undermine gender equity, but it also       violates principles of racial and economic justice.        The Hyde Amendment discriminates against poor women.        Congress passed the Hyde Amendment in order to deny poor       women access to abortion. Former Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), the       law's sponsor, admitted during the debate of his proposal       that he was targeting poor women. ``I certainly would like to       prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a       rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman,'' he said.       ``Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the Medicaid       bill.''        1 in 10 women of reproductive age in the United States       relies on Medicaid for their health coverage. By prohibiting       Medicaid from covering abortion services, the Hyde Amendment       has used the primary source of health care for low-income       women to restrict access to abortion.        Poor women face significant disparities when it comes to       reproductive health. Compared with higher-income women, poor       women's rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion are each       five times as high, and their unplanned birth rate is six       times as high. These disparities are rooted in deeply       entrenched inequities in the areas of health-insurance       coverage, health care, and medically accurate sex education,       as well as other health-promoting resources.        Abortion costs between $300 and $950 in the first       trimester, making it unaffordable for poor women without       insurance coverage. In  [[Page H4098]]       2009 more than half of nonelderly adult women enrolled in       Medicaid had family incomes below the poverty level; one-      quarter had incomes below 50 percent of the poverty level.       The monthly income for a family of three living at half the       current poverty level is $813.75.        One in four Medicaid-qualified women who seek an abortion       is forced to carry her pregnancy to term because of cost.       Many more are forced to delay their procedure for as long as       two to three weeks while they raise money, with the costs and       risks of the procedure increasing the longer they wait.        The Hyde Amendment discriminates against women of color.        A dissenting Supreme Court opinion recognized that the Hyde       Amendment was discriminatory. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood       Marshall's dissenting opinion in Harris v. McRae noted that       the law was ``designed to deprive poor and minority women of       the constitutional right to choose abortion.''        Women of color are disproportionately poor and therefore       less likely to be able to pay out of pocket for their health       care. According to 2011 census data, 25.5 percent of African       Americans and 25 percent of Latinas are living below the       poverty level, compared to only 10.4 percent of whites and       12.2 percent of Asians. Moreover, certain groups of Asian and       Pacific Islander women face much higher poverty rates than       are reflected in the aggregate census data. For example, 67       percent, 66 percent, and 47 percent of people of Laotian,       Hmong, and Cambodian descent, respectively, live in poverty       in the United States.        Women of color are more likely to be enrolled in government       insurance. In 2011, 40.9 percent of African American females       and 36.3 percent of Latinas had government-based insurance,       including 29.2 percent and 29.6 percent participation,       respectively, in Medicaid. In contrast, 32.6 percent of white       females and 24.4 percent of Asian American females got their       insurance through a government program. While Asian and       Pacific Islander women use Medicaid at lower rates for a       variety of reasons--only 6 percent were enrolled in the       program in 2004--participation is quite high among various       subgroups. For example, 20 percent of women of Southeast       Asian descent are covered by Medicaid.        Women of color are disproportionately more likely to need       an abortion. Black women had the highest unintended pregnancy       rate of any racial or ethnic group and more than double that       of non-Hispanic white women. The unintended pregnancy rate of       Latinas is 78 percent higher than the non-Hispanic rate.       These high unintended pregnancy rates are part of the reason       women of color seek abortion at higher rates than non-      Hispanic whites. Although they represent much smaller       segments of the population as a whole, black and Latina women       comprise 30 percent and 25 percent of women who have       abortions, respectively. Data on Asian and Pacific Islander       women's utilization of health services, including abortion,       is extremely limited, but one study has shown that 35 percent       of pregnancies for Asian and Pacific Islander women end in       abortion, compared to 18 percent for non-Hispanic white       women.        These health disparities mirror other health disparities       that women of color experience. In addition to higher rates       of unintended pregnancy and abortion, women of color face       higher rates of reproductive cancers, HIV and other sexually       transmitted infections, premature births, low birth weights,       and maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. They also       encounter poorer health outcomes for diabetes, cardiovascular       disease, and obesity, among other health conditions.        Root causes of inequality drive the health disparities       women of color face. Differential access to treatment, lower       levels of respect and competency from health care providers,       lack of trust in the medical establishment, lack of accurate       information, and a host of other socioeconomic factors lead       to poorer outcomes along racial and ethnic lines for overall       health indicators, specifically with regard to reproductive       health.        The Hyde Amendment treats the rights of women in this       country according to two different standards: whether you can       afford to pay for your rights or not. That is not equality.     Mr. Speaker, I do note that in my home State of New York  we have made the decision for many years to support women in poverty  who seek reproductive rights.   Rights are granted to us under the Constitution. Those rights are as  fundamental as any other right guaranteed to us under the Constitution,  but we don't have economic tests for rights in the United States. So if  you have a right, Mr. Speaker, you have a right. We don't say you have  the right to free speech as long as you can pay for it. We don't  suggest that the right to assemble, the right to have your grievances  addressed by your government, the right to petition, the right to press  or to select the religion and support the religion that you choose is  subject to some kind of economic test. We believe the same should be  true for reproductive rights.   So I would just say that in New York it is something that we have  supported for many, many years, and we continue to urge support, public  dollars for reproductive rights and for women's health, which is very  much at stake, particularly in communities of color.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), who is my friend on the Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, I do want to respond to my distinguished colleague from  Oklahoma and friend from the Rules Committee as it relates to the  McGirt decision. I share his concerns for the challenges being faced by  the people in the State of Oklahoma. I know his amendment has been made  in order. Without regard to how that vote takes place, I would love to  work with him--and, I am sure, others would--to address the real  concerns by the people of the State of Oklahoma. I look forward to that  conversation.   I do want, before I yield to my friend, to mention that I talked, in  my opening comments, about some of the things that are in the bill. I  do want to highlight some of the important things in the Legislative  Branch appropriations, which provides $4.8 billion, an increase of  nearly 14 percent.   I mentioned earlier that we hope to build upon the emergency  supplemental bill, which we passed in May, that would continue to  support the Capitol Police, National Guard, et cetera. In this bill, we  put money to improve training and bolster wellness support for the  Capitol Police, who were attacked on January 6, and provide funding to  hire up to over 2,100 sworn officers and 450 civilian members of the  Capitol Police and more resources for recruitment, retention, and  readiness for them.   We strengthened congressional capacity. It increases funding for  congressional offices to help recruit and retain a talented and diverse  staff and supports mental health and wellness for Members and staff.   We always talk about being Article I of the Constitution, and we  really need to support that legislative branch and make sure we have  the resources to be able to provide balanced, thoughtful support for  the American public.   I wanted to highlight some of the really important things. I  appreciate, certainly, Chairman Ryan and the work that he, the ranking  member, and the members of that subcommittee did in getting that bill  before the House and the rule that we are debating right now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), my colleague and friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to commend the previous speaker for her  encouragement of all Americans to be vaccinated. We certainly want to  continue to promote that message and urge everyone in the United States  to be vaccinated.  [[Page H4101]]    Mr. Speaker, in my previous comments, I talked about the  congressional and legislative appropriations.   I include in the Record a July 13 Business Insider article entitled:  ``Capitol Hill staff take second jobs with Postmates, Starbucks, and J.  Crew to make up for their low salaries.''   I continue to repeat that men and women who work here shouldn't  struggle to make ends meet just because they have dedicated their  careers to public service.                              [July 13, 2021]   Capitol Hill Staff Take Second Jobs With Postmates, Starbucks, and J.                   Crew to Make Up for Their Low Salaries                             (By Kayla Epstein)         With no choice but to accept low pay, Capitol Hill staffers       often have to pick up second jobs.        Retail, gig-economy, and service-industry jobs are frequent       options.        Staffers told Insider the second jobs add to an already       stressful workload and lead to burnout.        The next time you order takeout in the DC area, your       delivery person might work for Congress.        Given no choice but to accept startlingly low salaries in       exchange for the privilege of working on Capitol Hill, many       interns and junior staffers to America's most powerful--and       wealthy--politicians take second jobs to survive in       Washington, DC, one of the most expensive cities in the       country.        Some staffers and interns go for gig-economy roles like       Postmates, Uber, and DoorDash, while others work as baristas       and bartenders. For those who struggle to afford a       professional wardrobe, retail jobs help provide additional       wages and a discount on clothes.        While it's common for people in the US to work second jobs       to make ends meet, civic groups and staffers say that low pay       on Capitol Hill pushes out talented staff and creates an       environment in which employees from privileged backgrounds       have an edge in building long-term careers.        ``You could tell when certain people kind of came from       money and didn't have to'' work second jobs, one former       staffer to a House Republican said. ``I have some friends       that didn't need to because they came up from a wealthy       upbringing . . . They were comfortable. Others were kind of       like, `OK, yeah, I need to really do some extra jobs because       this is not livable.'''        Insider spoke to five current and former staffers who had       worked second jobs as a way to compensate for what one former       senior Democratic House aide called ``poverty wages.'' They       described exhaustion and burnout from pulling double duty,       their only days off eaten up by delivering takeout or       grabbing graveyard shifts at clothing stores. Some spoke on       the condition of anonymity because they feared losing their       jobs or hurting their careers by speaking out.        ``It's tough for the normal traditional staffer because       that is easily a 50- to 60-hour week,'' said one former House       and Senate aide who started out at $27,000 a year and had to       take a second job at apparel company J.Crew.        When you add on the additional hours for a second job, he       said, ``you just burn yourself out to stay afloat.''        Do you have a tip about Capitol Hill workplace issues to       share? Bad bosses, toxic offices, or questionable behavior       toward congressional staffers? Insider is continuing to cover       Congress as a workplace.                                An open secret         The fact that many congressional employees take on second       jobs has been an open secret on the Hill for years. But when       some staffers do seek outside work, they face repercussions.        Audrey Henson, who was a Republican House aide making       $25,000 before she founded the internshipplacement program       College to Congress, said she faced pushback from her manager       when she took a bartending job near the Hill.        ``I would work until 2, 3 in the morning on a Tuesday,       Wednesday, Thursday night. I'd come into Congress absolutely       exhausted,'' she said of her job, which she held from 2013 to       2014.        ``Whenever I was having to pick up more shifts at the bar,       and then when I ended up getting a weekend job, I was talked       to by my chief of staff about priorities,'' she told Insider.       ``And he was like, `This job should be your priority.'''        ``I said, quite frankly, it is. I'm only doing these other       jobs so that I can give you more,'' Henson said. ``Trust me,       this is my only priority. Those jobs allow me to afford this       job.''        She worked at Union Pub, a popular watering hole on Capitol       Hill.        ``I was like, I'm up here to work in Congress, and I'm       putting in equal hours at Union Pub. There's an issue with       this picture,'' she said. ``And I wasn't alone.''        Union Pub spokesperson Sam Sanchez said that, ``pre-      pandemic, Capitol Hill staffers made up a good portion of our       staff working as part-time servers or bartenders--more than       50% at times.''        One current Democratic House staffer, who started in DC       before eventually making her way back to a district office,       worked at a law firm and a retail store to make it through       her part-time, unpaid Senate internship.        ``I would do a shipment shift at like 3:30 in the morning,       go to the law firm, and go to my internship,'' she said. ``I       was working seven days a week . . . I wanted to work       somewhere I could buy work clothes because it's very       expensive.''        After her predawn store shift, ``I would leave at 7, go       catch the Metro'' to her law firm gig, she said.        As a part-time Senate intern, she didn't get any travel       benefits.        ``I spent $260 a month on my Metro,'' she said.        Even after getting a full-time role with a committee, she       continued to work her $10-per-hour retail job on the weekends       to have enough spending money and afford work clothes.        ``It was exhausting all the time. But in my mind it's what       I had to do for the job on the Hill,'' she said. ``I didn't       have much of a social life. I kind of missed out on a few       years of my 20s just working myself to death.''        Union Pub, a popular bar near Capitol Hill in Washington,       DC.

Instead of using weekends to recuperate from weeks of late-      night votes, political chaos, and a stressful office       environment, they had to spend their time finding ways to       make money.        The former Republican House staffer started driving for       Postmates to bolster his $30,500 salary.        ``I would typically do it Friday evening, Saturday,       Sunday,'' he said. He could make about $200 to $300 a month       from Postmates but had to ``really grind to make those       numbers.''        ``I was making money, to have extra money, but I was also       giving up a lot,'' he said. ``And it was just really hard       sometimes to do my second job because I wanted to go out, I       wanted to have fun, I wanted to just be lazy on a Saturday or       Sunday. I wanted just to be able to relax.''        Sometimes, the staffers said, the stress affected their       physical health, too. One current staffer told Insider that       the exhaustion of working sunrise Starbucks shifts on top of       her Hill internship made her hair fall out.        ``I wasn't getting a lot of sleep. I was looking very       tired,'' she said. ``I was breaking out a lot. My hair was       not in great shape--it was thinning out.''        `They're missing out on the most talented people'.        House and Senate offices and committees have only so much       money to spend, and that allotment must fund everything,       including travel, office supplies, direct mail, and staff       salaries. Each office functions like its own business,       determining pay and the number of workers and interns. There       is no formal human resources office on Capitol Hill that can       help regulate pay for certain jobs, and the pay band system       that exists across the federal government to standardize       salaries doesn't apply to Congress.        On June 14, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and       more than 100 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the House       Appropriations Committee to demand an increase in the       Members' Representational Allowance, the pool of funding that       is distributed equally among all House offices.        ``For years, pay and benefits for the staff of Member       offices, leadership offices, and committees have fallen       farther and farther behind what is offered in the private       sector,'' the lawmakers wrote.        A few days later, the House Appropriations Committee       released its legislative funding bill that calls for a $134       million increase to the MRA. It would also increase the       spending for intern pay and committee budgets.        But there's no guarantee that the extra money to the MRA       would go toward bolstering staff salaries. And many House       offices still don't properly use the money available for       internships, said Carlos Vera, executive director of the       advocacy group Pay Our Interns.        Low pay is simply accepted as the cost of admission into       the legislative branch, and many job candidates fear       attempting to negotiate with hiring managers because of the       scarcity of these opportunities.        But Henson, who bartended, said it's long past time for       that to change. Forcing staffers to work themselves to the       point of burnout hinders their ability to do their jobs for       the American people, she said.        ``What other profession do we ask full-time professionals       to be a barista on the side?'' Henson said. ``What if you had       professional athletes leave practice every day to work at       Starbucks? Would they be winners? Would the teams be getting       the best talent? No.''        ``That's what's happening in Congress,'' she added.       ``They're missing out on the most talented people because       they're not paying them.''     Mr. Speaker, having talked about the legislative branch,  let me take just a moment now to talk about where we are globally with  this appropriations bill.   The State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee asks  for an increase of more than 12 percent, an appropriation of $62  billion to support the displaced and vulnerable, rebuild public health  infrastructure, confront climate change, advance women's health, and  promote democracy.   If I could take just a moment, Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight  some  [[Page H4102]]  of these things, particularly as it relates to rebuilding the public  health infrastructure.   The rule which supports the underlying bill would dramatically  increase funding to confront the current COVID-19 pandemic, prevent  future pandemics, and shore up gains made in global health. It includes  $10.6 billion to support the health of families and communities around  the world. The total includes a billion dollars for global health  security to prevent future pandemics through both bilateral and  multilateral mechanisms, something that is critical to stop the spread  of future pandemics.   It also places a premium on confronting climate change and the  climate crisis by expanding global efforts to address environmental  threats and reduce emissions, with over $3 billion to address the  climate crisis and other environmental programs and includes the first  direct appropriations for the Green Climate Fund, to the tune of a $1.6  billion investment.   It also promotes democracy around the world, provides funding to  support allies and partners of the United States with a $1.6 billion  appropriation to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific and help counter  the growing influence of the People's Republic of China in developing  countries, something that I think people on both sides of the aisle  know is a growing threat to freedom and democracy around the world. It  also funds a $2.517 billion effort to increase democracy programs and  provides $300 million for the National Endowment for Democracy.   For those of us who care deeply about the world in which we live and  care deeply about those countries that seek to limit democratic  institutions and democracy, this is welcome news and I think very, very  appropriate to the American values which we hold so dear.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to just take a moment to dive a little deeper in  the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriation, and  thank, again, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Cartwright, for the  great work that he did in getting the appropriations bill before the  House.   Overall, the appropriation bill provides $81.6 billion, an increase  of 14 percent, to create jobs, support safer communities, and confront  the climate crisis here at home.   I would like to take just a moment to highlight some of the  specifics, because it is important, as the American public observes the  conversation going on here in the Congress about what our priorities  are. Budgets always describe our priorities and our values.   For instance, this bill provides $25 billion, an increase of $1.77  billion for NASA, with strong funding and a total effort to gain  scientific knowledge about the Earth's changing climate.   It includes $6.46 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration for climate research and mitigation efforts, including  improvements to weather forecasting, understanding the impact and  degree of sea level rise, supporting offshore wind energy, fisheries  management, and STEM education.   It fosters innovation in U.S. economic competitiveness with $9.63  billion for the National Science Foundation to support climate science  and sustainable research, as well as research on artificial  intelligence, quantum information science, advanced manufacturing,  cybersecurity, and other critical research efforts, which I might say,  parenthetically, is critically important, not only for economic  security, not only for the climate crisis, but for national security as  we confront these threats across the globe.   In this bill we also address gender-based violence, providing $753.8  million for Violence Against Women's Act prevention and prosecution  programs and includes $60 million for grants to reduce the backlog of  unprocessed rape kits, which is critically important.   This bill also provides support to create good-paying jobs for  Americans, including providing $10.95 billion for the Department of  Commerce, an increase of $2.03 billion, with investments in economic  development in distressed communities and support for small businesses,  including small- and medium-sized American manufacturers, as we  continue to be concerned about the supply chain and the value chain as  it relates to not only competitiveness by American companies but also,  again, to make sure that we support our warfighters, and to make sure  the supply chain for critical components and parts is ready for the  defense of our Nation.   It invests directly in our communities, with $433.1 million for the  Economic Development Administration, an increase of $87 million, to  boost economically recovering areas and launch innovative community  development efforts, as well as $275 million for the very important  Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, which we utilize in my  community and others across the country, and an increase of $125  million to help small- and medium-sized United States manufacturers  create and preserve jobs.   Much of this will also be involved with making sure that people who  have been displaced because of the pandemic economically will have  opportunities to go into new industries and be trained, as well as make  sure that incumbent workers continue to upgrade their skills so they  can be competitive  [[Page H4103]]  in what is a very, very competitive global economic environment.   So I want to highlight those, Mr. Speaker. I know that I just talked  about a lot of things that are not before the House, but I thought I  would spend just a few moments talking about what is actually before  the House and some of the critical investments that we are making in  the bills that are before us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just remind folks that the Members of the House who  are on the floor today are working very hard to make sure that we pass  appropriations to support the American people, to create jobs, to make  America safe, to make our interests around the world known.   I do want to talk a little bit about making our communities safer,  because there are substantial resources in the appropriations bill to  do just that, providing resources for local law enforcement who are  facing a period of great challenge: $360 million for Byrne Justice  Assistance Grants; $156.5 million for COPS hiring grants, it takes  concrete actions and provides resources for meaningful police reform  initiatives, including requiring recipients of Federal law enforcement  funding to comply with requirements in the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act; provides $100 million for community-based violence  intervention initiatives; addresses the epidemic of gun violence in the  United States with $100 million to strengthen the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System; $40 million to incentivize States to  establish or refine red flag and gun licensing laws; and $10 million to  develop and expand gun buy-back and relinquishment programs.   We are working very, very hard, Mr. Speaker. We are trying to move  ahead for the American people who have been through one of the most  difficult times in the history of our country, in the history of the  world, a pandemic which has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.  We do see rising rates of infection. If you look at and do the  correlation of those States who have the lowest vaccination rates, that  is where the greatest numbers of those infections are occurring.   And we are working hard. We are trying to move forward an agenda that  will serve all Americans from a public health perspective, from an  economic recovery perspective, and how to move forward and build this  country back better and make sure that all people in America, every  American citizen has the right, the opportunity, the potential to meet  their dreams and aspirations.    That is our work before the House, and we are not going to be  distracted. We are not going to be taken down the proverbial rabbit  hole. We have work to do, and that is the work before the House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I note a great irony. We face enormous challenges in our country and  in our world. But the Members who refuse to wear masks on the floor in  the face of rising infections of a deadly delta variant, particularly  in States with low vaccination rates, respond to all of this by making  a motion to adjourn, to go home, to quit, to stop working. How ironic.   My father, who was a proud pipefitter, Local 13, back in Rochester,  New York, said, You never quit. You never quit until the job is done.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to not quitting, I note another irony. My  colleagues across the aisle are suddenly troubled by deficits. Never  mind that nearly $2 trillion has been added to the national debt by  cutting the taxes of billionaires. Aiding the rich, but not investing  in the lives of middle class and working Americans? We reject that  notion entirely.   Mr. Speaker, many of my Republican colleagues speaking on the rule  today painted a dystopian view of our country. Yes, we have challenges:  a climate crisis, a public health crisis, economic concerns, and great  racial inequities. That is why the investments we are proposing are so  critically important today.   But, Mr. Speaker, I reject the dystopian view. I believe America is  the greatest country in the history of humankind, and my colleagues, we  share an optimistic view. We want to invest in an America where  everyone has a chance to realize their potential, and to achieve their  dreams.   We want to invest our resources and energies to create a safer, more  secure, more prosperous world, and to strive mightily to build a more  perfect union.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                 Amendment to House Resolution H. Res. 567         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 13. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human       Services from lessening the stringency of, and to prohibit       the Secretary of Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening       implementation of, the COVID-19 border health provisions       through the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 14. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 471.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
