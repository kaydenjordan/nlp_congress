 Madam Chair, I appreciate Mr. Neguse working on this  legislation here, but to have this all in a catchall bill--in my home  State of California, the two biggest things going on are wildfire and  drought, other than politics. So, to have so little time to put this  together, I wish we had more time to work on this.   I appreciate that he included a small piece on biochar that I was  working on, but the big picture here is the drought is affecting so  much of my State. These crops listed here, many of them 100 percent of  what is used in the United States. Hundreds of thousands of acres are  being left out.   The people in this country will not see these crops come from  California or the U.S. They will come from other countries if we get  them at all.   On the forestry side, I had the Dixie fire last year. That was a  million acres. Yet, we are going to take the power away from the Forest  Service, which already moves at a glacial pace of 1 percent per year  under their 10-year plan of treating forests lands--take away 600 of  their staff and basically just make it that much slower for the Forest  Service to respond.   Between the drought and the weaponizing, possibly, of monitoring  against farmers the water supply, we are going backward on this. So, I  am disappointed.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration is throwing such a  wrench in the American economy and is stifling production in critical  domestic industries, including agriculture.   His failed economic policies raised input costs on essentials like  fuel and fertilizer and severely disrupted our supply chain.   Of great concern right now in California is our water supply. His  regulators in the Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Fish and Wildlife have  cut so much water out of the State. We have hundreds of thousands of  acres that are idle this year.   Now, why is that important to everybody across the country?  California produces a very high amount of all these crops: 100 percent  of artichokes, celery, garlic, honeydew, olives, plums. Many of these  crops you can see on this chart here: 100 percent, 96 percent, 94  percent. Even down here, wild rice, 60 percent. Horseradish, 30  percent.   The water is being taken away to grow these crops. Is that a big  deal? Well, if you want to import it from other countries, I guess you  can, and then we can be subject to their supply, their price, their  delivery times.   California is the top agriculture producing State in the country. We  need to have a water supply. We do not need to have it taken away by  regulators or given to fish or environmental stuff.                            ____________________
