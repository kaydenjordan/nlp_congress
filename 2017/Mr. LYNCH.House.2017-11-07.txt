 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott) for yielding me this time, and I thank him for his leadership on  behalf of the America workers.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong opposition to H.R. 3441.  Because of the modern use of temporary staffing agencies and  subcontractors, the National Labor Relations Board has properly defined  the term ``joint employer'' as two or more businesses who codetermine  or share control over a worker's terms of employment, such as rate of  pay or work schedule.   If enacted, H.R. 3441 would cripple workers' rights to collectively  bargain or seek redress when workers are found to have joint employers.  The opportunity to collectively bargain over wages and conditions of  employment is diminished if some parties that control employment are  given the option to refuse to bargain and avoid liability as employers.   As a result, this bill will open the door to widespread wage theft  and equal-pay violations, and it will harm workers across the United  States.   Some of my Republicans continue to argue that H.R. 3441 will provide  stability for workers. As a former union president and as a labor  attorney dealing with issues before the National Labor Relations Board,  I urge my colleagues to stand with the American worker and oppose this  disastrous bill.
