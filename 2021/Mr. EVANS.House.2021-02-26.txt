 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the American Relief  Plan desperately needed by Philadelphia constituents. This plan extends  the poverty-busting earned income tax credits and provides billions for  small businesses. It expands vaccine access, addresses health  disparities, and helps schools open safely. The American people are  counting on us to crush the virus. Let's do the right thing and pass  this very critical bill.
