 Madam President, I come to the floor today with, frankly,  a heavy heart and a fair bit of trepidation. My goal over the next few  minutes is to pay tribute to somebody who is so special, so remarkable,  so beloved, so important to my home State of North Dakota that I feel  inadequate, frankly. But here I am to pay tribute to Sister Thomas  Welder, who died and went to be with the Lord on Monday morning of this  week at the age of 80.   Sister Thomas was for 31 years the president of the University of  Mary and in the last several served as president emerita--very active.  She was a member of the Benedictine Sisters of Annunciation Monastery  at Bismarck. She was a dear personal friend--and not just to me but to  everyone. When I say ``everyone,'' I mean everyone who mattered. I am  unprepared, frankly, to begin to really address all that she is and was  and does and means to people.   Madam President, first of all, I would like to ask unanimous consent  to print in the Record her obituary, as well as the news release  announcing her passing from the University of Mary   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            Sister Thomas Welder                       [April 27, 1940-June 22, 2020]         Sister Thomas Welder, 80, a member of the Benedictine       Sisters of Annunciation Monastery, Bismarck, and president of       the University of Mary for 31 years, passed into eternal life       June 22, 2020, at the monastery, following a recent diagnosis       of kidney cancer.        Mass of Christian burial is scheduled for Monday, June 29,       at 10:00 a.m. in Our Lady of the Annunciation Chapel (OLA) at       the Benedictine Center for Servant Leadership at the       University of Mary. Visitation will be held at OLA from 9       a.m. to 10 a.m. before the funeral. Due to Covid-19       restrictions, the funeral is limited to Welder's family and       close friends. The funeral can be viewed online through       livestream at: www.umary.edu/SisterThomas. A public vigil       service with Evening Prayer will be held Sunday, June 28, at       7 p.m. in Our Lady of the Annunciation Chapel, with       visitation prior from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday's visitation       and vigil service will also be livestreamed.        Sister Thomas (baptismal name Diane Marie) was born in       Linton, N.D. on April 27, 1940, to Mary Ann (Kuhn) and       Sebastian Welder. She was the oldest of three children. When       she was two, the family moved to Bismarck.        A graduate of St. Mary's High School, she joined       Annunciation Monastery after a year of college in Minnesota.       Attracted by the community and prayer life of the sisters,       she felt God's call to become one of them. As a novice, she       was given the name of Sister Thomas. She made her monastic       profession on July 11, 1961. Sister Thomas cherished       Benedictine monastic life which she lived faithfully for 59       years.        She graduated from the College of St. Scholastica, Duluth       with a bachelor's degree in music and earned a master's       degree in music from Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill.        A dedicated servant leader, she gave her life to the       University of Mary for 57 years.  [[Page S3189]]       She led from her heart and touched the lives of many. She was       president from 1978 to 2009. Under her remarkable leadership,       the school attained university status in 1986; tripled in       size from 925 students to 3,000; added the university's first       doctorate, grew on-site and online adult learning programs to       16 locations across the state, region and nation, and moved       to NCAA Division II athletics.        Sister Thomas was present to students, faculty and staff.       She attended student recitals and concerts, cheered at       athletic events and participated in many university       gatherings. She called students by name and her genuine       caring attitude left a deep impression on them. She enjoyed       getting to know friends of the university whose financial       assistance made growth possible. After her retirement as       president, she was named President Emerita and served in the       university's Mission Advancement Office.        One of the most widely known and highly respected women in       North Dakota, Sister Thomas loved visiting with people of all       ages and walks of life. People gave her energy. She would       focus her entire attention toward listening to the person       right in front of her. Her enthusiastic spirit, sense of       humor, and gentle nature made others comfortable in her       presence. It was a joy to be with Sister Thomas.        Sister Thomas modeled many Benedictine values, such as       hospitality, respect, prayer and service, with ease and       grace. Benedictine values were dear to her heart. She       committed herself to instilling these values throughout the       monastery's sponsored institutions, the communities of CHI       St. Alexius Health and the University of Mary.        She served on many state and national boards including CHI       St. Alexius Health and MDU Resources Group, Inc. She received       numerous honors during her lifetime including North Dakota's       highest honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award.        Music was one of her passions. She directed the Sisters'       Choir for 46 years and gave credit to the choir for the       beautiful liturgical music.        Sister Thomas was grateful for many blessings in her life.       She was particularly thankful to two kidney donors who gave       her the gift of life through two kidney transplants. She       often prayed for and stayed connected to these special       people.        A beloved woman of faith, wisdom, and humility, Sister       Thomas gave all of herself to so many for so long. She will       be deeply missed.        She is survived by a sister, Judy (Steve) Jankus, Navarre,       Fla.; a sister-in-law, Marcia Welder, Apple Valley, Minn.; an       aunt, Sister Alene Kuhn, SSND, Mankato, Minn.; 6 nieces and       nephews, 11 grand nieces and nephews, one great grandniece,       and the Sisters of Annunciation Monastery.        She was preceded in death by her parents and her brother,       George.        Memorials may be made to Annunciation Monastery or the       University of Mary.                                   ____                [Posted by University of Mary, June 22, 2020]     Iconic Servant Leader, Educator and University President Emerita,                       Sister Thomas Welder Has Died         Bismarck, ND.--Former University of Mary President Sister       Thomas Welder, OSB, has passed away at her Annunciation       Monastery home early this morning, June 22, south of       Bismarck, ND, following a recent diagnosis of kidney cancer.        Revered locally, regionally and nationally as a true       servant-leader for living the Gospel of Jesus, the 80-year       old Welder cared for the Christ-like development of all       University of Mary students and the well-being of all       faculty, staff, and her beloved Sisters of Annunciation       Monastery.        ``Sister Thomas lived her life for others,'' said Sister       Nicole Kunze, Prioress of Annunciation Monastery. ``She was       always giving to others, whether it was a smile, an       encouraging word or a promise of prayer. She often said that       the greatest gift you could give a person was the gift of       your time, and she did that without fail. Sister Thomas       modeled so many of our Benedictine values with ease and       grace. She truly received all as Christ. She was intent on       maintaining a vibrant connection between the sisters of the       monastery and our sponsored institutions.''        The Sisters sponsor the University of Mary, where the       public will be able to gather and memorialize her life and       lay her to rest. The celebration of Welder's life will take       place over two days.        The public is welcome to join the following memorial       ceremonies and funeral online through livestream at       www.youtube.com/universityofmary/live. A public visitation is       planned from 1 p.m. until 7 p.m. on Sunday, June 28 in Our       Lady of the Annunciation Chapel (OLA), located in the       Benedictine Center for Servant Leadership building on campus.       A vigil service with Evening Prayer will follow at 7:00 p.m.       Before her funeral at 10:00 a.m. in OLA on Monday, June 29, a       second public visitation will be held prior from 9 a.m. until       10 a.m. The funeral is open to Welder's family and close       friends.        Welder will then be immediately buried after Mass in the       nearby Monastery Cemetery located on the west bluff next to       the Benedictine Center for Servant Leadership, overlooking       the Missouri River.        ``Sister Thomas Welder was a rare person,'' said University       of Mary President Monsignor James Shea. ``Under her       leadership and vision, the University of Mary was confirmed       in its purpose to form leaders in the service of truth in       renewed and ever-growing ways, and Sister Thomas's leadership       touched thousands of students' lives as the university grew       and expanded over her presidency. But perhaps even more than       this, Sister Thomas was known for her attentiveness, her       humility, her heart for service, and her love for her       vocation as a Benedictine Sister of Annunciation Monastery.       It was these qualities, too, which touched innumerable lives       over the course of her life.''        In 2019, Bismarck's CBS affiliate, KXMB TV, honored Welder       for Women's History Month. During that interview, when       reporter and anchor Lauren Kalberer asked Welder what she       thinks about being regarded as one of the most       influential women of our time, ``It gives me pause. First       of all, what do we mean by influence? And, what kind of a       difference can we make, because, as I think of leadership,       I think about it much more in terms of influence, than I       do of power or control,'' responded Welder.        During that same TV interview, Shea commented, ``Sister       Thomas Welder--more than leading by words, leads by her       example and by the way she treats people.''        Welder influenced millions of people during her lifetime,       and more profoundly, so many students during her time as the       longest serving female university president in American       history from 1978 to 2009. Her joyful laugh, witty humor,       profound wisdom, and genuine love and respect for others were       hallmarks of her character as she lived the Benedictine       values. Her knack for remembering names, particularly the       thousands of students, alumni and faculty, is one of her most       gifted qualities that will be forever treasured.        ``With an incredible ability to remember names and faces of       almost everyone she met, Sister Thomas was always focused on       the person directly in front of her,'' added Kunze. ``Her       attention to the details of daily lives and family members of       those she met would be recalled in future encounters.       Students, faculty, staff, and guests of the Monastery would       marvel when she asked about people and situations in their       lives that had been discussed months, even years, earlier.       She had a ready laugh and gentle nature that made others       comfortable in her presence.''        Welder, a Bismarck native, attended the College of St.       Benedict, graduated from the College of St. Scholastica,       Duluth, and earned a master's degree in music from       Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. She is a       member of the Benedictine Sisters of the Annunciation       Monastery.        Welder began her career as a teacher at the university in       1963, when it was named Mary College. As president, Welder       helped the school gain university status, experienced steady       growth, added numerous undergraduate and on-site graduate       degree programs throughout North Dakota, helped make Mary one       of the premier institutions for the preparation of leaders,       and fostered leadership development in students and       colleagues. The Norsk Hstfest Association inducted       Welder into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame, she       received the Lifetime of Caring Award from the United Way,       and on May 4, 2004, she earned the state's highest honor from       Governor John Hoeven--the Theodore Roosevelt Roughrider       Award--presented to individuals who have received national       recognition, reflecting credit and honor upon North Dakota       and its citizens:        ``. . . Sister Thomas promotes competence in communication,       a commitment to values and service to community. Her strong       belief of growing into leadership through service stands as a       model for North Dakota and the nation,'' reads an excerpt       from the plaque beneath her portrait that hangs in the North       Dakota Hall of Fame in the lower level of the State Capitol       Building.        During the later years of her presidency, Welder endured       chronic kidney complications that led to a transplant in       2001. In 2005, she learned that due to a virus she would need       a second kidney transplant, but had to regularly undergo       dialysis until a successful second kidney transplant could be       done in 2011.        At the start of Shea's current presidency in 2009 and after       her 31-year tenure as the fourth University of Mary       president, Welder continued to be involved with University of       Mary as president emerita--remaining active with public       speaking events, committees and fundraising in the department       of Mission Advancement.        In lieu of flowers, if you wish to honor the memory of       Sister Thomas Welder, her love for University of Mary's       students, lifelong mission of servant leadership, and genuine       care for others, memorial donations are being accepted to       Annunciation Monastery or for the university's Sister Thomas       Welder Scholarship Fund at www.umary.edu/SisterThomas. They       can also be mailed to the Office of Mission Advancement in       care of the Sister Thomas Welder Scholarship Fund at 7500       University Drive, Bismarck, ND, 58504    I am going to read some of the facts of her life from her  obituary and do my best to fill in some personal thoughts while I do  that. I am not going to read the entire thing.   It starts out: ``Sister Thomas Welder, 80, a member of the  Benedictine Sisters of Annunciation Monastery, Bismarck, and president  of the University of Mary for 31 years, passed into eternal life June  22, 2020, at the monastery, following a recent diagnosis of kidney  cancer.  [[Page S3190]]    ``A graduate of St. Mary's High School, she joined Annunciation  Monastery after a year of college in Minnesota. Attracted by the  community and prayer life of the sisters, she felt God's call to become  one of them. As a novice, she was given the name of Sister Thomas. She  made her monastic profession on July 11, 1961. Sister Thomas cherished  Benedictine monastic life which she lived faithfully for 59 years.''   I recall a speech--or an interview--once at an event. In fact, I  think it was during her retirement. She was asked about monastic life.  She was asked: What is it that grounds you? Where is it you get your  inspiration?   She said: ``My wellspring are the Sisters of Annunciation  Monastery.''   Skipping down a little bit, her obituary reads: ``A dedicated servant  leader''--and we will speak to that in a little bit--``she gave her  life to the University of Mary for 57 years. She led from her heart and  touched the lives of many. She was president from 1978 to 2009.''   I had the great honor of serving as the master of ceremonies at her  30th anniversary as president.   ``Under her remarkable leadership, the school attained university  status in 1986; tripled in size . . . ; added the university's first  doctorate, grew on-site and online adult learning programs to 16  locations across the state, region'' and the country, and moved the  school from NAIA to NCAA Division II athletics.   This is an important line: ``Sister Thomas was present to students,  faculty and staff.'' I will elaborate on that a bit as well.   ``She attended student recitals and concerts, cheered at athletic  events and participated in many university gatherings. She called  students by name and her genuine caring attitude left a deep impression  on them. She enjoyed getting to know friends of the university whose  financial assistance made growth possible.''   I went on many fundraising calls with her.   ``After her retirement as president, she was named President Emerita  and served in the university's Mission Advancement Office.''   I had the great honor of working with her and then working for her  after she hired me and then working with her again as a member of the  board of trustees and sharing and serving on many boards and committees  at the university.   Her obituary goes on to say: ``One of the most widely known and  highly respected women in North Dakota, Sister Thomas loved visiting  with people of all ages and walks of life. People gave her energy. She  would focus her entire attention toward listening to the person right  in front of her.''   Boy, do we need that lesson here, Sister Thomas. We need you to teach  us.   Let me say that again: ``She would focus her entire attention toward  listening to the person right in front of her.''   In fact, in a TED talk she did for TEDx on TV about, I think, 3 years  ago or so--she was speaking to a lot of young people, of course, at  this TED talk and was talking about connectivity, and she was speaking  to the issue of monastic life and community and the stability that  comes from being grounded in a community, while also talking about--not  criticizing, mind you; she was rarely critical--but speaking of the  challenges of the digital era. She said this: ``The challenge is to be  fully present to those around us. The challenge is to be fully present  to those around us, to engage face to face with one's child, with a  colleague, with a neighbor. . . . '' and she went on to say ``even that  person who may not be in our circle of friends.''   See, she didn't just speak to this value of being present; she was  present. She was the epitome of always being present. In fact, her  humility caused her to always deflect attention away from herself and  to the person in front of her.   Earlier I mentioned that in the obituary it mentions she called the  students by name, and this is perhaps the best example of what I mean  when I say she was always present: The University of Mary had about  3,000 students a year by the time she retired. She knew them all by  name, and when she would greet students, faculty, friends, neighbors,  supporters of the university, she always called you by name--but not  just you; she asked about your spouse by name, your children by name.  We all thought that was some special spiritual gift--a big brain with  an incredible memory that just automatically recalls people's names.  Yeah, she was really smart. She had a good memory, to be sure. But she  didn't call us by name because she had a great memory; she called us by  name because it was important to her because she knew it was important  to us. It was a conviction, a commitment that she had to being present  all the time. It was a remarkable thing--a remarkable thing.   Sister Thomas modeled many Benedictine values at the University of  Mary. We learned them all, all the time. The six that they highlight  there are the Benedictine values of hospitality, respect for persons,  prayer, moderation, service--really important, as she called them,  gospel values. But she didn't just call them gospel values. She didn't  just teach them, although she does a lot.   By the way, the internet and YouTube are full of her speeches on  Benedictine values and other values and leadership, especially servant  leadership.   ``She committed herself to instilling these values throughout the  monastery's sponsored institutions,'' which included, of course, the  University of Mary and CHI St. Alexius Health.   ``She served on many state and national boards including CHI St.  Alexius Health and MDU Resources Group,'' a Fortune 400 corporation.   ``She received numerous honors during her lifetime including North  Dakota's highest honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award.''   She earned them all. She earned them all. In fact, whenever she was  complimented--which was often, as you might imagine, when you know as  many people as she knows and have accomplished as much as she  accomplished--she always, as I said earlier, deflected her  accomplishments and gave someone else credit.   She said this in an interview once when confronted with her many  accomplishments: ``I have always been blessed with the sense that I can  do only what I do with the guidance and the help of the Spirit.'' Think  of that. All that she accomplished--she takes no credit but credits the  fact that she was blessed with the sense that at least she was aware  that the Spirit was the one that was guiding her.    Her obituary also states: ``Sister Thomas was grateful for many  blessings in her life. She was particularly thankful to two kidney  donors who gave her the gift of life through two kidney transplants.  She often prayed for and stayed connected''--connected--``to these  special people.''   In that TEDx speech that I talked about from about 3 years ago, she  was talking about connectivity, as I said. She was challenging them.  She said: ``A disconnect from our cellphone or iPad makes possible a  reconnect with those around us.''   ``A disconnect from our cellphone or iPad makes possible a reconnect  with those around us.''   I could share lots of personal stories. I am tempted to, but I don't  think that would be the tribute she would want.   She and I made a lot of calls together. We went on a lot of road  trips together. We spoke at a lot of the same events. I was always  grateful when I could go first. It was impossible to follow her--an  incredible speaker.   One time we were at an event--I think I was the emcee, actually--a  local event in Bismarck. She gave one of her phenomenal speeches. They  all are. They all were. In the audience, unbeknownst to me, was the  president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. He came up to  me afterwards, and he said: ``Do you realize that every year we pay  about $50,000 for a speaker at our national annual meeting, and we have  never had one this good?''   I said: ``Well, I could get her to do it for less.''   He said: ``It is unbelievable. I have never been this inspired in my  life.''   I would just challenge everybody who has a minute and wants to be  inspired to just do a quick Google search of Sister Thomas Welder, and  you will find a video that will inspire you.   Every person I know who ever met her is better because they did,  everybody I know whom she encountered. I once brought John Wooden, the  great  [[Page S3191]]  wizard of Westwood, the winningest coach in NCAA history, to the  University of Mary to give a speech on servant leadership. It was a  remarkable time. I sat there, and as I watched Coach Wooden--he was 96  years old at the time--come up to the stage after Sister Thomas  introduced him, I stood between them and I thought, wow, I am between  saints, two of the best servant leaders, who both taught and lived that  incredible value.   As I said, my heart is heavy. It is hard not to be sad. Yet Sister  Thomas and I, of all of the things we talked about over the many years  that I worked with her and for her, talked mostly about matters of  faith.   I am not Catholic. I do have a degree from the University of Mary. I  am on their board of trustees. I love the place. I love the Sisters of  Annunciation Monastery and Sister Thomas especially because she  embodies all that is good about them. But we always talked about  matters of faith.   I will never forget one trip to Fargo. I will never forget, in fact,  where we were--sitting in my car, waiting to go in to call on somebody  about a gift to the school. And we talked about Heaven. She said: ``I  think we're going to be surprised at who we will see there.'' And I  thought, yeah, you are probably right.   She gets the blessing of being there first now and seeing who all is  there, but there will be a lot of people there who know her, and they  are looking forward to welcoming her and thanking her for the  incredible gift she was in their life. I look forward to the day when I  can go and be welcomed by her. I am grateful for her life.   I love you, Sister Thomas.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
