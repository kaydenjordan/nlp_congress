 Mr. President, 16 years ago the United Nations General  Assembly designated April 4 as the International Day for Mine Awareness  and Assistance in Mine Action. Today, I am introducing a Senate  resolution recognizing that designation and reaffirming United States  leadership in eliminating landmines and unexploded ordnance.   As we read the reports of withdrawing Russian troops leaving  landmines to terrorize, maim, and kill Ukrainian civilians, we are  reminded of the necessity to redouble our efforts to ban these  insidious weapons once and for all. The mines in Ukraine will remain a  deadly hazard there long after the fighting ends, whenever that time  comes.   Landmines and other unexploded ordnance cause death and terrible  injuries to people in dozens of countries, mostly places where the  ability to provide lifesaving medical care and long-term rehabilitation  and vocational support is lacking or far from adequate.   The United States continues to provide the largest share of demining  assistance, and we spend many millions of dollars annually helping the  survivors. That is something we can be proud of.   But in some countries, like Laos, the millions of cluster munitions  that failed to detonate on contact were manufactured in the United  States and dropped by American aircraft. Fifty years later they  continue to destroy innocent lives.   So while the number of landmine and UXO casualties has fallen  significantly since I and others first took on this issue in the late  1980s and early 1990s,  [[Page S1939]]  we are not where we hoped to be back then.   First, the Biden Administration needs to restore the policy on  landmines that was put in place during the Obama Administration. The  White House said they would but it has not happened yet. There is no  excuse for delaying.   Second, we need to continue to provide the funding for humanitarian  demining and survivors assistance. Fortunately, this is not a partisan  issue. It is simply a matter of continuing to treat it as a priority.   And third, this is my last year in the Senate and while I will do  everything I can while I am here, we need others to continue to  advocate for the United States to sign the international treaties  banning anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions. It should have  happened already, and we have to keep working until it does.   I have seen first-hand the effects of landmines and other unexploded  munitions. It is horrific, especially when it's a young child with a  leg or an arm missing. Or a parent blinded and crippled by a landmine,  being led around by a child.   We should be the country that leads the world in ending not only the  carnage of landmines and UXO left behind, but the production, export,  use and stockpiling of these indiscriminate weapons that don't belong  in the arsenals of civilized nations.                            ____________________
