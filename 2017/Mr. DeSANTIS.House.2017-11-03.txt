 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Iowa for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, it was really distressing to hear that Christ Church  in Alexandria is removing a monument honoring its most famous  parishioner, George Washington. It just made me think: What is this  world coming to?   Now, Christ Church is free to do as it pleases, but I think we are  also free to criticize such an absurd course of action. If we can't  honor the Father of our Country, then we truly are drowning in a sea of  knee-jerk political correctness.   George Washington was one of the few truly great men, an American  original without whom we would not be standing here today as free  people.   I just want to tick off a few things before I yield back to my  colleague from Iowa, but this is important.   His stewardship during the American Revolution brought America a  victory that we really had no right to win against the most powerful  army on Earth.   He only had one-third of the country behind the revolutionary cause,  yet, against all odds, Washington led our country to victory. But then  having won that military victory, what does Washington do?   Throughout all of human history, when you win a military victory,  that commanding general then seizes power for themselves and creates a  society which is at that individual's beck and call.                                time  1215    That is not what George Washington did. He famously surrendered his  sword to the Continental Congress and gave up power voluntarily because  he wanted to establish a republic. Then he went home to Mount Vernon.  When word of Washington's relinquishment of power reached King George  III in England, he was flummoxed. He said: Well, if that is really  true, then Washington is the greatest man in the world.   It is unheard of that you would relinquish power in that way.  Napoleon, on his deathbed--obviously, he had a lot of trials and  tribulations--said: Look, they wanted me to be another Washington, and  I just couldn't do it.   Washington presided over the Federal Convention in 1787, which  created our Constitution. Had Washington not been willing to lend his  legitimacy to that proceeding and to the Constitution, I think it is  pretty clear the Constitution would have never been ratified.   He gets elected the first President of the United States unanimously.  I think we really needed somebody with Washington's character and  stature to be able to launch this new ship of state. If you had had  anybody else--and there were many great Founding Fathers--you may not  have been able to launch it successfully. He was that type of man.   He was also somebody who has offered some of the most eloquent  defenses of religious liberty in our country's history. I want to quote  from a letter he wrote to the Hebrew congregation at Newport in 1790.   He said: ``It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it  were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the  exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government  of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to  persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its  protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on  all occasions their effectual support.''   Those are words that I think ring as true today and are as important  today as they were in 1790.   He established a two-term voluntary limit for President. People  thought he could have been President for life, and, of course, he could  have been. He didn't think that that was the right way to go. In fact,  his entire career--from surrendering his sword at the Continental  Congress to the two-term limit--was dedicated to the notion that in a  republic--the government of laws and not of men--no one individual is  indispensable. Yet he really was the exception to that rule. He was  truly first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his  countrymen.   Mr. Speaker, I think, when you look back at history, you can  obviously point to things that we don't necessarily like, and I think  it is fair to air that. But to simply remove somebody's monument-- somebody who truly exhibited greatness--I think is a direction in this  country that we do not want to go.   So I just thought it was important to stand up here and to say that  the Father of our Country is somebody who all Americans should hold in  profound esteem because I don't think we would be sitting here on the  floor of the House of Representatives in the most powerful country on  Earth if Washington had not existed.
