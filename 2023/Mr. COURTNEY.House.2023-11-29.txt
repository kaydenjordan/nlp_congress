 Mr. Speaker, today I missed rollcall No. 679 on the  Rule (H. Res. 891 ) for three bills under consideration on the floor  this week:   H.R. 5283, ``Protecting our Communities from Failure to Secure the  Border Act; H.R. 5961, ``No Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act''; and S.J.  Res. 32, ``Providing for congressional disapproval, relating to ``Small  Business Lending Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act''.   Had I recorded my vote, I would have voted ``no'' on the Rule, H.  Res. 891.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
