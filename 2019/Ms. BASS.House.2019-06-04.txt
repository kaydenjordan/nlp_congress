 Mr. Speaker, May was National Foster Care Month, a time for  our country to come together to acknowledge the half million people in  our child welfare system, the hundreds of thousands who work within the  system day in and day out, and the millions of adults who have exited  the system and are no longer in care.   No one knows the child welfare system like the foster youth who have  grown up in the system. Today, the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth  and the National Foster Youth Institute have brought more than 100  young people from every corner of the country here to Washington, D.C.,  to shadow their Member of Congress. I would like to take a second to  thank the nearly 100 Members of Congress who are spending this morning  learning from a constituent and delegate of this program about their  personal experiences and ideas to make impactful change in the child  welfare system.   The delegates of this program have been in town since Saturday and  have been learning about community activism and successful movement  building. Yesterday, we held a forum right here in the Capitol where  our delegates were able to ask Members of the leadership of Congress  questions about changes to the child welfare system. I can't wait for  the participants of this program to be up here serving in Congress,  making their voices even louder than they are now.   Each year, our participants have a real hand in making change. From  the Chafee Grant extensions to the passage of the Family First  Prevention Services Act just last year, this group's voices have  changed our child welfare system forever.   The reality is this: When the government removes children from their  parents, the government becomes that child's parent. Too often, the  government forgets this commitment and life goes on for those not in  the child welfare system; but for those in it, they come to feel  trapped and forgotten.   These young people here today have traveled thousands of miles to  share their stories of their challenges with abuse, trafficking,  overmedication, or homelessness. In addition, they are sharing their  successes with mentorship, adoption, family reunification, community  activism, and independent living. Their goal is to leave Congress with  a better understanding of the reality faced day in and day out by our  Nation's youth in care.    Today, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share the stories of four former  foster youth who are here shadowing me today.   Yeshi Vaughan graduated in the top 10 of her high school class. In  May 2019, she graduated with honors from Saint Martin's University with  a bachelor's in social work and a minor in sociology. She hopes that as  a social worker she can share her story to encourage other youth.   Fonda Williams is a former foster youth from California, born and  raised in the city of Watts. She is 27 years old and the sixth child of  eight. Her current occupation is a public safety dispatcher. She  attended UCLA and is currently attending El Camino College.   Racquell Perry is a Florida barred attorney and is the statewide  outreach for Keys to Independence at Educate Tomorrow. The Keys to  Independence program is designed to help youth in out-of-home care  overcome barriers to driving. Racquell is a proud two-time graduate of  Florida A&M University, earning a bachelor's degree in criminal justice  and a JD from its college of law.   Toni Criner, while attending Howard University, had the opportunity  to be an intern in my office, where she experienced child welfare and  foster care policy issues from a different viewpoint. After Toni's time  on the Hill, she went on to pioneer a White House initiative and was  given the opportunity to work with Washington, D.C.'s most vulnerable  transitioning-aged youth. In 2019, Toni founded her own company, T.C.  Mentoring and Consulting LLC. The company's mission is to help at-risk  youth and young adults find their path in life.   Mr. Speaker, our country is the richest country in the history of the  world, and there is no excuse for us not to take care of the half  million youth who are in the child welfare system. When the government  removes them, we are the ones responsible, and we should never be in a  situation where anyone  [[Page H4227]]  would accuse the government of abuse and neglect. This is why we need  to transform the Nation's child welfare system to make sure that all of  the children in our country have everything they need to be successful  adults.                            ____________________
