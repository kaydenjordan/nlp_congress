 Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from  Colorado. I will not tell him what I was doing in 1986, the last time  we adjusted the tax rate, but I just want to remind our colleagues  today that we are in a moment of crisis in the United States.   Today we have a national debt crisis. I have been to this floor many  times, and many of my colleagues have as well, to talk about this debt  crisis. It affects our ability to do the things that we know are right  to do--to deal with the victims of hurricanes, with national security,  and with our healthcare situation.   Folks, we are losing the right to do the right thing.   To solve this national debt crisis, we have to do many things. But  one of the ways we can deal with this debt crisis--and one of the first  things we have to do--is to grow our economy. The way to grow the  economy is to roll back regulations, unleash our energy potential, and,  yes, finally, once and for all, fix this archaic tax system, which  keeps us from being competitive with the rest of the world.   In 1986, we had the third lowest corporate tax rate in history, in  the world, and over the next 15 years we benefited from that. But at  the same time, the more our economy grew, the lower the tax rates were  taken in the rest of the world. Today, American businesses are taxed at  one of the highest rates in the developed world: 35 percent. Meanwhile,  for example, Japan's statutory corporate rate is just 23 percent;  Germany is at 16 percent; Mexico is at 30 percent; the U.K. reduced  theirs in 2009 from 30 percent to 19 percent, and they are about to go  to 17 percent as we speak. As a matter of fact, the average rate in  Europe is just 18 percent, while in Asia the average corporate tax rate  is 20 percent.   Why is the corporate tax rate so important to an American worker? The  corporate tax rate we have in America is the greatest burden the  American worker has today. Why? Because it makes that American  corporation less competitive with the rest of the world. It also makes  that American corporation vulnerable to foreign acquisitions of U.S.  companies and then the moving of those headquarters and factories and  jobs offshore.   The No. 1 thing we can do for the American worker is to become  competitive from a tax standpoint with the rest of the world. I have  lived this. I have lived in Asia; I have lived in Europe. I have worked  here most of my career, and I know when this gets out of balance, and  it is out of balance today. We are penalizing the American worker  because of it.   It is no secret, a lower corporate tax rate would make us more  competitive globally. Our tax plan fixes this. We are one of the last  countries that still has a tax on unrepatriated earnings. In other  words, if we have a U.S. company that makes money overseas, it pays  taxes over there; when they bring it over here, they have to pay tax  here. We are the last country in the world that really has double  taxation. We need to end that repatriation tax so  [[Page S7236]]  that we can free up almost $3 trillion of U.S. profits overseas and  bring them back and invest in training, in plants, in facilities, and  in research and development. Our plan makes that happen.   We have an individual tax code that is 2.4 million words in length.  Let me say that again: 2.4 million words in length. Wasn't that the tax  simplification law of 1986? I think it was. It is 2.4 million words in  length. That is ridiculous, and it is entirely too complex. We all know  that. Our plan will fix this.   It is also estimated that, if we can get it enacted, this tax plan  will create over 1 million new jobs because of the changes that we are  enveloping into this Tax Code right now.   In addition, it is estimated that the GDP growth will be more like  3.7 percent, instead of the 1.9 percent we have become used to over the  last 8 years. Frankly, I believe there is no reason it can't be  significantly more.   We are getting closer to getting this done, but I realize there is a  lot more to do. It is more important now than ever that we don't get  bogged down in this Washington dysfunction and gridlock.   Last week, I mentioned that many Democrats supported the changes we  are talking about in the Tax Code, right up until President Trump took  office. In fact, over the last several years--in fact, over the last  several decades--many Democrats on the other side of the aisle and  people in their place before agreed.   This is not a partisan issue. This is about national security, if you  want to get right down to it. It is about making America competitive  again. Who would be against that? There are decades of quotes from  Democrats and Republicans about this issue. This should be a bipartisan  issue.   In 1963, a very famous American made this quote:         A tax cut means higher family income and higher business       profits and a balanced federal budget.        Every taxpayer and his family will have more money left       over after taxes. . . . Every businessman can keep a higher       percentage of his [or her] profits in his [or her] cash       register or to put it to work expanding or improving his       business, and as the national income grows, the Federal       Government will ultimately end up with more revenues.    That noted American was President John F. Kennedy, in 1963. If he  were here today, I think he would admonish all of us to put our  partisan bickering aside and get something like this done for the  American people.   Another quote:         I think [the corporate rate] should be lowered. We should       try to get it as close to the international average as we       can, so we'll [once and for all] be competitive.    That was Bill Clinton last year, 2016.   Another quote:         Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use       the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first       time in 25 years.    That was President Barack Obama in 2011, believe it or not. This is  not a partisan issue.   There are more minority party leaders in the House and the Senate who  have also come out and spoken on this point:         Today, 28 OECD countries and every other G-7 country has       adopted some form of territorial tax system--and all these       countries have lower corporate tax rates than the United       States. This means that no matter what jurisdiction a U.S.       multinational company is competing in, they are competing at       a disadvantage.    That was the current Senate minority leader in 2015. This is not a  partisan issue.   Another quote: ``It is long past time for tax reform that would lower  the corporate tax rate.''   That was House Minority Leader Pelosi last year. This is not a  partisan issue.   This tax bill is being done under regular order, including a  committee markup this week, with plenty of amendments, and it will go  to the floor as soon as we can get it there for debate and more  amendments.   I urge all my colleagues: Let's put partisan politics aside once and  for all and collaborate through the amendment process to do something  historic, something that American workers deserve, and that is to  become competitive with the rest of the world again. Renew your support  for the same tax changes your party has supported for years.   I want to close with another quote from an individual I have long  admired, President John F. Kennedy, in 1962.         I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut       deficit and a budget surplus. It is between two kinds of       deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted       result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy, or a       temporary deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut       designed to boost the economy, increase tax revenues, and       achieve, I believe--and I believe this can be done--a budget       surplus. The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and       weakness; the second reflects an investment in the future.    Again, these are words from President John F. Kennedy, while he was  President, in 1962. This is not a partisan issue.   Our tax plan is an investment in our future, just as John F. Kennedy  said. It is an investment that will help all Americans.   I know there is a lot of disinformation going on: This is only a tax  break for the wealthy, and so forth. When the facts come out--and they  have already come out; four Pinocchios have been given to those  comments. Our tax plan will prove that when we get into the details.   Equally important, getting this tax plan done to help all Americans  is a critical part of developing a long-term plan to solve the national  debt crisis.   I am proud to serve here with my colleague from North Carolina,  Senator Tillis. I think, in North Carolina, they actually did this, and  they had the results we are talking about here.
