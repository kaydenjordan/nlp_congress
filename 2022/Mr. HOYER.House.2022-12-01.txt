Res. 744         Whereas in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996,       2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017,       2018, and 2020, Congress declared that it deplored the       religious persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i       community and would hold the Government of Iran responsible       for upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, including       members of the Baha'i faith;        Whereas since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed or       executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders, and more than 10,000       have been dismissed from government and university jobs;        Whereas the Baha'i International Community documented a       more than 50-percent increase in hate propaganda directed       against the Baha'is in the 12-month period ending in August       2020, compared to prior years, with more than 9,500 such       articles, videos, or web pages appearing in Iranian       government-controlled or government-sponsored media;        Whereas, on December 16, 2021, the United Nations General       Assembly adopted a resolution (A/C.3/76/L.28) criticizing       Iran for human rights abuses and calling on Iran to carry out       wide-ranging reforms, including--        (1) ``ceasing use of the death penalty and commuting the       sentences for child offenders on death row'';        (2) ``ensuring that no one is subjected to torture or other       cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment'';        (3) ``ceasing the widespread and systematic use of       arbitrary arrests and detention'';        (4) ``releasing persons detained for the exercise of their       human rights and fundamental freedoms'';        (5) ``improving conditions inside prisons'';        (6) ``eliminating discrimination against women and girls'';       and        (7) ``eliminating discrimination against ethnic,       linguistic, and other minorities'';        Whereas in the 2022 Annual Report of the United States       Commission on International Religious Freedom issued in April       2022, it is reported that the Government of Iran--        (1) ``arrested scores of Baha'is across Iran, many of whom       were held incommunicado or taken to undisclosed locations'';        (2) ``sent Ministry of Intelligence agents to search the       home of a Baha'i citizen and confiscated her belongings'';        (3) ``continued to deny university education to Baha'is on       account of their faith'';        (4) ``closed six Baha'i businesses'';        (5) ``demolished the homes of three Baha'is without       warning'';        (6) ``announced the auction of thirteen Baha'i farms''; and        (7) ``continued to deny Baha'is the right to bury their       deceased in empty plots at the Golestan Javid cemetery       outside Tehran which the community has used for decades.       Instead, Baha'is are being forced to use the Khaveran mass       grave site where victims of the 1988 prison massacres are       buried'';        Whereas the Iran section of the Department of State's 2021       Report on International Religious Freedom issued in June 2022       provides, in part--        (1) ``Security forces in Shiraz and Mazandaran Province       conducted multiple arrests of Baha'is in their homes or       workplaces in the last week of September without providing       reasons or charges.'';        (2) ``Authorities continued to confiscate Baha'i properties       as part of an ongoing state-led campaign of economic       persecution against Baha'is. Authorities issued an order in       April denying Baha'is permission to bury their dead in empty       plots at the Tehran-area cemetery designated for Baha'is,       forcing them to bury them at a mass grave site.'';        (3) ``Authorities reportedly continued to deny the Baha'i,       Sabean-Mandaean, and Yarsani religious communities, as well       as members of other unrecognized religious minority groups,       access to education and government employment unless they       declared themselves as belonging to one of the country's       recognized religions on their application forms.''; and        (4) ``Government officials continued to disseminate anti-      Baha'i and antisemitic messages using traditional and social       media.'';        Whereas, on July 4, 2022, the Baha'i International       Community noted ``The Iranian government's systematic       campaign to persecute the Baha'i religious minority       accelerated again this past week with the arrest, court       hearing or imprisonment of at least 18 more Baha'i citizens       across the country, bringing the June total to 44 people.       Hundreds of others, meanwhile, also await summonses to court       or to prison.'';        Whereas, on July 21, 2022, the Baha'i International       Community announced ``More than 20 Baha'is in Shiraz, Tehran,       Yazd and Bojnourd, have been arrested, jailed or subjected to       home searches and business closures since the beginning of       July. Last month 44 Baha'is were arrested, arraigned or       imprisoned, suggesting an escalating crisis in the Iranian       government's systematic campaign against the country's       largest non-Muslim religious minority. . .'';        Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a       signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights       and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,       among other international human rights treaties, without       reservation;        Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions,       Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514)       authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individuals       who are ``responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for       ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission       of serious human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or       their family members on or after June 12, 2009''; and        Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights       Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) amends and expands the       authorities established under the Comprehensive Iran       Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public       Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now,       therefore, be it  [[Page H8699]]         Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the Government of Iran's state-sponsored       persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued       violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)       and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights       (ICCPR);        (2) calls on the Government of Iran--        (A) to immediately release the imprisoned or detained       Baha'is and all other prisoners held solely on account of       their religion;        (B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of hate propaganda       against the Baha'is; and        (C) to reverse state-imposed policies denying Baha'is and       members of other religious minorities equal opportunities to       higher education, earning a livelihood, due process under the       law, and the free exercise of religious practices;        (3) calls on the President and the Secretary of State, in       cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn       the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights,       and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on       account of their religion; and        (4) urges the President and the Secretary of State to       utilize available authorities to impose sanctions on       officials of the Government of Iran and other individuals       directly responsible for serious human rights abuses,       including abuses against the Baha'i community of Iran.    Condemning the Use of Hunger as a Weapon of War and Recognizing the           Effect of Conflict on Global Food Security and Famine                                H. Res. 922         Whereas, in 2021, 193,000,000 people experienced crisis       levels of food insecurity, with nearly 139,000,000 people       living in environments where conflict was the main driver of       this crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened rising       global food insecurity;        Whereas conflict acutely impacts vulnerable populations       such as women and children, persons with disabilities,       refugees, and internally displaced persons;        Whereas armed conflict's impacts on food security can be       direct, such as displacement from land, destruction of       livestock grazing areas and fishing grounds, or destruction       of food stocks and agricultural assets, or indirect, such as       disruptions to food systems, leading to increased food       prices, including water and fuel, and the breakdown of a       government's ability to enforce regulations or perform its       judiciary functions;        Whereas aerial bombing campaigns targeting agricultural       heartlands, scorched earth methods of warfare, and the use of       landmines and other explosive devices have direct impacts on       the ability of vulnerable populations to feed themselves;        Whereas effective humanitarian response in armed conflict,       including in the threat of conflict-induced famine and food       insecurity in situations of armed conflict, requires respect       for international humanitarian law by all parties to the       conflict, and allowing and facilitating the rapid and       unimpeded movement of humanitarian relief to all those in       need;        Whereas efforts to restrict humanitarian aid and the       operational integrity and impartiality of humanitarian aid       works and distribution efforts, including through blockades,       security impediments, or irregular bureaucratic requirements       is another means by which combatants employ starvation and       food deprivation as a weapon of war; and        Whereas the United States Government has the tools to fight       global hunger, provide and protect lifesaving assistance, and       promote the prevention of conflict, including through the       Global Fragility Act of 2019 (title V of division J of Public       Law 116-94), the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (Public Law       114-195), and the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public       Law 115-334), and has the potential to hold accountable those       using hunger as a weapon in conflict through the Global       Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of       title XII of Public Law 114-328) and other means: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns--        (A) the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of       warfare;        (B) the intentional and reckless destruction, removing,       looting, blocking, or rendering useless objects necessary for       food production and distribution such as farmland, markets,       mills, food processing and storage areas, such as ports and       hubs containing grain terminals, foodstuffs, crops,       livestock, agricultural assets, waterways, water systems,       drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation       works;        (C) the denial of humanitarian access and the deprivation       of objects indispensable to people's survival, such as food       supplies and nutrition resources; and        (D) the willful interruption of market systems to affected       populations in need in conflict environments by preventing       travel and manipulating currency exchange;        (2) calls on the United States Government to--        (A) prioritize diplomatic efforts to call out and address       instances where hunger and intentional deprivation of food is       being utilized as a weapon of war, including efforts to       ensure that security operations do not undermine livelihoods       of local populations to minimize civilian harm;        (B) continue efforts to address severe food insecurity       through humanitarian and development response efforts,       including in-kind food assistance, vouchers, and other       flexible modalities, and long-term programming focused on       agriculture support and resilient livelihoods;        (C) ensure existing interagency strategies, crisis response       efforts, and ongoing programs consider, integrate, and adapt       to address conflict by utilizing crisis modifiers in United       States Agency for International Development programming to       respond to rapid shocks and stress such as the willful       targeting of food systems; and        (D) ensure that the use of hunger as a weapon in conflict       is considered within the employment of tools to hold       individuals, governments, militias, or entities responsible       such as the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act       (22 U.S.C. 2656), where appropriate, and taking into       consideration the need for humanitarian exemptions and the       protection of lifesaving assistance.
