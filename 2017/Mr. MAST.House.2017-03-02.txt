 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of including  Everglades restoration in the President's infrastructure plan for  America.   The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is the most ambitious  ecosystem restoration ever attempted and represents the ultimate  infrastructure package for Florida, but many critical projects designed  to add harmful Lake Okeechobee discharges and algal blooms into my  community are far behind where they should be and becoming far more  costly by the delay in full funding.   The President has touted his record of building world-class projects  ahead of schedule and under budget; so I am calling on him to create an  Everglades restoration infrastructure task force, secure the full  funding, and accelerate the CERP projects to completion.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents have waited long enough to realize the  massive benefits of Everglades restoration. Now let's seize this moment  and put this President and this Congress to work to finish the job.                            ____________________
