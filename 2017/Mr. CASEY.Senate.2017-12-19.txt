 Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished  chairman of the Finance Committee for his hopes for more bipartisanship  and his concern about the way the Senate is working today. I appreciate  that. I think we all hope that in the new year there will be more  bipartisanship. I think there are some areas where we can work  together.   On this issue, though, I think we have some basic disagreements, and  we are still debating those and articulating our differences before we  cast a vote tonight. I have said for a number of weeks now--not months  but certainly weeks--when describing the bill that is before us, the  prior iteration of the bill in the Finance Committee and the version in  the House, that I thought that each one of them had a few things in  common, in my judgment. This is my sense of the overall bill.   First of all, I think every one of these bills has been a giveaway to  the rich or the superrich and a giveaway to profitable corporations. I  think it is excessive. We have a difference of opinion on that.   This is a tax bill, and yet it will have a substantially adverse  impact on health care because of one basic provision that was added in  the last couple of weeks. That provision alone will cause healthcare  premiums to increase by an additional 10 percent a year, and it will  cause 13 million people to lose their healthcare, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, including, by one estimate, 5 million  fewer Americans benefitting from Medicaid. At a time when we should  invest substantially in the middle class and invest in our children,  roads, bridges, schools, scientific research, skills training, and  broadband in rural communities--we can make the list even longer--this  tax bill prevents that from happening in a significant way because of  the giveaways that I talked about to profitable corporations and the  superrich.   This bill will literally pay for a permanent corporate tax cut on the  backs of middle-class families in the next decade. Congress's official  scorekeeper, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, tells us that  in the next decade, meaning the second 10 years that this bill is in  effect, the bill uses hundreds of billions in tax increases on working  families to pay for a permanent corporate rate cut. I will say that  again. In the next decade, taxes go up for you across America, working  families, to pay for a 14-percentage-point cut for profitable  corporations.   This kind of result, where we have a corporate tax break which  increases debt and someone else has to pay for it down the road, is a  result that only a swamp dweller could support, but unfortunately that  is where we are today.   How about for children? There has been a lot of discussion about the  child tax credit. Thankfully, there was debate about that. We don't  talk about children in this body nearly enough or that tax credit, but,  unfortunately, even the proposals by some on the Republican side  weren't adequate enough. Even the ones rejected may not have been  enough. Under this legislation parents of 10 million children in the  lowest income working families will either receive no improvement in  the child tax credit or a token increase of $1 to $75. The last minute  changes to the bill, which got a lot of publicity in the last couple of  days--those last-minute changes to the bill--will do nothing additional  for these families.   Another 14 million children in low- and middle-income working  families would get something by way of the child tax credit but less  than the full $1,000 per child increase that a family making $400,000 a  year would receive. For a fraction of the hundreds of billions of  dollars going to the very wealthy and profitable corporations, we could  have, in this bill, made sure that every low-income parent gets the  full $2,000 per child tax credit, but because of the way the bill is  written, it doesn't allow that to happen for every low-income parent. I  think that would have been a worthy goal of the legislation, but that  is not where we are. To say that is unfair is a vast overstatement. The  families who need it the most aren't getting the full benefit of the  child tax credit increase, but those who are wealthy get an extra  $2,000 of child tax credit.   I mentioned the Joint Committee on Taxation. Let me give you another  way to look at the bill according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.  The JCT estimates that in 2019 alone, the second year the bill is in  effect, were it to pass, more than $36 billion in tax cuts will go to  households worth more than $1 million. That is in the document entitled  JCX-68-17 of the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is a $36 billion cut  for the wealthiest Americans, while over 57 million middle-class  households--my definition for those making under $100,000--will see a  tax increase or tax cut of less than $9 a month in 2019. So for 57  million middle-class households, they will see a tax increase or a tax  cut of less than $9 a month in 2019.   Instead of lining the pockets of the rich with $36 billion in tax  cuts in 2019, that money could have been used to connect Americans to  the internet, especially Americans who live in rural areas. Let me be  precise: 39 percent of the people living in rural America don't have  high-speed internet.    Yes.    I want people to make sure that people know the document.  This is the document, JCX-68-17. If you look at the category of  Americans who are making $100,000 or less--that is 57 million  households who make under $100,000--they would see either a tax  increase of one kind or another or a tax cut of less than $9 a month in  2019.   I don't think that is much help when we consider that it is not as if  that is the only revenue available--that all we can come up with is $9  a month--because I just walked through the other number which is  relevant--the $36 billion that will come in 2019, the second year that  the bill is in effect, going to households worth more than $1 million.   If I had to choose, I would say that we should give all of that $36  billion to middle-income families or folks trying to get to the middle  class or at least a substantial percentage of the $36 billion. I have  been asking for months: Why do people making more than $1 million, that  category of Americans, need $36 billion in tax cuts? I don't think they  do.   It is interesting--I want to commend the work of the ranking member  of the Finance Committee. In some of our debates, one of the numbers  that came out in the last couple of weeks was what has happened to the  top 1 percent since 1980. I said several times that they have had a  bonanza. I didn't have an exact number when I said that; now I do.  Since 1980, the share of national income for these folks in the top 1  percent, which is less than $1 million a year, but it is about $730,000  and up, so that is--the 1 percent goes beyond the millionaires and up.  But since 1980, the top 1 percent have had their share of national  income go up from 11 percent to 20 percent, from 1980 to 2014, so it  has almost doubled. So my point is, they have done pretty well since  1980, so why do a big share of them--meaning the million-dollar-and-up  crowd--why should they get $36 billion in this tax bill? It doesn't  make a lot of sense.   So that is one way to look at it. What we could invest these dollars  in--a bigger tax cut for the middle, a bigger tax cut for those  struggling to get to the middle, working families trying to get to the  middle, or other priorities, such as infrastructure. I mentioned just  one idea on rural broadband. I think rural America should get some help  being connected to the internet. That is one way we could focus on  priorities.   Let me give another example--the estate tax. As many people know,  once fully implemented, this bill doubles the estate tax--it exempts  the first $22 million of inheritance from the tax, which is $11 million  per individual. The cost of doing that will be roughly $9 billion a  year. In the earlier versions of the House and Senate bills, that  number was a lot higher. There was a lot higher revenue loss from the  elimination of the estate tax, but even with the changes, there is  still a revenue loss of an estimated $9 billion a year.   Well, what could we do with $9 billion? Well, in the midst of this  debate about the Children's Health Insurance Program, just for 5 years  of the Children's Health Insurance Program, that is roughly the number  that we need. So 1 year of revenue losses from the estate tax equals 5  years, roughly, of paying for the Children's Health Insurance Program.  And that is not done yet. The Children's Health Insurance Program  expired September 30, and I hope that in the midst of all of this work  on tax policy, we are going to get that done. I know that the  distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, for years, from the  beginning, has been a strong advocate of the Children's Health  Insurance Program, and I commend him for that, but we have to get it  reauthorized in a few short days.   I wanted to talk as well--I know I probably am limited on time, and I  will move quickly--on the Republican budget because you can't really  read the tax changes in isolation; you have to also consider them in  the context of the Republican budget resolution that passed. That  budget proposal, which did pass, proposes to cut Medicaid by $1  trillion over the next 10 years. So that is $1 trillion with a ``t''  for Medicaid. The Republican budget also proposes to cut Medicare by  over $400 billion over the same period, over 10 years. So the proposal  roughly proposes to cut about $1.5 trillion from just Medicare and  Medicaid. All the while, this Republican tax bill contains almost the  same amount of unpaid-for tax cuts.   We heard recently from Speaker Ryan that he wants to ``reform''  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Well, my view of that is, when  they talk about reform in that context, that means cutting--cutting  funding for programs that working men and women of my home State of  Pennsylvania and the country have paid into to ensure that they have  some retirement savings and a safety net for when tragedies and  unforeseen events occur. Some people refer to Social Security and  Medicare as earned benefits because they are. They have earned those  benefits for Social Security and Medicare.   How about outsourcing? The Republican tax bill gives U.S. companies  that offshore jobs a large tax cut on old profits that is unavailable  to companies that kept jobs and production in the United States. This  means that a company that outsourced to Mexico to take advantage of  cheap labor will pay less taxes on accumulated profits than a domestic  company that kept jobs in the United States. In fact, once the bill is  enacted, some profits from an overseas factory may never be taxed in  the United States, while a company that keeps those jobs here could be  taxed at the U.S. corporate tax rate. This disparity could actually  encourage companies to move production and jobs overseas.   We mentioned earlier the tax cut for major corporations. One of the  great leaders of corporate America for many, many years, Jack Bogle of  Vanguard, said the following a few weeks ago. I don't know what  political party Jack Bogle is in, but he said this most recently about  corporate profits:         Corporate profits after taxes last year were the highest       they've ever been in the history of GDP going back to 1929.       And we are thinking of giving relief to the corporations at       the highest levels ever. Individual wages are at the lowest       level in about 15 years as a percent of GDP.    Those are not my words; those are Jack Bogle's words.   So corporations will have a tax windfall to spend on increasing  executive compensation if they want or increasing stock buybacks or  increasing dividends. All this is with absolutely no guarantees that  workers will see benefits from this tax cut, despite assertions by many  here in Washington about what would happen on wages and other benefits.   Mr. President, I have maybe 3 more minutes. I know we are maybe a  little over time.   There has been a little bit of discussion--not enough--about what  happens to the Consumer Price Index, which is used as a baseline for  measuring programs over time. Maybe the most pernicious tax--and that  is the best word for it--in the bill is the so-called Chained CPI,  which alters the way inflation is measured. This bill raises an  estimated $134 billion on the backs of hard-working Americans by  changing how the Tax Code measures inflation--so-called Chained CPI. So  it is the measurement of inflation that is going to change, and that is  going to have an adverse consequence for untold millions of Americans.  This number grows over time. The Joint Committee on  [[Page S8123]]  Taxation told us that this single provision increases taxes by at least  three times as much in the next decade as it did in the first decade-- potentially as high as $400 billion in the second 10 years. This will  be in full force when a lot of young people are entering the workforce.  Someone who is just starting their professional life will see this tax  increase haunt their paychecks for the next 50 years.    There is a lot we could talk about in terms of missed opportunities  here, but let me conclude with this: There is nothing in this bill that  invests in rebuilding America. I thought we would have an opportunity  to do that, as we seemed to be headed that way a couple of years ago,  but we don't have that opportunity with this bill. We could be using  this opportunity to make a substantial investment in roads, bridges,  schools, water systems, or the like, but that won't happen. In our  State, we have 4,500 structurally deficient bridges, and we wish that  we would get some more help in addition to State dollars going for  those.   There is nothing in the bill to expand college affordability and  nothing to ensure that workers' wages increase. Amendments like that  were offered in the committee. It was all Democrats for the amendment  and all Republicans against it.   Those in the middle class and those working to join the middle class  continue to tread water in this bill, while the superrich zoom ahead.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
