 Mr. Chair, we introduced H.R. 8 8 years ago after our  friend and former colleague, Gabby Giffords, was shot and nearly  killed.   When she was by our side to introduce the bill, she said: ``Speaking  is still difficult for me, but I don't think I can make myself more  clear: Congress must act to make our country safer from gun violence.''   Now is that time. We have waited too long to close loopholes that let  people easily avoid background checks through private sales. I have  cried with too many survivors and attended too many funerals. I have  marched with too many student activists, and I have bowed my head  through too many moments of silence.   We know strong gun laws work. In the 25 years since the Brady law  took effect, background checks have stopped more than $3 million in gun  sales and have saved countless lives.   It is time to expand the Brady law. It is time to close the dangerous  loopholes. It is past time for Congress to take action to save lives  from gun violence.   Mr. Chair, this is not a moment of silence. This is not a sit-in.  This is action by the United States House of Representatives on behalf  of everyone who has pled for that action after San Bernardino and after  Sutherland Springs and after Fort Hood and after Virginia Tech and  after Columbine and Sandy Hook and Las Vegas and Pulse and everyday gun  violence in our communities and, yes, after Parkland.   Let's represent the 95 percent of the American people who want us to  take this action to help save lives. Let's pass H.R. 8.
