 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we close out Black History  Month. Last night at the Oscars, we saw ``Moonlight'' win the Best  Picture, which was a real milestone for Black filmmakers. We also saw  Viola Davis, the first African-American woman to win an Oscar, an Emmy,  and a Tony.   We have come a long way since the civil rights era. As a kid in  school, I was intrigued by the period. It is when I first learned about  standing up, fighting for people, for equality against racial  discrimination, and injustices. The struggle is real, and it continues  today.   I am looking forward this weekend to going with one of my civil  rights heroes, Congressman John Lewis, on a Faith and Politics trip to  Selma, Montgomery, and Birmingham. May we learn from history to end the  hatred, divisions, and the injustices that continue.                            ____________________
