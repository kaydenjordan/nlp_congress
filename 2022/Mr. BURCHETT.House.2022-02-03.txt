 Madam Speaker, imagine you are an inventor with a new  idea. You put a lot of time, effort, and money into everything it takes  for your idea to become a reality. Finally, after all your hard work,  you have a successful product. However, a foreign competitor copied  your intellectual property, and your property is now worthless.   This is a serious problem facing American investors, entrepreneurs,  and businesses, and the Chinese Communist Party is typically the  culprit behind intellectual property theft. It is totally wrong that  this happens right under our government's nose, but we haven't done a  daggum thing to stop the exploitation.   House Democrats are putting on the floor a bogus China competition  bill that does nothing to actually solve this problem. In fact, they  even rejected several amendments that address the lack of intellectual  property protections in their bill.   My Trade Related Intellectual Property Protection Act was among the  amendments Democrats rejected. It would require Congress to approve the  sharing of any intellectual property with the World Trade Organization  member states, giving us a chance to make sure Americans' hard work  does not get stolen by the Communist Chinese.   By excluding my commonsense amendment, Democrats missed an  opportunity to make their bill a legitimate response to Communist  China's attacks on America's brightest minds.   Madam Speaker, we are in a race with China to be the world's  technology superpower and we are giving in to the Communist Chinese  wishes.                            ____________________
