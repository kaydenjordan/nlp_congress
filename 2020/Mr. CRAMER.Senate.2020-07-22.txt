 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I, like  the entire staff in the Chamber today and like the Presiding Officer  for most of this time, has endured this for the last hour, an hour that  has been very similar to the hour we had yesterday on the very same  topic and with the very same motion to have the very same amendment  passed in the Defense Authorization Act.   I am a member of the Committee on Armed Services. Prior to the  Presiding Officer, I was presiding. I was honored to sit in that chair  and watch the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services and the  ranking Democrat of the Committee on Armed Services talk in glowing  terms about each other and the bipartisan effort that has led to a  National Defense Authorization Act that has considered 807 amendments  to this point. As we sit here, 40 more amendments--20 by Republicans  and 20 by Democrats--are being hotlined for further consideration for,  hopefully, tomorrow's final passage.   The National Defense Authorization Act has been greatly debated. In  fact, it has been the most debated bill that I have been part of since  I got here. Not only that, the amendments that are represented in this  807 are almost, nearly, equally divided among the two parties  represented in this great Chamber.   What we have been witnessing tonight is a diatribe--in some cases,  fantasy but, in every case, an exaggeration and, in many cases, a  fabrication. The good Senator from Oregon has shown us pictures of what  democracy looks like. I don't disagree. We are self-governed. The  exceptionalism of America is that we are self-governed.   Democracy also demands protocol in this Chamber, the most  deliberative body in this world. Yet, without any warning--without any  heads-up--here we are, dealing with a unanimous consent motion on an  amendment that has already failed to get unanimous consent just in the  last 24 hours on a bill that has already been debated for weeks and  months. It included bipartisan amendments across the board. Then we are  confronted with this breach of not only protocol but of--well, let's  just say--common decency and respect for each other.   I do agree with the Senator from Oregon on this point: He is right in  that we should have the debate, and that is why it is too bad that his  amendment wasn't allowed to be debated in Senator Tim Scott's JUSTICE  Act.   And the reason it couldn't be debated there was because he and most  every one of his colleagues on the Democrat side other than three  filibustered against Tim Scott's police reform bill.   I don't think they want a solution. They want to have this crazy  rhetoric, demagogue all day and all night, wherever they can have a  demagogue, and they want to blame President Donald Trump for the  actions of criminals.   Now, I have heard it all when I have heard, from the Senate floor,  antifa referred to as the anti--what did he call them? The  antifascists. The antifascists. That is the way to sugarcoat thugs.   So for these reasons--and I could think of dozens of others, but I  will spare you all and the staff this late night, getting later--I  object.    I think we have had enough debate. I object.    Mr. President, I don't object.    Mr. President, I am just going to reiterate my final  point one final time, and I promise not to take more time than the  Senator from Oregon.   He had his opportunity to have this amendment considered, debated,  and voted on in the JUSTICE Act, introduced by Senator Tim Scott, a  bill that dealt specifically with police reform.   It would have been the perfect place to have the debate, except that  my colleague voted against cloture so we couldn't even proceed to the  bill.  [[Page S4414]]    I don't know how we could have made it any easier or better. In fact,  when we took up the JUSTICE Act, he and his side were provided at least  20 amendment opportunities. We could have had the debate he seeks  tonight at the appropriate time on the appropriate bill, and I am sorry  that we didn't do that.   Perhaps after tonight's episode, he and his colleagues will  reconsider, and perhaps before we are done this year, Senator Scott's  JUSTICE Act could be brought to the floor and we could have an adult  discussion and debate on amendments and on the bill and on all kinds of  great ideas right here in the most august body in the United States. I  hope that can happen.   With that, I yield the floor and wish you a good night.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for  up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Minot Air Force  Base on the 65th anniversary of its beginning.   On July 12, 1955, Minot, ND, community leaders and area residents  gathered to break ground on land north of the city for what would  become the Minot Air Force Base. One and a half years later, operations  commenced at the base, and personnel and aircraft made their way to  Minot, where they have enhanced our State and defended our Nation ever  since. By the mid-1960s, it was recognized as one of the Nation's  largest military installations, with a population of nearly 19,000  military and civilian men and women and their families. It was also  recognized as having the largest housing village on a military base in  the continental United States, with more than 2,450 homes.   The mission, aircraft, and staff have changed over these past seven  decades. Today, the Minot Air Force Base supports two legs of the  Nation's nuclear triad and provides vital defense to our security. It  is the only dual-wing nuclear-capable installation in the Nation, with  the 5th Bomb Wing and its B-52 bombers and the 91st Missile Wing, along  with Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles.   During these 65 years, the Minot community and State of North Dakota  have remained constant in their support for the thousands of people who  have been stationed at the Minot Air Force Base. We take pride in all  they have done and continue to do to ensure peace throughout our world.  We will continue to stand by them in the years ahead.   To the men and women of the Minot Air Force Base, you and all who  came before you have faithfully served our  [[Page S4416]]  country and lived up to your motto, ``Only The Best Come North.'' Every  day, you go to work carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders,  willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms and keep  us safe. Thank you for all you do to make America great.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of and the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 617.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, July 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 483, S.  4049; finally, that all time during recess, adjournment, morning  business, and leader remarks count postcloture on substitute amendment  No. 2301, as amended.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:55 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, July 23, 2020, at 9:30 a.m.
