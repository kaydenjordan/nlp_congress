 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Dr. Glenn Deibert, who will be retiring as Coastal Pines Technical  College's president at the end of February.   Dr. Deibert has served 27 years in higher education and has served  four of Georgia's technical colleges, including Okefenokee Technical  College, Coastal Pines Technical College, Southwest Georgia Technical  College, and Southern Technical College, formerly known as Swainsboro  Technical College.   Because of his dedication to improving education and the lives of  students, he was recently named one of the Top 100 Most Influential  Georgians by Georgia Trend's yearly publication. This title recognizes  some of the most prestigious folks who have contributed greatly to the  State's success.   Dr. Deibert attended Central High School in Thomasville, Georgia, and  graduated from Thomas Area Technical School, which later became  Southwest Georgia Technical College, so his appreciation for technical  colleges is personal.   Dr. Deibert's work to improve Coastal Pines contributed to record  enrollment at the college for multiple years.   Madam Speaker, I wish him and his family the best of luck as he  begins his retirement, and I am thankful for his many years of  dedication to improving higher education in Georgia's First  Congressional District.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 247, I am not  recorded because of circumstances which caused me to miss the vote. Had  I been present, I would have voted aye.                             personal explanation
