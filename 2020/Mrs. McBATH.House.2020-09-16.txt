Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Over 75 percent of preschool-age children attend some form of early  care and education before reaching kindergarten. For this reason, it is  imperative that we ensure we are providing our children with the best  educators that will give them the best education possible.   The 2014 reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block  Grant--or as we will say today, the CCDBG Act--made changes to the  original 1990 bill, including adding background checks to ensure that  childcare centers receiving funds through the CCDBG are employing  quality professionals.   However, in the 6 years since the reauthorization, barriers to  background check information have hindered the hiring process for  quality childcare providers.   So as of right now, there is no uniform process to share this  information across States. Each State has its own set of laws and  policies, making it harder for childcare providers to gather the  necessary information for the employees that they are hiring.   S. 2683, the Child Care Protection Improvement Act of 2020, would  create an interagency task force that will identify the obstacles in  the background check process and recommend best practices to overcoming  them.   When children attend safe, high-quality, early care and education  programs, they develop the skills that help them succeed in school and  in the future.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 2683. We must do everything that  we can to ensure the safety of our children. Families deserve to know  that their kids are being cared for by qualified providers.   Before we close out, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Van  Taylor, Cindy Axne, Fred Keller, and Abby Finkenauer for working with  me to introduce the House companion for this bipartisan legislation.   It is so great that we were able to work together to keep our  children safe, set them up for educational success, and ensure our  qualified childcare providers have access to the opportunities they  have worked so hard for.   I also thank the Education and Labor Committee staff for their hard  work of helping us advance this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
