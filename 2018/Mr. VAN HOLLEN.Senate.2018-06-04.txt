 Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the  dedication of Silver Creek Middle School, SCMS, in Kensington, MD as it  completes its inaugural year. SCMS opened on September 5, 2017, for 550  students in sixth and seventh grade.   Students from Chevy Chase Elementary, North Chevy Chase Elementary,  and Rock Creek Forest Elementary now attend SCMS. In recognition of the  combination of students from three different elementary schools, SCMS  dedicated its inaugural year to community building and has worked hard  to create a strong sense of unity and common purpose.   Before the 2017-18 school year began, SCMS organized three community  summer socials at parents' residences. More than 200 parents  participated in these events and helped cultivate a supportive network  before their students had even arrived at school. In addition, SCMS  students and parents have organized two cleanups of nearby Silver  Creek, for which the school is named. Students, teachers, and parents  collaborated in these efforts to protect our environment.   In addition to community building, SCMS focuses on a global and  holistic education. SCMS is an International Baccalaureate, IB, school  with a Middle Years Programme. This program allows students to engage  across cultures and subject areas to develop their self-understanding  and a sense of their relationships to others and our society.   I am proud that Silver Creek Middle School is committed to a quality  education and a collaborative educational environment for all of its  students. I commend the dedicated faculty and staff at SCMS for all  they do to help each of their students achieve his or her full  potential. The Silver Creek Middle School community has my best wishes  for a productive learning experience for many years to come.                            ____________________
