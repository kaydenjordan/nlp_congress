 Madam President, today I wish to recognize the  outstanding contributions of an organization based in my hometown of  Brunswick, ME. This year marks the 55th anniversary of Independence  Association, and I could not be more grateful to everyone who has  contributed to the organization's work to enrich our community by  serving children and adults with developmental disabilities. For over  half a century, Independence Association has helped individuals rise to  their full potential, growing up and out as fully included, fully  valued members of their communities. Their work, their creativity, and  their contributions make all of us better.   The Independence Association we know today has changed over the  decades. Its inception dates back to 1967--a time in which  institutionalization was still prevalent--when five families founded  the Youth Development Center to chart a different course for their  children. The Youth Development Center immediately demonstrated that  the right people, resources, and support made an inclusive and  independent life a reality for their children, and they soon welcomed  others with additional needs as well. That organization grew and, in  1977, became Independence Association; since then, its staff,  volunteers, and parents have gone on to empower hundreds of people with  disabilities to enjoy enriching lives in the Maine communities we all  love.   Over the last 55 years, Independence Association has continued to be  creative, collaborative, and comprehensive in supporting their clients'  ever-evolving needs. Even during a pandemic, faced with severe staffing  shortages, a challenging hiring environment, and stagnant reimbursement  rates, Independence Association remains committed to the more than 400  clients they support and the hundreds of people they employ.   The staff, volunteers, and community partners of Independence  Association  [[Page S2890]]  have expanded over the years, and they now offer a full range of  services in nine Maine counties and more than 60 Maine cities and  towns. Their services range from Spindleworks--a nationally recognized  artist's collaboration, which created the State of Maine ornament for  the White House Christmas tree in 2017--to single-level ``Aging in  Place'' lifetime housing. Independence Association also provides  transportation for clients who have jobs or volunteer commitments,  skills training for community life, case management services, and  boundless opportunities for growth and support.   As a champion of all people, Independence Association has grown and  adapted with the ever-changing needs of their clients. Their vision of  empowering people with disabilities has never waned, and our State is  stronger because of their work. I join with the people of Maine in  thanking Independence Association for its passionate caring,  commitment, and unwavering service to our communities and look forward  to their continued impact on our State.                            ____________________
