 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the aftermath of Las Vegas is a time for  this Senator to reflect on whether a shooting is like Mateen's, in the  Orlando nightclub, where he was motivated as a terrorist, and then  there was the remarkable recovery of Congressman Scalise in the  attempted killing of Scalise by a shooter who was motivated by  politics, and then there is the massive massacre in Las Vegas,  apparently by a shooter who was mentally deranged in some form. The  fact is, massive amounts of ammunition with high-caliber, rapid-fire  assault weapons is making this easier for whatever the motivation of  the shooter is. As a result, you get to the point of, how many more of  these do we have before you say enough is enough?   That leads to the subject of politics. When does humanity overtake  the divisiveness of our politics so we can come together and have a  commonsense discussion about what should be done? Because if we don't,  and humanity does not overtake our politics, we will continue, and it  will be more of the same.   So I ask--I yearn for that public but also private discussion with  our colleagues because going down this road over and over again is not  going to be the answer, and we ought to say enough is enough.   (The remarks of Mr. Nelson pertaining to the introduction of S. 1907  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am the Senator from Florida, along with  my colleague Marco Rubio. We, of course, have been at the forefront of  this terrible tragedy that is going on in Puerto Rico, and I want to  comment on that.   By the way, speaking of bipartisanship, there is a good example.  Senator Rubio and I, when our State was hit by Irma, spent 3 days,  going around together, showing that we were shoulder to shoulder trying  to help Floridians overcome the tragedy that had just befallen them. We  dished out food together. We went and surveyed the floods. We went into  the poor, little cities. We went and thanked university students who  had rescued the elderly, the frail, when they were abandoned. We went  all across the State. The day after the storm, we went first into the  Keys to see the destruction there. Senator Rubio and I have been joined  at the hip.   When it comes to looking at what is happening in Puerto Rico, it is  pretty obvious. Last week, a week had passed since the storm. In fact,  the supplies were stacking up, but they were stacking up in the ports.  They were not able to get out into the interior of the island. The two  of us were pretty strong in our words; that you have to get the most  capable organization in to do that when in fact it is almost like  combat conditions, and that is the U.S. military.   Finally, Wednesday night of last week, they sent me a three-star  general who started to get it organized. Now we are seeing it  distributed out, but it is going to take more because it is an island  that is just absolutely devastated. It is going to take a long time to  recover, and it is going to take a lot more money.   Remember, these are our fellow American citizens. We saw the  devastation in Florida. Now the continuing hardship is being tolled in  Puerto Rico. It is a population where half are without drinking water,  only 5 percent--and this is 2 weeks after the storm--of the electricity  grid is restored, and cash is in short supply.   Whereas, in Florida we saw the flooded streets, the downed trees, the  crushed cars, the flipped over mobile homes, limited access to critical  supplies like gasoline. Property damage was everywhere, and it was the  entire State. What we are seeing is--multiply that many fold, and that  is what we are seeing in Puerto Rico.   We are working on a supplemental funding bill. Remember that right  after the first storm in Texas, we passed a $15 billion emergency  supplemental appropriations bill. That is going to run out within the  next few days so we have to have another supplemental funding bill.   As you can imagine, now it is not just Texas and Florida, but it is  the Virgin Islands, it is Puerto Rico, and there are some other States  as well. We are going to need to help the people cover the cost of  recovery, and we are going to need to jump-start the local economy in  those areas hardest hit by the storms.   Today I am going to introduce a piece of legislation. I call it the  National Disaster Tax Relief Act, which would give people affected by  these storms some much needed tax relief. This is in the shadow of the  conversations taking place, as we speak, in a hearing--which I have  just come from--in the Finance Committee about future reform of the  Federal Tax Code.   The bill I am introducing today would do four things: One, it would  let businesses and farmers immediately write off their cleanup costs,  not just their replacement costs.   For example, the Florida citrus growers in the central part of the  State--and it was finally going to be a good news story on our citrus  crop--half of the citrus buffeted by the wind is on the ground.   Go further south into Southwest Florida, 75 percent of the citrus is  on the ground. What this would do is allow the citrus growers to be  able to, in the first year, write off the costs--expenses, in other  words--of removing the downed trees, not just the cost of a new tree.  That is especially important to citrus growers all over the United  States because they are already hurting from a plant disease, a  bacteria known as greening, which kills the citrus tree in 5 years.   Therefore, there are a number of these groves that have been  abandoned, but it is valuable land. We need to give an incentive to the  citrus grower to be able to go in and plow under that citrus growth and  replant--the immediate expensing of that plowing under, plus the  replanting of what we think are hardier varieties of citrus that are  more resistant to this disease, this bacteria called greening. We think  that would be a huge incentive to try to save the citrus industry not  only in my State but in Texas, Arizona, California. There is citrus  also in Louisiana and some in other Southern States.   The second thing the bill does is it gives taxpayers the ability to  exempt State and local disaster mitigation payments from Federal taxes,  and it lets them save for the next big storm tax-free. That would be in  a catastrophe savings account.   It would allow people to save tax-free $150,000 to cover things not  covered by insurance. In Southwest Florida, there are a lot of seawalls  that cave in, seawalls that are extremely expensive to rebuild and  repair. This tax-free account would allow them to put away savings for  that and other kinds of costs of remediation. They go out, and they try  to save their home by getting tarps on the roof, making certain repairs  until they can get the replacement, and the insurance can pay for it.  Expensing of those items in the Tax Code would certainly be that  incentive.   The bill also includes extra infrastructure financing for areas  damaged by the storms; for example, help for low-income housing needs  and other infrastructure needs that are so important to economic  recovery.  [[Page S6290]]    The fourth thing the bill does is it includes tax incentives for  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and extends tax benefits that are  available on the mainland but not in the territories like the full  child tax credit.   Why should we treat our American citizens in a territory any  differently taxwise on a child tax credit than we treat our citizens on  the mainland, the main 50 States? It shouldn't be. It doesn't make  sense.   What is happening in Puerto Rico should concern every American.  Governor Rossello has warned of a humanitarian crisis if we do not  quickly move to alleviate this situation.   The Coast Guard is working with FEMA and others to bring in drinking  water and other critical supplies as well. Additional work is being  done to restore power. Generators are being shipped in to help manage  the load at the airport, and there are 30 flights per day now, which is  projected to grow to 60 flights in the coming days. Meanwhile, as the  evacuations continue, we don't want to leave Puerto Rico in tatters. We  have to rebuild. That is going to be an expensive cost to pay.    As we are going into a supplemental package for all of these storm- affected areas, and since the utilities in Puerto Rico were so out-of- date and so arcane, let's think creatively. In remote villages, let's  supply photovoltaic cells to generate electricity as a backup because  another storm is going to come and the power lines are going to go  down. Let's think creatively as we help these areas rebuild.   We are working on this supplemental package to get additional aid to  those suffering, and I am hopeful that what I have suggested here as a  tax incentive will be a part of that conversation. Our country is  hurting. We should be doing everything we can to help it heal.   Now, not only are we healing from coming out of some ferocious  storms, but now we have another grim reminder that, in America, we are  not treating each other as we would want to be treated. Something is  wrong in the psyche of some, so that whatever the motivation is, there  would be mass execution. I hope we will soon have a very serious  conversation about the direction of this country.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED:   S. 1912.
