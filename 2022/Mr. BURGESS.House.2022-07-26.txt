 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neguse for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of three bills,  three bills that are unnecessarily partisan, but that is where we are.   The first bill, H.R. 5118, attempts to address the wildfires raging  across the country. Calendar year 2022 is shaping up to be the most  destructive wildfire year on record. To date, 5 million acres in the  United States have been ravaged by forest fires.   Concerningly, risk projections compiled by the United States Forest  Service have assessed that large swaths of the country will remain  under the threat of wildfires for the remainder of this year.   Forest fires are responsible for the destruction of lives and  property. They are responsible for the degradation of our air and water  quality and the destruction of vibrant natural ecosystems and wildlife.  They are also responsible for billions of dollars in damages to States  and individuals.   Perhaps the most distressing component of the proliferation in  intensity of forest fires is that some forest fires are entirely  preventable. A major contributor is decades of poor forest management  that have exacerbated forest fires.   Environmental activists and their allies have made routine forest  management all but impossible. Their campaign of legal obstruction has  directly contributed to the current wildfire and forest health crisis.  It is perplexing to see organizations that ostensibly are dedicated to  protection of natural habitats instead engaging in an obstruction that  has made safeguarding our habitats all the more difficult.   Unfortunately, H.R. 5118 is a package of 48 bills from many different  committees, but only 9 of these bills have received a committee markup.  For example, this bill includes provisions related to the electrical  grid, environmental justice, and the health effects of wildfire smoke,  all things that are not immediately necessary to fight wildfires.   The United States Forest Service has demonstrated that there are  scientific and environmentally sound solutions to mitigate the damage  of forest fires. If we allow the United States Forest Service to  actually do their jobs, we can create healthier, more resilient natural  habitats that all Americans can enjoy and from which all Americans can  derive benefit.   Second, H.R. 6929, the Susan Muffley Act, is a $1 billion taxpayer- paid bailout of privately run pension plans that have been absorbed by  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation after Delphi, a spinoff of  General Motors, went into bankruptcy.   The benefits guaranteed by the PBGC under the plan insurance  termination program are subject to statutory maximums. When the PBGC  became the trustee, participants in Delphi Salaried Pension Plan,  approximately 20,000 employees, were subject to these statutory benefit  limitations.   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's maximum benefit guarantee  for that pension was terminated in 2009, and it is $4,500 a month or  $54,000 per year for retirees who began receiving pensions at age 65.  Of the 20,000 salaried plan participants, 72 percent were not affected  by the benefit guarantee limit.   Prior to the 2009 bankruptcy of General Motors and of Delphi, General  Motors made an agreement to top-up potential benefit losses for certain  Delphi unionized employees represented by the United Auto Workers.  General Motors honored that agreement, and those unionized employees  were not subject to the same benefit losses caused by the statutory  limits.   This bill could create a significant precedent in the single-employer  pension system by allowing a taxpayer-funded increase for 1 of over  5,000 terminated single-employer PBGC trusteed plans. It would also  create an expectation that Congress will do the same with current and  future terminated plans.   Here is the deal: This bill had no committee hearings, no markups,  and no input from committee Republicans. Instead of working on  appropriations, the majority has decided to use this last week in July  to allow some of their Members to take home a win before the August  recess.   Lastly, H.R. 3771, the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and  Research Act of 2022 takes an important public health issue and makes  it partisan. The Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans have  repeatedly expressed concerns with the South Asian Heart Health  Awareness and Research Act throughout the entire legislative process.  The bill did not receive a single Republican vote in committee.   Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the United States.  Republicans don't disagree with the need to undertake the research  proposed in H.R. 3771. In fact, the Energy and Commerce Committee has a  history of supporting research on heart disease for at-risk  populations, including South Asian communities. Unfortunately,  [[Page H7137]]  this bill will not help address the burden of cardiovascular health  issues in America.   This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to  make grants promoting awareness of heart disease in disproportionately  affected communities. This, in fact, is a duplicative authorization  that will deepen the CDC's already problematic mission creep.   There are 24 programs currently at CDC, all of which are funded in  the 2023 Labor-HHS Appropriations bills. Some have expired  authorizations dating back to 1998. The CDC should be focusing on  addressing emerging diseases instead of authorizing duplicative  programs.   The CDC has repeatedly demonstrated that it does not have the  bandwidth to deal with its current responsibilities. I believe this  clear lack of mission and focus on infectious diseases has  significantly contributed to the CDC's failure, yes, of coronavirus and  now of monkeypox.   Furthermore, the CDC doesn't even want this authorization. When  providing the required technical feedback on the bill, the CDC  expressed concerns that the authorized grants are, in fact,  duplicative. The agency also expressed concerns that it would not be  able to provide the data required by the bill.   I am uncertain what effect, if any, this bill will have on  communities disproportionately impacted by poor cardiovascular outcomes  when the partisan government funding bill released by the House  Appropriations Committee will already be providing nearly $4 billion to  the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.   By creating this one-time authorization of a million dollars to  establish an internet clearinghouse on evidence-based heart research  and treatment options for South Asian communities, this bill merely  serves as an earmark. As Members of Congress, it is our job to examine  government programs to determine whether, in fact, they are effective  and producing positive outcomes for the American people.   The South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act should not  move forward. This bill is unnecessary, and it is never going to see  the light of day in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  amend the rule to immediately consider a resolution expressing support  for United  [[Page H7138]]  States Border Patrol agents introduced by Representative   Michael  Guest.   President Biden's border crisis is demoralizing our border agents.  Charged with securing our southern border, these agents are rescuing  women and children left to die by traffickers, they are confronting the  drug trade, combating gang violence, all while attempting to perform  their usual duties in the face of over 3 million undocumented  crossings.   Instead of supporting these brave men and women, the Biden  administration has, instead, turned them into political pawns. As we  saw in the fall of 2021, Democrats, including the President, the Vice  President, and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security,  all were involved in a rush to judgment and publicly accused Border  Patrol agents of criminal wrongdoing in Del Rio, Texas.   Despite being cleared by the Department of Homeland Security's  Inspector General and Customs and Border Protection's Office of  Professional Responsibility, the administration still seeks to punish  these agents in order to justify their initial criticism, all the while  continuing President Biden's open border agenda.   It is time for the House to stand with the Border Patrol by  denouncing these false claims and supporting their mission of securing  the border.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest) to explain his amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, we just heard a lot about wanting to right  wrongs. Well, here is an opportunity to right a wrong. You can vote  ``no'' on the previous question and allow this wrong to be corrected.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I oppose the bills in this rule because they  were crafted outside of regular order without significant Republican  input.   I had hoped we could produce legislation that would mitigate and  contain the scourge of forest fires that continue to plague our Nation.  This bill does not provide for responsible forest management, those  forest management solutions that have been demonstrated to be  effective. For that reason, I oppose H.R. 5118.   Additionally, Congress should not be authorizing taxpayer dollars to  bail out privately run pension plans above the statutory maximum. It is  unfortunate that Delphi overpromised and under-delivered for its  employees, but allowing a taxpayer-funded increase for a terminated,  single-employer pension would set a significant precedent for the over  5,000 similar pensions managed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation.   Then finally, addressing cardiovascular disease is a nonpartisan  public health issue, however, Congress should be conducting of  oversight of the Centers for Disease Control, not authorizing another  duplicative program. Our goal should be to reduce the duplication and  be more intentional with the funding in order to achieve positive  outcomes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, a ``no''  on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.
