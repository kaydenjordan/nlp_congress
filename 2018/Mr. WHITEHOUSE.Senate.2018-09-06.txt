 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, the swearing in of the Rhode  Island Legislature early next year will close a remarkable story of a  great Rhode Island family. State Senator Paul Fogarty is retiring after  20 years in office. The Fogarty family of northern Rhode Island will  have represented nearly 80 years of public service.   Paul was elected in 1998 to fill the State senate seat that was  previously held by his brother, Charles Fogarty, Jr. A master plumber  by trade, Paul rose to become the chairman of the senate labor  committee. Like his brother Charlie, Paul had served on the Glocester,  RI, town council before serving in the legislature.   Charlie Fogarty got his start in State government working as an aide  to Governor Joe Garrahy in the late 1970s. While a State senator, he  served as both majority whip and senate president pro tempore. He was  elected Lieutenant Governor twice, in 1998 and in 2002. He is  remembered for starting a Christmastime tradition, Operation Holiday  Cheer, which delivers care packages of Rhode Island mementos to  servicemembers deployed overseas.   In 2006, Charlie won the Democratic nomination for Governor, narrowly  losing to the incumbent. He returned to government a few years later to  run the State department of labor and training, where he cracked down  on unemployment fraud. In 2015, Governor Gina Raimondo appointed  Charlie director of the Rhode Island Department of Elderly Affairs.  Under his leadership, the State expanded support for Meals on Wheels,  and he played an important role in the State's successful repeal of the  tax that seniors paid on their Social Security benefits.   Charlie retired earlier this year, after four decades of service to  the people of Rhode Island.   Paul and Charlie's cousins shared the public service gene. Ray  Fogarty was a State representative from Glocester for 10 years. He  would go on to find and lead the Rhode Island Export Assistance Center  at Bryant University's John H. Chafee Center for International  Business.   Ray's brother Edward Fogarty was an accomplished lawyer, with whom I  worked in the State house. He worked as an arbitrator in the Rhode  Island Superior Court and clerked in the U.S. District Court for the  District of Rhode Island. However, Ed will best be remembered for his  work serving as legal counsel to the speaker of the Rhode Island House  of Representatives, to the senate majority leader, and later to the  senate president. Ed retired in 2013 and sadly passed away in 2017.   Charlie Fogarty credited his parents with teaching him that ``public  service was a public trust.'' Indeed, he and brother Paul followed in  their father's footsteps. Charles Fogarty, Sr., had been a State  senator from Glocester before them and served for a time as director of  the Rhode Island Small Business Administration.   Paul and Charlie's uncle was Congressman John Fogarty, who  represented Rhode Island in the U.S. House of Representatives for more  than a quarter century. John was a bricklayer and president of Rhode  Island's International Bricklayers Union local No. 1 before being  elected to Congress at age 27. From his post on the Appropriations  Subcommittee for Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare, Mr. Public  Health, as he became known, championed the expansion of health research  in the United States. During his tenure, the National Institutes of  Health grew from a small agency with only three named institutes--for  cancer, heart, and dental research--to a larger and more sophisticated  operation with institutes devoted to research on mental health, allergy  and infectious disease, neurological disease, arthritis and metabolic  disease, child health and development, and general medical sciences. As  subcommittee chairman during the passage of the Social Security  amendments of 1965, John Fogarty was one of the key supporters of the  legislation that created the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.   John served until his death in 1967. Dr. Howard Rusk wrote in the New  York Times, ``No one in the history of this country has done more to  promote more and better health services, more and better health  facilities, and more and better health research than Representative  Fogarty.'' In Rhode Island, no fewer than five health and educational  facilities have been dedicated in John Fogarty's name.   The deep commitment of the Fogarty family to the public welfare,  instilled across generations, has been borne out in countless ways.  Paul's son Brendan Fogarty even worked as a State senate page during  high school and college. For now, there will be no Fogartys in State  government. Our State and our Nation are all the richer for their  passion and dedication to public life. Rhode Islanders are grateful for  the lasting legacy of the Fogartys of Glocester.                            ____________________
