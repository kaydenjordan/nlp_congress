 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask that you all  join me in wishing Burdett Loomis a speedy recovery.   You may not know Bird, unless you took a political science class at  the University of Kansas anytime in the last 40 years, in which case he  was probably your favorite professor. Or maybe you would know him from  his decades as the KU Washington Semester coordinator, helping students  gain real-world experience at various organizations and congressional  offices here in D.C.   Regular followers of Kansas politics and government will, of course,  know him for his insight, wit, and frequent interviews and columns in  the local news.   He is an irreplaceable member of our community whose contributions  are too numerous for me to list in my short time here. He has been a  trusted friend and adviser to many Kansas officials over the years, and  I am personally grateful for his guidance throughout my time in  Congress and his unconditional dedication to the State of Kansas and  the well-being of its democracy.   Bird has a huge community wishing him well. From students to Senators  and so many in between, we look forward to seeing you soon and are  keeping you in our thoughts.                            ____________________
