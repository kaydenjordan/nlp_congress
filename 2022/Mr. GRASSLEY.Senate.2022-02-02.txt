 Madam President, this week, news reports made public a  May 2019 subpoena from the Justice Department. That subpoena requested  financial records relating to Hunter Biden as part of the Department's  criminal investigation into his activities.   Notably, that subpoena also requested records relating to James  Biden, Devon Archer, and Eric Schwerin. That subpoena sought records  relating to companies that Senator Johnson and I discussed in our Biden  report.   If the reports are accurate, this subpoena is yet another stake in  the heart of a totally unsubstantiated claim made by the liberal media  and Democrats that the Grassley-Johnson report on Biden was Russia  disinformation.   Today, I come here to speak about a matter directly related to the  recent news--specifically, the Biden Justice Department's failure to  answer fundamental questions related to Hunter's criminal  investigation.   I have asked serious ethical questions of the Justice Department that  the Department so far has refused to answer. In fact, the Department  has actually publicly contradicted itself.   Just one example of contradiction: On May 31, 2021, Senator Johnson  and I wrote to Attorney General Garland. Our letter noted that Hunter  Biden had a close association with Patrick Ho, an individual who is  associated with the  [[Page S480]]  communist Chinese Government and its intelligence services. Patrick Ho  was also charged and convicted of international bribery and money  laundering offenses relating to his work for companies connected to  that communist regime.   After his arrest, his first call was reportedly to James Biden,  President Biden's brother. Hunter Biden reportedly represented Patrick  Ho for $1 million.   In our letter, we noted that a Justice Department Federal court  filing said DOJ had FISA information on Patrick Ho. Not only did they  possess this information, the Department informed the court that they  intended to use it to prosecute that person.   Senator Johnson and I asked the Justice Department for that FISA  information as well as FISA information for other Chinese nationals  linked to Hunter Biden. In response, I quote the Justice Department:         Unfortunately, under the circumstances described in your       letter, we aren't in a position to confirm the existence of       the information that is sought (if it exists in the       Department's possession).    Now, get that--``if it exists in the Department's possession.''   Simply put, that is not a true and accurate statement unless the  Department's statement to the Federal court in the Patrick Ho matter  wasn't true and accurate.   So, then, as we naturally followed up, on November 15, 2021, we asked  Attorney General Garland to explain the discrepancy. No response to  this very day.   Both statements can't be true. Either the Department possesses the  information or it doesn't possess the information.   So we can legitimately ask Attorney General Garland again: What is  your answer?   Now, this doesn't end there with that question. On February 3, 2021,  and March 9, 2021, Senator Johnson and I asked Attorney General Garland  if Nicholas McQuaid is recused from the Hunter Biden criminal case.  Now, this McQuaid works in the Department's Criminal Division but  worked with Hunter Biden's criminal attorneys before joining the  Department. This poses a clear conflict of interest. Attorney General  Garland has refused to answer to this very day.   On June 29, 2021, Senator Johnson and I asked Attorney General  Garland whether Susan Hennessey, a National Security Division employee,  is recused from the Durham investigation. Before working for the  Department, she made negative comments about the Durham investigation.   In Attorney General Garland's July 13, 2021, response letter, he  failed to answer our questions. However, at the Senate Judiciary  Committee's oversight hearing October 27, 2021, the Attorney General  said she ``has nothing whatsoever to do with the Durham  investigation.''   Although this statement doesn't fully answer our questions, such as  whether she has been formally recused from the matter, it is more than  what we were provided in the Department's letter response.   Likewise, the Justice Department said that Margaret Goodlander ``has  no role in Mr. Durham's investigation.'' She is married to Biden's  National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. Sullivan worked for the  Clinton Presidential campaign. While there, he peddled the false Alfa- Bank story about the Trump Organization having a secret back channel to  this Russian bank. Those false allegations were reviewed as part of  Crossfire Hurricane.   Now, with all that said, let's take stock of where we are. On the one  hand, Attorney General Garland has publicly said Susan Hennessey and  Margaret Goodlander have no roles in the Durham investigation. On the  other hand, Attorney General Garland refuses to say the same for  McQuaid and the Hunter Biden criminal investigation.   So we can really ask, ``Why is it that way? Why won't the Attorney  General say that McQuaid has no role in the criminal case involving the  President's son?'' because this is a fundamental ethical question.   Our letters have provided Attorney General Garland the opportunity to  hit the ball right out of the park. Instead, he doesn't even try to  make a swing.   What is the Biden Justice Department hiding? This blatantly  inconsistent treatment has cast a cloud over Hunter Biden's criminal  case.   Just imagine if this fact pattern had evolved between President Trump  and his sons. The media would have gone nuts over it. You wouldn't hear  the end of it--also from my Democratic colleagues here in the Senate.  Yet not a sound from them, not a peep.   The American people are rightly skeptical of how the Justice  Department is handling the Hunter Biden criminal investigation. And the  secrecy and the lack of public transparency will only increase the  skepticism that the American people have.   So I and Senator Johnson won't stop doing good government oversight  on this issue. The American people deserve answers, one way or another.
