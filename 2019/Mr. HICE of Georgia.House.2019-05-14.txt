 Mr. Speaker, the threat to religious liberty and  religious toleration in the People's Republic of China is of grave  concern. Over the past several years there has been an ever increasing  intolerance of religious minorities.   Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China  guarantees the freedom of religious belief. Yet the rights and safety  of religious minorities in the country are very much in question.   China is the home to nearly 90 million Christians, and the country is  anticipated to be home to the most Christians in the world by 2030.  Yet, over the last several years, the percentage of persecution cases  have risen year over year. Furthermore, the government has increasingly  required churches to be state approved, churches have been razed and  worshippers subjected to detainment, physical interrogation, and  thought reform conditioning.   In the west, in Xinjiang Province, the United Nations has reported  the government to be holding roughly one million Uygurs without charge.  Those who have escaped have testified to being repeatedly told that God  did not exist and that they would only be fed after acknowledging the  greatness of communism.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage this Congress and our President to take  appropriate actions to promote religious freedom of religious  minorities in the People's Republic of China.                            ____________________
