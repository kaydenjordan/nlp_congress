 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Congresswoman Ros- Lehtinen's amendment No. 110 to the State and Foreign Operations  appropriations bill, and I appreciate the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho) for taking leadership on this as well.   This amendment would prohibit funds from contributing to a number of  United Nations agencies that endlessly single out our ally, the State  of Israel, for poor treatment.   There are numerous issues with these agencies, but as for UNRWA, the  very size of the agency is an underlying problem. UNRWA was created to  address the short-term needs of refugees, but it has perpetuated the  problem.   As of July 1, 2014, UNRWA had 30,252 employees for 5\1/2\ million  registered persons in a number of Middle Eastern countries and  territories, compared to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees staff of  7,700 in 2013, which provides support for 42.9 million refugees in more  than 100 countries. The proportion is just way out of scale when you  compare those kinds of agencies. UNRWA is out of control.   Additionally, UNRWA's grounds have been used to store rockets. Israel  has been fired upon from UNRWA facilities, and UNRWA has employed  individuals affiliated with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.  These are just a few examples of how U.N. agencies have mismanaged  funds. It is unacceptable that American taxpayer dollars contribute to  this problem.   I thank the Congressman and Congresswoman for offering this important  amendment, and I hope that my colleagues support it so that the United  Nations can get to helping individuals who need it the most.    Mr. Chairman, I also applaud the leadership of  Representative Gaetz on this important amendment No. 113 to the State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill.   This commonsense amendment prohibits American taxpayer dollars from  supporting Palestinian elementary schools that are named for  Palestinian terrorists who have murdered innocent human beings. Many of  these terrorists have murdered children who are no different than the  very children in the schools named after them.   Dalal Mughrabi, as was mentioned earlier, a Palestinian terrorist,  blew herself up on a bus in 1978, killing 37 Israelis, including 13  children. Her name is plastered on countless elementary schools, summer  camps, and memorials around Palestinian Authority-controlled  territories in Israel.   I applaud Denmark, Norway, and other countries that have frozen funds  from U.N.-affiliated Palestinian organizations that name their  buildings after terrorists like Dalal Mughrabi.   The United States Congress should have undivided moral clarity on  this issue in this year's appropriations bill. We cannot use taxpayer  dollars to fund Palestinian incitement to murder innocents, and that is  why I introduced legislation to stop sending American aid to the  Palestinian Authority until they end their practice of financially  supporting terrorists and the families of terrorists. We must end U.S.  contributions to the PA's campaign of incitement wherever we find it.   I thank Mr. Gaetz for offering this important amendment, and I hope  it passes with unanimous support, as it should.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:                          limitation on use of funds         Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement or enforce the threatened species or       endangered species listing of any plant or wildlife that has       not undergone a review as required by section 4(c)(2) of the       Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(2)).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It simply ensures that  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is following current law,  specifically section 4(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act, by  conducting a review of all threatened and endangered plants and  wildlife at least once every 5 years.   Time after time, the Federal Government refuses to follow the  original intent of the Endangered Species Act. The government  designates land as critical habitat despite not meeting the ESA  definition, and the government consistently refuses to remove plants  and animals from threatened or endangered status even when these  species are flourishing and are no longer in need of ESA protections.   But you may ask yourself: How does the government know when the  species should be removed from the endangered or threatened list? How  does the government know if a species is recovering? The answer can be  found in the ESA and its requirement that the Federal Government review  all plants or species that are currently listed as endangered or  threatened every 5 years.   Under the act, the purpose of a 5-year review is to ensure that  threatened or endangered species have the appropriate level of  protection. The reviews assess each threatened and endangered species  to determine whether its status has changed since the time of its  listing or its last status review and whether its status should be  changed or maintained.   Because the act grants extensive protection to a species, including  harsh penalties for landowners and other citizens, it makes sense to  regularly verify if a plant or animal is being properly classified or  should be delisted. Despite this commonsense requirement, the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service has acknowledged that it has neglected its  responsibility to conduct the required reviews for hundreds of listed  species.   By enforcing the 5-year review--which is in the law--my amendment  will ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is using the best  available and most current scientific information in implementing its  responsibilities under that act, including incorporating new  information through public comment and assessing ongoing conservation  efforts.   Now, I am sure you will hear the ranking member say that the problem  is that there is simply not enough money to comply with the law, but  the reality is that megasettlements and overzealous regulators have  caused the number of species listed under the endangered species list  to balloon to unmanageable levels. For the recovery of a threatened or  endangered species or plant to be successful, we must prioritize our  limited resources to where they are most critically needed.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service complies with the ESA and that we do not provide  money in this bill that would violate current law. This exact amendment  was added to the fiscal year '16 Interior Appropriations bill by voice  vote and was added to the fiscal year '17 bill by a bipartisan rollcall  vote.   Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to support this amendment for the third  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Colorado is right. We  have had this conversation in this Chamber, Mr. Chair, before. The  Service does attempt to comply with the statutory mandate and to review  the status of listed species every 5 years to determine whether or not  it is classified as threatened or endangered.   It is correct. The Service has a backlog in reviews due to funding  limitations. This year it is a 17 percent listing reduction contained  in this bill so that they have been working on the backlog. But the  Service still has only been able to complete 100 to 120 reviews per  year, which is half of what is needed.   So in this bill, you and I might agree that there are things that  could happen and that money isn't always the solution to a problem, but  in this bill you might be surprised to know that it has cut another  $3.4 million, so that only builds up the backlog all the more.   That is not necessarily the fault of the chairman of the  subcommittee, Mr. Chair. It is just the fact that the allocation that  our subcommittee had to work with, tough choices had to be made. I know  that the chairman was trying to balance a lot of things.   The gentleman talked about the court and the environment. I would  love to have a conversation with the gentleman more about that, because  it is my understanding--and I want to make sure I have it correct  before we go into depth about it because, as the gentleman knows, we  have a good relationship, and I want to make sure that I am correct  when I say things--that actually some of the things that have been  happening in court have actually helped to reduce some of the costs  that the gentleman is thinking about because it is in place.   I will get the information, Mr. Chair, and share it with the  gentleman later.   But the fact is that this amendment would not remove species without  review from the list of species protected by the ESA so that the ESA's  prohibition, again, would still remain, and it still would be the  ability of citizens to sue or force compliance even with what the  gentleman is proposing. So funding cannot be used to enforce the ESA  for species with late reviews; it is going to leave the species  unprotected.   Proposed language would prohibit the Service from working with the  agencies. It would prohibit working with developers and landowners to  comply, compliance to section 7 consultations or section 10 permits for  Federal and private projects that could potentially affect the species.  So as you can see, the other thing it doesn't do is the proposed  language would not affect the ability of third parties to sue those  agencies or landowners.  [[Page H7179]]    So I agree with the gentleman that we need to do a better job of  making sure that these reviews are done in a timely fashion. I agree  that, when a species has attained a classification where it is no  longer threatened or it is no longer endangered, it should come off. So  I think we have a lot in common.   But I think that the challenge with this amendment is that, without  the funding, in order for the Service to do the job that it has to do,  it just kind of puts the Service in a box in which we are saying you  are not doing a good job and, therefore, we are going to start changing  the way in which we proceed.   So I, right now, have to oppose this amendment. But as I said, in the  policy committee I think that there is room for some of us to come  together and to make improvement, but legislating this rider for 1 year  at a time on this appropriations bill doesn't allow us to have the  deep, transparent, and open discussion that we need to have to resolve  your issue.   So at this time I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that statement.   I will say to the gentlewoman from Minnesota that I would love to  work with her on this. I know that, in the Natural Resources Committee,  we are going to be looking at some of the different facets of the  Endangered Species Act, and I hope we can continue this dialogue.   This amendment seeks to make the agency comply with the law. That  provision is in there for a reason, so let's enforce what Congress, in  its wisdom, put into the law many years ago.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 68 Offered by Mr. Lamborn    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 68  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:                          limitation on use of funds         Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement or enforce the threatened species       listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse under the       Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Preble's meadow jumping mouse is a tiny rodent with  a body approximately 3 inches long, a 4-to 6-inch-long tail, and large  hind feet adapted for jumping. This largely nocturnal mouse lives  primarily in streamside ecosystems along the foothills of southeastern  Wyoming south to Colorado Springs, in my district, along the eastern  ridge of the Front Range of Colorado.   To evade predators, the mouse can jump, like a miniature kangaroo, up  to 18 inches high. In 1998, it leaped onto the Endangered Species list,  a move that has hindered development from Colorado Springs, Colorado,  to Wyoming.   Among projects that have been affected: the Jeffco Parkway southeast  of Rocky Flats, an expansion of Chatfield Reservoir, and housing  developments in El Paso County along tributaries of Monument Creek.  Builders, landowners, and local governments in affected areas have  incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in added costs because of this  mouse.   Protecting the Preble's mouse has even been placed ahead of  protecting human life and property.   On September 11, 2013, Colorado experienced a major flood event that  damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, important infrastructure, and  public works projects. As a result of the Preble's mouse being listed  as an endangered species, many restoration projects were delayed as  Colorado sought a waiver. In fact, FEMA was so concerned that they sent  out a notice that stated: ``Legally required review may cause some  delay in projects undertaken in the Preble's mouse habitat.'' It went  on to warn that ``local officials who proceed with projects without  adhering to environmental laws risk fine and could lose Federal funding  for their projects.''   While a waiver was essentially granted, the scientific evidence  simply does not justify these delays or the millions of dollars in  taxpayer money that go toward protecting a mouse that is actually part  of a larger group that roams throughout half of the North American  continent.   Scientific studies have concluded that the Preble's mouse does not  warrant protection because it isn't a subspecies at all and is actually  related to the Bear Lodge jumping mouse. Even the scientist that  originally classified this mouse as a subspecies has since recanted his  work and agrees that the Preble's mouse subspecies designation is no  longer defensible.   Moreover, the Preble's mouse has a low conservation parity score.  What that means is that hundreds of millions of dollars have already  been spent on protection efforts that could have and should have been  spent on other more sensitive species.   My amendment would correct this injustice that has been caused by the  inaccurate listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse. It would  refocus U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's efforts on species that have  been thoroughly scientifically vetted and that should be managed by the  Endangered Species Act.   This exact amendment was added to the fiscal year '16 Interior  Appropriations bill by voice vote and was added to the fiscal year '17  bill by a bipartisan rollcall vote. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support this amendment for a third time.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.                                time  2330    Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, clearly, what this amendment does--and it  is different from the other amendment--is prohibit the Fish and  Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the threatened species  listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse under the Endangered  Species Act. It full-out restricts the Service from offering any  critical protections to preserve the species.   Once a species like this is listed under the Endangered Species Act,  the role of the Fish and Wildlife Service is fairly permissive. They  can help parties comply with the act as they carry out their other  activities.   The Service right now is reviewing and considering all the comments  that they received during the public comment period, and a draft  recovery plan is being worked through to develop a final recovery plan.  But with this  [[Page H7180]]  amendment, the Service would not be able to continue to recover the  species. All the Endangered Species Act prohibitions would still apply.   So, in other words, we would stop them from moving forward, but they  would still be under jurisdiction to comply. They wouldn't be able to  comply by working with agencies and land developers and landowners to  provide the ESA compliance.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be barred from issuing  permits or from offering exemptions. That means landowners, industry,  and other parties who might need to take the Preble's meadow jumping  mouse incidental to otherwise lawful activities, such as urban  development, are vulnerable to third-party lawsuits.   Another limitation that the Service would have would be undertaking  the required status reviews of subspecies or initiating any rulemaking  or downlisting or delisting species.   So now we are talking about deep dives into what the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife may or may not be impacted by doing or helping landowners or  developers on an appropriations bill.   Quite frankly, as I have been saying all night--and I understand  people have the right to come here with these amendments--the Service  has a responsibility to implement the Endangered Species Act. They are  charged with fulfilling their legal requirements. When they don't  fulfill their legal requirements, it makes them more vulnerable to  lawsuits, which I know is not the goal of the author of this amendment,  Mr. Chair. But when there are lawsuits incurred, it creates more costs  for American taxpayers.   The gentleman's amendment would just undermine the Service's ability  to work collaboratively with States and local communities. It opens the  Service up for lawsuits and it would create even more uncertainty for  landowners and make them vulnerable, as I said, to lawsuits.   I think we should be working to support the Fish and Wildlife  efforts, not blocking the agency from doing its job and going back to  what we discussed earlier, that is working through the committees of  authorization, and then the authorizing committees having conversations  with the Appropriations Committee on how they can achieve their goals,  this being one of them.   Because of those reasons, I do not support this amendment. I thank  the gentleman for bringing this forward, but at this time I cannot  support it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert) to weigh in on this issue.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert) to weigh in on this issue.    Mr. Chairman, I will conclude by saying there is one  other sort of a temporary element in this whole episode. And that is  when you go from Colorado into Wyoming, the mouse is no longer  threatened or endangered. There is a political boundary line between  the two States.   In its wisdom, the Fish and Wildlife Service says that if you go  north far enough across the State line, it is no longer threatened or  endangered. There is an element of arbitrariness that I think also  calls into question why this was ever done in the first place.   Mr. Chairman, I would ask support for this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).   The amendment was agreed to.
