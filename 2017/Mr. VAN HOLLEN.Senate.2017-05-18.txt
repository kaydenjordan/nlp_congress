 Mr. President, after reviewing Rachel Brand's record  and testimony during her confirmation hearing, I cannot support her  nomination to become Associate Attorney General.   Ms. Brand is a fierce supporter of the so-called Patriot Act and the  bulk collection of millions of Americans' data. Americans deserve an  Associate Attorney General who can properly balance their  Constitutionally protected right to privacy against national security  interests. Ms. Brand has demonstrated her willingness to abridge those  rights.   I am particularly disturbed by Ms. Brand's tenure as the Assistant  Attorney General for the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Policy  from 2005 to 2007. Ms. Brand worked at the Department at the time when  Bradley Schlozman, a high-ranking official within the Department of  Civil Rights, was accused of inappropriately politicizing the  Department. Ms. Brand's emails during her time at the Department  indicate that she may have been aware of and, indeed, a willing  participant in this inappropriate activity. Conservative groups are now  urging Attorney General Sessions to ``wash out the progressive liberal  activism that infects the agency from top to bottom.'' This Justice  Department under Attorney General Sessions is already facing its own  ethics crisis. When President Trump flouts protocols and procedures  with impunity, I cannot in good conscience vote to allow Ms. Brand to  return to the Department of Justice and continue where she left off.    Mr. President, during this week, National Police  Week, I honor all those who serve to keep us safe. I honor three  Maryland officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2016.  Corporal Jack Colson of Prince George's County Police Department,  Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey, and Deputy First Class Mark Logsdon, both  of Harford County Sheriff's office, all dedicated their lives to making  Maryland safe. We thank them for their sacrifice, and we thank their  families, friends, and fellow officers. They will never be forgotten,  and they deserve to be honored not just this week, but every day.                            ____________________
