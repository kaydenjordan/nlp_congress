 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Women's  History Month, where we recognize women who are living today, making a  difference in America.   I want to recognize a Detroit woman, Adrienne Bennett, who was the  first Black female master plumber in the United States of America. She  had already broken barriers and made history, and her impact only  continues to soar in her position as the CEO of her own company.   This month and every month, we must stand up and lift up women all  across this country, ensuring our laws and policies empower and protect  all women.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as co-chair of the Women's Caucus and  join women all over this country as we step up and ensure that this  country, for the girls and young women coming behind us, is one of  respect, one of equality, and one of opportunities.                            ____________________
