 Mr. Speaker, in follow-up to my colleague from Texas'  comment, I would also say that we get what we pay for, which is why I  rise to support the bipartisan Invest to Protect Act which is  legislation I was proud to cosponsor. This legislation follows our  prior increases of funding to the community-oriented policing program  through the appropriations process.   The Invest to Protect Act would help get the job done of ensuring  that police departments--particularly those like I represent in smaller  and rural communities--have the ability to recruit and retain officers.   This legislation invests in officer safety, it invests in domestic  violence response training, and it invests in funding the police  departments like those I represent.   Throughout Virginia's Seventh District, I hear directly from local  police departments about the need for stronger investments in training,  equipment, recruitment, and retention. And as a  [[Page H8089]]  former law enforcement officer, I greatly admire and am thankful for  the dedication of the men and women who work every day to keep our  communities safe.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Congressman  Gottheimer and Congressman Rutherford, for their leadership on this  legislation. I thank CBC Chair Beatty for her partnership on these  important issues of public safety and public trust. And I appreciate  that this bill has the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police and  the National Association of Police Officers.   This is a smart investment, smart policy, and at this moment we  should have the common commitment to keeping America's communities  safe.
