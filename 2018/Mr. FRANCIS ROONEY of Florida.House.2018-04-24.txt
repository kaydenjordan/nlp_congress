 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the  dire need we have for term limits in the Congress. Eighty-six percent  of Americans agree, but it is possible that Congress doesn't.   I have introduced the Thomas Jefferson Public Service Act of 2018 to  create a limit of 12 years without amending the Constitution, something  which we all know will never happen. It is time for Congress to ``fish  or cut bait.''   To the argument about the value of seniority, I would humbly suggest  that we ask the 18- to 25-year old millennials in our country, these  folks here, who will be voting and taking over the workforce. As you  can see here, they voted massively for Democrats in 2016--that is the  blue--and would have left an electoral college of 504 Democrats and 23  Republicans.   Across the business world where I come from, employers are responding  to the millennials' lack of concern for seniority, refusal to wait  their turn, and questioning deference to authority. I am not making a  value judgment. I am telling you, that is the way they are; and if you  want employees and good people, you have got to deal with their  concerns. The digital age is different.   We Republicans have a chance of convincing them that we are nimble,  flexible, and responsive by adopting this law. If we stay in our rut,  like Hamlet, we deserve our fate.                            ____________________
