 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the 38th Annual National  Peace Officers Memorial Service honored the men and women who paid the  ultimate sacrifice upholding the rule of law and protecting the people  of our great Nation.   Last year, Mississippi lost five officers in the line of duty. I  would like to honor them as we remember their service and sacrifice.   Please join me in honoring Police Officer Emmett Paul Morris,  Corporal Walter Zachery Moak, Patrolman James Kevin White, Patrol  Officer LeAnn Simpson, and Police Officer Robert McKeithen.   President Ronald Reagan once said there can be no more noble vocation  than the protection of one's fellow citizens.   May we remember these brave officers, their sacrifice to protecting  our communities, and the sacrifice they made for the people who call  Mississippi home.                            ____________________
