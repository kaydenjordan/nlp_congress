 Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank my friend  from Ohio. Senator Brown has been a real champion. It is wonderful to  partner with him and with the senior Senator from Indiana, Mr.  Donnelly.   All of us believe strongly--and the Democratic caucus together  believes strongly--that a pension is a promise, period. A pension is a  promise. Too many people right now are finding themselves in a  situation where they are being told that promise is not going to be  kept.   For generations, millions of working men and women have built better  lives for themselves in Michigan and across the country, and better  lives for their families, with jobs that provided more than a paycheck.  That is part of the American dream.   These folks have worked hard, and we know that the people of Michigan  can outbuild and outwork and outimagine anyone. I will take on my  friends from Indiana and Ohio on that one because we know that in  Michigan we have bright, hard-working folks.   In exchange for a job well done, workers knew that they could count  on basic benefits, including quality healthcare and a secure  retirement, a pension. Jobs like these didn't just build families. We  know that those jobs have built the middle class of our country--making  things, growing things, creating things, and building things. That is  what has created our middle class and our way of life.   Unfortunately, though, we know that jobs that provide this kind of  security and stability are becoming increasingly hard to find. Even  worse, some workers have discovered that the benefits they earned over  years of hard  [[Page S182]]  work have proven to be less than dependable. That is why we are here,  because we believe a pension is a promise, and too many people are  being told that promise isn't going to be kept. That is wrong.   Imagine what it is like to be one of these workers. Perhaps you spent  your career behind the wheel of a truck, hauling freight. The work is  dangerous. The hours are long. You are separated from your family, but  you keep on driving because the pay and the benefits are good, you are  taking care of your family, and you are planning for the future. You  know that after driving literally millions of safe miles, you will be  able to retire with dignity. You will be able to have that cottage up  north in Michigan, the snowmobile, and the boat, and to send your kids  to college, thanks to the pension you worked so hard and so long for.   After decades of work, you decide it is time to park the truck one  last time. You say goodbye to your coworkers and hello to a new stage  in your life. You plan in your retirement to spend more time at the  lake, maybe even teach your grandkids to fish. You can make these plans  because you know you have the security of that pension you have worked  all your life for.   Then, one day, everything changes. You learn that for a variety of  reasons, the fund providing your pension is running out of money--not  because of your fault. In fact, you might receive little, if any, of  the benefits you were counting on. What do you do? What do you do? Do  you swallow your pride, sell your home, and move in with one of your  kids? Would you go back to work? Would you be able to get a job?   A lot of Michigan workers don't have to imagine what they would do  because they are living it right now. This is very serious.   Again, I have always believed that a pension is a promise. Shame on  our country, shame on our government if we don't make sure that promise  is kept.   People who worked hard to earn their retirement benefits should not  have to worry about paying the power bill or putting food on the table  or keeping their homes. Unfortunately, we know that a number of multi- employer pension funds, including ones in Michigan that Michigan  workers depend on, face serious challenges due to the financial crisis  and other factors. I remember back in 2008 and 2009, when there was a  bailout that was passed for Wall Street banks, but what about the  pensions that were invested? What happened to the middle-class families  depending on that? We know what happened in terms of people losing  their homes, and what about the other piece, which is the pensions,  that lost money?   This isn't the fault of the workers, like Kenneth of Sterling  Heights, MI. He is a retired teamster. He wrote to me about his fears  of being able to pay his bills and cover the basics, including food,  medicine, and everyday expenses. He worked hard all of his life. He  doesn't want to end his life in poverty, nor should he have to.   He told me: ``We are not the people who made the bad investments of  our hard-earned money and lost billions of dollars.''   Kenneth is absolutely right. This isn't the fault of the workers, and  they shouldn't pay the price. They should know that the promise made to  them after a lifetime of hard work will be kept.   That is why I am so pleased to be cosponsoring the Butch Lewis Act of  2017 with my colleagues who are here this evening. The bill would  create a new office within Treasury called the Pension Rehabilitation  Administration. The new office would give troubled pension plans the  opportunity to become solid again through loans and assistance from the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. With this bill, these plans would  be able to pay workers all of the promised benefits with no cuts--no  cuts. The plans would be required to demonstrate the ability to repay  the loans at the end of the term.   Think about how Wall Street banks got loans. Shouldn't middle-class,  working men and women--retirees who worked all of their lives and  believed in our country, and believed that, in fact, our country would  have their back--also have the same kind of opportunity to be able to  protect their pensions?   Let me just say again that this is an incredibly important piece of  legislation that affects millions of middle-class Americans who have  worked their entire lives--people who are retired now or are near  retirement or are still working hard and paying in and trust that, in  fact, their pension will be there, and it is incredibly important that  our country keep its promise to them.    Let me also say in conclusion that I will be reintroducing  legislation that I introduced last session to address something else  that I think is a matter of fairness: to prevent raises and reduce  salaries of top pension fund executives if retiree benefits are cut. I  understand how devastating pension cuts would be to retirees and their  families, and the people making decisions--the people in power making  decisions about funds--should actually be able to know that by feeling  the same pain of cuts.   There is no question we need long-term solutions to the pension  crisis facing our country. People who are retired right now and face  losing that pension and going into poverty or people who are about to  retire don't have time to wait. There is a tremendous sense of urgency  about this.   Cutting benefits would place a terrible burden on retirees who have  worked hard all of their lives to earn some dignity, some comfort, some  security. It is people like Keith and Mary. They are both in their  seventies and depend on Keith's pension and Social Security to meet  their basic needs. They told me:         We try to save, but it is difficult. We are hoping that the       pension will last more than 10 years, but who knows.    Keith and Mary have the right to know. They have the right to know  that their country has their backs and that they can count on their  pension being there.   I urge my colleagues to help keep that promise for Ken and Keith and  Mary and hard-working people all across Michigan and America.   I see our leader on the floor. I want to thank him for making this a  top priority as we are negotiating the priorities of this country, the  priorities of the budget for next year. Making sure hard-working  Americans have the promise kept of their pension is something that I  know is at the top of his list, and I am proud to join him in this  effort.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.
