 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Congressman Elijah Cummings, a friend, mentor, patriot  and titan of the House of Representatives.   Congressman Cummings was a giant among us who led with his heart and  governed with the love of his district and our country. He worked until  his very last breath for the good of our nation because he believed in  the power of the American people to make our country a better place for  our children to live and prosper.   After all, Congressman Cummings knew firsthand the power of the  American dream. The son of sharecroppers, he grew up to graduate Phi  Beta Kappa from Howard University, receive his law degree from the  University of Maryland and go on to serve his beloved home of Baltimore  in both the state legislature and in Congress.   Day in and day out, Congressman Cummings fought to ensure our  government worked for the people, providing the tools to help Americans  succeed and the opportunities to make their dreams a reality. He  understood that patriotism is not looking at our nation's past through  rosy glasses and a revisionist history, but rather that it is having  the courage to examine more closely those areas that are broken and  believing in the power of our system to fix them.   Social justice was in his blood--when he was just 11 years old, he  and his friends worked to integrate a segregated swimming pool in his  native Baltimore. I was honored to work with him closely to ensure  every American is able to cast his or her ballot on election day. And  he fought passionately against forces that undermine the integrity of  our democracy and the principles upon which our nation was founded.   Congressman Cummings will be forever missed, but his legacy lives on  and continues to inspire us to live our lives for the benefit of  others--and the good of our nation.                            ____________________
