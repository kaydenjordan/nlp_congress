 Madam President, today, I rise to share my concerns with the  nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an Associate  Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Let me begin my remarks by noting that I have enjoyed getting to know  Judge Jackson. My visits with her and conversations with her in the  committee and otherwise and also my interaction with Judge Jackson's  family have all reinforced what I know of her generally, which is that  she is a good person, a noble citizen, and someone who has earned very  impressive academic and professional credentials.   After graduating from Harvard Law School, she ended up clerking at  all three levels of the Federal judiciary and worked at a number of  positions over the years as a lawyer. She has now, as a judge, served  as a Federal district judge, which is a trial court position, and has  served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, which is an  appellate court position. If confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, she  will have served at all three levels of the Federal judiciary, which is  itself an impressive accomplishment and one that I think would benefit  the Supreme Court. Any time they have the insight of someone who has  served in that many roles, it can be helpful.   She is a good person in many respects and comes with impressive  qualifications academically and professionally, but I do have concerns,  and those concerns are what I want to turn to now.   Many of them date back to efforts by groups like Demand Justice to  shame and intimidate Judge Jackson's former boss and the Justice whom  she would be replacing if confirmed to this position, Justice Breyer,  into retiring by paying for a billboard mounted on a truck to drive  around the Supreme Court of the United States, bearing the slogan  ``Retire, Breyer.'' These same groups are now the same groups that are  spending money--millions of dollars--to advocate for Judge Jackson's  speedy confirmation. Then there was the shameless leaking of Justice  [[Page S2022]]  Breyer's decision to retire well before he was ready to announce it.   Now we find ourselves in the midst of a needlessly rushed nomination  process, where liberal dark money groups are pressuring Senate  Democrats to confirm their preferred Supreme Court nominee months--many  months--in advance of when she could actually be seated on the Court.   Because of this false sense of urgency being presented by the radical  left, we have also seen the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  refuse to accommodate reasonable and commonsense document requests from  Republican members of that committee. The same members of the committee  who demanded more time to review and interrogate a nominee about his  high school yearbook are now feigning outrage and insisting that it is  somehow unacceptable that we should demand more time to review a  nominee's own judicial record. The contrast is significant.   Let me provide some additional context to illustrate how outrageous  that aspect of this situation is.   My Republican colleagues and I have been very keen to hear from Judge  Jackson about her judicial philosophy. This is something that is an  essential part of assessing any judicial nominee's fitness for office.  The higher level the nomination, the more important it is to understand  that. Nowhere is this more important than when the nominee is someone  who has been nominated to serve on the highest Court in the land, the  Supreme Court of the United States.   Judge Jackson, significantly, has refused to describe her judicial  philosophy or even to agree that she has one. Instead, she has told us  that she has a methodology, but this methodology--neutrally applying  the law to all relevant facts--is nothing more than a simple  statement--a simple rote recitation--of what judges do, not an  explanation of how they do it.   When Republicans on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Jackson for  more information about her judicial philosophy or any statement about  it, Chairman Durbin and the nominee both directed us to her judicial  record. So we asked Judge Jackson about her record. We inquired about  questionable sentences in child pornography cases, sentences that  appeared to constitute a pattern and practice of giving inexplicably  light sentences to criminals--people who are caught trafficking in what  can only be described as the products of the commercialization of child  sex torture. These are vile offenses. Her response was that we simply  couldn't understand her sentencing decisions. We couldn't understand  them just by looking only at the public record because we didn't see  what she saw. We didn't have the information that she had.   Now, Chairman Durbin told us that we can discern Judge Jackson's  judicial philosophy from her judicial record. Judge Jackson told us  that we can't understand her judicial record without all of the  supporting documents that informed her decisions. So we asked for those  supporting documents, which included presentence reports from those  cases involving child pornography possession. Chairman Durbin's  response? Not on my watch--his words, not mine. Democrats dismissed our  requests as baseless attacks on Judge Jackson herself.   What if we said, ``That isn't true''? Do they contest that Judge  Jackson presided over those cases? That she, in fact, imposed those  sentences? Do they contest that she imposed those sentences or that  Judge Jackson's sentences departed from both the sentencing guideline  ranges and from the requests of the prosecutors? These are simply the  facts in the record, and we have questions about them, legitimate  questions.   So, if this is a baseless attack to a nominee's factual record, what  exactly is the purpose and scope of the Senate's duty to offer our  advice and consent with regard to such nominations?   After we pushed back, Chairman Durbin based his continued refusal on  the sensitive nature of the documents at issue. Now, I agree completely  that presentence reports are highly sensitive. They contain sensitive  information in them, and this body of written work product deals with  necessarily sensitive materials on a regular basis. The U.S. Senate  deals with sensitive records, so the fact that these are sensitive  documents doesn't mean that we can't handle them. In fact, we already  have security measures in place to protect that kind of information. We  even have specified rooms where we can and routinely do review  sensitive information. So hiding behind a glib quote about protecting  children at the expense of thousands upon thousands of actual child  victims is shameful.   The chairman says that parents are living in fear that presentence  reports that discuss harm to their children would be confidentially  shared with this body for the limited purpose of allowing us to do our  job, to review Judge Jackson's record. I think it is more likely--far  more likely, in fact--that parents of sexually exploited children live  in fear that their children may be victimized again when one of Judge  Jackson's defendants gets released from prison after an unconscionably,  indefensibly short sentence.   To make matters even worse, not only have Democrats refused  Republican requests for more information on Judge Jackson's judicial  record, but they have withheld information from me and my Republican  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. I am referring in this context  to a chart referenced accidentally by a Democratic member of the  Judiciary Committee that summarized probation office sentencing  recommendations gleaned from the presentence reports--the same  presentence reports that we have requested and that we have not been  allowed to see.   Now, I have to admit I am still unclear as to how the majority  obtained this information. Chairman Durbin wrote to Republicans that  the chart was given to him by the White House, which, in turn, obtained  the chart from Judge Jackson's chambers. However, when I and every  other Republican member on the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to  Judge Jackson to request further information, she replied that she had  no way of obtaining the requested information because it ``is the  property of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and I  am no longer a member of that court.'' How, then, did her chambers  obtain the information that was provided to the White House and then  provided to Senate Democrats which came from the presentence reports?   Do the Democrats have something to hide--something that they can  avoid having to reveal and have discussed by rushing Judge Jackson's  nomination? What might it be? It may be the one thing Judge Jackson  steadfastly refused to share--her judicial philosophy.   Despite my Democratic colleagues' pretending that judicial philosophy  is some arcane and esoteric legal concept that doesn't matter,  Americans everywhere instinctively understand its importance. While  they may not all use the same terminology, Americans know that  justice--as we imagine Lady Justice always depicted as being blind or  blindfolded--is to ensure equal justice under the law for everyone  regardless of their race, their religion, their background, their  creed. That kind of justice matters to every petitioner, every  respondent, every plaintiff, and every defendant who comes before our  courts. That kind of justice can be ensured only by judges adhering to  a guiding principle by which they bring clarity out of often unclear  language.   The Supreme Court is not a representative body; Congress is. Justices  are not accountable to the people once they are confirmed, but we are.  That is why we have heard from virtually every nominee that their  personal perspectives on X, Y, and Z don't matter--because they are  fully committed to applying the law without their own personal  perspectives getting in the way. That is exactly right and could not  more fully demonstrated the importance of judicial philosophy. When a  Justice is swayed by her natural inclinations or fails to get to a  neutral place when deciding a particular case, adherence to her  judicial philosophy keeps her from violating that commitment. That  guiding principle constitute a judge's judicial philosophy.    Now, look, judicial philosophy is not a methodology or, as I said  earlier when Judge Jackson described her judicial methodology as simply  applying the law to the facts, that is not describing her unique  approach to judicial decision making. She was simply reciting the  definition of what a judge does.  [[Page S2023]]    Every judge applies the law to the facts. That is literally what it  means to be a judge. The question is, How? Because statutory and  constitutional language is often unclear, whether on its face or as  applied in a particular context. What matters is how a judge resolves  that ambiguity. Laws are not self-interpreting, and interpretation is  rarely obvious, especially in the difficult cases that tend uniquely to  come before the Supreme Court of the United States on the merits. You  have to have a guiding principle by which to bring clarity out of  unclear language. That is your judicial philosophy.   So a judge without a judicial philosophy is no more useful than a  pastor without a theology. It is just someone making it up as they go  along, dressing up their opinions as holy writ. A nominee who claims to  have no judicial philosophy is either being misleading or is perhaps  unsuited to a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench, let alone on  the highest Court in the land. Yet the vast majority of President  Biden's judicial nominees have repeatedly asserted that they simply  don't have one; that they lack a judicial philosophy. This sudden and  uniform shift suddenly and strongly suggests that they are being  coached to give precisely that inexplicable, indefensible answer.   And yet every judge does, in fact, have a judicial philosophy.  Whether they acknowledge it or not, whether it is easily definable by a  few words or a few sentences, they do have one. When a nominee refuses  to describe her judicial philosophy, the likely explanation is simply  that she does have one; she just knows that neither the public nor this  body would approve of it. In that case, we are left to infer what her  judicial philosophy is from her record, which is precisely what  Chairman Durbin and Judge Jackson suggested that we do. Except, as I  have already pointed out, they don't want us to have the whole record,  and they are unreasonably denying our access to the whole record.   So, again, Judge Jackson refuses to tell us what her judicial  philosophy is. Senator Durbin says we can find it in her record; Judge  Jackson says we can't fully understand her record without all the  supporting documents, but neither of them will let us see these  documents. If this makes you nervous, that is because it should.   So why does this matter? Well, we got to see this firsthand 2 weeks  ago. While Judge Jackson insisted that she didn't have a judicial  philosophy, she actually did give us a small peek into it. In response  to a question from Senator Durbin about the sentencing guidelines and  child pornography offenders, she acknowledged Congress implemented a  statutory scheme with specific directives to courts to help them  determine how they are to sentence defendants found guilty of  possessing or distributing child sexual assault material. But then she  admitted that she and other judges have made a habit of using the  discretion they are given in applying the sentencing guidelines that  disregard or discount the parts that, in their view, no longer make  sense, saying:         Courts are adjusting their sentences in order to account       for the changed circumstances.    With all due respect, that is not her or any other judge's decision  to make. Courts don't change the law; Congress changes the law. If  Congress one day decides that receiving child sexual assault material  electronically is somehow less offensive than receiving it through the  mail, then we will change the law.   Judge Jackson insists that she was statutorily required to consider  the factors--the very factors she relied upon--to depart from the  guidelines, consistently sentencing defendants to prison terms  considerably below where the sentencing guidelines would have sent her.   All that is true, but all the factors listed in the statute in  question, codified in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553, Judge Jackson seems to  weigh quite heavily those factors that will decrease an offender's  sentence and gives, apparently, short shrift to those who would  lengthen the sentence in these child pornography cases.   This kind of cherry-picking of considerations resulted in astonishing  outcomes, like giving one defendant 3 months in prison instead of 10  years. Her willingness to change the outcome based not on the law but  based on her own sense of ``changed circumstances'' demonstrates a lack  of judicial humility and restraint, and that is troubling.   Unfortunately, this lack of judicial humility and restraint was not  limited to any narrow line of cases. It wasn't limited to those cases  that involved the production and distribution and possession of child  pornography.   In the case of Make the Road New York v. McAleenan, Judge Jackson  ignored clear statutory language, stating that she didn't even have  jurisdiction to review the case. She set aside that language and  instead reached back in time to apply the previously enacted and much  broader Administrative Procedures Act to obtain her preferred outcome,  the outcome advocated for by the dark money group Arabella Advisors,  which happens to be funding the campaign for her confirmation. When  asked about this case, Judge Jackson doubled down on her faulty  reasoning, even though it had been overturned by the left-leaning DC  Circuit.   Unfortunately, this was not the only case where Judge Jackson ignored  clear statutory language to assert jurisdiction and reach her preferred  policy outcome.    To make matters worse, Judge Jackson took multiple opportunities in  her responses to my colleagues' written questions to separate herself  from principles that form the bedrock of our constitutional Republic.   When asked by Senator Cruz if she believed that individuals possess  natural rights, she said:         I do not hold a position on whether individuals possess       natural rights.    This is after she acknowledged that these lines from our Declaration  of Independence reflect natural rights:         We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are       created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with       certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,       Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.    When asked by Senator Cornyn if she believed that natural law is  reflected in the Bill of Rights, she stated that she ``would interpret  the Bill of Rights based on the methods of constitutional  interpretation the Supreme Court employs, not based on principles  derived from natural law.''   These responses eliminate any hope that I had that even if Judge  Jackson interprets and applies statutes incorrectly, she would still be  guided by our Founding documents. Every part of Judge Jackson's  record--that is, every part that we have been given--seems to indicate  something of a desire to separate herself from grounding principles in  order to reach her desired outcomes.   This is why judicial philosophy matters. This is why it isn't just  some esoteric exercise for law nerds. This is why it matters and should  matter to every American.   When a judge can impose her own policy views in contradiction of the  expressed will of the people through their elected representatives in  Congress, it doesn't just undermine our representative system of  government. As we have seen here, it can put child predators back on  the streets.   In one case, the convict, upon release from his inexplicably short  jail sentence, resumed seeking out suggestive images of children to the  point that Judge Jackson had to agree to send him to 6 months in a  halfway house.   In another case, the convict who had been convicted of raping his 13- year-old niece and then falsifying his address to evade the sex  offender registry, sexually assaulted another family member after being  released from the light sentence imposed previously by Judge Jackson.   Neither of these defendants would have had these opportunities to  reoffend had Judge Jackson just followed the sentencing guidelines and  what the law required.   Judicial philosophy matters. It is foundational to the very fabric of  our constitutional Republic. And, again, there are no magic words we  are looking for. There is not a single judicial philosophy that is  either going to deem it acceptable or not acceptable, but they need to  have one. They need to be willing to talk about it and explain what  animates, what motivates their decision making, how they will go about  construing these statutes.   If judges won't commit to giving effect to the words of the laws that  Congress passes, as understood at the time  [[Page S2024]]  they were written and enacted, then American voters have no control  over the laws that govern them. We will be ruled in that kind of  scenario by a self-anointed class of five philosopher Kings in black  robes.   I fear Judge Jackson may see the Court in that very way. I fear that  based on her answer to a question in the hearing raised by one of my  colleagues. In response to that question, she said:         Well, anytime the Supreme Court have five votes . . . they       have a majority for whatever opinion they determine.    The Constitution demands more, and the American people deserve  better.   For all these reasons, I oppose Judge Jackson's nomination.    Mr. President, Col. Gail S. Halvorsen is known as the  ``Candy Bomber'' because in 1948, Colonel Halvorsen brought not only  much needed supplies to the besieged residents of Berlin, but he  brought joy in the form of candy bars and bubble gum with miniature  parachutes dropped from his airplane. This story of hope, light, and  service is but a highlight in a life dedicated to serving others.   While Colonel Halvorsen passed away earlier this year at the notable  age of 101 years, the people of Utah hold him and his story close to  our hearts. Recently, my staff and I were honored to join the Gail S.  Halvorsen Foundation and other groups in Utah to help facilitate the  donation of six tons of school and baby supplies along with 9,000  letters from Utah schoolchildren to refugees fleeing Ukraine. While  logistical challenges are characteristic of international donations of  this type, the dedication of the Halvorsen Foundation and all involved  ensured these vital supplies made it safely to those within a critical  timeline.   In a time of violence and evil, when our friends are under attack,  Gail Halvorsen is again leading the way for American generosity,  kindness, and compassion. The parallels between these two tragic  situations are moving. The men and women of America's military  volunteered in aiding in delivering supplies to those in need. The  Halvorsen family and foundation were involved intimately in the effort.  Colonel Halvorsen's daughter brought along chocolate bars to induct the  Navy pilots as some of the next generation of ``candy bombers.'' These  supplies landed at Tempelhof airbase where the legend began. Now, as  then, the people of the United States are showing characteristic  kindness. It is particularly moving to me that alongside the supplies  and necessities of life, this shipment included touching letters from  the schoolchildren of Utah. Gail Halvorsen is remembered not for his  efficiency or logistics, but his kindness and gift for human  connection.   These diapers, packages of formula, and school supplies will be used  by the most vulnerable of the Ukrainian refugees. This gesture of  kindness will lift up weary hands and encourage struggling hearts of  the mothers and fathers of these children. Importantly, at this moment  of difficulty and despair, the Gail Halvorsen Foundation and the people  of Utah are also remembering the people behind the tragedy and are  remembering kindness, humanity, and an individual touch in the effort  to relieve suffering.   The people of Utah are not unfamiliar with stories of displacement.  Utah was settled by religious refugees seeking freedom from persecution  and violence. Indeed, the history of the United States is broadly  marked by groups fleeing violence, persecution, or turmoil in their  homelands. The American empathy for refugees and desire to help those  in desperate need is alive and well in the hearts and minds of Utahns.   Col. Gail S. Halvorsen lived a life dedicated to service. His  signature kindness shines brightly in telling his signature story. His  glowing smile matched his glowing personality. In Utah, we miss the  ``Candy Bomber'' and his personal touch. Neverthless, his mission and  influence continues.   The dedicated work of the Gail S. Halvorsen Foundation is changing  lives today. Be it caring for refugees, inspiring kindness, or building  future generations of STEM professionals, the Gail S. Halvorsen  Foundation continues the legacy of one of Utah's greatest citizens.  Col. Gail S. Halvorsen's story, his legacy, and his influence carry on  bringing smiles and relief all along the way.                            ____________________
