 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a  serious issue facing my home State of Texas and millions of Americans,  the Biden border crisis. Things at our southern border have gotten  worse by the day since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have taken office.   For example, illegal immigration numbers were up 450 percent in June  compared to June of last year. June was the fourth straight month with  over 170,000 apprehensions. Border Patrol officials have seized more  fentanyl so far in 2021 than all of 2020.   COVID cases among illegal immigrants are up 900 percent in the Rio  Grande Valley. Numbers don't lie. The Biden administration's reckless  approach to immigration has caused a full-blown crisis at the border,  and there is absolutely nothing being done to stop it.   To be clear, the public health and drug crises that have been  exacerbated by what is happening at the border are not just a problem  for border States. The drugs being smuggled in at the border are coming  to a neighborhood near you, courtesy of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   Their hypocrisy on the public health threat, in particular, couldn't  be more appalling. While pushing stringent COVID rules on the American  people, the Biden administration is simultaneously pushing an open- border agenda that includes placing COVID-infected illegal immigrants  all over this country. It is absolutely unbelievable.   Every American will ultimately be impacted in some way by this Biden  border crisis. I plea with the President to reverse his failed  immigration plan and start protecting the American people.
