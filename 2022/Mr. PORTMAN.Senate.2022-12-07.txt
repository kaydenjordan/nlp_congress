 Mr. President, I come to the floor for the 27th  consecutive week since the invasion of Ukraine to give another update  to the American people on the brutal, illegal, and totally unprovoked  attack by Russia on its neighbor Ukraine. This is at a time when brave  Ukrainian freedom fighters continue to successfully fend off the third  largest army in the world.   What Russia thought was going to be a weeklong invasion, successfully  occupying Ukraine, is now past the 9-month mark. Against all odds,  Ukraine has not only survived, but they have pushed back a much larger  Russian army--more than half of the land that Russia occupied in  Ukraine. Remember, they were all up here in the area of Kyiv and all  down here. More than half of the land has been liberated already.  [[Page S7023]]    Here in the northeast part of Ukraine, near Kharkiv, in this  province, the Kharkiv Oblast, the Ukrainian forces continue to make  progress pushing back against the Russian forces.   It has been slow--a combination of things. One is, it is mud season.  It is very difficult for them to get through the mud with their armored  vehicles. The second is, the Russian forces who were pushed back from  here in September have now dug in along this line. So it is slower  going, but they continue to fight.   They are continuing with the momentum that started when they took  over Kharkiv.   Further south, near Bakhmut--and Bakhmut is in this area, and I was  actually in Bakhmut back in 2018 at the so-called line of contact-- there is very intense fighting going on. This is where you have had  months and months of fierce combat, lots of artillery. It has turned  this area, the Bakhmut area where I was, into a battlefield reminiscent  of what you might have seen during World War II--just total  destruction, as you can see from this photograph.   This is the Bakhmut area today. There you have the Russian forces,  mostly the Wagner Group, which is a mercenary group, making steady but  very slow progress. Ukraine has made them pay dearly for every meter,  but that is, again, kind of in that central part of eastern Ukraine.   In the south of Ukraine, near Kherson, they have also made good  progress. You can see here in the blue where the Ukrainian forces, in  the fall, earlier this fall, were able to liberate parts of occupied  Ukraine.   This is an interesting area. I think it is relatively quiet right  now. We had a briefing today about that. But I don't think it is going  to stay quiet for long. This is an area to watch. There are already  reports of Ukrainian raids, actually, on a small peninsula there.   This is a little closer look at this. Ukrainian raids have now been  made on this peninsula which goes out into the Black Sea. Also, we know  that Ukrainian forces have crossed the river here, the Dnipro River,  and planted Ukrainian flags on the other side of the river, letting the  Russians know they are not safe in this region; this is Ukraine.   They have also started to evacuate, facilitate the evacuation of some  of the Ukrainian civilians from this side, the occupied side of the  river.   All this indicates to me that the Ukrainians are continuing to send a  clear signal to the Russians that they are not done in terms of  liberating this part of Ukraine this winter.   Unfortunately, while the nation of Ukraine has survived this war, so  far not all Ukrainians have. These gains on the battlefield I have  talked about have come at a tremendous cost. Casualty reports have been  hard to come by, but we know that tens of thousands of Ukrainian  soldiers have been killed during this liberation.   But it is not just the men and women in uniform that are taking the  brunt of Vladimir Putin's aggression. Since the first day of this war,  it is innocent Ukrainians themselves who have been dying. They have  been intentionally targeted by Russian forces.   How many cities and villages have now become infamous for the war  crimes committed by Russia? Bucha and Irpin, cities where I was  visiting several weeks ago; Mariupol, Izium. Think of 4-year-old Liza.  We had her photograph up here on the floor. She was killed in Vinnytsia  in July. Think of 2-day-old Serhii, who was killed 2 weeks ago--2 days  old, a newborn--at a maternity hospital in Vilniansk.   The United Nations reports that at least 6,500 civilians have been  killed in this senseless Russian war, then adds that ``the actual  figures are considerably higher.'' We just don't know what they are.  This is because we know so little about the horrors which are occurring  behind enemy lines.   So when you think about it, although we know more about the  casualties that have occurred in the interior of Ukraine, what we don't  know is how many casualties and war crimes and deaths are occurring in  this Russian-occupied area, the red area.   What we do know is that so many of the atrocities in this war are  only brought to light months after they occur. They happen in silence,  and then they are discovered when these territories are liberated by  Ukrainian forces. That is the bittersweet pattern of this war: You have  the Russians occupying a territory, committing heinous war crimes,  atrocities. Then the area is liberated, and we discover these horrific  crimes.   And Russia's crimes are not just limited to the territory it  occupies. Russian forces are losing on the battlefield, as we talked  about, not making the progress they want, and they are sort of taking  their frustration out on the rest of Ukraine. This is with cruise  missiles and drones, bombing all of these other parts of Ukraine.   They continue to strike noncombatants. A whole new wave of attacks  occurred yesterday, as an example, mostly on Ukrainian infrastructure,  energy infrastructure, but also on just civilian targets. They have  destroyed neighborhoods, schools, hospitals. As this photo shows, they  have really targeted civilian infrastructure. This is, again, some of  the energy infrastructure that they have targeted.   When I was in Kyiv with Senator Coons about 3 weeks ago--we were  there several days after one of the powerplants had been attacked-- actually, the national utility--and these were targeted attacks on the  infrastructure. But also Ukrainians, civilians, and workers were  killed. It is not just collateral damage. These are targeted attacks on  civilians--targeted and cruel.   Russia's goal, of course, is to try to force a whole new wave of  civilians to flee from their homes and head west. This massive  displacement, of course, would further devastate Ukraine's economy,  which is already expected to contract about 35 percent this year. We  have seen this time and time again since the war has started. They  can't defeat Ukraine on the battlefield, so they strike behind the  battlefield to try to destroy Ukraine as a whole.   The actions by the Kremlin to destroy these civilian areas and kill  innocent Ukrainians are also, of course, meant to dampen the Ukrainian  resolve. But what I have seen on my trips to Ukraine and my trips to  the region is that every time there is a Russian atrocity, the resolve  of the Ukrainian people doesn't weaken; it gets stronger--and for good  reason.   And the Ukrainian military certainly isn't backing down in their  fierce defense of their homeland. In fact, a Ukrainian military  spokesman recently said that Ukraine intends to continue, if not  accelerate, its counteroffensive this winter in these areas we talked  about--in particular here and here. So stay tuned because I think the  Ukrainians are not done yet this winter in many places along the  frontline, although the winter is bitterly cold for the infantry. The  ground is also frozen solid, which makes mechanized warfare possible  again.    Additionally, on Monday and again today, there were explosions  reported at military bases in Russia. These are military bases hundreds  of miles behind the frontlines. So this is in Russian territory. There  are military bases that are experiencing explosions. These bases happen  to house the Tu-95 bombers, which have regularly taken part in Russia's  deadly cruise missile strikes against Ukrainian civilians.   According to the British Ministry of Defense, these explosions  constitute, as they say, ``some of the most strategically significant  failures of Russian force protection since [Russia's] invasion of  Ukraine.''   Ukraine is the shield defending freedom in the West. When I visited  Ukraine in August and November, I heard from so many Ukrainians who see  themselves that way. They are holding Russia at bay, essentially, for  the rest of the world. For years--think about it--Russia has threatened  Europe and other regions with military action. We have all witnessed  their attack of the country of Georgia and their brutal tactics in  Syria and Chechnya.   In 2014, and then, of course, in February of this year, Ukraine  became Russia's next target; and if Ukraine falls, Russia has promised  other dominos will fall in Eastern and Central Europe. They have said  openly they want to recreate the Soviet Union or the Russian Empire,  which would include so many countries in the region.   The brave soldiers of Ukraine, men and women in uniform, are holding  back the forces of Russian tyranny, and we should honor their sacrifice  and  [[Page S7024]]  their bravery. Fortunately, they are not in this fight alone. Over 50  countries from around the world have stepped up to help Ukraine defend  itself.   Ukraine's freedom fighters have been trained and equipped not just by  the United States but by dozens of other countries that believe in  freedom. Ukrainians are well aware of this, and they are eternally  grateful. I hear this gratitude every time I am with Ukrainians.  Yesterday, I met with a bunch of Ukrainian Parliamentarians from their  Rada here in Washington. But when I have been in Ukraine, I have heard  it also.   When I spoke with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv in August and again in  November, the first thing he said to me was, ``Thank you to the  American people.''   The aid from the United States and our allies does not go unnoticed  or unappreciated. Ukrainian soldiers are bearing the brunt of Russia's  wrath, but because of the significant assistance provided by the West,  President Zelenskyy speaks about this war against Russian aggression as  a joint battle and that we should continue to strive together toward  our joint victory.   Ukrainians are well aware of the need to provide transparency to  taxpayers here in the United States as to how this aid is being used. I  think that is very important. During both my visits to Kyiv this year,  I spoke with our diplomats at the U.S. Embassy about how they are  ensuring proper oversight and accountability for military aid.   I have also met twice with the 101st Airborne in Poland, the  principal unit responsible for delivery of U.S. and allied military  assistance. They have gone into great detail about how they are  tracking and monitoring the U.S. military assistance through so-called  end-use monitoring to ensure the military equipment actually ends up in  the right hands.   One thing interesting to me, confirmed again today, is that we have  sent these HIMARS, which are these rocket-launching systems, to Ukraine  that have been particularly effective and that, at least at this  point--we have sent about 20 of them--not a single one, not a single  one has been attacked and destroyed or has gotten into the wrong hands.   We also believe, from what we know, unbelievably, that with all the  weapons we are sending to Ukraine, we don't have any instances that are  documented of these weapons getting into the wrong hands. Plenty of  Russian weapons have gotten into Ukrainians' hands--I will tell you  that--including lots of armored vehicles that they have left behind.   So no one is advocating that this Congress or U.S. taxpayers give  Ukraine a blank check. This aid is generously provided by taxpayers so  it has got to be accountable to taxpayers. Ukraine knows that and,  again, has gone to great lengths to provide transparency, even in this  time of war.   These resources fund not only Ukraine's military; they back the  government and help maintain and repair civilian infrastructure.  Ukraine's economy has been hit so hard by this conflict that, without  help from its allies, the government there would be unable to provide  many basic services to its citizens.    The Europeans, Japanese, and others, of course, have stepped up here,  as they should. This is particularly important this winter. As Russia  attacks Ukraine's energy infrastructure to plunge the country into cold  darkness, the humanitarian aid from the United States and dozens of  other countries has ensured that innocent men, women, and children are  able to survive the cold Ukrainian winter amidst these heinous Russian  war crimes.   Our economic aid, along with that of the European Union and dozens of  other countries, has supported Ukraine's Government so that critical  services to its citizens can continue. With regard to the economic  assistance, by the way, the Ukraine budget support goes through the  World Bank from the United States because, in addition to our own  oversight, the bank adds a second layer of oversight and  accountability, including issuing periodic reports and audits to both  parties.   Economic assistance is further monitored by a USAID contractor, the  U.S. accounting firm Deloitte. They monitor all expenses, which is a  good thing, in my view.   We also need to ensure our constituents that what we are providing to  Ukraine is actually working; it is making a difference. And it  certainly is. When Ukraine took back the city of Kherson here, which  was the first and only provincial capital taken by Russia, the key  element to their success, I am told, was the military equipment  provided by the United States--and others, but primarily the United  States--and that was the HIMARS launchers we talked about a moment ago.  These missile launchers were very effective at tearing down the Russian  infrastructure that was providing the supplies to Russia--so the  weapons, the food, and so on. By wearing down the Russian forces and  forcing them to abandon the city, the American weapons were very  effective in debilitating Russia's ability to command and resupply its  forces.   And the air defense systems provided by the United States and our  allies have helped Ukraine shoot down hundreds of missiles and drones  launched by Russia that otherwise would have killed innocent civilians.   I do continue to believe that we can and should do more, by the way,  particularly with regard to military assistance. I continue to urge the  Biden administration to provide Ukraine with more of the weapons that  the Ukrainians themselves have said they actually want and need and can  use. This would include fourth-generation advanced fighter jets--not  the latest and greatest but things like F-16s that we are not using  that they could use, that other countries have that we could allow them  to provide to Ukraine; Abrams tanks that other countries have that they  are willing to provide; long-range missiles.   If we are serious about helping Ukraine continue to win, as opposed  to the possibility that this could just result in a stalemate, we  should provide these weapons so that they can respond to the very real  Russian threat.   Let me pose this question to my colleagues who are skeptical about  assistance: If we had not led our allies in supporting Ukraine during  this fight for survival, what would have happened? What would have  happened if we allowed this authoritarian regime to dominate and  subjugate its neighbors by force of arms?   Ukraine would have become an occupied state. Many more refugees, by  the millions, would have fled to Europe, to the United States, and  elsewhere. And even if the threat by Vladimir Putin to occupy all these  other independent countries in the neighborhood that were once part of  the Soviet Union had not yet become a reality, the United States would  have mobilized thousands of troops and massive amounts of weapons at  the borders of these NATO allies at a tremendous cost to the American  taxpayer.   I think we have to think about that, think about what the alternative  would have been. It also would have resulted, of course, in the rules- based international order that we have had in place for almost 80  years, since World War II, crumbling in Ukraine. What would have  happened then? What message would aggressive adversaries like China and  Iran take from that?   The world would have become a much more dangerous and volatile place,  let's be honest. Countries would have armed up. This is why it is so  important that we continue to support Ukraine. Our enemies and our  adversaries alike are watching very carefully. We can't pull back now,  not during this critical time. We cannot falter.   In addition to working with our allies to help Ukraine win on the  battlefield, we have got to continue to tighten the global sanctions  and export controls on Russia. I believe it is only that combination-- success on the battlefield and making the Russian economy feel the  pain--that is going to be successful in getting Russia to the peace  table. Export controls already are blocking supplies, including  semiconductors, needed to create military equipment in Russia. So that  is having an effect. Sanctions must include better success at stopping  the energy receipts to Russia that are fueling the war machine.   I mentioned what is happening to the Ukrainian economy. The Russian  economy has also gone down but not nearly as much as the Ukrainian  economy.  [[Page S7025]]  Why? Largely because the economy depends on the energy receipts that  are still coming in from Russia selling its oil and gas around the  world.   This week, there was some progress on that front. Back in June, the  European Union decided to end all seaborne Russian oil imports by  December 5. That was Monday. And the EU did, indeed, follow through on  this promise. I applaud the European Union for taking that step.   However, in June, the EU also committed to end financing and  insurance services for all vessels carrying Russian oil, even to non- European countries. This would be devastating to Russian oil exports  since Europe dominates a large chunk of the maritime services market.  Financing and insurance: Without financing and insurance from Europe,  these ships would never embark and Russian oil sales would plummet.   Unfortunately, in this case, the EU did not follow through on this  promise made in June. Instead, on Friday, the EU, the United States,  other G-7 countries, and Australia agreed to what is being called a  ``price cap'' scheme. Under this framework, the participating countries  will continue to provide financing insurance for vessels selling  Russian oil but only below a certain cost per barrel. So instead of  ending these sales of seaborne Russian oil exports, we are enabling  them at a lower price. What is more, as the Washington Post reports,  the price cap, which was agreed to at $60 per barrel, ``is well above  Russia's cost of production and close to where its oil is currently  trading--meaning it may not have much of a direct impact.''   That is my concern about it. I understand that there is another  argument that the Russian oil price would, perhaps, be even higher at  lower volumes if they didn't have these ships. But I think the first  plan made in June would have been much more effective in helping to  tighten these sanctions.   Analysts, by the way, said the cap will have little immediate impact  on the oil revenues that Moscow is currently earning. In fact, Russia  itself said on Monday the cap is not going to hurt the financing of its  special military operation, as they call it, in Ukraine--this deadly  and unprovoked war.   The price cap is ``an unhappy compromise that will do very little to  cut Russia's oil revenue'' from current levels, said Ben Cahill, an  energy security expert at the Center for Strategic and International  Studies in Washington.   I would ask the suffering people of Ukraine what they would think  about it. Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic States--who have consistently  been right about the threat of Russian aggression--suggested a price  cap of just $30 a barrel if they were going to do a price cap; so half  of the $60 that the EU, the G-7, the U.S., and Australia ended up at.  The one we agreed to, again, was twice as high.   On a more positive note, at a meeting in Romania last week, the  NATO's Secretary General reaffirmed that the door to membership remains  open to Ukraine. This has been NATO's official policy for Ukraine, by  the way, since 2008, but it was important that the alliance reaffirm  that commitment last week in the context of Vladimir Putin's war on  Ukraine.   I encourage NATO to begin the steps to welcome Ukraine in the future.  Despite all the atrocities and hardships now we have talked about  tonight, I believe that Ukraine will eventually prevail in this  conflict and survive as a country and that Ukraine will someday join  NATO and the European Union to add the most important security  guarantees they could get. No amount of Russian missiles can stop that,  by the way, because the people of Ukraine will always have something  that Russia does not: freedom and faith.   Faith is what our Founding Fathers had so many years ago when they  set out on a risky journey to chart America's own destiny--faith that  freedom would work. Faith is what the Ukrainian people grasped onto as  they embarked on their own Revolution of Dignity in 2014, abandoning a  corrupt Russian-backed regime and choosing freedom, democracy, and free  markets. Ukrainians chose to stand with us, with the European Union and  the United States and other free nations.   Faith is what gave the people of Ukraine the strength and resolve at  the beginning of Russia's overwhelming invasion in February--faith that  as a country, they would survive, and as a people, they would come out  on the other end of this conflict--when the odds were so stacked  against them--more unified than ever.   Against all odds, again, that faith has been justified time and time  again during this bloody war. Now, once again, it is time for us to  join our allies in keeping the faith--faith in the proven Ukrainian  bravery and perseverance and faith that freedom will win out over  tyranny if we stay the course.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
