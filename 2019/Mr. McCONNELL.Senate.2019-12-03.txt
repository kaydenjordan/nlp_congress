 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, House Democrats are  continuing their 3-year-long quest to impeach the President and are  continuing to obstruct urgent bipartisan legislation. This has been the  Democrats' strategy for months now--obsess over impeachment and  obstruct everything else.   Take the USMCA, which would create 176,000 new American jobs. Speaker  Pelosi has been stalling it for months, constantly saying she is  optimistic or getting close or almost there. For months, it has been  this broken record. I understand, this very week, while the Speaker of  the House has apparently flown to Madrid to discuss climate change, she  keeps offering the same empty rhetoric that is no different than what  she was saying 10 months ago. American workers have waited and waited  and waited. House Democrats keep stalling.   Consider the appropriations process. Even after signing a bipartisan  agreement to forgo poison pills, Democrats ignored it and thrust other  policy disagreements back into the appropriations process. They voted  twice to filibuster funding for our Armed Forces. Well, last week,  Chairman Shelby and Chairwoman Lowey reached an important agreement to  address allocations at the subcommittee level. This was an essential  step. It will take a lot of work and cooperation to move the  appropriations process forward in the short time ahead of us. Our  Democratic colleagues will finally need to rediscover that our men and  women in uniform are more important than their partisan fights.   Speaking of our Armed Forces, let's talk about the NDAA. Congress has  passed an annual defense authorization bill every year since 1961.  Every year, after some jousting and jostling, the Congress has put  aside all of our extraneous disagreements to fulfill one of our most  basic responsibilities and reauthorize our Armed Forces, but remember  the Democrats' new playbook: Obsess over impeachment, obstruct  everything else, including, apparently, even our troops and national  security.  [[Page S6794]]  Imagine being so far left that even the routine annual bill to  reauthorize the U.S. military is some controversial thing you have to  be goaded into supporting. House Democrats abandoned longstanding  traditions of compromise and larded up the NDAA with partisan policy  riders. For what appears to be the first time ever in either Chamber,  they passed an NDAA on a pure party-line vote--the first purely  partisan NDAA in 58 years. In the Senate, by contrast, Chairman Inhofe  and Ranking Member Reed collaborated on a bill that passed the Senate  86 to 8. We certainly did our part to stick with an annual tradition.   Now my colleague, the Democratic leader, is moving the goalpost and  enabling Speaker Pelosi's reckless strategy. Longstanding bipartisan  precedent says that in order for any subject outside the Armed Services  Committees' jurisdiction to travel in the final NDAA, the chairmen and  ranking members of the actual committee of jurisdiction need to give  bipartisan signoff. This basic test protects the Senate; it protects  our committees; and it protects the NDAA from being held hostage for  specific partisan ends. Every year, dozens, if not hundreds, of  provisions meet that bar. Those that don't end up on the cutting room  floor.    Thus far, in the Senate, Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed have  worked hard to respect those norms, but this year, the Speaker of the  House and my colleague the Democratic leader want to scrap this  precedent, undermine the committees, and demand special treatment for  partisan priorities that have no business being crammed into this  essential legislation for our Armed Forces.   We are talking about a new taxpayer-funded benefit for all Federal  employees and sweeping changes to U.S. foreign policy. This is what  they are trying to shoehorn into the NDAA. It is not good-faith  policymaking, not when these demands pour in at the eleventh hour over  must-pass legislation for our servicemembers. It is just political  theater that is taking precedence over our Armed Forces. So, right on  cue, I am sure we will hear made-for-TV histrionics about all of the  new provisions the Speaker and the Democratic leader want to shove into  this bill--bypassing hearings, markups, and negotiations between  chairmen and ranking members.   We will probably keep hearing the dishonest myth that the Republicans  are soft on Russia--never mind that a few years ago, President Obama  was mocking the Republicans for being too tough on Russia; never mind  that this administration has aggressively pursued sanctions, expelled  Russian operatives, provided lethal defensive weapons to Georgia and  Ukraine, taken major steps to protect our elections, and more. It is  just more bluster and histrionics to distract from the core fact that  is crystal clear to the entire country: There is no legislation, no  matter how crucial, that the Democrats will not obstruct in order to  pick fights with this President.   The very bills the Democrats are resisting are essential for our  national defense strategy--for our needed investments in cutting-edge  weapons, in the European Defense Initiative, in modernizing our nuclear  force. They are all critical for competing with, deterring, and  defending against Russia and China. If the Democrats divide Congress  over nondefense issues and kill these bills, they will have played  right into our adversaries' hands. If we jettison the longstanding  bipartisan process for negotiating the NDAA, they will have made this  basic national security requirement far more difficult in the future.   Our Democratic colleagues must understand that national security  comes before ``the resistance.'' The country cannot afford this new  tactic of obsessing over impeachment and obstructing everything else. I  hope this changes soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a totally different matter, the  Senate has set aside today to honor our distinguished colleague, the  senior Senator from Georgia, Johnny Isakson.   It has been about 3 months since Johnny announced he would retire at  the end of December. Since then, I think we have all been taking stock  of everything our dear friend has accomplished and everything he means  to so many people. I have long said, if the Senate were to hold a  secret ballot popularity contest, Johnny Isakson would win in a  bipartisan landslide--quite possibly in a unanimous vote.   He commands bipartisan respect and affection to a degree that is  truly remarkable. Yet, if you think about it, it makes sense for a man  whose personal mantra goes like this: ``There are only two kinds of  people: friends and future friends.'' For most people, that might be a  noble aspiration but unrealistic. For Johnny Isakson, it is a statement  of fact. Nobody is an enemy, and nobody is a stranger--just a friend  and future friend. That is it. With a motto like that, it is no wonder  that Johnny's first career was a successful stint in real estate--a  field in which relationships are everything.   It strikes me there could be two ways you could thrive in a business  in which friendships and connections matter so much. You could be  either good at faking a smile, at feigning interest in others, or you  could genuinely love meeting everybody and learning how you might be  able to help people. That second kind of person is exactly who Ed and  Julie Isakson brought up in Atlanta, GA--warm, honest, forthright,  incredibly kind. No wonder Johnny's neighbors jumped at the chance to  hire him to be their State representative, then their State Senator,  then their Congressman, and then their U.S. Senator. So his retirement  this month will cap a 45-year career in public service, packed with one  significant accomplishment after another.   First and foremost in Johnny's long legacy is his work for our  Nation's veterans. He spent 6 years in the Georgia Air National Guard  as a young man, and he has spent the half century since then as one of  his fellow veterans' best friends at any level of government.   Under Johnny's chairmanship, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has  passed literally scores of bills: more accountability at the VA, more  education benefits, better community care programs, better procedures  for when veterans appeal determinations, an updated GI bill with no  more expiration date, and, of course, Johnny's landmark bill--the VA  MISSION Act. It is now law. It provides many of the most significant  reforms in the history of the VA by taking power away from bureaucrats  and giving it back to the veterans and their doctors.   Yet, somehow, in the midst of compiling this singular record for our  Nation's veterans, Johnny racked up countless more legislative  successes that impact literally every American--from securing pension  protections to reforming education policy, from regional infrastructure  projects like the Savannah Harbor Expansion to combating hunger  worldwide. One look at the list of laws bearing Johnny's fingerprints  and you would be forgiven for thinking he never met a problem he could  not solve.   But alas, every Senator sometimes encounters requests from back home  on which he cannot deliver. Sometimes you have constituents on both  sides of an issue. Sometimes a request might conflict with your  principles. Whatever the reason, everybody in office eventually  disappoints somebody. Yet Johnny's staff marvels at the fact that even  when Georgians come up here to meet with him and, unfortunately, go  away disappointed, they still walk out of the meetings, beaming with  praise for their Senator: ``Can you believe Johnny? He is the greatest  guy ever. What a Senator''--and these are the people he just said no  to.   The same traits explain why Johnny is just as popular under this dome  as he is back home, and I don't just mean with his fellow Members.  Johnny Isakson is practically an honorary member of every other  Member's staff and an honorary elevator operator and an honorary  Capitol Police Officer and an honorary member of Chaplain Black's team  and on and on. He knows and values absolutely everybody.   I can't count how many times I would hear a peal of laughter from out  in my staff bullpen and realize that Johnny Isakson had dropped by, not  to see me but to chat with my team, to ask after their families, and to  maybe check up on a couple of Georgia's priorities while he was there.  [[Page S6795]]    There is one classic story that really distills this man's character.  Most people who have hung around Johnny and his team long enough know  the famous tale of the ``gin and tonic in the laundry room.''   Here is the deal: Back in 2006, Johnny was still a new Senator. We  were tackling some thorny pension issues, and thousands of Georgians  stood to be affected if things didn't get hammered out. So this  freshman Senator dove in. He went toe to toe with big players like Ted  Kennedy and Bill Young over in the House. He didn't get a seat on the  conference committee, but he basically appointed himself an honorary  member. Johnny worked it like crazy. He sleuthed out where they would  be meeting, and he spoke to everyone. Because it is Johnny we are  talking about, we know how this ends: He delivered for Georgia.   Afterward, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wanted to hear how this  freshman Senator had pulled off this victory. Among other things, the  reporter asked how Johnny had celebrated. Did he clear out the  champagne at some beltway steakhouse?   Here is what he said:         Isakson said that after the vote, he went straight back to       his Capitol Hill area apartment and celebrated--by doing his       laundry. He did not want to leave dirty clothes behind for a       month.    He said further: ``So as I was putting coins in the machine, I had a  gin and tonic in the laundry room.''   This anecdote is almost the perfect encapsulation of Johnny Isakson.  It starts with tenacity and a can-do spirit, propelled forward by  charisma, smarts, and stubborn patience. It ends with a win for  Georgians and one celebratory cocktail while being wrist-deep in  laundry detergent.   Yet there is one other story, I think, that reflects this remarkable  leader even more perfectly. It starts with one name--Kate Puzey.   In 2009, Johnny was reading his local paper and found an obituary for  a young lady from northern Georgia who had been in Africa with the  Peace Corps. She was just 24. Johnny didn't know Kate and didn't know  her family, but he felt called to attend her funeral. He sat quietly in  the very back and listened to her friends, her family, ministers, and  Peace Corps colleagues.   Unassumingly, he invited the family to stay in touch if there was  anything he could ever do. Only later, did they relate what wasn't in  the obituary. Kate had been murdered in the dark of night after  sounding the alarm on child abuse in her village in the African country  of Benin.   Johnny Isakson was on the case from that day forward. Not only was he  a fixture on the Foreign Relations Committee, but he was actually the  ranking member on the Africa Subcommittee. So he put a framed photo of  Kate on his desk and leapt into action. Senator Isakson flew to Benin  to personally lean on its President. He met with Peace Corps officials.  He built a legislative coalition for reforms to better protect  volunteers.   As I said earlier, because this is Johnny Isakson we are talking  about, we know how the story ends--with results. He helped Kate's  parents pursue justice, and just a couple of years after Johnny sat  down in that pew, the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act  was law.   Now, that is Johnny Isakson in one story. He starts out trying to do  good for his neighbors and winds up literally changing the world.   Of course, changing the world can be grueling work. We all know  Johnny's health has made his tireless service more and more challenging  in recent months. As much as the other 99 of us hate to hear it, he has  decided it is time to find new ways to serve that don't involve twice  weekly air travel or winding trips through the Capitol Complex.   But we know our friend is not riding off into the sunset or kicking  up his heels. I know he is bound and determined to keep putting his  expertise and institutional knowledge to work on behalf of Georgians  who need him. I have no doubt that he will keep on advocating for  Georgians with a pen and a phone, more friends across the country than  anyone can count up, and maybe a few of his eight grandchildren by his  side. It sounds like a pretty enviable work arrangement, and no doubt  Johnny has earned it. He has earned the right to a little less late  night voting and a little more time with his lovely wife Dianne.   So on behalf of all of his colleagues, I will tell Johnny to go ahead  and relax just a little and maybe find something to drink, but, this  time around, he should enjoy it on the front porch with Dianne and  leave the laundry until later.   We are savoring our last few weeks alongside our good friend here in  the Senate. We are so lucky to have called him our colleague.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
