 Madam Speaker, I did not come to Congress to impeach the  President. But, I swore an oath to protect our country  [[Page H12200]]  and defend the constitution. That is why, today, I will vote to approve  two articles of impeachment against this President for abuse of power  and obstruction of Congress.   In order to arrive at that solemn and somber conclusion, I used many  of the same skills that I acquired early on as a former prosecutor. By  putting politics and emotions aside to focus on the underlying evidence  and applying those facts to the articles of impeachment, I found it  clear that the President subverted our national interest for his own  personal and political interest. The President then repeatedly ignored  and refused to cooperate with the numerous requests and subpoenas of  the investigation by Congress. Moreover, the President proudly admitted  this conduct and refuses to acknowledge that he did anything wrong.   I do not take pride in impeaching a sitting president of the United  States. But as the U.S. Representative for the central coast of  California, I am upholding my obligation under the United States  Constitution and to protect the future of our democracy.   The impeachment of the President and his upcoming trial in the U.S.  Senate will not stop us from getting things done. As I have proven  during my limited time in Congress, I will continue to work on and pass  legislation that reforms our immigration laws, especially for Dreamers  and farmworkers, promotes our agriculture, combats the effects of  climate change, improves our health care system, lowers prescription  drug prices, changes the tax code to help the middle class and small  businesses, defends equal rights, and protects our values and way of  life on the Central Coast.
