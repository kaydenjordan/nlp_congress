 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and my  colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee for their bipartisan  work on this year's National Defense Authorization Act.   We advanced progressive ideals to support our military families;  improve readiness; sharpen our technological edge; and foster American  leadership, our alliances, and a culture that is in line with the  values of our Nation.   This bill is truly transformational when it comes to advancing  diversity and inclusion, as well as fairness and justice, in our  military.   We are at an inflection point when it comes to race in this country,  demonstrated by peaceful protests across the country and at a time when  a pandemic has widened disparities in healthcare, education, economic  opportunity, and housing along racial lines.   Our armed services are not immune to these currents.   The military has historically prided itself as leading in opportunity  and advancement for men and women of color, but we have fallen far  short of our expectations. Today we are still grappling with a military  that doesn't fully reflect our country's diversity. Forty-three percent  of the Active-Duty servicemembers are people of color, yet only two of  the 41 most senior generals and admirals in the military are Black, and  only one woman.   As recent events have brought a reckoning in our society, we are  still debating symbols of oppression. White supremacy, racism, and  other toxic beliefs exist within our ranks, impacting how Black  soldiers advance, their assignments in career fields, and how they are  treated and assessed.   African Americans comprise just a single-digit percentage of fighter  pilots and navigators, only 5 percent of Army Green Berets, 2 percent  of Navy SEALs; and only 0.6 percent of the Air Force's power rescue  jumpers are Black.   Structural racism still exists in our military formations. Fifty- three percent of minority servicemembers report they have seen examples  of white nationalism or racism within the ranks. These issues didn't  happen suddenly, but festered unchecked by a culture of indifference or  intolerance.   This culture extends to gender disparities we still see in our Armed  Forces. We have made progress and, this year, witnessed historic  barrier-breaking firsts:   Chief Master Sergeant JoAnne Bass was selected as the first woman to  serve as the highest ranking noncommissioned officer in a service  component;   Lieutenant Junior Grade Madeline Swegle became the Navy's first Black  female tactical jet pilot;   The U.S. Army just welcomed its first female Green Beret.   However, there is more work to be done:   Women have never exceeded 27 percent of nominations made by Members  of Congress to the prestigious service academies;   In 2009, more than 6,000 cases of sexual assault in the military were  reported. The Pentagon estimates these reports amount to just 30  percent of assaults, primarily against women.   Women and men, whose trust in their fellow soldiers has been shaken,  need our support and for this Congress to step up.   This year's NDAA takes important steps to create a more diverse and  inclusive military. It builds on the work in 2008 of Majority Whip  Jim  Clyburn, Representative Hank Johnson, and former Members of this  Chamber Elijah Cummings and Kendrick Meek. As members of the  Congressional Black Caucus, they recognized years ago that the military  was not living up to the potential unlocked in 1948 when President  Truman signed the executive order removing racial segregation in the  Armed Forces.   Together, Mr. Clyburn, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cummings, and Mr. Meek led  the effort to create the Military Leadership Diversity Commission,  whose recommendations in 2011 are the basis for many of the diversity  and inclusion provisions found in this year's NDAA, which are some of  the most significant steps towards diversity and inclusion  [[Page H3616]]  that Congress itself has taken since the desegregation of the Armed  Forces in 1948.   It seeks to foster opportunities for women and minorities.   We bring new visibility to congressional nominations to our service  academies to train a more diverse next generation of leaders.   We create a special investigator to review and investigate racial  disparities in the military justice system and personnel practices.   We create a special prosecutor for sexual assault committed at our  military academies.    We foster and train a greater number of minorities within the special  forces and aviation communities.   We tap into the talent at our historically Black colleges and  universities and other minority-serving institutions.   We hold the Secretary of Defense and service component leadership  accountable for progress and give them the tools to make it happen.   This package updates workplace and climate surveys to include  experiences with supremacist and extremist activity, anti-Semitism, and  racism, allowing leadership to understand the full extent of these  beliefs and better tailor responses and disciplinary action.   Finally, after decades of inaction, we reckon with one of the darkest  periods of our history, the institution of slavery. This NDAA bans the  display of the Confederate flag on Department of Defense property and  directs the removal of the names from military installations of those  men who betrayed their country--our country--and who fought a war to  defend the institution of slavery.   The culture we create in our armed services matters. Diversity and  inclusion in our armed services matters. It enhances unit cohesion and  it improves military effectiveness. We have known this since 1950.   Our work is far from finished, but this year's NDAA represents an  important step toward this pivotal moment.                            ____________________
