 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week and I  want to recognize all the brave officers, the men and women who risk  their lives and their safety every day to protect and serve our  communities.   Average citizens try very hard to stay away from certain types of  people: murderers, rapists, drug dealers, gang members, domestic  abusers, many I call dirtbags. These are the people our police officers  deal with every day in the line of duty. They run toward danger when  the rest of us run away.   They take criminals off our streets. They bring justice to our  country. They protect us no matter what. They even protected the wave  of antipolice protests that have been happening across our Nation.  Imagine that. That takes true integrity and dedication to their work.   We all benefit from their service, and we need to back them up  however we can.   I am incredibly grateful for our law enforcement, especially the  local sheriffs' offices and police departments and my good friends at  the State troopers' office in Tennessee's Second District who work so  hard to keep us safe from these bad people.                            ____________________
