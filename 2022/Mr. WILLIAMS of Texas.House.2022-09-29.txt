 Mr. Speaker, the Democrats have once again  failed their job to provide funding for the upcoming fiscal year. They  will now kick the can down the road until after the election and pass a  continuing resolution to keep the government open until December.   Funding the government in this fragmented fashion is irresponsible,  and it does not allow us to respond to the realities facing our  country, like a southern border enduring over 7,000 illegal crossings  every day, an energy crisis, and rampant inflation.   Additionally, CRs do not allow our military to start any new  contracts, which is a real problem right now, considering the  uncertainty around this world.   Every year, we know that these deadlines are coming, yet the  Democrats have once again failed to deliver for hardworking Americans.  In God we trust.                            ____________________
