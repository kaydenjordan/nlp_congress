 Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member Lowey for yielding  me the time.   Madam Chair, I rise today as a member of the subcommittee in  reluctant opposition to the bill before us. I want to thank the ranking  member and the chairman for their hard work on this bill. I know that,  in a truly bipartisan fashion, there has been an effort to address many  issues that are important to me and to other Members.   For example, I appreciate that the committee has come together to  fund a National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for  the Humanities at strong levels that will help support our local  economies and protect important cultural institutions.   But the truth of the matter is that we will be voting on numerous  amendments tonight that will add poison pill riders to the bill. They  will gut our environmental protections and act as a straightforward  assault on our country's air, water, and Federal lands.   The fact that so many of these harmful amendments were made in order  by the Rules Committee is a telling statement of misplaced priorities.  But even  [[Page H6383]]  more telling are the amendments that were not made in order. None of  the amendments to protect our oceans was made in order. Not one of the  10 amendments offered to prevent the devastation of our oceans due to  oil and gas drilling off our coasts was made in order.   We had Members from both sides of the aisle offering these  amendments. We had Members from all across the country offering these  amendments, and not one was allowed for full House debate, neither was  an amendment I offered to push the administration on distributing  appropriated funding that it has sat on without reason.   This administration created guidance for the Department of the  Interior in December of last year, which added another layer of  bureaucracy and review for already-approved projects. How ironic that a  Republican administration would actually be purposefully adding  bureaucracy that they so often rail against.   This has led to an unconscionable delay in getting funds out to the  communities in Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico that  have been impacted by natural disasters, as well as other projects not  related to hurricane relief.    As we enter our second month of the current hurricane season, our  American citizens have yet to see the full relief that they are owed  and that this Congress has provided for them. That is because of this  administration's unnecessary delays.   Again, I know the work that has gone into the creation of this bill  with funding levels from many programs that are vital in my home State  of Maine. In Maine, we have a strong appreciation for the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service and the United States Geological Survey. We love  estuaries, wildlife refuges, and National parks, like the beloved  Acadia National Park in Maine and our new Katahdin Woods and Waters  National Monument. This funding is critical, and I am proud to be on  the subcommittee that funds all of these national treasures and vital  programs.   But because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will spend  the next few hours attempting to gut the Clean Air Act, eliminate the  EPA methane rule, restrict the Endangered Species Act, zero out funds  for diesel emissions reduction, and ban even the discussion of the cost  of carbon in our Nation, I will not be able to support this bill. I  urge my colleagues to join me in opposition.                                time  1945     Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object.    Mr. Chair, while I appreciate the request made is  intended to correct an inadvertent drafting error, I am concerned that  granting the gentleman's request would legitimize a double standard  being applied to unanimous consent requests here on the House floor.   For example, during consideration of the defense appropriation bill 3  weeks ago, Congresswoman Jackson Lee sought to obtain a unanimous  consent to correct just this sort of innocent drafting error in her  amendment. The majority informed us that, while they had no problem  trying to fix the error in some other less direct manner later in the  process, they would object to doing so by unanimous consent.   More importantly, just today, the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee asked for and could not get unanimous consent to  consider a resolution endorsing Speaker Ryan's own statement rebuking  the President's statements in Helsinki in which the President said that  he takes the Russians' word over that of the U.S. intelligence  community, and refused to condemn the Russians' attacks on our  democracy.   If Democrats can't even get unanimous consent for that, endorsing a  statement by the Speaker of the House, it starts to look like a  partisan double standard for giving unanimous consent.   Mr. Chair, I withdraw my reservation of objection.    Mr. Chairman, I too rise to speak in opposition to this  amendment.   The NEA and the NEH have strong, bipartisan support on this  committee, and I had really hoped the days of attacking these agencies  were behind us. Maybe they seem like a good political target for those  who don't understand the ways the arts and humanities affect our daily  lives, but the economic benefits are undeniable for big cities, small  towns, and everywhere in between.   The arts and culture industry contributes $764 billion to our economy  every year, and the endowments are uniquely positioned to help smaller,  rural areas, as you heard the Chair say, access that energy in a way  that private capital can't or won't. And efforts to reach underserved  communities are just as important.   NEA's Creative Forces program helps servicemembers and veterans  manage TBI and PTSD through arts therapy. A cut would majorly impact  the program's reach.   Similarly, NEH has funded the popular veterans book clubs that use  literature that help process experiences in our military. I have been  lucky to talk to some participants, and this is a deeply meaningful  program that, again, is in jeopardy if this proposed cut moves forward.   Frankly, all of this comes at a very small price tag. The NEA and NEH  use minimal Federal investments.    I will just end by saying this is an important way to create jobs,  support families, and sustain communities in every Congressional  district.
