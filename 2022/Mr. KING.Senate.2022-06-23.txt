 Mr. President, as most of us here in the Senate know, this  Chamber functions with a dedicated and able staff to support us.  Because we are a relatively small body that has to oversee the actions  of the far larger executive branch, we rely on specialists detailed  from other Agencies throughout the government. It is really a two-way  deal. When they come here, they learn about the intricacies of the  legislative process and get to participate in it. In return, we benefit  from their years of experience in the Agency they come from.   In my case as chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the  Senate Armed Services Committee, we rely on the Government  Accountability Office or GAO staff who specialize in nuclear and space  systems to help us on the programmatic details of a multitude of  programs in the Department of Energy and Defense, and every year, the  committee sponsors one of them to spend a year with us.   For the past year, we were fortunate enough to have Ms. Camille Pease  with us from the GAO as our detailee, and now, her year is up, and she  is heading back.   Because of the way the Armed Services Committee works in preparing  for a markup, members such as myself and Senator Fischer, our ranking  member on the subcommittee, spend a tremendous amount of time with  staff, including Cami, on hearings and briefings in order to build a  legislative record and develop legislation for our annual markup of the  National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA. In every aspect, Cami was  there to enrich us with her expertise on the National Nuclear Security  Administration. In return, I hope she is wiser on how we work in this  Chamber, and in the Armed Services Committee in particular, on a  bipartisan legislative process that has managed to produce a NDAA for  the past 61 years.   So we thank you, Cami, for spending time with us, and we wish you the  best on your return to the GAO. We hope your time with us will help you  in the years to come. I hope you take back to the GAO that, when it  comes to the national security of this nation, and the NDAA in  particular, this Chamber does work in a bipartisan and productive  fashion, and it is my hope it will continue to do so in the years to  come.                            ____________________
