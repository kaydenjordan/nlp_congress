 Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the following editorial  from my local paper, The Ledger, in reference to my amendment to H.R.  5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, to  provide taxpayers with greater transparency into ``official time.''    Editorial: Per Ross, let's make officials report all `official' time                           (The Editorial Board)         Think unions and the stereotype that comes to mind is one       of burly, thick-necked guys clad in hard hats, scuffed work       boots and plenty of denim. Perhaps that image was fit in       1955, when the American Federation of Labor and Congress of       Industrial Organizations merged to form the AFL-CIO,       America's largest organized labor group. At the time an       estimated 35 percent of U.S. workers belonged to a union, and       most often such workers drove trucks, assembled cars, built       and wired buildings, or engaged in similar hands-dirtying       work.        Today, only 11 percent of workers are unionized, and       frequently they wear a uniform (such as police or       firefighter), or work in an office or public school       classroom. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 34       percent of union workers toil for local, state, or federal       government agencies--or roughly five times the number of       those who drive trucks, assemble cars, build and wire       buildings, or engage in similar hands-dirtying work.        Inevitably, these workers must tend to union business at       the expense of their official duties in service to the       public.        U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross is particularly concerned about how       such juggling among federal civil servants taxpayers, and       seeks to enlighten the public, and perhaps the rest of the       U.S. government, about how taxpayers' dimes are consumed by       union time.        Ross is eyeing a federal law that says managers must allot       staffers time--known in government jargon as ``official       time''--to perform union activities, insofar as it remains       ``consistent with the requirements of an effective and       efficient government.''        The federal Office of Personnel Management reported last       month that most union workers who tap official time spend it       lobbying Congress about legislation that affects federal       union employees (for instance, bills relate to federal pay       and benefits); representing union employees who face       discipline or who filed grievances; and participating in       labor-management ``workgroups.''        Certain federal employees, under law, are paid to spend 100       percent of their time on union functions. Or some union reps       establish ``banks'' of paid time that they draw down in       working just for the union. The OPM report found that between       2010 and 2016, the most recent year available, the hours       spent on official time jumped nearly 17 percent, from 3.1       million hours to 3.61 million.        In some cases, official time was negligible. The Federal       Election Commission, for example, reported just six hours of       official time in 2016. In other cases, it was considerable.       The Defense Department recorded almost 387,000 hours of       official time that year.        The size, scope and mission of a particular agency will       drive much of that. Still, in the aggregate, this is no small       expense. The OPM notes that in 2016 official time cost       taxpayers almost $175 million, up roughly 8 percent from       2014, the last time the survey was done. And the report       doesn't catch everything. The OPM said its report was limited       to payroll costs because it lacks ``comprehensive data       source'' that would allow for ``a complete accounting of the       costs of union activities.'' Thus, its analysis does not       include taxpayers' costs for facilities, equipment and travel       related to collective bargaining.        The OPM knew, for example, that the Social Security       Administration in 2016 spent $2.1 million on union reps'       travel, office space, telephones and supplies only because       the agency was required to report that to its congressional       oversight committee.        Congressman Ross seeks to fix that.        In May 2017, the Lakeland Republican, noting       inconsistencies and lags in data-gathering on these costs,       filed a bill that would require all federal agencies to       provide Congress detailed annual reports of official time       expenses.        ``With greater transparency, employees will be less likely       to abuse the system, which will result in less waste of       taxpayer dollars,'' Ross said at the time ``It is far past       time we require agencies to provide this information to       Congress and the public. Taxpayers deserve clear, reliable       data on how many employees are performing union work on       official time in lieu of their regularly assigned government       duties.'' He's right. His bill passed the House, but       unfortunately stalled in the Senate. Ross' office told us       Monday he will seek to have the measure added to the National       Defense Authorization Act, the must-pass defense spending       bill that the House will take up later this week.        Ross will soon retire, but we encourage him to pursue this       bill until he leaves. Moreover, we urge the rest of Congress       to heed his point.        Congress owes taxpayers a full accounting of time spent by       staffers promoting the personal career interests of the       nearly 1 million unionized federal workers, and how that       squares with the commitment, under law, of providing       ``effective and efficient'' government.
