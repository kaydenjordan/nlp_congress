 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster for yielding.   It is an honor to have represented the Coast Guard's only recruit  training center in the Nation which is in my district. It is an honor  to have represented the Coast Guard Air Station in Atlantic City, which  is the largest helicopter air station that the Coast Guard has.   Most of all, I want to recognize the men and women of the Coast Guard  whom this bill will benefit. There are very few issues that have been  so bipartisan across the board in my time here  [[Page H9651]]  in Congress. When I first came, I didn't really understand the  commitment that the men and women of the Coast Guard continue to make  for our Nation, always being asked to do more and given less to do it.   In many respects I wish we could have done more over the years, but  to be able to move forward with a bill like this that is so bipartisan  I think speaks to our commitment as a legislative body to the men and  women to whom we owe so much that protect our country.   I want to particularly thank Geoff Gosselin who is now with the full  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, but was on my staff for a  number of years and really did an amazing and outstanding job with  Coast Guard issues for me in helping me to understand them and move  them forward. So I want to thank all of my colleagues who have made  this day possible.
