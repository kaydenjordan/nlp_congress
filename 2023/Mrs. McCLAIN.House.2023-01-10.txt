 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the unborn; for the  protection and the defense of the most vulnerable among us.   I stand here today because this week the Republican majority is doing  what the previous Congress refused to do, and that is uphold the right  to life.   For far too long we have seen pro-life facilities vandalized and  broken into. For far too long we have watched as Democrats refuse to  protect born alive babies. Think about that for a moment. These babies  are born alive, breathing outside the womb, and the Democrats want to  kill them. They do not protect them.   This week, we right those wrongs and we defend life in America. It is  well past time for the United States Congress, for this body, to uphold  the guarantees laid out in the Declaration of Independence that we are  endowed by our creator with the unalienable right to life.                            ____________________
