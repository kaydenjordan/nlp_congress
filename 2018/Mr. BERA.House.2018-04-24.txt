 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2809, the American Space  Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2017. As the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Space, I support a robust and successful commercial  space industry, and I look forward to continuing to work with my  colleagues on policies that facilitate our Nation's contained growth  and leadership in space.   The bill before us today, H.R. 2809, would provide a regulatory  framework for U.S. innovative and emerging nongovernmental space  activities.   Commercial space launches, space-based remote sensing, and space  communications are currently authorized under existing frameworks in  the FAA, the Department of Commerce, and the FCC. However, proposed  activities such as commercial operations on the Moon, asteroid mining,  satellite servicing, and privately owned space habitats are not  covered.   The bill establishes a certification process at Commerce for those  emerging commercial space activities and, in so doing, provides  important certainty for commercial companies and investors in these  planned space activities. The bill also makes some updates to the  licensing regime for commercial space-based remote sensing systems.   Further, the bill moves the regulatory oversight of commercial space- based remote sensing systems to the Office of Space Commerce under the  Secretary of Commerce. The Office of Space Commerce would also have  authority for the certification of nontraditional commercial space  activities.   Mr. Speaker, I have often spoken about the importance of building a  rules-of-the-road framework that does not stifle innovation and  provides guardrails for proper government oversight. No bill is  perfect, but I believe that this bill strikes a fair balance in  achieving the goal of certifying these nontraditional commercial space  activities that don't fit within the current regulatory structure.   That being said, while I support moving the bill forward, there are  several aspects of H.R. 2809 that deserve further discussion, including  ensuring that:   Relevant Federal agencies can weigh in on whether proposed commercial  space activities could affect the physical safety of U.S. Government  space operations, including human space flight operations;   Making sure that relevant government expertise and measures to  perform harmful contamination of planetary surfaces are taken into  account;   Making sure that any remaining national security and intelligence  agency concerns are addressed;   And making sure additional information is provided on how the  consolidated Office of Space Commerce will be properly funded and  staffed so it can carry out the additional responsibilities for  authorizing commercial space activities and commercial space-based  remote sensing under the bill.   I am hopeful that these and other aspects of the bill will be  addressed as the bill proceeds, both in the Senate and in any House- Senate conference.   Space is an area that should have bipartisan support from Congress.  NASA and the commercial space industry can only benefit when we work  together as Democrats and Republicans. As a result, I support passage  of this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join me in helping to move  this bill out of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), my good friend and all-around champion of  human space travel to Mars by 2033.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think you have seen the genuine  enthusiasm that Democrats and Republicans and all Americans have about  space. It is in that spirit of national pride and American leadership  that I urge all my colleagues to pass this bill, and, again, to  continue to foster American leadership in space and meet that goal that  my colleague Mr. Perlmutter often talks about, getting to Mars by 2033.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure working with the chairman of the  full committee and the subcommittee, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1745
