 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise this evening, along with many of my  colleagues, to speak in opposition to the nomination of Betsy DeVos to  be U.S. Secretary of Education.   I oppose Mrs. DeVos, whom I had the chance to see at her confirmation  hearing before the HELP Committee, for three basic reasons. I think the  children and parents and teachers of this country are entitled to a  Secretary of Education who is a champion for public education. They can  be a supporter of choice, charters, vouchers, home schooling, but 90  percent of our kids go to public schools and they need a champion.   Second, I want a Secretary of Education who is pro-accountability and  has the idea and view that if any school, whether public or private,  receives taxpayer funding, they should be held to the same  accountability standards for their students.   And third, very particularly, I am deeply concerned about Mrs.  DeVos's commitment to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  which, in my view, is one of the best pieces of legislation that  Congress ever passed.   In my 4-plus years in the Senate, I have not had a single issue that  has generated so much effort to contact my office as the nomination of  Betsy DeVos. Last week, we passed 25,000 contacts by constituents-- letters, emails, phone calls--and those have continued to ratchet up  over the weekend with voice mails and more letters in our system and  more emails coming into the office, and we have dealt with some  contentious issues over the last 4 years.   For example, we shut the government down in October of 2013 because  [[Page S776]]  of the inability of the House and the Senate to sit down at a  conference table and work out a budget. That is a hugely important  issue to the Nation, and especially in Virginia, where we have nearly  200,000 Federal employees. Even a shutdown of the government for 13  days didn't lead to as much contact in my office as the DeVos  nomination.   I want to spend some time on those three reasons for which I will  oppose her, but before I do, I wish to speak about why this is  personally so very important to me. It is important to me because of  the Commonwealth I represent. It is important to me because of the  personal histories of my wife and I and our kids in the public schools  of Kansas, where I grew up, and in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is  important to me because of my previous public service as a mayor and  Governor, where education was the largest line item in the budgets of  my city and my Commonwealth. Finally, it is important to me because I  have recently been added as a member of the HELP Committee--Health,  Education, Labor, and Pension Committee--that shepherded this  nomination through a challenging but very illuminating confirmation  hearing a couple of weeks ago.   So let me start there. Why does this matter a lot to me? I will begin  with Virginia.   Thomas Jefferson, when he was Ambassador to Paris in the early 1780s,  wrote one of the great early works of American literature: ``Notes on  the State of Virginia.'' It was an effort to describe the Virginia of  the day but also his dreams for Virginia--his dreams for the Virginia  economy and the Virginia society, even looking into the future.  Jefferson became the first person to really lay out a vision for  compulsory public education in the United States. He had a very  detailed plan in that book for the division of the State into small  school districts and that education would be compulsory at least for  young people--men and women--who were White.   He used the phrase to promote his educational plan that is still--a  paraphrase of it is still in the Virginia Constitution, talking about  why public education was so important. He said: ``Progress in  government and all else depends upon the broadest possible diffusion of  knowledge among the general population.'' If you want to have a great  government, if you want to have a great economy, if you want to have  great happiness, what you should do is diffuse knowledge among the  general population. It was for that reason that he said we needed a  public education system.   Jefferson wouldn't have imagined an Internet and search engines,  where all knowledge would be digitized and at the fingertips of people  all around the planet, but that is kind of what he was talking about.  If you diffuse knowledge among the general population, that is the best  guarantee of the success of society, and so he laid out this very  ambitious plan in the 1780s.   Sadly, Virginia didn't adopt it. The first early adopter of a  compulsory public education I think was Massachusetts, and other States  did as well. Jefferson stayed active in promoting education not just  through his proposal for a K-12 system, but he also hatched the idea  for the University of Virginia--one of the three things on his  tombstone at Monticello: Author of the statute of religious freedom,  author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of the University of  Virginia. He did not even see fit to put that he was President of the  United States or Governor of Virginia on his tombstone. Education was  what he was passionate about and he founded the University of Virginia.   So we had some great educational thinkers in our Commonwealth who  understood from our earliest days that education would be the key to  our success.   Sadly, the great ideas weren't carried into practice, and Virginia,  as was the case with many States in the country, ran a very segregated  education system. When I was born in 1958--I am 58 years old right now;  I turn 59 in 2\1/2\ weeks--you could not go to school in Virginia with  somebody whose skin color was different. Women couldn't go to the  University of Virginia, and many of our major universities were  segregated on the grounds of sex. So we had a tradition where we  recognized the power of education, but even though our great Founders  did, we really thwarted the dreams and achievements of our students by  not allowing them to be all they could be.   In 1951, a young high school student by the name of Barbara Johns was  attending a segregated public high school in Prince Edward County, VA.  She was 16 years old. Her school was overcrowded. It was poorly heated.  She saw White students in her community having a great new high school  built for them. Some kids in her high school, because of poor  transportation, were killed in a bus accident, and in April of 1951 she  said: I am tired of this. I am a kid, but I am not going to accept  second-class citizenship, and she, encouraged one day with a fake note  to the principal of her school to go to the administrative office--and  then she gathered all the students in the auditorium at Moton High  School in Farmville, VA, and said: We are going to walk out. We are  going to walk out of our high school because we are tired of being  treated as second-class students and we are going to call civil rights  lawyers and ask them to represent us.    Barbara Johns and her classmates did that, and the Virginia case  became part of Brown v. Board of Education that in 1954 led to the  Supreme Court ruling saying that all children were entitled to an  education; we couldn't segregate kids based on the color of their skin.  It was the only one of these civil rights cases that was actually led  by schoolkids advocating for themselves.   Barbara Johns shared the same vision that Thomas Jefferson did:  Progress in government and all else depends upon the broadest possible  diffusion of knowledge among the general population. And she stood up  and said: I have the right to it just like everybody else does, and I  am not going to take second-class status.   Well, the Prince Edward story is one of the most powerful stories in  American educational history because after the Brown v. Board decision  was resolved, many Southern States fought against integration for a  number of years. In 1959, finally, 5 years after Brown, Federal courts  ruled that you have to integrate your schools. If you have public  schools, you have to integrate them, and Prince Edward County did  something that no other jurisdiction in the United States did. They  decided, OK, if we have public schools, we are required to treat kids  equally based on the color of their skin. I have an idea: We will close  all of our public schools. So Prince Edward County, for a period of 5  years, shut down all of their public schools. Do you know what they  did? They used county funds and State funds to support vouchers to  private schools, and they gave those vouchers to students who were  White so they could go to private schools. They called them segregation  academies and they set them up all over Virginia. In Prince Edward  County, White students, if they were wealthy enough, could go to these  academies with some State support, but poor White students and African- American students were deprived of education for 5 years.   I think you can start to see why supporting public education today is  very important in Virginia because in my lifetime, we didn't. In my  lifetime, we closed down public schools rather than let kids learn  together if their skin colors were different. In my lifetime, we put  State dollars into private schools so they could set up and allow  segregation to go forward and avoid the law of the land that kids could  learn together because of the color of their skin.   This was Virginia at the time I was born. It will not surprise you  that a State that didn't want kids to learn together because their skin  colors were different and a State that allowed schools to close down  was a State with very poor educational performance. The Virginia in the  1950s, forget about test scores, forget about SAT scores, forget about  AP exams, we were one of the worst States in the country in the  percentage of our kids that attended school. It will not surprise you  to know that in addition to having a poor record of attending school,  our economy was bad. Those things are directly connected. If you don't  value education, if you say kids can't learn together if their skin  colors are different, if you say women can't go to major universities,  your economy is not going to be very strong. So Virginia was a low- education, low-income State when I was born.  [[Page S777]]    Today, it is very different. The officials in Virginia continued to  battle to try to resist the integration of schools. My father-in-law,  my wife's dad, was the first elected Republican Governor in the history  of the Commonwealth, elected in 1969. He came into office in January of  1970. The previous Governors, who had been Democrats, had fought  against integration, had used all kinds of tricks and strategies to  avoid integrating schools, and my father-in-law, as Governor, took a  historic stand. He said: In this Commonwealth, we are putting  segregation behind us. We are now going to be an aristocracy of merit,  regardless of race or creed, and he embraced a court busing order in  the fall of 1970. He escorted my wife's sister into what had been a  primarily African-American high school in downtown Richmond, and his  wife, the First Lady, escorted my wife into a similar middle school.  The picture of my father-in-law Linwood Holton, this courageous  Republican Governor, and my sister-in-law Tayloe walking into the  school on that day was the front page of the New York Times. It was the  front page of the New York Times because in the civil rights era, there  were so many pictures of Southern Governors standing in a schoolhouse  door blocking kids who were African American from coming into schools  with White students. That was a common picture. There is only one  picture of a Southern Governor escorting a child--his child--into a  school that was predominantly African American with a big smile on his  face saying, finally, Virginia is going to embrace the vision of Thomas  Jefferson. Education should be for everybody. We shouldn't segregate it  based on race. During the time he was Governor, I think immediately  before, we dropped the segregation based on gender in our States'  colleges. And surprise, with those two moves, Virginia started to move.  Virginia started to move from a low-education, poor State to a high- education State that now has top 10 median income.   Now we are a State known for our educational system. Now we are a  State where we are always in the top five in the percentage of our kids  who take and pass AP exams. Our SAT scores are very strong relative to  other States. Our higher education system is viewed as very powerful,  and it is because we, in the words of the letter of Corinthians, put  away childish things. We put away segregation, we put away gender  division, we put away using public dollars to support private academies  so kids and their families could erase the law of the land, and as we  did that, as we embraced the Jeffersonian vision to improve education,  the State's economy improved, and now we are the top 10 in the country.   In my lifetime, no State in this country has moved further  economically from low median income, back of the pack, to front of the  pack than Virginia has, and our State has moved because we have  embraced that everybody has God-given talent. We have embraced  investments in our education system, beginning with this Barbara Johns  walkout and then with the courageous Republican Governor and then  Governors who followed--Democrats and Republicans, business leaders,  teachers, communities leaders. We were late to the game, but we  eventually embraced the Jeffersonian vision, and now we have an  education system we can be proud of. It is a public education K-12 that  educates about 1.2 million kids. We have great private schools. We have  a vigorous home school network in Virginia. We don't do vouchers for  private schools because of our painful history of the way vouchers were  used to support segregation and avoid integration in the 1950s and  1960s, but we have a system that is public and private and home school  and charter. It is a system that isn't perfect, it is a system we need  to always battle to improve, but it is a system we are so proud of, we  have gone from back of the pack to front of the pack.   We care about public education in my Commonwealth, and we do not take  kindly to people who trash the state of public education today because  we know how far we have come. We know how far we have come. That is who  my State is. Personally, I went through 13 years of education K-12; 7  public education, 6 Catholic education. My wife Anne was educated in  the public schools of Virginia--in Roanoke, Richmond, and Fairfax  County--as were her siblings. We have been married for 32 years. Our  three children have all graduated from Richmond public schools. They  have had wonderful careers. I wrote a piece a few years ago when my  daughter, my youngest, graduated called ``Forty Years as a Public  School Parent'' because my three children spent a combined 40 years in  the Richmond public schools.    The Richmond public schools are like a lot of school systems. There  are 25,000 kids or so in an urban environment. It is a high-poverty  school district; probably nearly 80 to 90 percent of the children in  the school system are on free or reduced lunch. It is overwhelmingly a  minority school system; three quarters or more of the students are  minority. But my kids got a fantastic public education in these public  schools of Virginia. They have all graduated and gone on, one to  graduate from George Washington, an infantry commander in the Marine  Corps; one to graduate from Carleton College, a visual artist; and one  is about to graduate from New York University--all built on the  foundation of a great public education in the public schools of my  city.   I told you about my wife being part of the generation of kids who  integrated the public schools of Virginia. Then, in the wonderful arc  of history, she went from a kid living in the Governor's mansion and  integrating Virginia's public schools to a First Lady working on foster  care reform and recently stepped down as secretary of education in  Virginia. I watched my wife grapple with exactly the same kinds of  challenges at a State level that the current Secretary of Education  will grapple with at the Federal level. I think I know a little bit  about what it takes to do this job and to do it well.   In addition to our personal connections in the history of our State,  let me talk about my professional connection to our schools and why I  view this as such an important position. I mentioned that I have been a  mayor and I have been a Governor. I am a little bit unusual. There have  only been 30 people in the history of the United States who have been a  mayor, a Governor, and a U.S. Senator. There have been a lot of  Governors who are Senators, but being mayor will kill you. That is why  there are so few who can do all three.   But when you are a mayor, as I was--the biggest line item in my  budget was public schools. At the time I was mayor, we had about 53  public schools. I had a goal when I was mayor: I would go to a school  every week. On a Thursday morning, I would go visit one of our schools  to see what is being done. If it was the biggest line item, that means  it was the most important thing. I wanted to make sure I understood not  just my kids' schools but the schools that all the kids in our city  went to. I wanted to know what was working and what wasn't.   Then I got elected to statewide office as Lieutenant Governor and  Governor. I made a vow when I was Lieutenant Governor. Just like I went  to a school a week when I was mayor until I visited them all, I made a  vow when I was Lieutenant Governor that I would to go to a school in  every one of Virginia's cities and counties to make sure I understood  public education in my Commonwealth. I should have thought before I  made that pledge because there are 134 cities and counties in Virginia.  It took me 4\1/2\ years to travel to every one of our cities and  counties to try to understand public education in my Commonwealth. I am  not aware of anybody who has made that pledge, and after I did it, I  can understand why nobody would ever make that pledge again. But I  wanted to make sure that I understood not just the schools my own kids  went to but the schools other kids went to all around our Commonwealth.   Northern Virginia and its high-tech suburbs, Wise County, where my  wife is from, the coalfields of Appalachia, the tobacco-growing regions  of Southside Virginia, manufacturing regions south of Richmond,  oystermen and watermen and tourism on the Eastern Shore of Virginia--I  wanted to see the schools in every part of my Commonwealth. I wanted to  see them because I was writing budgets. The biggest line item in the  State budget was education. The biggest line item in the city was for  education. I didn't want to know our schools just from a budget or just  from  [[Page S778]]  a newspaper article. I wanted to know them from seeing them. I wanted  to know them from seeing what came out of my kids' backpacks every day  in terms of the curricula requirements and other things my kids would  do in the Virginia public schools.   I am saying all this first because I am just trying to convey why  this is so important. There is nothing that we do as a society that is  more important to our future than the way we educate our young. The  most precious resource in the world today is not oil, it is not water;  it is talent. The cities or States or countries that know how to raise  talent, grow talent, attract talent, reward talent, encourage talent,  and celebrate talent are going to be the most successful because they  will attract and grow and reward their own talent and bring other  people here, but they will also attract the institutions that want to  be around talent--great companies, great think tanks, great  universities.   There is an inextricable causal link between your commitment to a  system of public education and the success of your city or your State  or your country. There is nothing we do in this Chamber or in the  Federal Government that will be more likely to affect our economic  outcome than the care with which we direct attention to our education  system.   The last reason it is important to me is because of my new membership  on the HELP Committee. I have had my family background. I care deeply  about my State. I professionally worked on education, and my wife has  too. But now I have a platform in the Senate. I tried to get on the  committee right when I got here. I wasn't able to. I couldn't complain  because I got great committees. I am on the Armed Services, Foreign  Relations, and Budget Committees. But I really wanted to be on the HELP  Committee because education has been at the core of what both my wife  and I have tried to do in Virginia for the last 32 years. Now I am  fortunate enough to be on the committee.   In one of my first meetings on the committee, we had a confirmation  hearing for Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. We didn't have all  the information at the time we had the hearing for Mrs. DeVos, but we  had done our homework. I have a wonderful staffer, Krishna Merchant,  who had helped prepare me. We had done our homework. We were put under  some pretty tight time constraints: We each only got 5 minutes to ask  questions. Five minutes isn't a lot of time when you are talking about  something as important as the educational mission of the Federal  Government to help our society succeed in educating our kids. I decided  that in my 5 minutes, I wanted to ask Mrs. DeVos about three things. I  wanted to ask her whether she could be a champion for public schools.  That is a simple kind of a question. I wanted to ask her whether she  believed in equal accountability for all schools if they receive  taxpayer dollars. I wanted to ask her about her thoughts on the  education of kids with disabilities because I care deeply about that  topic but also because I believe that the Individuals With Disabilities  Education Act points a direction for the future of American public  education, and I wanted to see what she thought about it.    I had three test questions. I had three test questions for our  nominee, and she did not satisfy me on any of them. Let me start with  the first one.   Can you be a champion for our public schools?   There are 1.2 million kids in Virginia. Ninety percent of the  children who are educated in this country are educated in public  schools.   I am a huge supporter of private schools. I went to Catholic schools  for 6 years. When I was Governor, I did a lot of great work with kids  and their parents who chose homeschooling as an option. I like options.  But just as a matter of fact, 90 percent of the kids in this country go  to public schools, and it is going to be at that number or near it for  as long as we can see.   In Richmond, we have some great private schools. Richmond has 1  million people, and so private schools can set up and find enough  students. But there are corners of my Commonwealth where it is very  hard to start a private school because there are just not enough  students. That is not just the case for Virginia; my colleagues on the  HELP Committee from Alaska or from Maine share this. There are parts of  their States where, talking about vouchers for private schools, you  might as well be talking Esperanto. That is just not going to happen in  some of these very rural communities. So you have to have a champion  for public schools.   In my research on Betsy DeVos, she gave a speech in 2015 that  troubled me. It was a speech about the state of American public  education. Here are two direct quotes, one of which is not the greatest  language for the Congressional Record, but she said that when it comes  to education, ``government really sucks.'' She also said public schools  are a ``dead end.'' This is not something she said 10 or 20 years ago;  this is something she said about a year and a half ago. This is her  view of public education in this country. Betsy DeVos never attended  public school for a day, never taught at a public school, and didn't  send her children to public schools. That is not a disqualifier. I  think you can have a great Secretary of Education who hadn't attended  public schools, who had come from private schools and had good private  school examples to learn from. I think that is fine. But if you have  never attended public school for a day, if your children have never  attended for a day, if you never taught at a public school, I kind of  have the attitude: What gives the right to stand up and say public  schools are a ``dead end''? Really? There are 1.2 million kids in  Virginia. Ninety percent of kids in this country. Public schools are a  ``dead end.'' Government education ``really sucks.'' What gives you the  right to say that?   So I asked her some questions about these statements. I asked her: Is  the morale of the workforce important? How important are teachers?   Teachers are very important.   Is morale an important thing for teachers? Should they have good  morale to do their job?   Yes, absolutely.   Does the attitude of a leader affect the morale of people who are  doing a job in the organization?   Absolutely.   Well, what does it say to a teacher teaching these tens of millions  of kids in this country--or the 1.2 million kids in Virginia--what does  it say to a teacher that the Federal Secretary of Education says that  government education sucks and public schools are a dead end? I would  submit, it transmits a horrible message.   I think we need a Secretary of Education who will empower kids, who  will empower teachers, who will celebrate what is great about public  education, who isn't afraid to point out what is bad about it, who  isn't afraid to point out the things that need to be improved. But if  you just paint it all with a broad brush and it is all bad, you are  going to miss an awful lot of really good things about American public  education.   I sometimes get down on some of my colleagues on my side about this.  There is kind of an anti-business attitude: Businesses are bad. There  are some bad businesses, but most businesses are really good. You  shouldn't paint with a broad brush, whether talking about business or  any institution, but you definitely should not paint with a broad brush  and say that public schools in this country are a dead end when you  have hundreds of thousands of great teachers and counselors and  busdrivers and cafeteria workers and people going to work every day.  They are not going there because their salaries are great; they are  going there because they care deeply about students, and they want to  either teach them or in other ways impress life lessons upon them so  their kids can have happy lives.   So the first test I found Betsy DeVos wanting in my examination of  her in the HELP Committee was that simple one. If you cannot be a  champion for public schools, you should not be Secretary of Education.   When we were having a discussion in the committee, some of the  colleagues who were kind of coming back at us a little bit were saying:  Well, OK, we get it. You are against charters, or you are against  vouchers, or you are against Betsy DeVos because she wants to expand  choice.   But most of us are from States that have significant choice. I  pointed out that Virginia doesn't do vouchers, but  [[Page S779]]  we have a very robust homeschooling network. I have been a huge  supporter of it. Choice is fine, but you have to be a champion for  public schools, and if you are not, you shouldn't be Secretary of  Education. That is reason No. 1.   Second, I wanted to interview Betsy DeVos about accountability.  Accountability. Should schools be accountable for the success of their  students, for outcomes? This is very important, and it is very  important to get this right.   Sometimes my wife, as secretary of education in a State, would  sometimes tear her hair out about the Federal mandates and strings and  regulations and rules. The HELP Committee did a good job last year  before I was on the committee rewriting No Child Left Behind--the Every  Student Succeeds Act--to try to reshift the balance a little bit to  allow cities, counties, and States more flexibility in trying to  determine how to educate their students, while holding them accountable  for outcomes. I wanted to ask Betsy DeVos: Will you hold all schools  accountable for outcomes--particularly because when he was a candidate,  President Trump said some things about what he wanted to do with public  education. President Trump as a candidate said that he wanted to take  $20 billion of Federal money and give it to private schools to allow  them to run voucher programs of the kind that Mrs. DeVos has promoted  in Michigan, Indiana, and other States. That is a lot of money, $20  billion. That is money that is taken out of the allocation for public  schools. If you take $20 billion out of public schools, especially in  some rural areas--in my view, having done a lot of budgets and worked  on this as a mayor and Governor--you are potentially going to weaken  the public schools.    (Mrs. ERNST assumed the Chair.)   I wanted to understand from Mrs. DeVos how we are going to do this.  You take the $20 billion out of the public schools; I think that is  going to weaken public schools. What I wanted to ask her is, When you  give the $20 billion to private schools, as President Trump wants to  do--and I asked her this question over and over again. I think I asked  her four times. If you give Federal taxpayer dollars to private  schools, will you hold them equally accountable to the public schools  that are getting this money, equally accountable for the outcomes of  the students, for the need to report disciplinary incidents, for  working on important issues like education and kids with disabilities?  Will you hold any school that gets Federal money equally accountable? I  asked her this.   She said: I believe in accountability.   I said: That is not my question. I believe in accountability too. But  I am asking you, Should you hold all schools equally accountable if  they receive Federal taxpayer money?   Well, I believe in accountability.   I asked her again, Should you hold schools equally accountable?   Well, they are not all held equally accountable now.   I am not asking about what you think about the situation right now. I  am asking you what you think is the right policy. Is it the right  policy, if we are going to give $20 billion to private schools, to hold  all schools equally accountable?   Well, I believe in accountability.   She wouldn't answer my question.   I phrased it a different way. I said: Let me tell you this, Mrs.  DeVos. I believe all schools that get Federal money should be held  equally accountable. Do you agree with me?   She said: No.   She doesn't believe that schools that get Federal money should be  held equally accountable. I have a big problem with that. The whole  goal of the choice movement is to provide choices so that students can  learn in environments that are best suited to them. Choice is also  supposed to promote some competition that will encourage everybody to  up their game.   If you hold the public schools accountable while you are taking some  of their money away and you give that money to private schools and you  don't hold them accountable, you are not promoting fair competition.  You are not promoting student outcomes. You are basically taking money  away from public schools and giving it to private schools.   Again, in Virginia, we had a painful experience with that--closing  schools down, defunding public schools, and giving money to private  schools. That is a second reason that is very, very important to me. I  don't think that she supports the notion of equal accountability for  both public and private schools that receive taxpayer funding.   If we are going to do the proposal that President Trump says--we  haven't seen a budget yet, but we may see one at the end of February,  early March. If we are going to suddenly start taking billions and  billions of dollars away from public schools and giving them to private  schools, I want to know they are going to be equally accountable.   The third issue that I asked Mrs. DeVos about was education and kids  with disabilities. Let me tell you why this one is so important to me.  It is important because it is right. It is also important because it  points a path to the future of education in this country.   Before the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed in  1975, we had hundreds of thousands of children with a gap between their  potential and what they were doing because schools were very spotty,  communities were very spotty, States were very spotty in providing  meaningful educational opportunities to kids who had disabilities.   Generation after generation of kids would go to school, but they  wouldn't get an education that was tailored to their needs. They would  finish their education not having the skills they needed to be all they  could be. If you think about that collective delta between what these  kids could do and what they could have done had they had the best  education, it is tragic. That was the genesis behind the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act in 1975.   It is as if we have all these children who are capable of so much  more if this society will only work to help them achieve, and the core  of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a simple thing.  If a student is identified as having a disability of some kind, the  student gets an IEP, an individualized education plan. If you have a  diagnosed disability, then you are entitled under Federal law to an IEP  where you get an education that is tailored to your particular  circumstance.   My three kids went through the Richmond Public Schools. One had an  IEP for a couple of years. That is pretty common. It is pretty common  that you get an IEP, and with a tailored education, you don't need it  for your whole 13 years of K-12 education. You need it for a couple of  years of speech therapy or a couple of years of something else. Then,  within a few years, you are completely mainstreamed, and you don't need  IEP anymore. The individualized attention helps you climb up and then  be completely competitive with your colleagues and with your peers.   There are other students who need an IEP for their entire educational  career, and that is fine too. They are entitled to it under the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.   What it has meant from 1975 to today--it is 40-plus years--is that  this massive cohort of kids with special needs are not in the shadows.  They are not shunted aside. They are not pushed into classes where the  expectations for them are low. Instead, they are challenged to be all  they can be, and they are happier, and their families are happier, and  society is better off as a result. This is a very important thing, and  I know this to be the case.   Every family in this country has somebody in the family with a  disability--or will at some point in the life of a family--and every  person in this country has a friend with a disability. The issues  dealing with the education of students with disabilities are important  morally, but they are important because this is about our friends and  our family and our neighbors.   The other thing about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  that I find so powerful is I think it has been the best single idea  about K-12 education we have come up with. It is better than testing.  It is better than choice. It is better than all the other strategies  because the nub of the idea is you should have an individualized  education. It raises the question, Why do you have to have a diagnosed  disability to get an individualized education?    With computer technology and so many other tools that a teacher can  [[Page S780]]  use in a class of 20 or even 30 students, there is an awful lot that  you can do to tailor the education to each individual student. I was a  teacher. I ran a vocational school in Honduras that taught kids to be  welders and carpenters. We individualized the education. I put together  a list of 60 carpentry projects from the simplest one to the most  complicated one, and all the students started on the same project the  first day of school, but then they proceeded at their own pace. Only  when they did the first one to the carpenter's satisfaction could they  go to the second one. That meant it was individualized because  everybody worked at a different pace until they got it right and they  could move to the next one. That is what the IDEA basically is:  Education should be individualized to the student, and more and more,  that is what we are doing in education all around the country.   I asked Mrs. DeVos questions about the IDEA because of the fairness  and justice issues for students with disabilities but also because the  notion of individualized education is the greatest single idea out  there that will ultimately be the idea that I think will be the  revolutionary next step in American public education.   I asked her a pretty simple question. Once again, if the President  pursues his plan to take $20 billion and invest it in private schools,  should the private schools receiving those dollars have to follow the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act? Should they have to work  with students with disabilities, diagnose the disability they have, and  then offer them a fair and appropriate education tailored to that  disability?   It is a pretty simple question. You get the money from the Feds.  Should you have to follow the law? Remember, this is a Federal civil  rights law. It applies to every ZIP Code in this country. It applies to  every school district in this country.   My question of Mrs. DeVos was, If a private school gets Federal  money, should they have to follow this important civil rights law?   Her answer to me was: I think the States should make that decision. I  think that should be up to the States.   I said: It is a Federal civil rights law. It applies everywhere.   The States should make the decision.   We struggled in my State of Virginia with States' rights arguments  because after the Supreme Court decided on another really important  civil rights principle, you couldn't segregate schools. Barbara Johns'  walkout of Moton High School, and Brown v. Board of Education--and now  it is the law of the land. You can't segregate kids on basis of race.  It is unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment.   The leaders of my State stood up in court for years and said: You  can't tell us what to do; education is a States' rights thing. We don't  have to follow the Supreme Court. We don't have to follow civil rights  statutes at the national level. We believe in States' rights.   States' rights arguments have been used throughout our history to  rebut the notion that Congress or the Supreme Court can pass civil  rights laws of applicability all around the country.   I was surprised. I did not know what Mrs. DeVos's history would be,  unlike reading her speeches where she says the public schools are a  dead end and government is soft. I didn't know what her position would  be on the IDEA. When she told me that a Federal civil rights law should  be a State decision, I was very, very troubled. I was surprised.   I blurted out: Well, what do you mean it should be a State decision?  If you are a parent and you have kids with disabilities and the State  isn't treating them right, you are supposed to move around the country  until you find a State that treats your kids well? You are not entitled  to have the law apply to you in the community where you live and you  are going to have to move somewhere until you find a State that is  going to treat your kid OK?   I think it should be a State decision.   Later on in the hearing, one of my other colleagues, Maggie Hassan,  the Senator from New Hampshire, who has a child with cerebral palsy,  followed up on this, and Mrs. DeVos tried to back out of it: Well, I  wasn't sure we were talking about a Federal or State law.   I was very, very troubled by this. I was troubled by it again because  of the peculiar history that we have had in Virginia and other States  where people have used States' rights arguments to try to trump Federal  civil rights statutes.   I would say that the answers to the questions about students with  disabilities became kind of a pivotal part of that hearing because both  Senators Collins and Murkowski, who have since said they are going to  vote against the nominee, at that hearing and then in the markup  session we had last week talked about that as one of the things that  they found troubling.   Another member of our committee, who is supporting Mrs. DeVos,  Senator Isakson of Georgia, also found it of enough concern that he had  a written exchange with her. He wrote her a letter and asked her a  question: Do you really understand what the IDEA is?   She wrote a letter back, which I have had the opportunity to review,  but I still don't believe that the letter she wrote demonstrates a real  understanding for this issue of the rights of kids with disabilities.   This is a really important point. Some of the States that have  voucher programs--we don't have these programs in Virginia for the  reasons I have described, but there are States that do--Indiana,  Florida. Some of the States that have voucher programs and receive  public money for kids make children sign away their rights under the  IDEA as a condition of being admitted to the school. You want to come  to our private school and you want to use voucher money to do it? We  will let you in, but you have to sign saying you will never take us to  court for violating your rights, for not treating you fairly under the  IDEA, and only if you sign such a waiver, will we allow you to come to  our school. I just don't think that is fair. I don't think that is  right. Especially if we are now going to give $20 billion of Federal  money to private schools, I think they should have to follow the law.    Many private school principals in Richmond--I talked to them about  this issue long before the hearing on Mrs. DeVos, and they are pretty  candid often with parents of kids with disabilities. My longtime  secretary in my office--who has worked for me for nearly 30 years--has  a daughter with a disability. She was going to parochial schools for a  while in the early grades, but as she was progressing up into late  elementary school, there just weren't the programs in the parochial  school that were tailored to her particular situation, partly because  the school was just too small. In a really small school, it is tough to  do education of kids with disabilities. You have to have some  particular training to be able to do it. The difference of a small K-8  parochial school and a larger county school is pretty big. The  principal was candid and honest in a way that my secretary appreciated  and I did too. ``We just don't have the kind of educational program for  somebody of your daughter's special needs that the public high school  has. You really should think about that.'' My secretary agreed and made  the change to the public school. It was actually a better environment  because the resources--which are not cheap--the resources to help do  disability-specific education were there.   Imagine now what would happen if we start to invest money in private  schools, and we don't make them follow the disabilities law. Follow  this through. We take $20 billion away from public schools. That is  weakening public schools' ability to do a lot of things, including  educating kids with disabilities. We give the money to private schools.  We don't require them to follow the Disabilities Act. So families--like  many we know--say, I might like to go to private school, but there is  not enough appropriate education, so I am not going to. I am going to  stay with the public school. So we have just taken the dollars away  from the public school, but all the kids with the significant needs,  the needs that are really costly to deal with, are going to stay in the  public school. It is a spiral that is a bad spiral.   We will defund you, but all the kids with the significant needs that  are costly, they are going to stay. That will dilute and hurt the  quality of the education they will get, while the private school is  getting the money and not having to follow the requirements of the  IDEA. They get the money. They don't have to be equally accountable for  it. They don't have to follow the requirements of the IDEA. This is  very troubling stuff.  [[Page S781]]    Those were the three questions I got to ask her in 5 minutes. Can you  be a champion of public schools, do you believe that any school  receiving Federal taxpayer dollars should be equally accountable for  student outcomes, and should schools receiving Federal taxpayer dollars  have to follow the requirements of the IDEA? With each of those  questions, I was prepared to get an answer I liked, but I got an answer  I didn't like.   I don't think Mrs. DeVos can be a champion of public schools. She has  told me she doesn't think all schools should be equally accountable to  receive Federal taxpayer dollars, and she is not committed to schools  that are receiving Federal moneys following the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act. This explains to me why the volume of calls  into my office over this have been so high--higher than the government  shutdown, higher than any other nominee, higher than any other issue.  We have been at war with ISIS for two and a half years. I have been  trying to make the case that we shouldn't be at war without a vote of  Congress. I get a lot of calls in my office about it, but it is not  ringing off the hook like it has been ringing off the hook with respect  to the DeVos nomination. While I credit Mrs. DeVos for being  philanthropic, and I credit her for caring about kids--that is very  sincere. I see that in her philanthropy and her care. I don't see in  her an understanding of the role that public schools play for 90  percent of our kids. Using arguments like States' rights arguments,  that brings up a real painful history in my State. I don't want to see  that return and especially be at the pinnacle of educational policy.   I mentioned the volume of calls we are receiving. We all asked  ourselves in the office, what has explained this volume? I think the  thing that explains the volume is the disability issue. Because a lot  of folks with disabilities are not used to their issues ever being made  front and center in anything. It matters so much to them. As we said,  every family has somebody with a disability or who will have a  disability. People know folks with disabilities. But the disability  community--which are Democrats, Republicans, Independents and every ZIP  Code in this country--they are not used to their issue being the front  and center issue in something. They are more used to being ignored or  being marginalized.    At this hearing, when the disability issue became front and center--I  think that is one of the reasons the uptick of concern has been so  significant, because people who otherwise are not that into politics or  otherwise not that into who is the Cabinet Secretary going to be, there  is one thing they do know, which is they want Americans with  disabilities to receive equal treatment. They want them to be all they  can be. It is good for their happiness and good for our economy and  good for our society.   I was honored last week to write an op-ed about this issue with a  former member of this body, Senator Harkin of Iowa, somebody the  Presiding Officer knows very well. Senator Harkin was one of the  congressional authors of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Senator  Harkin was a champion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act. All the issues surrounding Americans with disabilities were very  close to his heart. We really miss that because he was such a champion,  and I am not sure anybody can really fill his shoes on that issue. But  we wrote an op-ed about this disabilities point in Time magazine that  has gotten a lot of attention because it touches every family.   I will start to recap a little bit now as I await my colleague who is  going to be following me. I will just go back to where I started. This  is not a minor matter. It is a little bit unusual to be on the floor at  10 to 4 in the morning. It is a little unusual to be speaking 30 hours  in a row. I had some folks ask me: Why would you do 30 hours of  speeches on this? I said: Well, don't you think the Secretary of  Education is important enough--education in our country is important  enough to spend a day and a half, a day and a quarter talking about it?   I go back to that Jeffersonian vision: Progress in government and all  else depends upon the broadest possible diffusion of knowledge among  the general population. The United States, beginning in the early  1900s--then after the GI bill it really accelerated. We became the  educational leader in the world. We weren't necessarily that during the  1800s--Germany, other nations, England were--but we really became the  educational leader. We made education available to all. The GI bill  helped democratize higher education and make it available to many more.   Our education system is still one of our crown jewels. The number of  foreign students who come to our country to go to college, compared to  the reverse, is still a tribute to the fact our education system is so  strong. I haven't really talked about higher education at all. That is  also within the province of the Secretary of Education. The basic point  I am making is, of anything we do that is about whether we will be  successful as a country tomorrow, education is key. That is why we are  taking 30 hours to dig into issues of concern.   I put three questions on the table. The three I put on the table are  all about K-12 education. I had colleagues at the hearing who asked  searching questions about higher education, the cost of higher  education, student loan debt, what is the right way to deal with debt,  how do we make college less expensive. These are critical issues too. I  am very passionate about a career in technical education. My dad was a  welder, and I ran a school in Honduras that taught kids to be  carpenters and welders. This is a big and important job. It is such a  big and important job, it would be wrong to expect any person to be an  expert on all of it. That would not be a fair hurdle to set for  somebody. You are going to have to come in and bring expertise in and  hire good people to work with you, but I think there are some  fundamental threshold questions: Can you support and be a champion for  public education? That seems fundamental. Do you believe in equal  accountability for everybody that gets Federal dollars? That seems  fundamental. Do you believe that kids with disabilities should be able  to get this kind of education? That seems fundamental. And in those  areas, Mrs. DeVos did not succeed.   I voted for a number of the Cabinet nominees of President Trump. I am  not standing here taking the position that I am voting against all of  them. In fact, I voted for quite a few because even if they would not  be people who I would nominate, President Trump is the President. He is  entitled to have his own team, but the advice and consent function of  the Senate means, in certain cases, if people do not seem to meet the  threshold criteria for being able to do the job and do it well--that is  how you exercise advice and consent and express opposition to a  nominee. That is what I am going to do in this case.   I yield the floor.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this bill has a complex backstory, but it  serves a simple purpose--to allow a small daycare facility in Virginia  to undertake routine repairs and maintenance.   For more than 20 years, the Plains Area Day Care Center in Broadway,  VA, has served children from moderate-income families in Rockingham  County. This facility sits on a 3-acre parcel that was once Federal  land before the National Park Service conveyed it to Rockingham County  in 1989  [[Page S869]]  under the Federal Lands to Parks Program. The county in turn leases  this land to the center for $1 per year, with a contract that runs  through the year 2027.   The center is in need of repairs and maintenance, including a new  roof; however, it has had difficulty in securing private financing for  these activities because of the complex land ownership structure-- Federal land conveyed conditionally to a county and leased to a private  company. Due to Virginia's status as a Dillon Rule State, Rockingham  County cannot execute a loan either.   This bill would specify that the 1989 land conveyance is transferred  in fee simple, with no further use restrictions. I appreciate the goal  of the Federal Lands to Parks Program to preserve land as open space,  particularly after having overseen the preservation of 400,000 acres of  open space in Virginia during my time as Governor of the Commonwealth.  There are no plans to develop the open space on this site, only to fix  the daycare center building--a former Forest Service garage that has  been on the site since before its transfer from Federal ownership.   My Virginia colleague, Congressman Bob Goodlatte, has introduced  companion legislation in the House of Representatives. During the 114th  Congress, this bill was passed unanimously through the full House as a  standalone; reported favorably without opposition by the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee; and adopted by unanimous consent to be  included in the Senate's bipartisan Energy bill. Unfortunately, it fell  just short of final passage.   This is a small modification that simply removes unnecessary  bureaucratic hurdles and allows the daycare center to continue doing  what it has been doing for 25 years. I am pleased to partner with  Congressman Goodlatte in this commonsense, bipartisan effort.                                  ______                                         By Mr. COTTON:   S. 332. A bill to restrict funding for the Preparatory Commission for  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.    Mr. President, this bill has a complex backstory, but it  serves a simple purpose--to allow a small daycare facility in Virginia  to undertake routine repairs and maintenance.

I am pleased to partner with  Congressman Goodlatte in this commonsense, bipartisan effort.                                  ______    Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Senator  Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General. I thought very carefully about  this matter and about what it means to oppose a colleague. We had an  unusual night last night, where one of our Members was ordered to stop  speaking as she explained her opposition. Comments that  [[Page S957]]  would have been allowed regarding any other Cabinet nominee were ruled  unacceptable because this nominee also sits in this body. I voted to  overturn that ruling and restore my colleague's speaking privileges  because I was of the opinion that the constitutional duty to advise and  consent on nominations should allow for debate.   But whatever my opinions about the ruling, I do have to acknowledge  that standing on the floor to speak in opposition to a colleague is not  an everyday occurrence. We do disagree every day, all of us, even  within our own caucuses on matters of policy, but there is something  more personal about taking the floor to take a position regarding a  sitting Senator who has been nominated for a Senate-confirmable  position.   I know Senator Sessions well. We served together on the Armed  Services Committee. We attend a weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast  together. We have taken codel trips together. I consider Senator  Sessions a friend, and I respect that he has been repeatedly sent to  this body by the voters of his State, but while we can and should be  friends, strive to be friends, in this Chamber, we are not ultimately  here about friendship. We are here to do people's business. And  significant differences in our opinions and convictions are not to be  papered over, even when we find ourselves in different positions than  our friends.   Some Members of this body ran for President, and I did not support  them, even though they were my friends. And some people in this Chamber  did not support me to be Vice President, even though we are friends.  There is nothing unusual about that. We all understand it. We must  treat each other with respect and civility. We are still called to, in  the words of Lincoln, ``be firm in the right as God gives us to see  what is right.''   So based upon how I see the right and on my convictions, I cannot  support my colleague for the position because I do not have confidence  in his ability to be a champion for civil rights, to wisely advise the  administration on matters involving immigration, and to be resolute as  the Nation's chief law enforcement official that torture is contrary to  American values.   This one matters to me a lot. This appointment is very critical. The  Attorney General is one of the four Cabinet appointees who are not  allowed to be engaged in political activity: Secretary of Treasury,  Attorney General, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense. They are  beyond politics and supposed to be above politics. They must have an  independent gravitas and even be willing to challenge the President.  The mission of the Department of Justice cannot be more important. For  17 years, before I got into State politics, I was a civil rights  lawyer. I read a book, ``Simple Justice,'' when I was in law school,  about the lawyers who battled to end segregated education in this  country. Even though I really didn't know any lawyers and certainly  didn't know any civil rights lawyers--and was living in kind of an  Irish Catholic neighborhood in the suburbs of Kansas City--I decided I  wanted to devote my life to this.   So I moved to Virginia in 1984 and started practicing civil rights  law, and I did it for 17 years. I will always remember--and I bet you  will too--my first client, the first case that I had that was really  mine. A young woman who walked into my office and told me she had been  turned away from an apartment, and she thought it was because of the  color of her skin. I was able to prove that was the case, and so we  were able to win, but what I remember about Lorraine was how it made  her feel. She was my age. She had just finished school. She was looking  for an apartment, her first apartment away from home, just like I had  done. While my experience getting a job, finding an apartment, getting  out on my own had been a positive, her experience had been a negative.  And she was going to have that feeling and carry it with her every time  she looked for a house for the rest of her life: Am I going to be  treated differently because of the color of my skin? What had been a  happy occasion for me, as a young man venturing out into the world, had  been a sad one and a difficult one for her. That started 17 years of  fighting in State and Federal courthouses for people who had been  turned away from housing or fired or slander or otherwise treated  poorly, either because of their race or their disability or because of  their advocacy about important public policy issues.   The civil rights laws of this country protect the liberty of  minorities of all kinds who otherwise could be tyrannized by the  majority view in their community. The promise of equal justice under  the law is sacrosanct and fundamental. And in this battle, the Attorney  General is the guardian of liberty, or in a wise Biblical phrase, the  ``Watcher on the Wall.''   Judges sit in their courts and they wait for cases to come to them,  but an Attorney General is charged with going out and finding  wrongdoing and making sure it stopped. None of the advances that our  country has made in the civil rights field has happened without a  supportive Department of Justice and Attorney General. And those of us  out in the field, lawyers who were taking cases, but especially the  clients who simply seek equal justice under law, they have to view the  Attorney General as their champion.   In 1963, a married couple in Northeast DC sat down at their kitchen  table not far from here, and they wrote a letter to a lawyer in town. I  want to read the letter to you.         Dear sir: I am writing to you concerning a problem we have.       5 years ago my husband and I were married here in the       District. We then returned to Virginia to live. My husband is       white, I am part negro and part Indian. At the time, we did       not know that there was a law in Virginia against mixed       marriages. Therefore we were jailed and tried in a little       town of Bowling Green. We were to leave the State to make our       home. The problem is we are not allowed to visit our       families. The judge said if we enter the State within the       next 30 years that we will have to spend 1 year in jail. We       know we cannot live there, but we would like to go back once       in a while to visit our families and friends. We have three       children and cannot afford an attorney. We wrote the Attorney       General, he suggested that we get in touch with you for       advice. Please help us if you can. Hope to hear from you real       soon. Yours truly--Mr. And Mrs. Richard Loving.    That attorney, Bernie Cohen, became a friend of mine. And his partner  Phil Hirshcop and Bernie took the case of this married couple all the  way to the Supreme Court, and 50 years ago the Supreme Court struck  down interracial marriage in this country. But the case started with a  couple who, having no where else to turn, thought, if we write the  Attorney General, surely he will be a champion for us and he will help  us redress this horrible wrong. That is who the Attorney General needs  to be. The powerful never have a hard time finding somebody to  represent them in court, but the poor or oppressed or those who don't  have anybody else to stand up for them, they need a justice system that  will treat them fairly, and they need an Attorney General who will  embody that value.   Three areas: civil rights, immigration, and torture.   In the area of civil rights, Senator Sessions' record here as a  Senator has been troubling to me. In the past, when he was considered  for a judicial position, he declared that the voting rights laws were  ``intrusive.''   He welcomed the ``good news'' when the Supreme Court in the last few  years struck down, in the Shelby County case, parts of the Voting  Rights Act. He has not engaged in efforts that many of us have tried to  engage in to improve and fix the law.   This is an important issue to know about an Attorney General whose  Department is supposed to be the chief enforcer of the Nation's voting  rights laws. Voting rights are under attack all over this country. The  Attorney General must be a champion of those laws.   Senator Sessions has opposed protections for LGBT citizens in this  body. He voted against the elimination of don't ask, don't tell. He  voted against the passage of the Matthew Shepard hate crimes bill. He  has publicly stated numerous times his opposition to marriage equality.  As far as I know, he has never stated otherwise that he has changed  those opinions.   The Senator spoke on the Senate floor about the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act in 2000. He said that this beneficial law  was ``a big factor in accelerating the decline in civility and  discipline in classrooms all over this country.'' This is very  troubling to me as someone who believes that act is one of the Nation's  preeminent civil rights laws.  [[Page S958]]    There are other examples, but I won't belabor the point.   The Loving family wrote to Attorney Generally Robert Kennedy to help  them battle injustice because they believed he would protect their  important civil rights values at stake. I am not confident that people  hard-pressed in this country, who feel marginalized, will see the  office as a potential ally and champion under Senator Sessions. This is  particularly the case when we have a President who has been  successfully sued in the past for civil rights violations and who makes  prejudicial comments about people based on their gender, their  religion, their immigrant status, or their disability.   Second, immigration. Our immigration policies are critical. We need  to fix our laws. In my time in the Senate, Senator Sessions has been  the most vocal Senator in opposition to what I believe are reasonable  and necessary reforms. His floor comments and his obvious personal  passion around this issue are clear, but I think his policies are  simply wrong.   Immigration does not hurt our economy; it helps it. Jefferson  recognized this in the Declaration of Independence. In his Bill of  Particulars against King George, he said: We do not want to live under  your tyranny. You won't let us have a good immigration system.   Jefferson recognized it, and all through the years, the inflow of  talent, the blood of innovation and talent and new ideas from  immigrants, has been part of what has made our country great. That is  why there is such a consensus in favor of immigration reform from the  labor unions and the chambers of commerce. The CBO says that it will  increases our net worth and GDP.   Immigration does not hurt our workers, as Senator Sessions often  claims it does. A reform would help our workers by eliminating the  ability of people to live and work in the shadows and be paid  substandard wages that undercut the wages of others.   Senator Sessions' views on immigration even extend to a critical  program like the Special Immigrant Visa Program, which grants special  protection to foreign citizens, especially those from Afghanistan and  Iraq, who have helped our troops on the battlefield. They signed up to  help Americans who are in the service. They put their lives at risk for  doing so. Because of that, we have a special program to accord them a  welcome that they are deserved in this country.   Senators McCain, Shaheen, and I and many others have worked on this  program, and Senator Sessions has been a determined opponent of the SIV  Program, and I just can't understand why. If we will not help the  people who help us, then who will choose to help us in the future? Some  of these SIV immigrants were turned away at airports after the poorly  conceived and poorly implemented immigration order of President Trump.    As we contemplate some of this President's outlandish and  discriminatory claims about immigrants and as we deal with the  aftermath of this poor order, we have to separate the extreme and the  untrue from our legitimate security concerns. A good lawyer often needs  to be a check against the bad instincts of his client. In this area, I  am not confident Senator Sessions can do that.   Finally, torture. Like the vast majority of this body, I believe  torture is contrary to American values. That is why I was proud to work  with Senators McCain, Reed, Feinstein, and others in 2015 to pass a law  clearly stating that torture would not be allowed by any agency of our  government--not just the military but any agency of our government.  This law passed the Senate overwhelmingly and in a strongly bipartisan  fashion. But Senator Sessions was one of a small number of Senators who  opposed the law, who opposed a ban on torture.   When we met, I asked Senator Sessions why he had opposed the law, why  he had opposed this bipartisanship bill. This is a fundamental question  for any of us but certainly for an individual who wants to occupy the  Nation's chief law enforcement position. His response was not at all  convincing. I don't think the Nation should have an Attorney General  with an ambiguous record about torture.   While most Federal agencies have a general counsel, it is ultimately  the Attorney General who sits at the very top of the pyramid of  attorneys advising the President in providing this legal advice. This  President has--very unwisely, in my view--stated that he thinks torture  is both justifiable and effective. I believe we need an Attorney  General who will check that instinct and not support it or justify it.   I will say this in conclusion: There is an independence that is  necessary in this position. It is established in law in this position  and three other Cabinet positions. Any Attorney General must be able to  stand firm for the rule of law, even against the powerful Executive who  nominated him or her. In this administration, I believe that  independence is even more necessary.   I oppose Senator Sessions, who is a friend, who is someone I respect  for this position, because I believe his record raises doubts about  whether he can be a champion for those who need this office most, and  it also raises doubts about whether he can curb unlawful overage by  this Executive.   I yield the floor.
