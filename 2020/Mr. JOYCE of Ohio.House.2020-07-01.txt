 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of U.S. Marine Sergeant Wolfgang K. Weninger.   On June 16, just days before he was set to graduate from the U.S.  Army Airborne School, Sergeant Weninger was tragically killed in a  training accident. He was 28 years old.   Sergeant Weninger, who went by Kyle or Wolf back home, was a graduate  of Kenston High School and a local sports legend in Geauga County.   Known for his selflessness, Kyle joined the Marines in 2015 and  immediately excelled. In roughly 4 years, he earned the coveted Marine  Special Operator Insignia and rose to the rank of sergeant.   Kyle's instructors said that he possessed unsurmountable  determination, a deep sense of integrity, and an unconquerable spirit.  They called him a natural leader, someone who always looked out for his  team.   I had the opportunity to speak to my old friend, Kyle's father,  Ernie, this past week and express my profound condolences directly to  him. As a parent, I can only imagine how difficult this time is for  him, Mrs. Henry, and their families.    Mr. Speaker, please join me in a moment of silence to honor Sergeant  Wolfgang K. Weninger and to pray for his loved ones in the wake of  their tragic loss.
