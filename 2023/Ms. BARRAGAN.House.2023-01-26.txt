 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 24.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to protect  the public health of our communities in this plan to increase oil and  gas production on public lands. My amendment prevents Federal lands  from being included in the required oil drilling plan if it is within  3,200 feet of a residence, a school, or a hospital.   This is a commonsense measure to limit the harmful impact of this  legislation. People living near oil wells are exposed to air pollutants  that can cause asthma, cancer, pregnancy complications, and preterm  births. I have seen it firsthand in my district. Kids are suffering  from headaches and nosebleeds from being too close to oil drilling.   Come to my district in California in Wilmington, Mr. Chairman, to  meet these kids. See how many of them have asthma inhalers around their  necks and in their pockets.   But whether you are in an urban community, a suburban community, a  rural community, or a Tribal community, everyone has a right to clean  air and a safe environment.   Now, oil and gas producing States like Colorado, Pennsylvania,  Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico have drilling setback laws to  protect communities. California also has passed a public health setback  of 3,200 feet for any new well.   This is a commonsense amendment for Democrats and Republicans to  protect communities near our Federal lands from drilling.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment to  protect public health, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
