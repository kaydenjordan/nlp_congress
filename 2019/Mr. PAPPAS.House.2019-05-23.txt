 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of thousands of American  heroes who may be unjustly denied the opportunity to serve the country  they love.   Last month, the administration's discriminatory ban on transgender  military service took effect, telling 15,000 Active-Duty servicemembers  they don't belong in uniform. That is completely unacceptable.   And now these brave patriots are worried not just about the loss of a  career that they love, but also about the loss of healthcare benefits  they have earned through years of service and sacrifice.   That is why, yesterday, I was proud to introduce the SERVE Act. My  legislation will enshrine into law a simple pledge to every veteran  that they will receive the benefits they deserve no matter how they  identify or whom they love.   Americans willing to lay down their lives for our country are  entitled to honor and dignity. That is a basic promise we make to  everyone who puts on the uniform, and we can never go back on that  promise.                            ____________________
