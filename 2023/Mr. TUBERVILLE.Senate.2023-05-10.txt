 Madam President, reserving the right.    Madam President, I want to thank my friends from the  House for their support today. But the question today is, What kind of  Nation do we want to be? This debate speaks to the moral fabric of our  society.   We boast the most powerful military in the history of the world. The  purpose of that military is for the strongest among us to protect the  weak.   In America, those with the broadest shoulders guard those with the  narrowest. Yet the Biden administration wants to mobilize our military  against the weakest and the most defenseless--the unborn. I believe  that is wrong. It is immoral.   My colleague has described an abortion as just another medical  procedure. He mentioned Lasik. He also talked about bunions.   The children of our Nation are not just another routine medical  procedure. That is why I am standing here to object.   For 40 years, we have had a bipartisan agreement--40 years. Americans  may have different views about abortion, but the majority of this  country believes that taxpayers should not have to fund abortions.  Secretary Austin blew up 40 years of tradition, an agreement, by just  one memo--one memo. There was no debate in the Senate. There was no  vote in the House. And here is why. They didn't have the votes. This  administration couldn't change abortion laws here in the Senate or the  House, so they wrote a memo.   Our Cabinet Secretaries aren't supposed to be politicians. They are  there to uphold and enforce the laws made in this building. Yet  Secretary Austin is the most political Secretary of Defense we have  ever seen.   I am glad to hear Senator Warren got her prompt reply from Secretary  Austin this week. As I recall, she made her request on April 6. She got  a response a month later. That is certainly not the kind of treatment I  have received from the Pentagon. Maybe it has got something to do with  my political party.   Nearly a year ago I joined 12 other Republicans in a letter to  Secretary Austin, this past July. We asked the Secretary to  substantiate the comment he made about abortions being necessary for  military readiness. We are still waiting for a reply.   In November, we sent the Department another letter. This time it was  just asking for a short and small briefing--just a briefing. That is  all we were asking for. We heard they were going to move forward with  an abortion policy that was illegal. Secretary Austin did not reply.   In December, I informed Secretary Austin in writing that I would hold  his highest nominees if he went forward with this unlawful abortion  policy. Well, in February, Secretary Austin implemented that policy, so  I kept my word. The very next day, we put a hold on his nominees.   You know, I didn't get a phone call from Secretary Austin until 1  month after I put the hold into effect--1 month. During the call, he  offered me absolutely no compromise. He didn't offer to meet or  discuss. Unlike Senator Warren, since then, I have heard nothing from  Secretary Austin except what he has said about me--the things that are  pretty negative--in Armed Services Committee hearings.   Ten months into this dispute, the Pentagon and I are still waiting  for one single fact to support this argument--one single fact.   I read Secretary Austin's letter to Senator Warren. It is long on  opinions, short on facts. I also read the boilerplate letter signed by  the former Secretaries of Defense that were put out this week. It reads  like a Democrat press release. The letter simply repeats the same  unsubstantiated claims made by Senator Warren, Senator Bennet, and  Senator Schumer. Frankly, I think these letters vindicate my opinion.  These letters were part of a coordinated effort by the Democrats to use  [[Page S1591]]  the authority and the prestige of the Secretary of Defense to distract  from the facts. Frankly, I don't think that will work either.   The Biden administration has done everything possible to turn our  military into just one more institution for leftwing social  engineering. Well, for all of history, Secretary Austin will be the  Defense Secretary who oversaw America's worst military defeat since  Vietnam.   The Senator from Colorado has twice now accused me of  mischaracterizing what he did just a few months ago. My goal is to end  an illegal abuse of taxpayer funds. That is what we are trying to do  here today.   Senator Bennet's hold was so he could get a meeting with Secretary  Austin. So how did Senator Bennet's threatened hold end? Senator Bennet  got what he wanted. Senator Bennet got his meeting with the Secretary  of Defense. Again, this is more than I received.   So let's remember what I am asking for. I am asking for the Pentagon  to drop a policy that is illegal. I am asking Secretary Austin to do  his job and follow the law. I understand that Senator Bennet is a  strong supporter of abortion. That is all understood. But if he wants  this abortion policy, then let's pass a bill.   But it hasn't been done that way. Democrats know that they can't get  that done. They know they don't have the votes. The burden is not on me  to pass legislation to stop this illegal policy. That is not my job.  The burden is on the administration to stop breaking the law.   I am glad that Senator Warren is concerned about our military  readiness. Maybe she will actually vote for this year's Defense bill.  She hasn't voted for it since 2017. Senator Warren has a long history  of holding military leadership nominations--a long history. In fact,  she held the nomination of one of our witnesses at the most recent  Armed Services Committee hearing, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall.  This was the same witness she asked about my hold, was it a big  problem? Senator Warren has held his nomination several times. And  guess what. She got what she wanted from the Pentagon, just like  Senator Bennet with his hold on military nominations.    So I am glad Senator Warren is concerned about military readiness. It  excites me that she is excited about the military. Maybe now Senator  Warren and Senator Schumer will support funding our military at a level  necessary to actually win a war. That is something else that they have  resisted doing throughout their long careers in Washington.   If Democrats were actually concerned about readiness, then we would  be voting. The U.S. Senate has had more than 30 days off already this  year. If we want to pass this, let's vote. But we have had 30 days off.  That is not including the weekends. The rhetoric just doesn't match the  reality of how this is being handled.   This is more than enough time for us to have confirmed literally all  the nominations we have been talking about. We could have already done  this, taking them one at a time. This could have been done. Yet that is  not what we are doing.   This week, we are having another 3-day workweek. We are getting ready  to go on recess 8 days from now. If my Democratic colleagues actually  were concerned, then we would be voting on these nominations.   And if Secretary Austin is so worried he can't live without these  nominees, he can suspend his memo. That is all he has to do. Drop your  memo, and these nominees will proceed by unanimous consent. I am a man  of my word. I will stand down. Until then, I am standing up for the  Constitution and the unborn, and that is why I object.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following article in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                           Not Enough Abortions?            (By Marjorie Dannenfelser, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith)         When Americans think about supporting U.S. troops, they       usually think about servicemembers with difficult deployments       far from their families. Or wounded veterans in need of       health care, jobs, or homes. You know what doesn't top the       list? Abortion. ``Not enough abortions'' probably never       crosses their minds as a problem that needs solving, much       less at taxpayer expense.        AT this very moment, unbeknownst to many Americans, the       Biden administration is using our tax dollars to pay travel       expenses for elective abortions--and not only for       servicemembers, but for their kids, spouses, and other       dependents. This isn't just a brazen moral affront to       hardworking Americans, it is also illegal. At this pace, it       is estimated to lead to an increase of more than 4,000 unborn       children killed in abortions each year.        Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama is doing all Americans       who value life a great service by exposing this scheme and       vowing to put a hold on promotions at the Pentagon until it       stops. Senator Tuberville is not alone. A majority Americans       and many colleagues in the Senate and House support his       effort to hold the Biden administration accountable to the       law and the people.        Americans have made it clear repeatedly that they abhor       their tax dollars going to fund abortions. The latest annual       Marist poll shows 60% of Americans--millions of Independents       and rank-and-file Democrats included--oppose using tax       dollars to fund abortion domestically, and 78% oppose using       tax dollars to fund abortion abroad.        The people's will is expressed in our federal laws and in       bills that Congress votes on year after year. The most       familiar is the longstanding Hyde Amendment, which saves       millions of lives by keeping taxpayer-funded abortion out of       programs like Medicaid and has been reapproved annually in       larger bills supported by Democrats. In addition, the Defense       Department specifically has been prohibited in permanent law       from paying for elective abortions for nearly 40 years.        Pro-abortion Democrats have failed to get rid of these       critical protections through legislation, so the Biden       administration is resorting to violating federal law to       bypass them and impose agenda that would never fly at the       ballot box.        Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the pro-abortion media       accuse Senator Tuberville of impairing military readiness.       But the truth is that Senate Democrats don't need Senator       Tuberville's help to move personnel appointments forward--      they simply complain that he is not helping fast-track them.       The issue he raises is not frivolous, it is one of life or       death.        Democrats also complain that service members don't have       enough access to abortion on demand. With a handful of       exceptions like North Korea and China, virtually the entire       world--including most of Europe--has stronger national       protections for unborn children than the United States.       Clearly, this has never ground our military to a halt.        Only when the U.S. Supreme Court returned the right to       protect unborn children and their mothers to the people and       their elected representatives, and more than a dozen states       moved swiftly to let the people's consensus become law, did       this become a political maneuver for Democrats to appease its       radical, angry base.        We are grateful for all those who are already making their       voices heard, and we hope others o have not yet joined in       will soon add theirs. The GOP's long tradition of standing       for life is a great strength and there  [[Page S1598]]       is growing support in Congress to block this administration's       lawless abortion policies for our military, including Iowa       Senator Joni Ernst's bill to do just that. Sadly, Senate       Democrats have insisted on promoting abortion on demand until       birth, paid for by the taxpayers, and stonewalled Senator       Ernst's legislation, rather than allow any debate.        What is more important: that Majority Leader Schumer and       Senate Democrats spend less 1e on the Senate floor approving       military promotions and nominations, or that the most       vulnerable and defenseless of American lives are protected       from President Biden's lawlessness?        The time is now to hold the Biden administration       accountable for its illegal policies that have conscripted       our military into facilitating the violence of abortion. We       are proud to stand with Senator Tuberville, Senator Ernst,       and others in fighting back. Together we will not back down.                            ____________________
