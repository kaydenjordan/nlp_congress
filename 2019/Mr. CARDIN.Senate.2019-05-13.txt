 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Jacqueline  ``Jackie'' Louise Falk. Jackie was an incredible force in Democratic  politics for decades. She left behind a tightknit family of relatives  and a political family that stretches around the world.   Jackie is best known for holding a key role in nearly every  Democratic National Convention from 1972 through 2004. She also was on  staff at the Democratic National Committee (DNC), as an aide to then- treasurer Robert Strauss, during the time of the Watergate break-in;  she served as assistant to the counselor to the President during the  Carter Administration; and served as administrative assistant and chief  of staff to U.S. Representative Leo Zeferetti in the early 1980s.   Jackie suffered a stroke last week and passed away on Wednesday, May  8, surrounded by her loving, extended family. Jackie never sought the  spotlight. but left her mark on our party and our country by bringing a  semblance of order to the sometimes-chaotic world of nominating the  President of the United States.   Today, I would like to honor Jackie's memory by sharing some of her  remarkable story. To tell the story of Jackie Falk is more than  politics, although it is weaved throughout her life. As one friend,  Yolanda Caraway, described her: ``Jackie was one of the sweetest,  kindest and funniest people I've ever known and I'm really going to  miss her, especially her wonderful laugh.''   Jackie was born in Trenton, NJ, to Minnie and Arlo Falk. She grew up  with her brother Albert and sister Lisa. Jackie got hooked on politics  and public service at a young age thanks to her Aunt Violet (Williams  Biglane), who, after service in the Navy WAVES, went on to work as the  personal secretary to former Senator and former Vice President Hubert  Humphrey.   Jackie would tell stories of interacting with Hubert Humphrey and  passing out flyers for his campaign. In 1964, Jackie accompanied Aunt  Violet to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, NJ, to  see Humphrey nominated as Vice President. Aunt Violet helped Jackie  make her way to the Democratic National Committee, where she started  working in 1972 for then-DNC Treasurer Robert Strauss. Jackie went on  to work closely with every Democratic Party chairman from Strauss  through Terry McAuliffe.   When Terry McAuliffe, former Governor of Virginia and former chairman  of the DNC, heard of Jackie's death, he had this to say: ``We lost a  legend. The Democratic Party and Democratic National Conventions will  never be the same. Jackie's convention credentialing was a labor of  love and truly a work of art. She conducted her credential operation  like Mozart conducted his symphonies. She never ceased to amaze. I and  so many others will forever be in her debt and will miss her deeply.''   In 1975, Jackie moved to Atlanta to work on the Presidential campaign  of Jimmy Carter. She returned to Washington to work on his White House  staff in the Office of the Counselor to the President. The Washington  region would remain her home, even as she would take up temporary  residence every 4 years in whatever city was the latest to host the  Democratic nominating convention. Oftentimes, she was one of the first  people working on a convention and one of the last to wrap things up.   After President Carter lost relection, Jackie worked on Capitol Hill,  where she served as chief of staff, administrative assistant, to  Congressman Leo Zeferetti from January 1981 to January 1983. She then  was hired early for the Democratic Convention in San Francisco, which  was the start of her run overseeing credentials and a larger swath of  the conventions.   From 1984 on, she was responsible for credentials--who gets the  precious access passes and where they could go--  [[Page S2783]]  either as credentials director or as deputy convention manager. This  made her one of the most sought after and powerful women in Democratic  politics.   In the 1990s, between conventions and DNC work, Jackie started an  interior decorating business. Clients came from among her political  contacts, including Mary Matalin and James Carville.   Jackie loved her family; she cheered on their milestones and loved  celebrating holidays together. She is survived by her brother and  sister-in-law Albert and Debbie Enourato; sister Lisa Enourato; nieces  Whitney and Hannah McNees; nephews Will, Luke, and Eli McNees and Wyatt  and Gunnar Enourato. Her great love also was for her Great Pyrenees;  the latest was Bree, who we know misses her dearly.   Jackie also built an immensely loyal political family that came  together every 4 years for conventions and as often as possible for  happy hour or dinner at Jackie's house. She was an incredible mentor  and role model. She demonstrated how a woman in politics could be both  strong and gentle, funny and serious.   Let me close by saying that May is National Stroke Awareness Month.  Everyone is encouraged to know the signs and understand how important  it is to get help quickly. The minutes and hours right after stroke  occurs are crucial. According to the Centers for Disease Control--CDC-- stroke, while preventable, is the fifth leading cause of death in the  United States and a leading cause of severe disability. Jackie Falk  died of a stroke, and the CDC says that approximately 60 percent of  individuals who die from strokes are women. I urge the women and the  men out there not to ignore the signs, such as sudden numbness,  confusion, trouble seeing, trouble walking, and severe headache.   The political world will never again see someone the likes of Jackie  Falk. Her memory will be a blessing to her family, all those who knew  her, and all those who benefited from her hard work, dedication, and  love of the Democratic Party and the good it can accomplish.                            ____________________
