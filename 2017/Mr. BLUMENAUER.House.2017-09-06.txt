 Mr. Speaker, we return to Capitol Hill amidst chaos-- wildfires in the West, choking smoke in my community, the cruelty of  800,000 young people having their lives turned upside down  unnecessarily by Trump yesterday, and we are dancing with the debt  ceiling chaos with the world economy. All are made unnecessarily worse.  Even Harvey was predictable due to government action and inaction.   Congress should stop pretending these things are beyond our control.  A majority of Congress would treat young DREAMers, fairly if given a  right to vote for it on the floor of the House.   We should fund disaster prevention, including forest fires, and stop  subsidizing more floods, and not play unnecessary games with the world  economy, pretending we won't pay for money we have already spent.   In the end, we will probably spend the next 3 weeks setting up the  next crisis later in the year.   Isn't it time that Congress stop playing the victim and take charge?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues on  the floor of the House dealing with autonomous vehicles. I think this  is one of the most important issues that nobody is really focused on. I  wish it were not on the suspension calendar and we had a chance to  spend several hours discussing it here.   What you have done is forge a bipartisan coalition to be able to  leapfrog going forward, to be able to not just focus on safety, but how  autonomous vehicles have the opportunity to reshape the American  landscape dealing with recovering right-of-way and being able to have  new economic opportunities.   But this must be done right. The fact that ``Driver'' is the number 1  category of employment for men without a college education, means there  could be some problems here. If we don't do it right, we can actually  increase congestion rather than decrease it.   But I think you have established the framework to allow us to go  forward, to be able to capitalize on this innovation, to be able to  accelerate American leadership and avoid the problem we had with drones  where the FAA was not really capable of dealing with drones which were  more like flying cell phones than dealing with jets. You are trying to  lay a foundation that I think is going to help us avoid that problem,  and it is going to pay dividends for years to come.    Mr. Chairman, this is an interesting question about  an opportunity for people in a region to try and craft a solution.   I have been working with people in Clark County for 40 years, because  this has been a serious problem between Portland and Vancouver, Oregon  and Washington.   The gentlewoman may have noticed that this is a serious problem for  her constituents. In fact, they pay more of the burden in terms of  congestion and lost opportunity for economic development. I hear about  it all the time from businesses in our communities.   There is no solution to this congestion problem without either  investing money or sending some pricing signals to try and change some  behaviors. Not everybody has to cross the I-205 and I-5 freeway at 8:30  in the morning and 5:30 in the evening.   What has been proposed in Oregon is to look at alternatives. I am not  going to prejudge what it is, but I would notice that there is a  yearlong process that is underway, including people on the other side  of the river, because we have always worked with Clark County and  previously with the legislators in the State of Washington and people  in Congress to try and figure out how we work together. We are one  region. There are 60,000 people who work in Oregon every day who have  to negotiate a really troublesome area.   The Federal Government is still trying to pay for 2017 infrastructure  with 1993 dollars. We haven't raised the gas tax since 1993, when  States around the country have been stepping up, including in  Washington and Puget Sound. Voters are expressing their own frustration  and taxing themselves to solve these problems.   The Federal Government has been missing in action. In fact, many of  my friends on the Republican side of the aisle are looking at creative  programs for public-private partnerships. There were 26 Senators who  talked about devolving the interstate freeway system and the Federal  transportation partnership to the States.   For us to swoop in when the Federal Government has been missing in  action and try to help the gentlewoman's constituents and mine and to  try and pull the rug out from underneath, an approach that may have  some potential and would in fact require voter support, I think, is an  egregious overreach.   I may have missed it, but I haven't heard the gentlewoman's proposals  to pay for solutions for her constituents. I have offered some. We are  working on the Oregon side. Occasionally, we have had some partnerships  with the State of Washington, who collapsed the proposal for a Columbia  crossing because they weren't willing to put any money on the table.  For the Federal Government to intervene and take away this option I  think is outrageous and it is wrong.   Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire as to the  time remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington has 2 minutes  remaining.   Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chair, I will make this brief.   I think a lot of the points the gentleman from Oregon made are valid,  and I don't reject them at all. I think we need to come up with  solutions to pay for these things. We need to fix the congestion issue.  We are one region, and we need to work together.   I completely agree with all of that, which is why the scheme that was  put together to tax one portion, essentially charge a toll on  Washington commuters who are paying into the Portland and Oregon  economy through their income taxes already and using that money  collected from those tolls not on the bridge, not on the Columbia River  crossing, the area where we all agree we need to find a solution, but  using it elsewhere in the State is fundamentally unfair. He made my  point. That is the problem.   It is not that I oppose the idea of tolls. We are going to have to  bring something to the table. I am not afraid to advocate for that.  That is not the issue here. Even within this commission, they are going  to be looking at other ways to fund their projects throughout the  State. That is great.   It is fundamentally unfair to pick the pocket of working people who  don't even have a right to redress Oregon's government. They don't get  to vote. So to take their money because you can smacks of really being  a bully. That is what I am against; that is what is unfair; that is  what I won't stand for; and that is why I am offering this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 54 Offered by Mr. Grothman    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 54  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
