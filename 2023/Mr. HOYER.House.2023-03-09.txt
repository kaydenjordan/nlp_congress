 Madam Speaker, I rise today, as I have in the past, on  this floor for Republican staffers and Democratic staffers to thank  them, to thank them for their service to the House of Representatives,  for their service to the Congress of the United States, and for their  service to individual Members and to leadership.   I do so again today for my friend who was with me for approximately a  quarter of a century, Dr. Keith Abouchar. He has long served as my  senior policy adviser on everything from oversight and financial  services to congressional ethics and campaign finance.   After working with me for a few years as a professional staff member  of the House Oversight Committee and the Committee on House  Administration, he joined my leadership staff in 2003.   He recently retired at the beginning of this year from Federal  service after serving this institution, as I said, for more than a  quarter of a century.   Keith Abouchar, Dr. Abouchar, accomplished much in that time. He  [[Page H1215]]  played an instrumental role in negotiating the Help America Vote Act,  spending many early mornings and late nights to enact a law that The  Washington Post later called ``the most significant piece of Federal  election law since the Voting Rights Act.''   Congratulations, Keith.   Similarly, he was integral to helping us pass the ADA Amendments Act  in 2008, which strengthened and carried out the intent of Congress for  the ADA and for future generations.   Keith was also a steadfast advocate for our Federal employees and  went to great lengths to stave off repeated partisan attempts to cut  their pay and benefits and security.   Perhaps the most significant result of Keith's time in my office, of  course, was his marriage to a fellow staffer whose name is Jane. Once  coworkers, they are now parents to two incredible children, Adele and  Henry. He cherishes his role as their father above all else.   It is in this spirit why, when looking back on my time with Keith, I  don't think of the list of groundbreaking laws he helped enact, though  that list is long. Instead, I think the virtues he displayed every day  here on Capitol Hill are what I remember.   Keith has a doctorate in political science. He is an epic consumer of  the printed word. You would typically find him with his head buried in  the mountain of papers on his desk. He made frequent use of the Library  of Congress, read multiple newspapers daily, and often left the office  with a cache of unread papers under his arm.   Few can match Keith's mastery of technical details behind the issues  on which he worked. Even fewer share his ability to understand how  these details impact Americans' everyday lives.   That talent is rooted in Keith's thoughtful demeanor. Quick to offer  a piece of wisdom, a word of encouragement, or an expression of  gratitude, Keith's generosity made him a beloved feature of our team  and of so many people in the private sector and public sector who dealt  with him on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.   We all admired the impressive enthusiasm he brought to his work. I  can recall many meetings where Keith would speak so quickly and  passionately about an issue that we could hardly keep pace.   A lifelong student of philosophy and a devout Catholic, Keith's  earnest energy stems from his belief in the importance of our work in  this, the people's House, and in the ethics that ought to guide each of  us in this institution.   Through it all, Keith maintained a great sense of humor and never  took himself too seriously. He was serious but not serious about  himself.   Although I am proud to praise Keith, everyone should know that he is  a man of deep humility and perhaps would not want me making this speech  on the floor. He is probably squirming in his seat listening to this,  and I hope he is--listening, that is, not squirming.   Nevertheless, he ought to know how much we have appreciated his  service. Who better to serve as my adviser on issues facing our Federal  workers than a man who himself exemplifies the ideal Federal employee,  a man of intellect, a man of integrity, a man of generosity, a man of  humor, but a very serious, hardworking, and effective public servant.   Madam Speaker, if Keith is listening, and I hope he is, I thank him  for everything he has done for our country and wish him well as he  begins this new chapter in an extraordinarily productive career.   Madam Speaker, I bless him and his family, and I wish him Godspeed.                            ____________________
