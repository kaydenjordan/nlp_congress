 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment which helps to ensure that communities ravaged by wildfires,  including the recent October fires, get the help they need to recover.   Last year, we saw the worst fire season in California history. The  October fires alone included 21 major fires that were fought by 11,000  firefighters burning nearly 245,000 acres. Those fires forced 100,000  people to evacuate and destroyed 8,900 homes and structures.  Tragically, 44 people lost their lives.   The City of Santa Rosa is located in my district and was hit  especially hard by the October fires with over 3,000 homes and  businesses destroyed. In the Fountaingrove neighborhood, north of  downtown, the contamination in the water system that resulted directly  from the fire melting the plastic water lines and appurtenances  servicing 350 homes, must be replaced due to ongoing contamination of  benzene, a toxic organic chemical.   As our communities move forward on the long road to recovery, we are  finding that the needs of suburban and urban communities impacted by  devastating wildfires don't always fit neatly into some of FEMA's  current rules and regulations, which seem geared towards hurricane and  flooding response and mitigation.   Issues as simple as whether or not FEMA should cover the costs of  removing standing burned trees or replacing water systems, like the one  in Fountaingrove that was contaminated as a result of the October  fires, are not so simple.   My amendment provides FEMA with the capability and authority to  mitigate these issues by explicitly stating that FEMA hazard mitigation  funding can be used to remove standing, burned trees and replacing  water systems damaged and/or contaminated by wildfires.   I appreciate House leadership working with my office to include this  amendment in the en bloc so that we advance this issue and I look  forward to continuing to work with them to ensure that my district's  fire recovery needs are being met.
