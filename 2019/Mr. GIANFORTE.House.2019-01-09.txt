 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this body to provide  the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana with the overdue  Federal recognition they deserve.   The Little Shell Tribe began petitioning the Federal Government for  recognition in the 1930s, several generations ago. Mr. Speaker, 80  years later, the resolute Tribe continues their efforts.   Last year, the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act  passed this House unanimously. It was the first time that a bill  providing Federal recognition of the Little Shell Tribe passed either  the House or the Senate.   Following passage in the House, however, this uncontroversial bill  hit a roadblock in the Senate. We take up their worthy cause again  today as I introduce the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I call on this body to consider and pass this bill  again. This Congress should provide the Little Shell Tribe with the  Federal recognition it deserves, particularly after eight decades of  dedicated efforts.                            ____________________
