 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4895) to establish the Medgar Evers National Monument in  the State of Mississippi, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4895         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medgar Evers Home National       Monument Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Monument.--The term ``Monument'' means the Medgar Evers       Home National Monument established by section 3.        (2) Historic district.--The term ``Historic District''       means the Medgar Evers Historic District, as included on the       National Register of Historic Places, and as generally       depicted on the Map.        (3) Map.--The term ``Map'' means the map entitled ``Medgar       Evers Home National Monument'', numbered 515/142561, and       dated February 2018.        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National       Park Service.        (5) College.--The term ``College'' means Tougaloo College,       a private educational institution located in Tougaloo,        Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I know this is somewhat unusual, but  I really would like to have the sponsor of this bill have the first  opportunity to speak towards it. It is one of my favorites, so I am  going to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Thompson introducing this bill, and  introducing it with his remarks so far. This is an important one to me,  too, which is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill.   I remember this gentleman, and I remember the events of his  assassination. I think it had an impact on everybody.   Medgar Evers was born in 1925 and served in the military during World  War II in both Germany and France and then became one of those who  fought to try and integrate a law school in the 1950s.   He was assassinated, as Mr. Thompson said, in 1963, and I clearly  remember watching that on the news at the time and being impacted by  it.                                time  1715    Mr. Soto probably wasn't even born then, but the rest of us still  remember this event going on there.   He tragically died within an hour after that shooting and is now  buried in Arlington National Cemetery. The home was donated to Tougaloo  University, and it is currently being operated as a museum with period  pieces, as well as the memorabilia that talks about the legacy of this  icon of the civil rights movement.   I am happy that we are doing this particular bill, because these are  the kinds of projects that should be national monuments. These are the  historical sites that need to be in the National Park System so that  people can go there, they can learn, and, more importantly, so they can  remember. Because it is in forgetting in which we sin; in remembering  is when we will never forget the legacy of Medgar Evers and what he  sacrificed to move this country forward in some particular way.   So I commend Representative Thompson for introducing this  legislation. I am very proud of the way we are doing it. This is the  proper way of creating a national monument: by legislative action and  going through the legislative process, during the hearing, during the  committee, bringing it to the floor, and then taking it over to the  Senate.   I expect this to be passed very quickly. I expect this to become a  reality. And I expect this to be an illustration of how Congress should  be creating national monuments going forward in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will not say the gentleman is just  a child.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 35) to transfer administrative jurisdiction over certain  Bureau of Land Management land from the Secretary of the Interior to  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for inclusion in the Black Hills  National Cemetery, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 35         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Black Hills National       Cemetery Boundary Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Cemetery.--The term ``Cemetery'' means the Black Hills       National Cemetery in Sturgis, South Dakota.        (2) Federal land.--The term ``Federal land'' means the       approximately 200 acres of Bureau of Land Management land       adjacent to the Cemetery, generally depicted as ``Proposed       National Cemetery Expansion'' on the map entitled ``Proposed       Expansion of Black Hills National Cemetery-South Dakota'' and       dated June 16, 2016.

(d) Boundary Modification.--The boundary of the Cemetery is       modified to include the Federal land.        (e) Modification of Public Land Order.--Public Land Order       2112, dated June 6, 1960 (25 Fed. Reg. 5243), is modified to       exclude the Federal land.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), who is the House  sponsor of this particular bill and who has done so much work on this.  I allow her to introduce this piece of legislation that is so  significant to her State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is talking about 200 acres of public property that needs to be  used by a national cemetery that was created back in 1948 as the final  resting place of people who gave their last and gave their all for the  defense of this country. It includes the final resting place of Medal  of Honor Recipient Sergeant Charles Winthrop. A memorial to Korean war  veterans is there. And 16 years ago, it was made part of the National  Cemetery System.   It is significant that we are doing this particular process right  now. I think it is important that both the Bureau of Land Management  and the Veterans Affairs Department are both in support of this  transfer, because this illustrates not only the significance of this  cemetery and what it allows people to do, to honor those who have given  their all for this Nation, but it allows us to have the proper use of  public lands.   Here are now 200 acres of public land that is going to be used for a  public purpose, and that is the reason you have public lands in the  first place. If this 200 acres were simply to sit there with nothing to  do, then there is no reason for anybody to own it in the first place.  But having public lands now used for a public purpose that elevates,  enlightens, and ennobles us is how you are supposed to be using public  lands.   So I am appreciative of Representative Noem for introducing this bill  on several occasions. The last time it actually came to this floor, we  voted on it. It was a tough vote; it was 407-0. I am grateful it  finally has a Senate sponsor and the Senate has actually done something  to send us this bill back so we can allow Representative Noem to do  what she does best in pushing things forward for the State of South  Dakota in a positive and selfless way, and I am looking forward to the  vote on this one.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure. I have no other  speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, April 5, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning S. 35,       the Black Hills National Cemetery Boundary Expansion Act.       There are certain provisions in the legislation which fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its       Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on S. 35       and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the       measure on the House floor. Thank you.            Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, April 10, 2018.      Hon. David P. Roe,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: S. 35, the Black Hills National Cemetery       Boundary Expansion Act, was ordered favorably reported on       March 14, 2018, by unanimous consent. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an       additional referral to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on Veterans' Affairs       to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so       that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This       discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support having       the Committee on Veterans' Affairs represented  [[Page H3953]]       on the conference committee. Finally, to memorialize our       understanding, I would be pleased to include your letter and       this response in the Congressional Record when the bill is       considered by the House.        Thank you for your response and cooperation. I look forward       to further opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 1285) to allow the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower  Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde  Community of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of  Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Cow Creek Band of  Umpqua Tribe of Indians, the Klamath Tribes, and the Burns Paiute  Tribes to lease or transfer certain lands.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1285         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Oregon Tribal Economic       Development Act''.       SEC. 2. APPROVAL NOT REQUIRED TO VALIDATE LAND TRANSACTIONS.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, without further approval, ratification, or authorization       by the United States, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower       Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the       Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of       Siletz Indians of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Warm       Springs, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, the       Klamath Tribes, and the Burns Paiute Tribes may lease, sell,       convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer all or any part of its       interests in any real property that is not held in trust by       the United States for the benefit of such tribe.        (b) Trust Land Not Affected.--Nothing in this section       shall--        (1) authorize the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower       Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the       Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of       Siletz Indians of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Warm       Springs, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, the       Klamath Tribes, and the Burns Paiute Tribes to lease, sell,       convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer all or any part of an       interest in any real property that is held in trust by the       United States for the benefit of such tribe; or        (2) affect the operation of any law governing leasing,       selling, conveying, warranting, or otherwise transferring any       interest in such trust land.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to this particular piece of  legislation.   This bill will clarify that five recognized tribes in the State of  Oregon may buy, sell, lease, or otherwise convey land that they own in  fee without approval from the Federal Government.   Some of the earliest laws passed by Congress after the ratification  of the Constitution reserves to the United States the exclusive right  to acquire Indian lands. These laws are commonly called the Trade and  Intercourse Acts.   The acts were meant to protect Indian tribes by preventing the loss  of their lands, except by treaty. It does so by preventing the  transfer, sale, lease, or other conveyance of land owned by an Indian  tribe to third parties without Federal approval.   This bill, S. 1285, would clarify that the five tribes named in this  bill may do this job without Federal review or approval.   The bill benefits other tribes in a similar fashion were also  considered by the Natural Resources Committee and enacted into law  during the 106th, 113th, and 114th Congresses as well. This particular  bill, which passed by unanimous consent in December, truly shows that  despite what some Members are quoted as saying in the press, the  Natural Resources Committee is, in fact, still a productive committee  after all.   In fact, we have been the most active House committee next to the  Rules Committee. We have already marked up 147 bills and reported out  114 of these bills. No other committee has reached the 100 mark. I  guess that is a plus. If it is, then we did it. The House has passed 92  of these bills, and 23 have been signed into law. We hope to change  that to 93 and 24 respectively.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1417) to amend the National Law Enforcement Museum Act  to allow the Museum to acquire, receive, possess, collect, ship,  transport, import, and display firearms, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1417         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Law Enforcement       Museum Exhibits Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY OF NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MUSEUM TO                     ACQUIRE, RECEIVE, POSSESS, COLLECT, SHIP,                     TRANSPORT, IMPORT, AND DISPLAY FIREARMS.         The National Law Enforcement Museum Act (Public Law 106-      492) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 5. AUTHORITY OF MUSEUM TO ACQUIRE, RECEIVE, POSSESS,                     COLLECT, SHIP, TRANSPORT, IMPORT, AND DISPLAY                     FIREARMS.         ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       Federal law, or any law or any rule or regulations of a State       or any political subdivision thereof, the Museum may acquire,       receive, possess, collect, ship, transport, import, and       display firearms (as defined in section 921(a)(3) of title       18, United States Code, or section 5845(a) of the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986) in fulfilling the purposes of the       Museum.        ``(b) Definition of State.--In subsection (a), the term       `State' means the several States, the District of Columbia,       Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the       Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa,       and the possessions of the United States.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of Congress, if he  has been able to catch his breath, having cut this as close as is  possible.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am pleased to stand and support this bill, and I urge my colleagues  to adopt it.  [[Page H3955]]    The National Law Enforcement Museum will showcase the great work that  is done by those who are in the law enforcement profession, but it is  also going to have interactive exhibits designed to give visitors a  firsthand experience of the life of law enforcement officers.   It seems strange that we have to do this by actual legislation, but  this is an amendment to the National Law Enforcement Museum Act that  simply will allow the museum to acquire, ship, import, and display  firearms. If we don't do this, obviously, that doesn't take place,  which detracts from the entire experience of the museum in the first  place.   I commend Mr. Young for introducing this piece of legislation. It  seems like it is strange that we have to go to these lengths to do  something so logical, but it is the right thing to do, and I appreciate  his efforts to do that.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
