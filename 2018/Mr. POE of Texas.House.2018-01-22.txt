 Mr. Speaker, Members have been given access to a  top secret memo by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The memo is  disturbing.   Mr. Speaker, for years I have worked to rein in FISA's abuse of  Americans' constitutional rights. The memo, along with supporting  evidence from other government agencies, should immediately be  declassified. Despite the shutdown, the process to release this  document to the American public and the media has begun.   There is also an overclassification of documents by government. They  have nothing to do with national security. The American people and the  media must see what our government is doing in secret without America's  knowledge.   The memo is proof that government cannot be trusted. In the words of  Thomas Jefferson, ``Educate and inform the whole mass of people. . . .  They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.''   Mr. Speaker, the memo shows this is not the America our forefathers  envisioned.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
