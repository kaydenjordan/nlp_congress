 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the story of my  State of the Union guest, Kevin Harden, a West Philly native, a  successful attorney, and a gun violence survivor.   When Kevin was in college, he survived five gunshot wounds during an  altercation at the Myers Recreation Center in Southwest Philadelphia.   Kevin's life had not been easy. His mother suffered from addiction,  and his father juggled several jobs to make ends meet. His neighborhood  lacked economic and educational opportunity. In the 2 years after the  shooting, he lost both parents to cancer and assumed responsibility as  primary caretaker for his younger siblings.   Kevin's turbulent childhood did not diminish his spirit. He was  fortunate to find mentors. He graduated from college and decided to  pursue law school. He became a successful lawyer and now works in his  community to extend a helping hand to others like him.   We know there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to gun violence, but  every day that we fail to act, we fail our children and our country. It  has been 345 days with no action or vote from the Senate on commonsense  gun safety measures passed by the House.                            ____________________
