 Mr. Chairman, this bill is all about obstructing  effective law enforcement that challenges predatory payday lending,  that protects military families from unjustified foreclosures, and  addresses the burden of mounting student debt.   Republicans give Trump new power to fire the chief cop on the beat  who protects consumers against wrongful financial practices. We have  seen how well that worked with Trump and the FBI. Have you learned  nothing about giving Trump more power?   Without the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Wells Fargo would  never have been penalized for its multimillion-dollar fraud.   Republicans here want to shield Wall Street, granting it free rein to  run over people across America and later reward it with even more tax  breaks. They tolerate almost any wrongdoing, any crazy Trump tweet, so  long as they can get more tax breaks and less consumer protection.   Enough is enough. It is time to say no to this sorry bill and offer  protection to the people of America from financial wrongdoing.
