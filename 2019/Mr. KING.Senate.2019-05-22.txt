 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the efforts of  Dr. William Medd and his work with Western Maine Health and Stephen's  Memorial Hospital. His dedicated work with MaineHealth, the largest  health system in Maine, has improved the lives and health of many  residents of western Maine.   Although Bill is originally from Long Island, he has proudly called  Maine home for almost five decades. He studied and specialized in  Internal Medicine at Wesleyan University and then at the University of  Rochester School of Medicine. Following his medical residencies and 2  years of service in the Air Force, Bill and his family relocated to  western Maine in the early 1970's.   Throughout his career, Bill has dedicated himself to improving the  quality of healthcare in Maine, specifically in the rural area he has  worked and lived. His efforts to achieve this goal have taken many  forms, from serving as a trustee at Western Maine Health Care  Corporation and MaineHealth to his 45 years as an internist in the  Oxford Hills region. Perhaps one of the most symbolic aspects of Bill's  hard work is the growth of the local hospital in Norway, ME. At first a  small facility when Bill arrived, it is now a fully equipped, modern  hospital known as Stephen's Memorial and provides quality healthcare to  the rural region.   In early 2016, an expansion of Western Maine Health, was named the  William L. Medd, MD, Health Center. This new facility integrated new  models for delivering primary care and relocated other Western Maine  Health units. For the last 3 years, Bill has had the unique opportunity  to work out of the facility that bears his name.   On March 30 of this year, Bill was presented the Legacy Award at the  Oxford Hills Chamber of Commerce annual dinner. Not only does this  award embody Bill's commitment to healthcare in Maine, but speaks to  other contributions he has made to his community, from fundraising for  local scholarships to supporting youth programs in the region. His work  in these fields outside the medical profession demonstrate Bill's  commitment to more broadly improve his community.   I would like to thank Dr. Medd for his decade's long work in the  State of Maine. Thanks to his determination and drive to make a  difference, the future of healthcare in western Maine is bright. Dr.  Medd's passion for his patients, community, and State sets an example  for the medical professionals who will follow him.   Congratulations, Dr. Medd, on a successful career and happy  retirement. I look forward to seeing your continued contributions to  your community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the town of  Pittsfield, ME, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year.  Throughout its long history, Pittsfield has continually displayed a  rich heritage of hard work, entrepreneurship, innovation, community,  and family spirit. Situated along the Sebasticook River in Somerset  County, Pittsfield is home to roughly 4,200 residents who help make it  a thriving Maine town.   Incorporated as Warsaw in 1819, the town became Pittsfield in 1824,  named after one its prominent citizens, William Pitts. Early on, most  of the town's occupants were farmers, growing so much corn and wheat  that they used the grains to pay their taxes. Like many Maine towns,  Pittsfield began to develop a strong mill industry that flourished  along the Sebasticook River. This assortment of textile, saw, and grist  mills created hundreds of new jobs and Pittsfield saw its population  nearly double in just 40 years. Closures and relocation of many of the  town's mills lead to some decline, but the citizens of Pittsfield  helped reinvent the town, and today, Pittsfield is as vibrant as ever.   Maine Central Institute, an independent high school, opened in 1866  and continues to serve many of the town's residents and foreign  students from such countries as South Korea, Spain, Guatemala, and many  more. The school's Manson Essay contest continues to bring members of  the community together every year to hear presentations by students on  their university level research papers. Along with its high-level  academics, MCI's impressive athletic program has produced a number of  professional athletes, many of whom have gone on to play professional  basketball.   A hallmark of Pittsfield's economy, Cianbro was founded by Carl  Cianchette in 1946. Cianchette and his brothers would go on to grow  this company into the largest construction company in Maine, providing  thousands of jobs throughout the State. Now nationally recognized and  100 percent employee owned, with locations stretching into the mid- Atlantic region, Cianbro is still headquartered in Pittsfield.   It is an honor and a privilege to congratulate Pittsfield on this  historic occasion. For 200 years the town and its residents have  repeatedly demonstrated the hard work and community spirit found  throughout Maine. I hope the residents of Pittsfield take the  opportunity during this yearlong celebration to reflect on their rich  history and strive to make the next 200 years as prosperous as the  last. Happy 200th birthday, Pittsfield, and congratulations to all who  have made this a vibrant Maine community.                            ____________________
