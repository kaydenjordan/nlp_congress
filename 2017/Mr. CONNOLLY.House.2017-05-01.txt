 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   When we are going to pass a bill on a bipartisan basis, it might be  useful to acknowledge the bill has a Democratic cosponsor. I am proud  to be the lead cosponsor with Congressman Duffy on the Follow the Rules  Act--in fact, he asked me to play that role--and I rise  [[Page H2984]]  clearly in strong support of the legislation which will protect,  critically, whistleblowers who disclose waste, fraud, and abuse.   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Duffy, for working with  me in a bipartisan way on this important bill. We initially introduced  the bill together in the 114th Congress, and it passed the House  without opposition. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act. Hopefully,  this Congress we will be able to persuade the Senate to enact this  important protection.   This bill would clarify that, under the Whistleblower Protection Act,  an employee who refuses to obey an order that would require the  employee to violate a law, rule, or regulation is protected.   Congressman Duffy and I introduced the bill to address a  misinterpretation of the Whistleblower Protection Act by the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the case of Rainey v. MSPB in  2016, as my colleague from Kentucky suggested. In that case, a  contracting officer, Dr. Timothy Rainey, was ordered by his supervisor  to tell a contractor to rehire a terminated subcontractor. Dr. Rainey,  in principle, refused because carrying out that order would have  required him to violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation by  improperly interfering with the contractor's personnel decisions and  requiring the contractor to act contrary to the terms of the contract.   What reward did Dr. Rainey get for doing the right thing? He was  stripped of his duties and given a negative performance rating.   The Federal circuit, God knoweth how, held that an employee who  refuses to obey an order is protected only if the order would violate a  law, a statute, but not if the order would violate a rule or a  regulation. Talk about looking at angels on the head of a pin. The  court's ruling was contrary, clearly, to the Whistleblower Protection  Act and the intent of this Congress.   In enacting the Whistleblower Protection Act, Congress clearly  intended that protections granted to government employees who blow the  whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse be construed broadly. We clearly had  in mind not only laws, but rules and regulations as well.   Congress and the American people rely on whistleblowers to make  government efficient, honest, and effective, and we in Congress want to  support those people. As a member of the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform, I rely on whistleblowers to help us with our  oversight and reform work. Without them, rooting out mismanagement,  abuse, and corruption would be very difficult.   The underlying principle of the Whistleblower Protection Act is that  employees should be protected from retaliation if they do the right  thing, even if it means disobeying orders from their superiors. Given  the Trump administration's attacks on the Federal workforce, it is  especially important now, more than ever, for this Congress to uphold  whistleblower protections for all of our public servants.   We cannot tolerate the issuance of gag orders to silence dissent, and  we cannot permit the firing of agency employees who have differing  political views from our own or who might object to administration  actions. If the administration and my colleagues are serious about  draining the swamp, we need to do all we can to ensure that Federal  employees are allowed to perform their jobs free from political  pressure to violate laws, rules, and regulations.   Protecting whistleblowers has been and should continue to be a  bipartisan--indeed, nonpartisan--issue and something on which we can  find common ground. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this  important bipartisan legislation. I am proud to cosponsor it with my  friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with my friend from Wisconsin. I  think he laid out the case very well.   I think the ruling of the circuit court in many ways tells us about  the perils of a very juridical view of what a statute is all about. To  refuse to take into account context, history, legislative history, and  congressional intent that is reflected often in the kind of debate we  are having here on the floor I think is not in the spirit of trying to  interpret the laws as Congress intends them. Sooner or later I think  Congress is going to have to address this kind of fundamentalist,  originalist approach to laws that I think is nonsensical and leads to  this kind of cherry-picking about what it was Congress intended to  protect.   I agree with my friend from Wisconsin. I think this bill is necessary  because we have to clarify the law, apparently, for the courts and  protect people like Dr. Rainey.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1242, the 400 Years of  African-American History Commission Act, introduced by my friend and  colleague from Virginia, Bobby Scott. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia has  introduced a companion bill in the Senate.   In the 400 years since the first Africans arrived at Point Comfort,  Virginia, African Americans have made an indelible contribution to our  Nation. They have been pioneers in the arts and sciences. They have led  the charge for civil rights and spoken out against injustice against  anybody. They have also ascended to the highest level of politics,  athletics, and business, and sacrificed for our country in every  military engagement from the American Revolution to the present-day  fight against terrorism.   African Americans have played a crucial role in the establishment and  evolution of our Nation:   Crispus Attucks, a Black man, became the first casualty of the  American Revolution in my hometown of Boston when he confronted British  soldiers in what became known as the Boston Massacre.   James Armistead, a slave who fed false information to the British,  helped the Patriots' cause to secure victory in the Battle of Yorktown.   Abolitionists, from Sojourner Truth to Frederick Douglass to Harriet  Tubman spoke out against slavery and fought to realize the meaning of  Thomas Jefferson's founding creed that all men are created equal.   And African Americans helped our country awaken its collective  consciousness during the epochal civil rights movement, with the  courageous actions of so many from Rosa Parks in the Montgomery bus  boycott to the persevering spirit of our colleague John Lewis and the  Freedom Riders, and the bold vision, of course, of Martin Luther King,  Jr., that ``injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere.''   The bill before us today would recognize those accomplishments while  acknowledging the sorry, tragic history of slavery in America and the  subsequent era of discrimination and economic deprivation after the  Civil War. H.R. 1242 would establish a commission charged with  celebrating the rich history of African Americans in the United States.   Along with States, community groups, and nonprofit organizations, the  commission would plan and execute anniversary activities throughout the  Nation and encourage the publication and distribution of scholarly  research on African-American history.   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1242.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining on this side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 17\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), my friend and the author of this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Bobby Scott for  his leadership. This is an incredible service, not only to my  Commonwealth of Virginia and his, but, frankly, to all Americans. This  isn't just an issue for African Americans or some subgroup. All of us  are formed from our history, as we know from the popularity of the  opening of the new African-American museum here in Washington, which is  an incredible contribution, I think, to our Nation's culture and our  discussion.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
