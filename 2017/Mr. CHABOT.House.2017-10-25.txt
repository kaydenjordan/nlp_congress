 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Chairman  Royce, and all the other folks that have worked on a number of bills  here today.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 359; H.R. 3329; H.R. 3342; and  H.R. 1698, that one, in particular, aims to prevent Iran from acquiring  ballistic missiles because they have the capability or soon will have  the capability not just to target the Middle East and Europe, but also  target us here on our soil right here in the United States if we don't  do something about this, with ultimately a nuclear device.   Iran is determined to be the dominant power in the Middle East. The  Iranian regime hopes to achieve this by exporting terrorism,  destabilizing its neighbors, and promising death to America and to our  allies.   Bearing this in mind, Iran's nuclear ambitions and ballistic missiles  program are not only a direct threat to the United States and our  allies, but they are a direct threat to the peace and stability of the  entire world.   When the Iran deal was signed, I said back then and believed back  then that this was a bad deal, it would ultimately lead to nuclear  weapons, and that they weren't going to meet their commitments. And we  are seeing here today the backsliding by Iran to these commitments.   Ten years ago, Russia agreed to sell a number of S-300 surface-to-air  missile systems to Iran. The Russians suspended the deal in 2010, but  renewed it after the Iran deal, the JCPOA was agreed to. Now Moscow has  delivered multiple S-300 systems.   While the S-300 missile platforms strengthens Iran's conventional  capabilities, it also fundamentally complicates the United States'  strategy for eliminating a potential nuclear threat against us or  against our allies. Iran displayed this surface-to-air missile system  to the public late last month, so we know it is there and it is  dangerous.   That is exactly why H.R. 1698 is so important. It will help combat  Iran's ongoing nuclear ambitions by requiring the President to report  on the Iranian ballistic missiles program and to oppose targeted  sanctions on Iranian Government entities and foreign actors that aid  Iran in its nuclear development.   I also want to speak briefly relative to the threat that Hezbollah  poses to the Middle East and the entire world. I, again, want to thank  Congressman Royce and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen and Ranking Member  Engel and many others for their hard work on this.   Hezbollah's mission is to destroy Israel. It is backed by Iran. It  poses a constant threat to the Middle East peace. We have designated it  as a terrorist organization due to its routine attacks, especially  rocket attacks on  [[Page H8194]]  Israel that have led to war, and its brutal tactics.                                time  1615    For years, Hezbollah has continued to accumulate larger rocket  stockpiles, grow their presence, and develop even more unimaginable  barbaric strategies.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for these, and I urge my  colleagues to support these.
