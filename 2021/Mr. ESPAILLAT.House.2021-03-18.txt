 Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 6, the American  Dream and Promise Act.   Madam Speaker, how hypocritical and shameful of the other side of the  aisle. They want to deny Dreamers, yet those Dreamers provide education  and daycare services for their children.   They want to deny Dreamers, but those Dreamers take care of their  frail and elderly parents.   They want to deny Dreamers, but their parents pick the crops and the  fruits that they eat at their table.   Madam Speaker, how hypocritical. They want to deny Dreamers, yet  those Dreamers, as members of the National Guard, protected us right  here against an angry, racist mob.   Madam Speaker, I know that too well because I came to this Nation  without any papers. And I sit as a Member of Congress and my vote is  equal to any of their votes. It is equal to any of their votes because,  in this country, you can dream and it has promise.    Madam Speaker, we will not go back. We will continue to move forward.  I support H.R. 6.
