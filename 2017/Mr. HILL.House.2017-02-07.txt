 Mr. Speaker, this weekend I had the opportunity to visit  the exceptional exhibit of Ansel Adams' photography, from his early  years, at the Arkansas Arts Center, and it made me reflect on the life  of Townsend Wolfe, the ultimate southern gentleman and truly a cultural  visionary. Townsend passed away earlier this month at the age of 81.   Townsend served as the director and chief curator of the Arkansas  Arts Center in Little Rock for 34 years, until his retirement in 2002.  That year, he was honored with the Governor's Arts Award for Lifetime  Achievement by the Arkansas Arts Council. During his tenure, the Arts  Center experienced unparalleled growth in numbers of annual visitors  and in its exceptional collection.   Townsend's love of art extended beyond the walls of the galleries,  bringing beauty into the lives of countless Arkansans. Townsend leaves  behind a legacy of warmth and passion, and his contributions to ``The  Natural State'' will continue to live on at the Arkansas Arts Center.                            ____________________
