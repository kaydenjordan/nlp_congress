 Mr. Speaker, I stand today to address and congratulate  President Trump on imposing the public charge rule with regard to  public benefits.   You know, around here, we get along on many different items  bipartisan in nature, and I enjoy working with my Democratic  colleagues. But one issue that I think is at the crux of the  disagreement and dislike of President Trump is something I agree with  him very strongly on, and I think all the American public ought to know  about it, and that is something referred to as the public charge rule.   Ever since the 1800s in this country, we have tried to make it a  point that people who come here from other countries not come here and  wind up on public benefits or welfare or what have you.   Unfortunately, we weren't doing a very good job of enforcing this  rule until President Trump stepped up and put a rule that went into  effect last October, saying that if you are here as an immigrant, you  are not eligible for food stamps; you are not eligible for low-income  housing; you are not eligible for Medicaid; you are not eligible for  other means-based benefits.   President Trump, having a soft heart, continues to allow immigrants,  immigrant children, to receive free and reduced lunch, Medicaid, and  even are eligible for student loans.   Nevertheless, I think it was a very good thing for President Trump to  do. Our immigrants are the future of America.   Right now, in America, our immigrants are far more likely than the  native-born to take advantage of public benefits. A study shows that 63  percent of noncitizens versus 35 percent of the native-born are on some  form of public benefits. With regard to food assistance, 45 percent of  the immigrants, compared to 21 percent of the native-born, are on  public benefits.   Well, anybody can go through a tough time. And I should point out  that President Trump does not remove your ability to stay here, just to  be on public benefits for a month. It has to be for a period of several  months, and once you are on those benefits, we want you removed.   The reason for that is, for the future of America, we want people who  are self-reliant and paying taxes. We already take care of our native- born who, to a huge degree, for whatever reason, have to rely on our  fellow citizens.   Right now, we are in a position in which a much higher percentage of  people--63 percent of noncitizens versus 35 percent of native-born--are  taking advantage of some benefits.   If you look at food stamps, between 2004 and 2019, the total number  of people on food stamps in this country went up 50 percent. That is a  huge increase. It is particularly a huge increase if you take into  account the economy in 2019 was about as strong as it is going to get.   I, therefore, applaud President Trump for stepping up to the plate  and trying to restrict immigration to people who can take care of  themselves, all the while making sure that we are taking care of the  children of people who are here.   I also want to point out that people who are here illegally should  not be eligible for those benefits. But, again and again, I hear people  from my district, and I think from public comments made by people--like  the Governor of California or the mayor of New York--that I don't  believe local officials are at all times prohibiting people who are  here illegally from getting benefits.    In any event, particularly as long as we have birthright citizenship,  I think the policy before Trump got here is misguided and, ultimately,  will lead to a decline in the quality of life in America.   I am, therefore, very glad that the Supreme Court allowed President  Trump's rule to be upheld. But we have to caution America in that this  is not a statutory thing. This is not something that has passed  Congress.   The only reason we are trying to hold down the number of people who  are here who are not citizens from getting benefits is President Trump.  It could easily be true that by this time next year, we will go back to  the days in which a high number of noncitizens are taking advantage of  public benefits.   Like I said, I think for some people, the generosity of the public  benefits will encourage people to adapt a lifestyle in which they are  eligible for them, which is a real crime.   In any event, I would like to say one more time--I don't always get  invited over to the White House, in case President Trump is watching-- thank you, President Trump, at a time of trillion-dollar deficits, for  stepping up to the plate and trying to improve the immigrants that we  have coming in the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
