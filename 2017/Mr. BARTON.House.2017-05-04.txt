 Mr. Speaker, mandates seldom work. Markets do work.   My friends on the Democratic side of the aisle haven't pointed out  that 19 million Americans have chosen to pay the tax penalty to the  IRS, rather than be forced into one of these ObamaCare plans.   They talk about all the people who have gotten coverage. Most of them  got coverage when the bill that is now called ObamaCare expanded  Medicaid to healthy adults and paid 100 percent of the cost to cover  those individuals at a cost right now of about $70 billion a year.   Mandates don't work; markets do. I choose less government mandate,  more personal freedom.   Vote for the rule; vote for the bill. Let's restore markets and  freedom to health care in America.
