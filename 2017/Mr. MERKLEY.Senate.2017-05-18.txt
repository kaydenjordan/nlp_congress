 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the most important words in our  Constitution are the first three words ``We the People,'' written in  beautiful script and written many times larger than the rest of the  document so that even if you are across the room, you know what this  Constitution stands for--not a government by and for the powerful, not  a government by and for the privileged, but as President Lincoln so  eloquently said in his Gettysburg Address, a ``government of the  people, by the people, and for the people.''   As a ``we the people'' nation, we adhere to a core set of principles  that have guided us through good times as well as in dark moments. One  of those key principles is the rule of law, that we are a nation in  which not only is there the rule of law but in which no one is above  the law.   If we walked out of this Chamber right now, proceeded through the  double doorways, and down the steps of the Capitol, we would be staring  at the beautiful building of the Supreme Court. The entire building  symbolizes the role of justice in our society. As you look at that  magnificent Supreme Court--the broad, marble steps leading up to the  door--you see these simple words inscribed above: ``Equal justice under  the law.'' It is right there. You can almost see it from where I am  standing now: ``Equal justice under the law.'' That is the principle  that is part of the ethic of every courthouse in America--from the  smallest, most rural courthouse to the big city courthouse square. We  see those same principles personified as Lady Justice. There she is,  holding the scales, blindfolded so as to make sure everyone is treated  equally.   Yet, over the past few months, we have been in a period in which we  have been staring into the abyss of a constitutional crisis because  this very core principle of ``no one is above the law'' and ``equal  justice under the law'' has been under assault.   We have a President whose campaign team is under investigation  because of substantial information that suggests the possibility of  coordination and collaboration with Russia to change the outcome of the  Presidential election--an assault on one of the most fundamental  premises of a free society; that of free and equal elections.   We have a President who gave code-word classified information to an  adversary--Russia--just a few days ago. We have confidential  information, we have secret information, we have top secret  information, and we have code-word information at the very top. These  are the most sensitive secrets of the American Government, and our  President gave that information to Russia. If anyone else did that, he  would be facing criminal charges.   We have a President who sought to shut down an investigation into one  of his former team members--retired LTG Michael Flynn. We know  Lieutenant General Flynn was in contact with Russian officials, and he  was fired for lying about it. President Trump fired the head of the FBI  because he would not drop the investigation into General Flynn's  Russian connections and conduct.   We have a President, President Trump, who asked his Attorney General  and Deputy Attorney General to develop a cover story to tell the  American people the reason he fired the Director of the FBI, which is  that he was upset about the Director of the FBI's treatment of his  former Presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton.   If anyone believes the President woke up in the middle of the night  and  [[Page S3035]]  decided to fire the Director of the FBI because he was concerned about  the way Hillary Clinton was treated, then you have not been paying  attention this last year and a half.   Now, if in the course of an investigation it is found that members of  the Trump campaign coordinated or collaborated with the Russians to  undermine the integrity of our elections, then that is treasonous  conduct. If the President asked for, encouraged, or knew about such  activity, then he would be party to such treasonous conduct. If the  President used his office to attempt to shut down either the  investigation of Michael Flynn or the investigation into the  collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russians, then that  obstruction is potentially a serious crime of obstruction of justice,  and it has to be fully pursued. If the President fired his former FBI  Director in order to slow down or shut down these investigations, then  that compiles the evidence of obstruction of justice.   These sets of facts point to serious misconduct. We have to fully  investigate whether there was, in fact, such misconduct. That is why,  for more than 3 months--going back to February 15 and Michael Flynn's  resignation--I have been calling for a special prosecutor to conduct a  thorough, impartial investigation into these matters. Over these 3  months, the case for why we need an independent special prosecutor has  only grown stronger with each new event, each new story, each new piece  of evidence.   If there were any lingering doubt about the need for a special  prosecutor, that doubt was washed away last week when President Trump  fired Director Comey for pursuing the investigation into the ties  between the Trump campaign and Russia. That is why many of my  colleagues and countless Americans all across the country stood up and  demanded that no nominee fill Director Comey's shoes unless a special  prosecutor had been appointed. So I was very pleased when last night  Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein appointed such a special prosecutor.    Now, he will be coming to this Chamber to speak with us in a short  period of time, later this afternoon. But whatever else transpired,  stepping up and appointing that special prosecutor was the right thing  to do. He announced the appointment of former FBI Director Robert  Mueller as special counsel--the words ``special counsel'' and ``special  prosecutor'' are largely interchangeable--with wide-ranging authority  to conduct a thorough and independent investigation into ``any links  and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals  associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and, any  matters that arose or may arise from the investigation; and, any other  matters within the scope of the investigation.''   Last night's announcement was a tremendous victory for justice--the  principle of justice. It was a tremendous victory for a country with  the rule of law. It was a tremendous victory for the principle that no  individual is above the law in the United States of America.   We need to have confidence that there will be a robust investigation  to get to the truth, no matter where that leads us. Certainly, our  confidence has been improved by the appointment of the special  prosecutor last night--and not just any individual, but an individual  qualified and respected to lead such an investigation.   For 12 years, from just before the September 11, 2001, attacks and  right through 2013, this man, Robert Mueller, led the FBI. He led it  for the second longest period in U.S. history. He led it for 2 years  more than the standard term for the head of the FBI. He is known as a  thorough, by-the-book prosecutor who can't be influenced or  intimidated, and I have every faith that he will conduct a  professional, robust, and thorough investigation and give the American  people the answers to all of these issues.   But as we applaud this strong movement toward justice, to truth, and  to accountability, this strong stride in support of our ``we the  people'' democratic Republic, we cannot rest. We need to make sure that  Mr. Mueller, as a special prosecutor, gets every resource he needs to  aggressively pursue justice and the complete independence he needs to  undertake this incredibly important task.   At the same time, we have to keep pressing here in the Senate,  encouraging our Intelligence Committee, as well as the House  Intelligence Committee, to aggressively pursue information. We cannot  cede our obligation to represent and fight for the best interests of  the American people or for our ``we the people'' Nation, and that  includes speaking truth to power and holding our leaders accountable  for their actions.   Mr. Mueller will have, as I noted, wide-ranging authority to conduct  his investigation. His investigation and the investigation here in the  Senate by the Senate Intelligence Committee will be looking at a number  of connections that have occurred over the course of this last year and  a half.   Now, we know a lot about what the Russians did to hack the American  Presidential election. The intelligence community told us in a report  this past January that, with ``high confidence'' Russian President  Vladimir Putin ``ordered and influenced the campaign in 2016 aimed at  the U.S. presidential election'' and that he did so in order to  ``undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate  [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential  presidency.''   The report goes on to say that the Russian Government ``aspired to  help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by  discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably  to him.''   We know many of the elements of this aggressive Russian campaign.  They used the resource ``Russia Today'' to spread fake news stories, to  develop those stories, and to publicize those stories. They hired  thousands of internet trolls to comment in social media on the affairs  in America, as if they were Americans weighing in. They proceeded to  hack the DNC, or the Democratic National Committee, files and the  Clinton campaign files, and they released damaging documents from those  hacks. They used bots; that is, remote computers instructed by code  that was placed onto those computers to weigh in on social media as if  they were people weighing in. So we had thousands of machines weighing  in with comments as if they were individuals weighing in. Why did they  do that? To take the fake news story and proceed to amplify it with  comments from thousands of trolls and, probably, tens of thousands of  bots, in order to get those issues trending so they would appear in the  everyday news that Americans see. We are talking about a massive  campaign of interference in the Presidential election.   What we need to know is whether anyone on the Trump campaign was  connected, in any possible way, to these activities. To find that out,  we have to investigate the growing web of connections between members  of the Trump campaign and Russia.   Just consider some of the connections that have been explored already  in the press. One individual is Carter Page, who served as President  Trump's foreign policy adviser on the campaign trail. Mr. Page lived in  Russia for 3 years while working for Merrill Lynch. He participated in  several deals during his time there with Gazprom, the Kremlin-owned  energy giant whose chairman was Vladimir Putin's deputy while Prime  Minister.   He became friendly and emailed back and forth for months with Victor  Podobnyy, a Russian spy who was recorded on tape saying he was trying  to recruit Page.   Last year, while employed as a member of the Trump campaign, Mr. Page  traveled to Moscow to deliver a speech bashing U.S. policy toward  Russia, saying: ``Washington and other Western powers have impeded  potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such  as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.''   Then there is Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the President's  campaign. He was hired to manage the Republican Convention and to  wrangle delegates, but he was promoted to campaign chairman and chief  strategist, until he resigned because of his questionable foreign  dealings.   From 2004 until 2014, Manafort worked as an adviser to the Ukrainian  President, Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian strongman who, over the  years, adopted policies that moved his country away from the European  [[Page S3036]]  Union and closer to Russia. Manafort is regularly credited with helping  Yanukovych win the Presidency in 2010.   In 2014, a revolution rose up against Yanukovych, and he was ousted  from power. He now lives in exile in Russia. But Mr. Manafort continued  working in Ukraine, helping rebrand the former President's Party of  Regions as an opposition party, mostly from eastern Ukraine, which  advocates for stronger relations with Russia.   Then, we have Roger Stone, President Trump's longtime ally, friend,  and adviser since they first met back in 1979. That is three-plus  decades. Ironically, it was Mr. Stone who introduced Donald Trump to  former President Richard Nixon back in the 1980s, and there are stories  in the media that Mr. Stone pressured the President to fire Director  Comey.   Over the years, Mr. Stone has appeared many times in Russia Today,  the Kremlin's English language news network that developed and  publicized fake news stories during last year's Presidential election.   In his appearances, Mr. Stone regularly criticized the U.S.  intelligence community, he attacked our media, he attacked our free  press, he praised Russia and its policies, and he even praised  WikiLeaks--the organization responsible for releasing massive amounts  of confidential and damaging documents about our Nation's intelligence  services and capabilities.   More than that, Mr. Stone has bragged about his communications with  hackers--hackers like Guccifer 2.0. And who is Guccifer 2.0? The  individual responsible for hacking the DNC and releasing emails during  the campaign.   Another person whose connections to both the Trump campaign and  Russia will be looked at is our former colleague and now our Attorney  General. During the course of his confirmation hearings, Mr. Sessions  misled fellow Senators about his interactions with Russian officials.  When asked what he would do as Attorney General if he learned that  anyone connected with the Trump campaign had communicated with the  Russian Government, he said:         I'm not aware of any of those activities . . . I have been       called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I       did not have communications with the Russians.    But he did have communications, meeting with Russian Ambassador  Kislyak on two separate occasions last year.   Then, we have Michael Flynn, a very major part of the connections  between the Trump campaign and Russia--a retired lieutenant general and  appointed to be National Security Advisor by President Trump. He was  intimately involved in the series of events that led us to yesterday,  with the appointment of a special prosecutor.   Beginning in February 2016, General Flynn served as an adviser to the  Trump campaign, and he was even considered as a potential running mate  for President Trump. As we know, he followed President Trump into the  White House as National Security Advisor. But as I noted before, that  role was short-lived, as his Russian connections came to light.   Back in 2015, he was paid to attend a 10th anniversary gala for  Russian TV and sat at a table with Mr. Putin. He didn't disclose this  on his security forms.   During the Trump administration's transition, he talked with  Ambassador Kislyak by phone, including one call on the very day that  President Obama ordered sanctions against Russia as punishment.  Punishment for what? Punishment for interfering with the American  election.   When that information was discovered, the White House contended that  General Flynn's conversations with the Russian Ambassador were nothing  more than ironing out logistics for an eventual call between the  President and Vladimir Putin.   Even Vice President Pence went on the record defending Flynn, telling  CBS News that the two ``did not discuss anything having to do with the  United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against  Russia.''   But General Flynn's conversation with the Ambassador was picked up  during routine surveillance of the Russian Ambassador. And what were  they discussing? They were discussing the sanctions President Obama was  placing on Russia. Why did he place those sanctions? Because of Russian  interference in the election.   Acting Attorney General Sally Yates made it known that she warned the  White House that Flynn was lying to the Vice President and that he was  compromised. She met twice with Dan McGahn, the White House Counsel, to  warn him about Flynn. But in exchange for making sure the White House  knew about the fact that the National Security Advisor was compromised  and then lied to the Vice President, she was fired--fired by the  President.   Eighteen days after Sally Yates' warning, Michael Flynn resigned,  after the Washington Post revealed that he had, in fact, discussed  sanctions with Ambassador Kislyak.   Now, according to his lawyer, ``General Flynn certainly has a story  to tell, and he very much wants to tell it.''   Well, I hope, as the Senate Intelligence Committee and as the special  prosecutor pursue the investigations, that he will have every chance to  tell it and will tell it with a fullness and an accuracy that will be  complete.   That is the web of visible connections we already know about, and  they suggest the possibility of coordination, consultation, and  collaboration with the Russians to influence the American elections. We  have to get to the bottom of whether, in fact, that is the case. Did it  go beyond a series of conversations to actual coordination,  consultation, and collaboration? This is what we need to know.    Now, the President says that there is no ``there,'' there. That is  why we need an investigation, in order to find out. The President has  called this a witch hunt. An investigation, I would convey to President  Trump, is not a witch hunt. An investigation is pursuit of the truth.  An investigation is in the highest tradition of equal justice for all.   A very large development, as we all now know, occurred last week with  the firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the Bureau's  investigation into these matters. Director Comey confirmed while  testifying in the House on March 20 that the FBI was, in fact,  conducting an investigation into Trump's campaign--something we now  know really bothered the President. But at the outset, the President's  White House claimed that Comey's firing was about the Director's  handling of the Clinton email investigations, not because of the Russia  investigation. That story on its face caused eyebrows to raise across  the country. Did people really believe the President woke up and was  determined to right a wrong because the FBI Director had unfairly  treated Hillary Clinton? Yet he asked his team to develop this story to  share it with the American people. He asked his team--his Attorney  General and his Deputy Attorney General--to essentially put out a story  to mislead the American people. That in itself deeply damages the  integrity of the White House.   This cover story also claimed that Comey was fired because he lost  the trust of the rank-and-file FBI agents. Acting FBI Director Andrew  McCabe came to the Hill to testify before the Intelligence Committee  last week, and he conveyed that this is simply not true.   The cover story also involved Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein  being the instigator of the firing by preparing this memo on his own  and recommending it to the President. That also turned out to be a part  of the deception, and the President himself made that clear, taking  responsibility that it was his decision to fire, not a decision based  on a recommendation that came from Rosenstein.   In an NBC News interview with Lester Holt, President Trump admitted  that he ``was going to fire regardless of recommendation'' and that he  was thinking of ``this Russia thing,'' as he called it--``this Russia  thing''--when he finally decided to fire the Director. He also told  Lester Holt that he had asked Director Comey three times whether he  himself was under investigation. The President admitted on camera to  the American people that he fired the man in charge of the  investigation against his campaign because he was frustrated that the  investigation was still going on.   The American people received reports subsequently that the President  [[Page S3037]]  had asked Director Comey to pledge his loyalty to the President. This  is news report of the memo that Director Comey wrote after meeting with  the President. We find that the FBI Director is not going to be loyal  to anyone but Lady Justice.   The President had the audacity to publicly threaten Director Comey  after firing him. ``James Comey,'' said the President, ``better hope  there are no `tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to  the press!''   Attempting to intimidate future statements and possible statements in  an investigation after a person has been fired is another factor that  is totally inappropriate. Everyone with any shred of common sense knows  such intimidation is inappropriate, but in the context of a criminal  investigation, it may be more than inappropriate.   We don't know if there actually were tapes. Our Intelligence  Committee has requested the memos Director Comey wrote on his various  conversations with the President. Remember, this is an experienced,  seasoned FBI agent-turned-Director who has spent his life documenting  conversations. It is considered to be a high level of integrity when  such information is recorded in this fashion. Those memos carry a lot  of weight. Some are classified, some are unclassified. They need to be  provided immediately to the Senate Intelligence Committee, and if they  aren't provided, then the Intelligence Committee needs to subpoena them  and needs to subpoena the tapes. If they exist, they need to be  delivered. If they are not tapes but they are transcripts, they need to  be delivered. If they are not tapes but a thumb drive or they exist on  a piece of hardware, they need to be delivered, and our special  prosecutor, Mr. Mueller, needs to have them as well.   I think that as one steps back from this incredible amount of  information--the information about how Russia hacked the campaign, not  just hacking into the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign but then  releasing that information in strategic moments; hiring a thousand  individuals to comment in social media as if they were American  citizens; establishing a botnet of computers to weigh in as if they  were people to amplify this false social media, to get it trending and  to get it into the mainstream news--when we consider all of this, we  know how terribly wrong it was, and we have to learn every piece about  what went on in order to make sure we are in the best prepared way to  stop it from ever happening again.   We need to make sure we are in the best possible place to ensure that  we can assist other democratic republics in making sure they are not  victims of the Russians. We need to make sure that if any American, no  matter who he or she is, collaborated or coordinated with the Russians  in this effort to hack our campaigns, that they are prosecuted to the  full extent of the law.
