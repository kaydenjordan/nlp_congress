 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this continuing  resolution.   The Federal Government's fiscal year started 3 months ago. The  Republican Congress still hasn't passed a full year of Federal  spending. Rather than protecting our Nation and meeting the needs of  the American people, we are now debating a third continuing resolution  to kick the can into January.   Republicans control this House, the Senate, and the White House, but,  clearly, they do not take their responsibility to fund the Federal  Government seriously. Frankly, they should be embarrassed.   For the past 3 months, Democrats have sought to work with Republicans  to secure a budget agreement and responsibly pass appropriations bills,  but Republicans have been too busy to meet this basic responsibility.  Instead, they have spent months working in secret on their deficit- busting tax scam.   Let's be clear: the Republican tax scam is part of this CR as well.  The CR contains language to exempt the Republican's lavish tax cuts for  big corporations and billionaires from the statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act.   Republicans passed their tax scam knowing it was fiscally  irresponsible and that it would trigger cuts to Medicare, the Crime  Victims Fund, and other vital programs, and trigger an increase in  Federal student loans. Now they are asking Democrats to help bail them  out.   While I didn't vote for the Republican tax scam and I am not going to  paper over their mistakes so that President Trump can sign it into law,  here is what I will do, Mr. Speaker.   As the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I know Republican appropriators  are as frustrated I am. I want to work with them to find common ground  and to responsibly fund our government. It is time for appropriators to  do our jobs and for Republicans and Democrats to work together. It is  time for us to get back to work and fund the Federal Government  responsibly.
