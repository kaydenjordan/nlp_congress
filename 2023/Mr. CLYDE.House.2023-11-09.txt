 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor our Nation's  veterans.   This Veterans Day we recognize those who have selflessly served our  Nation and as well we honor the sacrifices they have made so that we  can live in freedom in the greatest country on Earth.   Our veterans, those living and those who have gone before us,  represent our Nation's finest heroes. These men and women answered the  call of duty to defend our country, preserve our peace, and protect our  precious freedoms. Their valor, love of country, and unwavering  commitment has ensured all Americans continue to enjoy life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.   On Veterans Day and every day may we recognize our Nation's champions  of liberty and honor their service by safeguarding our freedoms.   President Ronald Reagan once said: ``Veterans know better than anyone  else the price of freedom, for they have suffered the scars of war. We  can offer them no better tribute than to protect what they have won for  us. That is our duty. They have never let America down. We will not let  them down.''   Madam Speaker, this Veterans Day may God bless our veterans and their  families, and may God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
