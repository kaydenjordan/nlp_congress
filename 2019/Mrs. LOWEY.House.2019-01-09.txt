 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to  work with what we call our cardinal, the chair of this distinguished  Subcommittee of Appropriations, and I thank him for yielding me some  time.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump shutdown is now in its 19th day. It is simply  outrageous that more than 800,000 Federal employees are going without  pay and that the American people are being denied vital services, all  because of President Trump's demands for a wasteful border wall.   House Democrats want to open the government, but the President and  the Senate Republicans continue to obstruct and delay instead of  working with us to get the people's business done.                                time  1430    The solution to this crisis is simple: Pass the bills where we can  agree, and extend funding for Homeland Security for a month, 30 days,  to allow time for negotiation on border security and immigration  policy.   I hope that my colleagues across the Capitol come to their senses and  stop this ridiculous, dangerous Trump shutdown. Unless Congress acts,  the American people will continue to experience serious impacts from  the shutdown.   Taxpayers rely on the IRS to assist them in making big choices for  their financial planning. That advice helps families make important  decisions, like whether to put money into their savings or buy that new  appliance to replace a broken one. With taxpayer assistance, phone  lines, and centers closed for business, our constituents don't have  anyone they can turn to.   Outside of the IRS, small businesses, which make up the backbone of  our economy, also take a hit. With no access to Small Business  Administration loans during the shutdown, those businesses will remain  unable to make capital improvements, and entrepreneurs can't even  attend workshops with the SBA to seek advice.   We can reopen both the IRS and the SBA today, along with other vital  agencies like the FCC, the SEC, and the Federal judiciary. Democrats  are again ready to act. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
