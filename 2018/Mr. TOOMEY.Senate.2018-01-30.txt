 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about two separate  matters. The first is a very painful and difficult topic, but I feel it  is important to address.   I wish to recognize, acknowledge, and honor the heroic life and  legacy and sacrifice of one of Pennsylvania's finest: Deputy U.S.  Marshal Christopher Hill.   On January 18 of this year, Deputy Hill was shot and killed while he  was apprehending a fugitive in Harrisburg, PA. Christopher Hill lived  in York, PA. He was only 45 years old. He was a husband and the father  of two young children. He dedicated his life to serving and protecting  first his country and later his community. He was an 11-year veteran of  the U.S. Marshals Service. He was a former U.S. Army Ranger who had  been deployed to Somalia. In 2014, Deputy Hill was one of the deputy  marshals who helped capture a notorious cop killer in Pennsylvania,  Eric Frein, who was the subject of one of the largest and longest  manhunts in recent history throughout rural Pennsylvania.   The fact is that day in and day out for a very long period of time,  Christopher Hill put his life on the line for the rest of us. He did it  as an Army Ranger in Somalia. He did it as a deputy U.S. marshal. I had  the privilege of attending the memorial service for him recently. It  was extraordinary to hear one after another of the people whom he had  served with in various capacities speak about a truly extraordinary  individual, a guy who was by all accounts humble and modest but  absolutely dedicated with a passion to his family, to his community,  and to his country.   Sometimes it is easy for us to forget the risks and sacrifices that  are being taken by the men and women who wear various uniforms that  represent the various organizations that defend and protect us. But I  want to say to the people of Pennsylvania and to the family of  Christopher Hill that we are never going to forget the bravery and the  sacrifice and the service he provided for all of us.
