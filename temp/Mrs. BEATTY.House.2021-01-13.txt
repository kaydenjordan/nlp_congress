 Madam Speaker, domestic terrorists attacked our  democracy, urged on by a sitting President. These insurrectionists  believe Donald Trump's lies about the stolen election. They obeyed his  call to attack. They literally carried his banner while storming  the Capitol.    Last week's insurrection was shocking and tragic. It was the  culmination of 4 years of assaults on our democracy.   We must impeach this President. And the Congressional Black Caucus  stands ready to join in a bipartisan message to the likes of Donald  Trump.
