 Mr. Speaker, I thank in particular Ranking Member  Thornberry and Chairman Smith for their work on this NDAA.   I rise in strong support, Mr. Speaker, of this bipartisan William M.  (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act. A strong  bipartisan act such as this one is more important today than perhaps  ever before.   As we are facing competition with our adversaries in emerging,  contested domains, we have to develop cutting-edge capabilities in  space, cyberspace, air, land, and sea, and we must do this at a time,  Mr. Speaker, when a global pandemic continues to take lives and  devastate economies around the world.   This NDAA, Mr. Speaker, recognizes the role that America has played  in ensuring peace, prosperity, and freedom around the world for 75  years. It recognizes that our forward deployed forces are fundamental  to deterring aggression and forestalling conflict. It recognizes that  retrenchment and withdrawal are destabilizing and aid America's  adversaries.   Through its provisions, Mr. Speaker, this NDAA underscores that  America faces a fundamental choice: We either continue to lead,  including through forward deployed forces in places like Germany,  Eastern Europe, and South Korea, or we retreat, thus ensuring that the  global rules of the road will be set not by us and other free nations,  but by our adversaries, including China and Russia.   This bill enhances cooperation with critical allies in the Indo- Pacific, authorizes funding to counter China, and fully funds the  European Deterrence Initiative to enhance deterrence against Russia. It  also fully funds nuclear modernization to ensure the safety and  reliability of our nuclear stockpile and the credibility of our nuclear  deterrent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to ensure that this  legislation passes the floor in the same bipartisan fashion in which it  passed committee, staying true to the spirit of the Member after which  it is named.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment, which threatens to undermine the credibility of our Nation's  nuclear deterrent.   Mr. Speaker, there is a consistency on the other side of the aisle  which is very concerning. It finds a moral equivalence between the  United States and our adversaries, also an affinity for treaties that  bind only the United States and no one else.   Mr. Speaker, if this amendment becomes law, the United States loses  the ability to ensure that we can test, if necessary, to ensure that  our deterrent is reliable and, therefore, credible. That prohibition  emboldens our adversaries, and it undermines our allies' faith in the  nuclear umbrella.   We provide a nuclear umbrella. We provide security to allies so they  do not have to develop their own nuclear weapons. So an amendment that  ensures that the United States is no longer going to be able to  guarantee a credible nuclear stockpile is going to make nuclear  proliferation more likely, not less likely.   Mr. Speaker, this is a dangerous amendment, an amendment which ties  the hands of the United States, when we know that the Chinese are, in  fact, undergoing a huge nuclear buildup and likely testing. And we know  that the Russians are doing the same.   Mr. Speaker, this is dangerous. There is absolutely no reason we need  to do it. It contradicts a Clinton-era Presidential directive under  which the NNSA must maintain readiness to resume underground nuclear  testing, if necessary. This could be the case, for example, if our  stockpile experiences a unique failure.   Mr. Speaker, this is a mistaken amendment. It is a misguided  amendment that finds moral equivalence between the United States and  our adversaries and ties the hands of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, imagine the message it sends when Members of this body  stand up and actively urge that we tie the hands of the United States  while we allow the Russians and the Chinese to move forward with their  developments and with their testing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   Our forces remain in Afghanistan in order to prevent terrorists from  establishing safe havens from which they can launch attacks against the  United States.   My colleague, Ms. Omar, has said that she is a survivor of war, and I  honor the fact that she has been able to find safety and refuge and  citizenship and opportunity and freedom and that she stands with me  today on the floor of this body, this people's House. I think that  tells you what an incredible nation the United States is.   But I also think that as someone who has described herself as a  survivor of war, she would recognize more fully the damage and the  devastation that was done to the United States of America on September  11 when we were attacked by terrorists who trained and plotted and  launched from bases in Afghanistan.   Decisions about troop levels in Afghanistan must be based on  conditions on the ground. Wars don't end because the United States  retreats. What that means is that we have ceded the ground to our  adversaries. And wars don't end because some number of years have  passed. We have to decide whether we want to fight the terrorists, al- Qaida, ISIS, the Taliban, in Afghanistan or whether we have to fight  them here.   Pretending the Taliban is a partner for peace, especially in the  wake, Mr. Speaker, of reports that Russia is paying the Taliban to kill  United States troops, is indefensible, whether you are a Democrat or a  Republican.   I urge my colleagues to recognize that decisions about troop levels  must  [[Page H3334]]  be made based on what is necessary to prevent terrorists from  establishing safe havens they can use to attack all of us and the  freedoms and the values we hold dear.   This is a dangerous amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is a deeply irresponsible  stunt that would have great implications for our national security. It  would return us to days even worse than the days of sequester, a time  in which Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said:         No foe in the field has done more damage to the U.S. Armed       Forces than the United States Congress has because of       arbitrary across-the-board cuts.    We would, with this amendment, undermine near-term lethality and the  readiness of our troops on air, on land, and at sea.   We are asking our men and women to go into harm's way to defend all  of us, and we must always do that ensuring that they have the absolute  best equipment and resources necessary.   This amendment is a stunt, Mr. Speaker. It would be dangerous. We  have to ensure that the United States of America maintains a military  force that is second to none.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this irresponsible and  reckless amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. I think this amendment actually highlights the hypocrisy at  the heart of the foreign policy and national security policy our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they advocate.   This is a situation in which the President has said that Russia is  cheating and, therefore, I will not allow Russia to cheat. I will not  allow the United States to continue to be party to a treaty that  enables Russia to gather information about us in violation of the  treaty.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle consistently say and  accuse the President of not being tough enough on Russia, but here we  have a situation where the President is doing exactly that. The United  States senior counterintelligence official, Bill Evanina, recently has  said that Russia  [[Page H3513]]  has, for years, ``used the Open Skies Treaty to collect intelligence on  civilian infrastructure and other sensitive sites in America.''   The Kremlin has been abusing this treaty to gather intelligence on  the United States. The President was absolutely right to withdraw, and  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to be consistent. If  they say that they stand on principle, then they need to be consistent  about that principle and not simply oppose things because Trump  supports them. The President was right to get out of this treaty. It is  dangerous to our security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
