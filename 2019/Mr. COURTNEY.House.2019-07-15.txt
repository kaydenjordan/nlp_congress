 Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the House of Representatives  passed the National Defense Authorization Act for 2020, a measure which  sets policy for the folks who wear the uniform of this country.   The U.S. Congress has actually passed a defense authorization act  every year for the last 57 years. This year, if we all continue to work  together, we can make it 58 years running.   Again, this is a measure which sets everything from military pay--a  3.1 percent pay raise for the military, the largest pay increase in the  last 10 years--to setting the ground rules for military acquisition,  whether it is recapitalizing our Navy or buying the new F-35 planes for  the Air Force. It is a large, sprawling bill which covers, again, all  aspects of U.S. defense policy for the upcoming year.   Included in this measure was an amendment that I offered for which,  on Friday evening, the Iraq and Afghan Veterans of America issued a  strong statement of support in the wake of passage of the bill.   What my amendment did is it offset a policy decision that was made in  July of 2018 by the Trump administration which cut off the ability of  long-serving members of the military to transfer their GI Bill  educational benefits to a spouse or dependent. Again, the IAVA, which  TIME Magazine has described as the most important organization  representing a new generation of veterans--what my amendment did was it  eliminated what IAVA described as a shortsighted policy change  announced by the Department of Defense in July 2015, which would have  limited transferability to servicemembers with less than 16 years of  Active-Duty service and excluded servicemembers who had served for  nearly the entirety of the war on terror.   In 2008, we changed the GI bill, recognizing, again, that we have an  all-volunteer force and that the GI Bill, which goes back to Franklin  Roosevelt signing it 75 years ago, had deteriorated over time. We  restored the value of the educational benefit, and we created, for the  first time, the ability of a servicemember to transfer, on a one-time  basis only, the educational benefit to a spouse or child.   Again, what this did was it took the burden of those who were serving  particularly long periods of time in our military at great economic  sacrifices the ability to at least take one family member's educational  benefits for higher education.  [[Page H5779]]    Again, my amendment, which was part of the bill that passed last  Friday night, would restore the full intent of the Congress in 2008 and  reverse the Trump administration's decision to cut off that  transferability, which was issued last July.   Again, we still have work to do. We have a conference to build with  the Senate, and we, obviously, have to get it to the President for  signature. We have done it for 57 straight years, and we should make it  58 this year by passing the 2020 NDAA bill.                   Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program     Mr. Speaker, there are also things happening over at  the U.S. Department of Education regarding higher education which are  of great concern.   On Thursday, the American Federation of Teachers filed a lawsuit in  the District Court of Washington, D.C., basically asking the court to  rule that the Department's foot-dragging in terms of discharging  student loan debt through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program  has got to come to an end.   In 2007, we passed the College Class Reduction Act which set up a  mechanism for those who serve in critical public service occupations,  such as teaching, nurses, doctors, police, prosecutors, social workers,  veterinarians, and people who work in nonprofit organizations. If they  make their student loan payments consistently over a 10-year period,  under the College Class Reduction Act, they could apply for a discharge  of the balance of their student loan, recognizing that these are people  who are going into occupations for which the payment of student loan  debt can be too onerous.                                time  1215    So, 2007 was the year that this program was supposed to kick into  effect. As the Government Accountability Office determined, since that  period--and these are our figures from 2019--7,555 borrowers have  submitted applications to have their loans discharged. Only 864 have  been approved, and only 516 borrowers, less than 1 percent, have had  their loans forgiven.   Again, the loan servicers working for the Department of Education, as  determined by GAO, are giving bad information and are not crediting the  monthly loan payments that teachers and nurses and others have been  faithfully making, relying on this program. They built their employment  history around the opportunity, knowing that that student loan debt  could be discharged.   Again, what we are seeing are shocking figures from the Department of  Education that have not followed through and implemented this law.   Not a great surprise to those of us on the Committee on Education and  Labor because the Trump administration, for the last 3 years, has  submitted budgets that would eliminate the Public Service Loan  Forgiveness Program.   We have to change this administration's policies toward higher  education. We did it on Friday, and we have to do it with public  service loan forgiveness to reward the good guys, the people who are  out there doing critical work for our Nation.                            ____________________
