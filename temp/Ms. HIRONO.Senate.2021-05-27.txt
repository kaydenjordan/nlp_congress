 Mr. President, I rise today, in recognition of Asian  Pacific American Heritage Month. Every year throughout the month of  May, the people of the United States come together to celebrate the  contributions of generations of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and  Pacific Islanders, AA NH/PI, who have enriched our society and whose  legacies are deeply intertwined in our Nation's history.   The AA NH/PI communities are among the fastest growing and most  diverse demographic groups in our country. Today, approximately 23  million people of AA NH/PI descent live in the United States,  representing more than 45 ethnicities and speaking more than 100  languages. As AA NH/PI communities increase their social and political  presence in our country, we must work to raise the visibility of issues  important to AA NH/PIs. One way to do  [[Page S3888]]  this is to uplift the diverse voices of our communities through  representation. This year, there are a record 21 AA NH/PI Members  serving in Congress, and we celebrate the historic election of Kamala  Harris to be the first woman and the first Asian American to hold the  Office of the Vice President. However, even with today's progress, our  AA NH/PI communities continue to face issues of disparity and  prejudice.   This year, we once again commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage  Month amid a global pandemic. While the pandemic has claimed the lives  of more than half a million Americans, COVID-19 has had an outsized  impact on communities of color, including Pacific Islanders, who are  three times more likely to contract COVID-19 and are nearly twice as  likely to die from the disease. The pandemic has also exposed and  exacerbated social and economic disparities in our country. Throughout  the pandemic, Pacific Islanders and other vulnerable groups have been  disproportionately impacted by unemployment, food and income  insecurity, and unstable or inadequate housing, among other hardships.  This pandemic has highlighted the work we must do to ensure that all  Americans, especially individuals from marginalized communities, have  access to quality healthcare, fair pay, workplace protections, and  other civil and human rights.   Violence and discrimination against Asian Americans have also surged  during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between March 2020 and March 2021, Stop  AAPI Hate received over 6,600 reports of discrimination and hate  incidents across all 50 States and the District of Columbia. These  unprovoked, random attacks can happen anywhere--on public  transportation, on sidewalks, in businesses, and even in the workplace.   The dramatic rise in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans might be a  recent development, but we all know that racism has never been far  beneath the surface in our country. Part of honoring the rich history  of the AA NH/Pl community includes reflecting on some of the darker  moments in our Nation's past. AA NH/PIs have always been targeted as  the ``other'' in our country and have been treated as the perpetual  ``foreigner.'' Since the first Asian immigrants came to our country  nearly two centuries ago, our communities have experienced race-based  prejudice and have been subject to discriminatory policies that  impinged on individuals' civil rights, improperly rescinded wartime  promises, and excluded immigrants from Asian countries out of  intolerance and fear.   Recognizing the recent increase of hate crimes, Representative Grace  Meng and I introduced legislation to focus attention on hate crimes  committed during the pandemic. Last week, President Biden signed this  bill, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, into law. This action sent a clear  message of solidarity to our AA NH/PI communities at a crucial moment.  This bipartisan legislation will help Federal, State, and local  governments confront hate in our country and help victims of hate  crimes to come forward.   Today, AA NH/PIs are uniting to confront this epidemic of racism,  discrimination, and hate. We are marching, speaking out, and demanding  action in cities and states across the Nation to ensure that our  country does not repeat the mistakes of the past. Representation and  visibility are some of the ways we are making our voices heard.  However, we must also sustain efforts to teach empathy and educate  others about our history. We can help to create a more just and  equitable society by raising awareness of past injustices and current  issues of importance to our communities.   As we celebrate the contributions of AA NH/PIs, there is also clear  evidence demonstrating how much work remains to be done. I look forward  to working with my colleagues beyond the month of May, Asian Pacific  American Heritage Month, to continue the work that must be done to  advance civil rights and equal treatment for all.                            ____________________
