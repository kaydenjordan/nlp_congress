 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. More  than that, I thank her for the thousands of hours that she has put in  over the years in trying to address in a positive, constructive way our  broken immigration system and for her leadership in forging a bill that  is a step--just a step.   I want to thank Mr. Nadler, the chairman of the committee, for  ensuring that this bill came forward.    Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting here for a few minutes, and I have  heard a number of my Republican colleagues bemoaning the fact that we  could have done this in a bipartisan fashion and come with up with a  much better bill. Many of those folks who said that have  [[Page H4283]]  been serving here over the last 8 years in the majority, and we have  been pleading with them over those 8 years: Bring us a bill, a  bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, as you so well know, you and Mr. Hurd, a Republican from  Texas, worked tirelessly in fashioning a bipartisan bill, and the  Republicans refused to bring it to the floor; although, in my view it  had a majority of votes on this floor.   Indeed, it was about to be petitioned out of the committee and  brought to the floor in a process that you can do that without the  committee's voting for it. Just short of the 218 votes necessary to do  that, the Republican leadership put all sorts of pressure to assure  that that bill was not discharged from the committee.   So spare me the crocodile tears about a bipartisan bill. We tried to  do a bipartisan bill. The Senate did a bipartisan bill in 2013, and we  pleaded for the Republicans to bring it to the floor, a bipartisan  Senate bill, and they refused, all the time saying the immigration  system was broken. But they refused to fix it.                                time  1630    So, now they come to the floor, bemoaning the fact that a bipartisan  bill did not come forward. If they had intended to work on a bipartisan  bill, as the majority leader, I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, a  bipartisan bill would have come forward.   So sad, so unfortunate that that didn't happen.   Mr. Speaker, I want to read something:   ``We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy  and proud.   ``They''--referring to the Dreamers--``got brought here at a very  young age''--1, 2, 3 years of age.   ``They've worked here. They've gone to school here. Some were good  students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in never-never land  because they don't know what's going to happen.''   Who said that? Donald Trump said it.   When did he say it? After he was elected, but before he was sworn in  as President of the United States.   I met with the President, along with a few others, at the White  House, and he said to us: ``Send us a bill,'' then he created the  problem we are confronting today. And he said: ``Congress, fix it, and  I will sign it.''   Well, today, Mr. Speaker, we are fixing it. And I hope that my  Republican colleagues would join us and that the President of the  United States would sign a bill which will take these folks out of  never-never land.   The bill we have on the floor today is called the American Dream and  Promise Act--the American dream and American promise.   We lift our lamp beside the golden door. That is what we have said to  the world. That dream is to see hard work rewarded with opportunity.   My father came here at the age of 32 in 1934, an immigrant from  Denmark. That promise is the commitment of our Founders and every  generation since to ensure that this Nation makes that dream a reality  for all.   Today, more than a million people who grew up in America don't know  any other home, yet they live in fear of being sent to a home they  never knew. They live in fear of being deported to countries they never  or barely knew.   These Dreamers, these yearners for justice and opportunity, deserve  to live without fear. They deserve to access the opportunities of  America that they have been helping to build already--a Nation of  immigrants, made great by immigrants.   This bill will remove that fear. It will give them the opportunity to  stay in the country they know and love and to know their hard work and  contributions will give them a chance to make it in America and that  they can give back by serving in our military or creating jobs or  working in their communities; that they can have a pathway to  citizenship, which is in their interest and in the interest of our  country.   This bill will keep the promise of our Founders and our forebears,  and it will keep the promise of policymakers from both sides of the  aisle who agree they should stay, along, I might add, with 86 percent  of the American people.   They are American in every sense. They are patriots and dreamers.   President Trump campaigned on a promise to help Dreamers--a promise  he broke. It was President Trump who created the crisis we now face by  rescinding the DACA program 2 years ago and allowing the Republican- controlled House to stand in the way of a legislative solution.   Now, the Democrat-led House is taking action. With this bill, we  proclaim to the Senate and President: Take the advice of the American  people. Pass this bill.   For these Dreamers are, in all but a certificate of citizenship,  brothers and sisters.   One of them from my district, Gabby Hernandez, is here today, Mr.  Speaker, to watch us take this important vote. She arrived in this  country from El Salvador at the age of 4. She attended school in Prince  George's County, Maryland, which I represent, and she has been studying  these last few years to be a social worker and help people in our  community.   I hope we can give Dreamers like Gabby reassurance that their  country, America, will not abandon them.   In addition, this bill would also allow those who have been on  temporary protected status and deferred enforced departure to remain as  permanent residents.   One of them has a business in my district. He employs 40 people.  Forty families would be affected by his leaving. He has been here for  25 years. He is, in every sense, a member of our community.   These are people who fled a natural disaster and violence and were  welcomed into our country as refugees. Here, they have helped build a  stronger community and have participated in building our economy.   I am proud to represent a strong community of Liberians in my  district, many of whom fled war and disease outbreak and built new  lives here. We should not allow them to be uprooted from their homes a  second time.   Some of them are here today in the gallery as well.   Let's show them. Let's show them that we stand together with them and  cherish their contributions to America.   Whether we are Irish or Danish or Italian or Jews or Poles or  Germans, all who came here in great numbers immigrated to this country  and have made us great.   This bill is not perfect. No bill is perfect. But it is a step, a  very important step, a down payment on fulfilling that promise.   But change happens most often in steps, and today the Democrat-led  House is taking that step forward by keeping our promise to Dreamers.   I want to thank Lucille Roybal-Allard, Nydia Velazquez, Yvette  Clarke, Jerry Nadler, and--yes, once again--Zoe Lofgren for all the  work that they have done to get us to a place where we have a fair  bill--not amnesty, a fair bill for America.   I hope my Republican colleagues will join us in voting for this bill.  Together, let's send a message of inclusion and acceptance of these  Dreamers, whose dreams are the same as ours, whose patriotism is the  same as ours, and whose Nation is the same as ours.   Vote ``aye.'' Vote for America.
