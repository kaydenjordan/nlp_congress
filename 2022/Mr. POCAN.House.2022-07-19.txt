 Mr. Speaker, this is a simple bill--whether or not you  support current law on marriage in this country, which includes for the  LGBT and the interracial couples across the Nation.   My friend from Ohio said this bill is unnecessary. This bill is very  necessary because the extremist-packed Supreme Court recently took away  a half a century of law on Roe.   In that decision, Justice Clarence Thomas said they should revisit  marriage equality. We have people in this House and in the Senate, like  Senator Ted Cruz, who have said the exact same thing.   Here is what I want, I want to make sure that my husband, Phil, can  visit me in the hospital, should I have to go back again, like when I  had a triple bypass a few years ago.   I want to ensure my husband has my earned benefits for retirement and  Social Security. I want to make sure that my husband is taken care of  just like your spouses are taken care of.   If I was the entity on the other side of the aisle, I would be more  concerned when my own Member is accused of having cocaine-fueled orgies  than worrying about the morality of my marriage.
