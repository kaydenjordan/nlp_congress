 Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Biden's open-border  policies, human smuggling is now a $20 billion business for criminal  cartels. In barely 2 years, the Biden administration and House  Democrats squandered the progress that had been made to secure our  border and have enriched criminal cartels.   What is the Biden administration doing to correct this? Nothing.   Instead, when Republican Governors DeSantis from Florida and Abbott  from Texas bused and flew a dozen illegal immigrants from their States  to Democrats' so-called sanctuary cities like Washington, D.C.,  Chicago, New York, and even Martha's Vineyard, Democrats were outraged.   Some politicians who earlier claimed they would welcome illegal  immigrants with open arms have threatened legal action against these  Governors, accusing them, laughingly, of human trafficking.   Are they really trying to claim that a free ticket to Martha's  Vineyard is human trafficking; but the criminal cartels smuggling  people into our country is not?    Democrats don't seem to care that their policies are enabling  criminal cartels to abuse women and children who are seeking a better  life.   The humanitarian crisis we are seeing at the southern border is a  direct result of President Biden's failed open-border policies. The  negligence of this crisis by the Biden administration and House and  Senate Democrats and their refusal to fix it is inconceivable.                            ____________________
