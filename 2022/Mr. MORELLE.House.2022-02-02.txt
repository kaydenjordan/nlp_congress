 Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of a Rochester, New  York, legend and beloved veteran, Gary Beikirch, who sadly passed away  December 26 at the age of 74.   With little regard for his own safety, Sergeant Beikirch's  conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his  life, above and beyond the call of duty, earned him the prestigious  Medal of Honor in 1973.   Sergeant Beikirch's story of selfless valor is so revered in  Rochester that our Vietnam Veterans Memorial at Highland Park bears his  name.   Sergeant Beikirch went on to become a pastor and beloved school  counselor whose presence, empathy, and service will impact our  community for generations to come.   I close with the words of General George Patton: ``It is foolish and  wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather, we should thank God that such  men lived.''   I thank God for the life of Gary Beikirch.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend and Rules  Committee colleague, Ms. Ross, for yielding time and for her leadership  on this important issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule that will advance the  America COMPETES Act, an historic package of long overdue legislative  actions to strengthen our supply chain and make bold investments  supporting manufacturing right here at home where it matters most.   There is so much in this legislative package that I am proud to  deliver for my constituents back home in Rochester, New York,  specifically the provision to boost regional innovation hubs and  regional innovation.   I am proud that language in H.R. 4521 will create regional technology  and innovation hubs like those envisioned in my legislation, the  Innovation Centers Acceleration Act.    Since early 2020, I have had the honor of leading the effort for  legislation that would dedicate serious Federal investment into our  Nation's innovation efforts. In fact, the Rochester area was identified  by the Brookings Institute as one of the top regions in the country for  group opportunity, and it is no secret why.   With cutting-edge universities and research facilities, combined with  a robust manufacturing infrastructure, access to shipping routes and a  highly specialized workforce, Rochester is ready. We just need the  investment to help expand on a wider scale.   This initiative will incentivize collaborative partnerships between  local governments, colleges and universities, private industry, non- profits and community organizations to promote and support regional  technology and innovation hubs in cities like Rochester.   Significant and sustained innovation investment is needed to drive  economic recovery and build resiliency, and the America COMPETES Act  puts us on track to just that.   Now is the time to boldly invest in innovation and scientific  research to advance America's competitiveness against China and  reestablish our Nation as the global leader of innovation.   By investing and enacting the America COMPETES Act, we reaffirm our  leadership around the world by strengthening diplomacy, promoting human  rights, and bolstering economic engagement.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and  the underlying bill.
