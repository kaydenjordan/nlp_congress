 Mr. Speaker, I thank and appreciate my friend from  Kentucky. He does a great job on the Energy and Commerce Committee and  as vice chairman on the Health Subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting Seniors' Access to  Medicare Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, and I am glad we are  passing this much-needed bill.   The Affordable Care Act created the Independent Payment Advisory  Board. This board of unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats was  charged with the single goal of cutting Medicare payments to physicians  and hospitals. We can't let that happen.   This poorly conceived scheme could force physicians to exit the  Medicare Program or limit their Medicare patients. We can't let that  happen.   This would create an access-to-care problem for the 170,000 Medicare  beneficiaries in my district. When I am back in the district talking to  seniors, senior advocates, local physicians, hospitals, practically  everyone has raised concerns with this board.   This is a commonsense repeal bill. They say that it hasn't been  implemented yet, it hasn't been set up yet. Okay. Well, let's get rid  of it. Most people don't want it.   Mr. Speaker, again, we need to pass this particular bill. We need to  abolish this bad idea.                                time  1630
