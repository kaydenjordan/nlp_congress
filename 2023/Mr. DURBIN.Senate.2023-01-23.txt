 Madam President, I want to begin by welcoming our newest  Senator from the State of Nebraska, Pete Ricketts.   I don't know him well, but I am sure I will come to know him. I  certainly know his family. They have made their impression on the city  of Chicago by purchasing the historic franchise the Chicago Cubs. They  have made major investments in the city of Chicago and the State of  Illinois in that pursuit. Best of all, they have virtually guaranteed  that Wrigley Field is going to stay in Wrigley Field--exactly where it  should be. It is one of the cathedrals of baseball in America, and the  Ricketts family has made a commitment to it, which is certainly  satisfying to devout baseball fans like myself.   I hope the time of the new Senator will be productive and gratifying.  Work in this body can sometimes be slow and frustrating, but with  patience, good things can happen.    I announce that the Senator from Maine (Mr. King) and the  Senator from California (Mr. Padilla) are necessarily absent.
