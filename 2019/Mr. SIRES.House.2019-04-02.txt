 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the hard work and dedication  of immigrant communities across New Jersey and across this country.   Earlier this month, the New Jersey Policy Perspective issued a report  confirming something we have known for a long time in my district and  in New Jersey: immigrants continue to serve as the backbone of Main  Street.   Immigrants make up 22 percent of the total State population, and  immigrants own 47 percent of Main Street businesses. Immigrant  communities own 81 percent of household maintenance services, 79  percent of laundry businesses, and nearly 50 percent of child care  centers and clothing stores. According to the study, immigrants  contribute $4.4 billion a year to just the New Jersey economy,  employing thousands and driving economic growth.   This study is just another reminder that toxic rhetoric against  immigration is a misguided attack against our neighbors, our teachers,  our firefighters, and local shop owners. As a first generation  American, I can attest firsthand to the grit and determination needed  to succeed in this country. These brave families sacrifice everything  to work hard in America and provide opportunities for their loved ones.   Supporting immigrant communities is the right thing to do to advance  American values and boost job growth across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say thank you to the immigrants working  hard across the State of New Jersey and across this country.                            ____________________
