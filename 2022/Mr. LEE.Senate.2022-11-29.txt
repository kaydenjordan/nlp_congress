 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 6482, and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, today, as popular winds blow against the  man and woman of faith, we should look to the Constitution and remember  that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . '' We do a  disservice to all Americans if we elevate the rights of one group at  the expense of another.   On the one hand, there is no existing threat to same-sex marriage. It  is and will remain legal nationwide regardless of the outcome of this  legislation before us, the Respect for Marriage Act. On the other hand,  we have current, real, sustained ongoing assaults on religious freedom.   How we proceed today will do nothing to the status quo of same-sex  marriage in this country. It is legal and will remain legal regardless  of the outcome of this legislation. It will, however, if enacted, have  profound consequences for people of faith.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, proponents of this legislation  have conjured up a series of hypothetical scenarios, resulting in an  imagined threat to the ability of same-sex couples to marry and enjoy  the privileges of marriage.   The rhetorical slippery slope goes something like this: First, they  claim that some unknown, unnamed State is on the verge of passing an  unknown, yet-to-be-proposed or imagined law prohibiting same-sex  marriage. Next, they imagine that Federal district courts will uphold  this hypothetical State law despite the crystal-clear direction within  the Dobbs and Obergefell opinions from the Supreme Court.   Should that adventure of unlikely hypotheticals transpire, they  envision a case making its way all the way up to the Supreme Court of  the United States. All of this despite the lack of political will  anywhere in the United States to prohibit same-sex marriage.   Should that happen, proponents of this bill contend that there is a  nonzero chance that one Justice could decide to analyze the right to  marry not through the prism of substantive due process, as it has been  since Obergefell was decided in 2015, but rather through the lens of  the 14th Amendment's privileges or immunities clause.   Proponents of the bill cite a single line within Justice Thomas's  concurring opinion and suggest that one Justice could effectively  destroy legal recognition of same-sex marriage not just prospectively  but undoing currently legal same-sex marriage.   Now, this is a complete fantasy. I am not aware of a single State in  the United States threatening to pass any law infringing the ability of  any same-sex couples to marry or enjoy privileges associated with  marriage; nor am I aware of a single State threatening to invalidate,  within their borders, marriages entered into in other States; nor is it  at all clear that Justice Thomas himself was suggesting that Obergefell  be overturned. He was suggesting that it be analyzed, like all  substantive due process juris prudence, to figure out whether there  might be another provision of the Constitution under which it might be  more appropriate.   They are attributing to him statements he didn't make. They are  attributing to him analysis he didn't even undertake in that one  statement regarding the doctrine of stare decisis, and then they are  attributing to States intentions they do not have and have not  expressed.   My colleagues have yet to offer even a single example of a same-sex  marriage threatened by any current or pending State legislation--not  one, not a single one--and they intentionally misinterpret Justice  Thomas's concurring opinion in Dobbs and claim that the sky is falling.  But it is just not happening.   Unfortunately, we are aware of case after case where individuals,  charities, small businesses, religious schools, and religious  institutions are being hauled into courts to defend themselves for  living out their faith. These people are not committing hate crimes  against their neighbors. No, they are not abusing peers for their  personal choices either.   No, they are being hauled into courts across this country for serving  the poor, the needy, and the refugee in compliance with their sincerely  held religious beliefs. In Texas, the United States Conference of  Catholic Bishops is currently being sued for operating in accordance  with Catholic beliefs regarding marriage while providing foster homes  for unaccompanied minor children.   Now, proponents of this bill claim that these charities will be free  to continue to operate. However, in that case, the question is whether,  because the Conference of Catholic Bishops receives Federal funding to  help with its work, it might be operating under color of law. If  accepting grants and licenses from the government makes you an actor  under color of law, then many of our religious charities and schools  will be threatened by this legislation, which relies on that  unnarrowed, undefined phrase. Either the U.S. Conference of Catholic  Bishops can cease operating according to its religious tenets or  abandon its God-given mission to care for the refugee.   In at least three other cases, religious childcare service agencies  deemed to be acting under color of law are being shut out of foster  care and adoption. These religious ministries can either abandon and  cease to act according to their convictions, their religious  convictions about marriage, or they can abandon the orphan.   This Nation and our orphans rely on these charities. We cannot and  must not force that decision on them. That isn't who we are. From the  very moment of our founding, we have been a nation that has welcomed  people of all beliefs and of no belief at all.   In recent years, the Obama administration, through the U.S.  Department of Education, compiled a so-called shame list outlining more  than 200 faith-based colleges and universities seeking religious  exemptions from title IX guidance on transgender and sex  discrimination. It is highly likely that these organizations could also  risk losing their 501(c)(3) status.   Considering that we are in the process of hiring 87,000 new agents  within the Internal Revenue Service, it is not beyond the realm of  possibility that some of these new IRS agents will be deployed  specifically to review the tax-  [[Page S6836]]  exempt status of some of these traditionally exempt religious schools.  These colleges and universities can either cease operating according to  their religious convictions or run the risk of losing their ability to  provide quality education at reduced prices. We may well find that they  will not be able to do both, and that would be a tragedy.   Dr. Andrew Fox created a chaplaincy program at the Austin Fire  Department, where he served as the lead chaplain in a volunteer  capacity for 8 years, earning the trust and respect of local  firefighters. In a personal blog--nothing connected to his work, just a  personal blog--Dr. Fox shared his religious views, his religious views  specifically regarding marriage.   City officials demanded he recant his statements and apologize for  the harm that his blog post allegedly caused. He explained that he  intended only to foster discussion and not cause offense, and he  apologized if anyone was offended. His apology apparently wasn't enough  for city officials who demanded total compliance with their preferred  views on marriage, views that didn't embrace his own religious beliefs.  They forced Dr. Fox to hand in his uniform. He could keep his job or  his beliefs but not both.   We should not be surprised by the current state of affairs. After  all, it was abundantly clear during the Obergefell oral argument before  the Supreme Court that this threat to religious nonprofits would be  forthcoming. The prescient exchange between Justice Alito and then- Solicitor General Donald Verrilli forecasted the present hostility and  the corresponding threats to religious organizations.   Justice Alito asked whether, should States be required to recognize  same-sex marriages, religious universities could lose their tax-exempt  status. His response, the response from Solicitor General Verrilli, was  chilling. He said:         [I]t's certainly going to be an issue. I don't deny that. I       don't deny that, Justice Alito. It is going to be an issue.    It is an issue today, and under this legislation it will only get  worse tomorrow unless we take affirmative steps to prevent that from  happening. And we have the opportunity to do so here, and we shouldn't  miss it.   Unlike the hypothetical but entirely nonexistent marriages being  threatened or discriminated against, these religious organizations are  currently, right now, in court fighting for their God-given and  constitutionally protected rights to live and operate according to  their beliefs and conscience. They are being targeted and harassed by  those who would force them to abandon their convictions and embrace the  convictions preferred by the government.   Sadly, the hostages at risk in this standoff are those who have  benefited from the charitable work of these institutions: the poor, the  hungry, the refugee, the student, and the orphan. Instead of resolving  the concern posed by Justice Alito, this legislation will put the  weighty thumb of government on the scale against religious  organizations and individuals.   Now, they say: Don't worry; you can still believe as you wish. But  if, in living out your faith, you offend the views sanctioned by the  government, you will suffer the consequences.   What do we get for this heavy sacrifice of religious freedom? Are we  alleviating the suffering of same-sex families about to be destroyed by  government interference? No. As I have said, we haven't heard of even  one potential threat to same-sex marriage, not one. The only outcome we  can expect from this legislation is for religious individuals,  businesses, and institutions to spend more time and more money  defending their God-given rights in court.   In our pluralistic society, we must be willing to compromise and  adapt so that we might live peacefully, peaceably with one another. In  that spirit of compromise, let us ensure that we are protecting  families--both traditional and same-sex families--and that we are  protecting the right to believe as we wish and live out those beliefs  without government interference. I believe we can do both. In fact, I  know we can do both.   Now, the Collins-Baldwin amendment takes a step in the right  direction, and I am grateful for that. Rabbis, imams, and pastors  should never be forced to perform a marriage contrary to their beliefs.  But religious liberty is so much more than marriage. It entails so much  more than what might go on within the four walls of a mosque, a  synagogue, or a church. It certainly entails and must include the  ability of people to practice their faith not only at church but at  home and in the public square.   In the hope that we can come to a place where we respect each other,  I have offered an amendment to this legislation that would explicitly  minimize the threats to these religious organizations and individuals.  I am at the table. I am willing to compromise. In the spirit of  compromise, I have publicly stated--and I reiterate here again today-- that I will support the legislation if my amendment is adopted.   My amendment simply prohibits the Federal Government from  discriminating against schools, businesses, and organizations based on  their religious beliefs about same-sex marriage. That is all it does.  It is very simple, and I am grateful that we are going to have the  chance to vote on it later today.   I am also grateful for the work of my friend and colleague Senator  Dan Sullivan from Alaska, who, working together with several of my  other Republican colleagues, helped secure and schedule this vote. I am  grateful to him for that effort.   My amendment prevents the Internal Revenue Service, among other  things, from revoking the tax-exempt status of these charities and  organizations simply because they act according to their beliefs about  the divine purpose of marriage. It prevents the Department of Education  from targeting schools with honor codes based on the fact that they  have got provisions in their honor codes based on religious beliefs.   It protects individuals from being denied business licenses or grants  or other statuses based on their views about marriage. It protects  Americans who wish to act according to their religious beliefs from  being forced to abandon their God-given mandates to love, serve, and  care for the poor, the orphan, and the refugee.   If we allow the government to threaten their ability to do so, then  the religious liberty of every American is in peril. That is why I  would ask those who have doubts about this to reconsider their doubts  about my amendment. If they object to my amendment and are inclined to  vote against it based on the fact that they regard it as unnecessary,  then why not pass it.   This is a legitimate concern--some may argue this--I have been told  by many of the bill's sponsors that my amendment is unnecessary  because, according to them, the Collins substitute amendment contains  protections that already accommodate this concern.   Now, the Collins substitute amendment does, in fact, contain some  protections. I am grateful that those were included, and that is a  meaningful step in the right direction. I must point out, however, that  it doesn't do what my amendment does and therefore doesn't do what many  of its proponents are claiming.   Nowhere in that legislation is a statement prohibiting the Federal  Government from taking adverse action against an individual or an  entity based on a sincere religious belief about same-sex marriage,  whether that religious belief is one that embraces or does not embrace  same-sex marriage. It does not do that. It instead says that nothing in  this act shall be construed to alter or deny any status or benefit of  any group. Those are two very different things.   That language does not do what my amendment does. You see, the threat  is not and never was based on what the act itself would do. The act  doesn't purport to itself deny or alter any status or benefit or right.  So by taking that away, they are paying lipservice to the need for my  amendment, but they are not actually addressing it.   The threat has been present at least since Obergefell itself was  decided for the reasons that prompted Justice Alito to ask then- Solicitor General Verrilli a question about it and the same reasons  that prompted Solicitor General Verrilli to acknowledge that it was  going to be an issue. Those same reasons exist today. They don't go  away because of this legislation. If anything, they are enhanced. The  risk is enhanced as a result of this legislation.   That is why this is the perfect opportunity, it is the right  opportunity, it may very well be the only opportunity  [[Page S6837]]  to make sure that, as we are undertaking a legislative effort to codify  rights for one group of Americans, we don't do so in a particularly un- American way; that is, enhance the rights of some at the expense of  others. That is not how we roll. That is not how we do things in this  country. We can protect both of these interests at the same time, just  as we can walk and chew gum.   So for those who would say the Lee amendment isn't necessary because  the Collins amendment already takes care of it, that is just not true.  And even if it were true, why not accept the Lee amendment anyway?  Which begs the question: Why wouldn't anyone want to deny the Federal  Government the authority to retaliate against individuals, nonprofits,  and other entities based on their sincerely held religious beliefs?  Think about that for a minute. Why wouldn't they want to deny that very  power from a government that may wield it in a way that is  categorically abusive?   For my Republican friends who are sympathetic to the need for my  amendment and are going to support it, I would ask that if they support  it and if the amendment fails, that you not support the underlying  bill, because if you support my amendment, hopefully, presumably, that  means it is because you agree that it does something--that it does  something necessary. It certainly doesn't counteract, contradict, or  undermine the stated purpose of this bill in any way. So if you believe  that it is necessary and you are going to vote for it, if it fails, you  should oppose passage of this bill unless or until the Lee amendment is  adopted.   We could get this done. I understand that it is not going to happen  as long as there are at least 10 Republicans willing to join with every  Democrat in order to support this legislation. But if even 3 of the 12  Republicans considering support for this legislation in the end--if  even 3 of them supporting my amendment would decide not to support the  bill unless or until the Lee amendment was added, I am confident-- indeed, I am certain--that it could and would ultimately be adopted.   As I said, we must be willing to compromise to protect the interests  of all. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which would  ensure that all Americans would have certain rights and that their  religious beliefs and their moral convictions will be explicitly  protected and provide some comfort that Congress is not purposely  passing laws that restrict the free exercise of religion.
