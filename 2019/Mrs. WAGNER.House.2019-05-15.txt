 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the Payment Commission  Data Act, which would make prescription drug prices more transparent,  and the BLOCKING Act, which would bring generic drugs to the market  faster.   I also support the Protecting Consumer Access to Generic Drugs Act,  which would prohibit drug companies from delaying the entry of generic  drugs into the market.   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, Democrats have packaged these bills  together with poison pills that would prevent States from offering  lower cost healthcare plans.   Democrats want to increase ObamaCare enrollment regardless of cost,  but ObamaCare is not affordable for many Americans. The average monthly  premium for a family of four is over $1,500, forcing Missourians to cut  housing and child care so they can pay skyrocketing premiums. It is not  a solution. We must take immediate action to allow States to promote  choices and affordability.                            ____________________
