 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we move through what is appearing  to be a choppy start to the 117th Congress, I think it is worth  reminding ourselves of the standards that guide our work here. The  mandate that we have does not come from the 24-hour news cycle or from  lobbyists or advocacy groups, but it comes, very simply, from the  Constitution. It is the foundation of the rule of law, our Nation's  Constitution, and it really serves as a pretty good policymaking  guideline.   The American people are looking at what is going on here, and they  see the cracks that Washington has made in the foundation of this  Constitution. These realizations have eroded their confidence in our  ability as a body to perform the basic functions of government without  devolving into partisan chaos when faced with disagreements.   Many times I will hear Tennesseans say: What happened to robust  political debate? What happened to being able to agreeably disagree and  have a discussion? Are those days totally lost, or can we return to  them? They are asking themselves how many shortcuts--like Executive  orders--Washington is going to take before the shortcut becomes the  rule or the norm and how many times can Washington chip away at the  standards that govern our country before those standards start to  crumble or are not relevant.   Restoring the trust of the American people will not be easy because  this fundamental lack of faith in our institutions has caused Americans  to question their very safety and security in the physical space and  also in the virtual world that they have been forced into by the COVID- 19 pandemic.   I like to say we have a lot of security moms who are out there--moms  and grandmoms like me--and, quite frankly, they are out in full force,  alongside millions of other Americans who now have cause to wonder if  their own government will bother making their security a priority. What  about their communities? What about their neighborhoods? What about the  universities where their children go to school? What is going to be  done about riots? What about the virtual space? As they have seen their  children move to online school, more of their daily functional life and  their transactional life has moved online. How do they keep their  families safe? How do they protect their rights to privacy?   In the physical space, yesterday we got the good news that a Federal  judge has granted a temporary restraining order barring the Department  of Homeland Security from implementing a nationwide pause on most  deportations. That pause was mandated by a DHS memo signed by the  Acting Secretary on day one of the Biden administration--not such a  great start for the administration's immigration policy team, but the  American people will benefit from having the time that has come to them  to ask questions about proposed shifts in existing policy. People want  to be safe.   I would like to just stipulate for the record that immigration law is  very complex. While most Americans aren't experts in the finer points  of immigration law, they do have and most of us have a very common  touchstone that we relate to; that is, having a secure border.   This should be a basic concept--let's secure the border; let's secure  our country--but somehow we have managed to politicize that point that  advocates at the highest levels of the Federal Government--for what? A  weakened border. Just imagine that. You have individuals at the highest  level of the Federal Government who are saying: Let's weaken our  border. That is stunning, absolutely stunning to Tennesseans.    Why would you not protect your border? Why would you not want to know  who is coming into your country? Why should I be forced to accept a lax  border? Why should I be accepting of allowing drug cartels to run those  drugs into the country? Why should I be told I should accept human  trafficking; I should accept gangs; I should accept sex traffickers  coming in across the border?   When we have a weak border, this is what you get. Every town--every  town--becomes a border town. Every State becomes a border State because  of the impacts--the negative impacts--of drug trafficking, sex  trafficking, human trafficking, and the toll that that takes on our  communities.   Last week, I introduced two key pieces of legislation that attack  specific vulnerabilities in our body of immigration law that thousands  of bad actors use to game the system every year.   The first is the Stop Greenlighting Driver Licenses for Illegal  Immigrants  [[Page S162]]  Act. It does exactly what it sounds like. It blocks certain Federal  funds from reaching the coffers of sanctuary States. This includes  States that defy Federal immigration law or that allow individuals to  obtain a driver license without providing proof that they are here  legally or without providing proof that they are who they claim to be.  This is no small penalty, and here is why.   In 2020, our Nation had 15 States plus the District of Columbia that  have decided to give illegal immigrants a valid State-issued ID, a  driver license. These 15 States and DC got $53 million in JAG grants  from the Department of Justice. These are funds--these are Justice  Assistance Grants that are given to local law enforcement and criminal  justice projects to do what? Enforce the law. So if you are not going  to enforce the law, why should you get the money? Those funds should go  to entities that have said: We will abide by the rule of law. That is  where those funds should go.   Now, the second bill is the Ban Birth Tourism Act. This would amend  the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit pregnant foreigners  from obtaining a temporary visitor visa they could use to enter the  United States specifically for the purpose of giving birth here. Yes,  you heard me right. There is a loophole in the law, in the Immigration  and Nationality Act. Because of this, we have some pregnant foreigners,  primarily from Russia and China, who circumvent the law, and they get a  temporary visitor visa, and they come here working with some of this  multimillion-dollar-a-year birth tourism industry. They get coached.  They come here. They go to a facility. They give birth. The child  becomes a citizen, and then they return. As I said, primarily these are  wealthy Russians and wealthy Chinese.   Our citizenship is not for sale. No, indeed. It is hard-fought. It is  hard-won. It is hard-kept. The American people are right to expect  better than this. Tennesseans want to see something done about this.  That is why I, once again, have filed this legislation.   The American people are not unreasonable. They do not lack  compassion. They just don't understand why officials who are charged  with upholding the law would act in their official capacity to  undermine something as basic as border security, as basic as national  security.   We have a lot of security moms out there who understand that it is no  small task keeping things secure at home. All of these security moms  out there know that there are plenty of threats online--threats that  they cannot see, but they know that there are a lot of these threats  that come into their homes and onto their computer screens and onto the  devices of their children because of a lack of privacy online.   How we curate and protect our virtual use, as I call it, is  critically important because it defines who we are to the people who we  do not see in person. And as I mentioned earlier, more of our  functional and transactional life is now online. So tomorrow, to mark  National Data Privacy Day, I will once again reintroduce the BROWSER  Act.   Mr. President, as you and I served in the House together, I know you  remember how I would introduce this bill, the BROWSER Act, to secure  online privacy for millions of Americans. Now, at its heart, this is an  effort to inject awareness, transparency, and accountability into the  relationship between technology platforms and their users.   This legislation sets up a very basic Federal compliance framework  that tech companies can use as a guide to update their privacy policies  online, make it something that is going to give you the ability to say:  This is information that I want to share.   It would require companies to secure an opt-in from consumers before  collecting their sensitive data. And for less sensitive information,  you, the consumer, would have the ability to opt out and not share that  browsing history with that company.   Companies would not be able to deny you service if you want to  practice your right to privacy. That makes common sense. It happens in  the physical space every single day, and it should also be a right  reserved to the individual in the virtual space.   This also would put the Federal Trade Commission, our online privacy  regulator, in charge of watching what is happening in the virtual  space, applying these rules equally across the entire internet  ecosystem. A right to privacy, being secure in our communities and our  homes, is something that not only Tennesseans but millions of Americans  are wanting to see.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week Team Blackburn is saying  goodbye to Heath Huckabay, who came to us last January as part of a  fellowship program between my office and the Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, which is located in Oak Ridge, just outside of Knoxville,  TN.   It has been an interesting year to say the least, but Heath has risen  to the occasion and impressed each and every one of us with his breadth  of knowledge and his ability to adapt to the hectic pace of life in the  Senate. We did our best to persuade him to stay with us a little  longer, but I am confident that his colleagues at Oak Ridge will be  happy to see him return, as well as his wife Emily and little Elliot.  They are looking forward to having him home.   It was an honor working with him this past year. We will miss him,  and we wish him all the best as he heads back to Tennessee.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
