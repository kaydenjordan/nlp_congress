 Madam Speaker, while Republican attempts to  repeal the Affordable Care Act went down in flames, their Texas v.  United States lawsuit seeks to subvert the will of the American people  and take our healthcare away.   In December, a judge ruled in favor of Republicans, issuing a  decision that would strike down the entire ACA. If that ruling stands,  every American will lose vital protections, like those for people with  preexisting conditions.   I have cosponsored Congressman Colin Allred's H. Res. 14, which  authorizes the House to intervene in this case and defend the law of  the land, because my family and I, like so many others, are no  strangers to the costs of preexisting conditions.   Madam Speaker, I am a two-time cancer survivor. Two of my four kids  have Crohn's disease, and they have been living with it for 14 years.  Bills upward of $10,000 are not unusual in my household.   Despite all this, I consider us lucky. Why? Because, thanks to the  ACA, my sons and I cannot be turned away or charged more because of our  medical histories. All of that will change if Republicans and President  Trump got their way.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, Congressman Allred, for  introducing this important resolution.                            ____________________
