 Mr. Speaker, I come from the fourth largest city in  the Nation, soon, I hope, to be the third. We take great pride in the  number of consular offices that we have and the languages that we  speak.   I particularly sought to engage in international affairs by  participating with international organizations that engage the European  Union as well as the OSCE.   There are individuals in Houston from France, from England, from  Italy, from Bulgaria, and many places in and around Europe, Western and  Eastern. So the behavior that I watched over the last couple of days  with the assault on NATO by our Commander in Chief is, frankly,  embarrassing.   America stands as a bastion of democracy and freedom, and the world  looks to us. Insults are not becoming of the American people. Insults  to heads of state are not becoming to the American people.   Frankly, I am against Brexit. I think it is the wrong thing to do. I  think Europe should be a unified group of individuals supporting  democracy and standing tall. But it is outrageous that our  representative engaged in NATO, as well as interacting with our foreign  leaders, would, one, have a dastardly and rude commentary in the Sun- Times insulting our news media, such as CNN. And then, frankly, going  on to one of our worst adversaries, a person who has poisoned people on  foreign land, who has jailed journalists, who has shot down airplanes,  and now Vladimir Putin will be giving our President a performance  review. That is not the American way. Shape up. Shape up, Mr.  President.                            ____________________
