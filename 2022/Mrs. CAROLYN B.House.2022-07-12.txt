MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Access for Veterans to Records Act would address the  serious backlog of requests for veterans' records currently pending at  the National Personnel Records Center, or NPRC, which is part of the  National Archives and Records Administration. This bill has received  bipartisan support, and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, including Ranking Member Comer and Representative Fred Keller,  who have cosponsored this legislation, along with a number of other  Members.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, the NPRC has accumulated a  backlog of veterans' records requests, which reached a peak of 603,000  during March of 2022.                                time  1430    Veterans and their families need these records to access critical  services, including housing and healthcare.   Many of these records are only available as paper documents. That  limitation, combined with limited building operations and a reduced  workforce to protect NPRC employees during the coronavirus pandemic,  have been the primary cause of this backlog.   The NPRC has made some progress to reduce the backlog. As of February  28, the NPRC workforce has returned to full capacity at its facility in  St. Louis, Missouri. NPRC also added overtime shifts on weekends and  some holidays. However, the backlog, which currently stands at 515,000  records requests, remains significant and can only be remedied with  legislative intervention.   This bill has two components. First, it requires National Archives to  provide the Oversight and Reform Committee with a detailed plan and  target timeframes to eliminate the backlog and strategies to prevent a  future records requests backlog. This includes submitting biannual  status updates on the backlog and maintaining staffing levels to meet  the goal of responding to 90 percent of requests in 20 days or less.   Second, the bill would authorize $60 million for NARA to make  upgrades to its information technology infrastructure. The upgrades are  necessary for NARA to improve its ability to digitize documents and to  prevent future backlogs.  [[Page H5952]]    The committee has already voted to approve $60 million for National  Archives in an amendment offered by Representative Keller to another  bill.   Congress must take action to help our veterans, many of whom put  their lives on hold waiting for records from the NPRC. I urge my  colleagues to support the veterans by supporting this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the distinguished  chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 7337, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7535) to encourage the migration of  Federal Government information technology systems to quantum-resistant  cryptography, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7535         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Quantum Computing       Cybersecurity Preparedness Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) Cryptography is essential for the national security of       the United States and the functioning of the economy of the       United States.        (2) The most widespread encryption protocols today rely on       computational limits of classical computers to provide       cybersecurity.        (3) Quantum computers might one day have the ability to       push computational boundaries, allowing us to solve problems       that have been intractable thus far, such as integer       factorization, which is important for encryption.        (4) The rapid progress of quantum computing suggests the       potential for adversaries of the United States to steal       sensitive encrypted data today using classical computers, and       wait until sufficiently powerful quantum systems are       available to decrypt it.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) a strategy for the migration of information technology       systems of the Federal Government to post-quantum       cryptography is needed; and        (2) the Governmentwide and industrywide approach to post-      quantum cryptography should prioritize developing       applications, hardware intellectual property, and software       that can be easily updated to support cryptographic agility.       SEC. 3. INVENTORY OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS; MIGRATION TO                     POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY.         (a) Inventory.--        (1) Establishment.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Director of OMB shall       establish, by rule or binding guidance, a requirement for       each executive agency to establish and maintain an inventory       of each cryptographic system in use by the agency.  [[Page H5953]]         (2) Additional content in rule or binding guidance.--In the       rule or binding guidance established by paragraph (1), the       Director of OMB shall include, in addition to the requirement       described under such paragraph--        (A) a description of information technology to be       prioritized for migration to post-quantum cryptography;        (B) a description of the information required to be       reported pursuant to subsection (b); and        (C) a process for evaluating progress on migrating       information technology to post-quantum cryptography, which       shall be automated to the greatest extent practicable.        (3) Periodic updates.--The Director of OMB shall update the       rule or binding guidance established by paragraph (1) as the       Director determines necessary.        (b) Agency Reports.--Not later than 1 year after the date       of the enactment of this Act, and on an ongoing basis       thereafter, the head of each executive agency shall provide       to the Director of OMB, the Director of CISA, and the       National Cyber Director an inventory of all information       technology in use by the executive agency that is vulnerable       to decryption by quantum computers.        (c) Migration and Assessment.--        (1) Migration to post-quantum cryptography.--Not later than       1 year after the date on which the Director of NIST has       issued post-quantum cryptography standards, the Director of       OMB shall issue guidance requiring each executive agency to       develop a plan, including interim benchmarks, to migrate       information technology of the agency to post-quantum       cryptography.        (2) Designation of systems for migration.--Not later than       90 days after the date on which the guidance required by       paragraph (1) has been issued, the Director of OMB shall       issue guidance for agencies to--        (A) designate information technology to be migrated to       post-quantum cryptography; and        (B) prioritize information technology designated under       subparagraph (A), on the basis of the amount of risk posed by       decryption by quantum computers to such technology, for       migration to post-quantum cryptography.        (d) Interoperability.--The Director of OMB shall ensure       that the designations and prioritizations made under       subsection (c)(2) are assessed and coordinated to ensure       interoperability.        (e) Report on Post-quantum Cryptography.--Not later than 15       months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Director of OMB shall submit to Congress a report on the       following:        (1) A strategy to address the risk posed by the       vulnerabilities of information technology systems of       executive agencies to weakened encryption due to the       potential and possible capability of a quantum computer to       breach such encryption.        (2) The amount of funding needed by executive agencies to       secure such information technology systems from the risk       posed by an adversary of the United States using a quantum       computer to breach the encryption of information technology       systems.        (3) A description of Federal civilian executive branch       coordination efforts led by the National Institute of       Standards and Technology, including timelines, to develop       standards for post-quantum cryptography, including any       Federal Information Processing Standards developed under       chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, as well as       standards developed through voluntary, consensus standards       bodies such as the International Organization for       Standardization.        (f) Report on Migration to Post-quantum Cryptography in       Information Technology Systems.--Not later than 1 year after       the date on which the Director of OMB issues guidance under       subsection (c)(2), and annually thereafter until the date       that is 5 years after the date on which post-quantum       cryptographic standards are issued, the Director of OMB shall       submit to Congress, with the report submitted pursuant to       section 3553(c) of title 44, United States Code, a report on       the progress of executive agencies in adopting post-quantum       cryptography standards.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 7535, the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity  Preparedness Act.   Today, the processes we use to encrypt data are incredibly reliable  and can keep sensitive data secure from unauthorized users during  storage or transmission. But tomorrow, that may no longer be the case.   Researchers around the world are accelerating advances toward quantum  computing, which refers to the application of quantum physics to  computers. This will allow the computers of tomorrow to perform  calculations many magnitudes faster and more powerfully than they do  today.   While quantum computers have the potential to provide considerable  benefits to society through unimaginable innovation, they could also  equip our adversaries with the ability to break the best encryptions  available today.   Capabilities of this magnitude are estimated to be a decade or more  away, but China and other adversaries are expected to begin stealing  sensitive encrypted data much sooner with the intent of unlocking it  when they have the ability to do so. It is essential that the Federal  Government prepare for this inevitability now while we still have time  to protect data that is critical to our national and economic security.   The process of migrating all Federal IT systems to post-quantum  cryptography will be complex and costly, but putting the right steps in  place now will help us stay at the forefront of this frontier.   I applaud Representative Ro Khanna, as well as Representatives Nancy  Mace and Gerry Connolly, for introducing this thoughtful bipartisan  bill to establish this process.   Within a year of enactment, the bill would require the Office of  Management and Budget to submit a report to Congress containing a  strategy for addressing the risk posed by quantum computing, the  funding needed to secure Federal information technology systems from  quantum computing threats, and a review of related coordination  efforts. This will allow time for assessment of this strategy before  the National Institute of Standards and Technology issues its post- quantum cryptographic standards, which are expected in 2024.   OMB would then be required to prioritize and designate Federal IT  systems for migration to post-quantum cryptography using those  standards and to submit an annual report to Congress on progress toward  transitioning Federal agencies to the new standards.   The bill has been carefully aligned with the national security  memorandum released by the Biden-Harris administration in May, which  made important strides to advance U.S. leadership in quantum computing  by strengthening collaboration and partnerships with private-sector  leaders, securing critical capabilities, and making strategic  investments.   I am grateful to Representative Ro Khanna for leading on this  important issue and setting an ambitious but achievable framework to  both maximize the benefits and minimize the threats of quantum  computing for the U.S.  [[Page H5954]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna).    MALONEY of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of H.R. 7331,  the Improving Government for America's Taxpayers Act, which was  introduced by Representatives Derek Kilmer and William Timmons, chair  and vice chair of the Select Committee on the Modernization of  Congress. I thank Ranking Member Comer, and Representatives Connolly,  Mace, Krishnamoorthi, Norman, Porter, and Norton for cosponsoring this  bill.   This is an important bipartisan bill that would help improve the  implementation of recommendations made to Congress by the Government  Accountability Office. GAO's work for Congress is invaluable and helps  us to ensure a more effective and efficient government in serving the  people and the needs of the American people.   The bill would direct GAO to consolidate recommendations to Congress  in one succinct report. It would also direct GAO to identify any  additional oversight actions Congress should take to assist agencies in  implementing their open priority recommendations. Implementing GAO's  recommendations to agencies and Congress would help improve government  efficiency and save taxpayers' dollars.   As we seek greater transparency and accountability within our Federal  Government, I appreciate the bipartisan approach that Chair Kilmer and  Vice Chair Timmons have taken on this bill. I commend my colleagues,  Senator Portman and Senator Peters, for supporting this bill in the  Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 521, the First  Responder Fair RETIRE Act, which was introduced by the chairman of the  Government Operations Subcommittee, Representative Connolly, along with  Representatives Fitzpatrick and Langevin.   This bipartisan bill makes an important change to the law governing  certain retirement programs which cover Federal first responders and  law enforcement officials in the event that they become disabled on the  job and continue government service in a different capacity.   Currently, these Federal employees are enrolled in and pay into a  system with mandatory retirement at the age of 57, or after 20 years of  service. This system also requires greater retirement contributions  from the employee.   Under current law, when these employees become injured and disabled  in the course of their work--which is inherently dangerous--they lose  the benefits they earned before they became disabled.   H.R. 521 would allow employees in positions covered by enhanced  retirement programs to retain their original benefits if they are  injured and disabled on the job and choose to continue working for the  Federal Government.                                time  1500    The employees covered under this bill include law enforcement  officers, firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, and diplomatic  security special agents. These are, by definition, high-risk jobs.  Denying them the retirement that they were guaranteed when they entered  public service is deeply unfair.   The men and women who sign up for dangerous jobs to serve our Nation  should not be punished if they sustain injuries on the job--especially  when, despite these injuries, they choose to continue their career in  public service in a new capacity. These people should be rewarded, not  punished.   I commend Chairman Connolly for his leadership on this bill which  enjoys bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important  [[Page H5958]]  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Government  Operations.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  from Pennsylvania has no further speakers, I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 521, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 203) to designate the facility of the  United States Postal Service located at 4020 Broadway Street in  Houston, Texas, as the ``Benny C. Martinez Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 203         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 203, to honor Benny  Martinez.   Mr. Martinez was born in Goliad, Texas, in 1934. He attended  segregated schools before his father moved the family to Houston so  that Mr. Martinez and his siblings would not have to pick cotton for a  living.   At the age of 18, Mr. Martinez was inducted into the U.S. Army. He  first went to boot camp in El Paso, Texas, and was then sent to supply  handling school for the Quartermaster Corps in Fort Lee, Virginia.  After completing this training, he was sent to Korea where he was  assigned to the 564th Quartermaster Company.   On June 23, 1958, Mr. Martinez was discharged from Active Duty and  transferred to the Army Reserves at Fort Hood, Texas, where he served  as a medic until his final discharge on September 4, 1962. After his  honorable discharge, he returned home to Houston and re-engaged with  his local community.   Mr. Martinez went on to graduate from Houston Community College as a  licensed vocational nurse in 1967. He later obtained a bachelor of  general studies degree from the University of Houston-Downtown College.  Mr. Martinez put his education degree to use as an associate teacher at  Crockett Elementary.   Mr. Martinez was most known for his collaboration with fellow members  of the League of United Latin American Citizens to organize a gala for  President John F. Kennedy during the President's trip to Texas.  Historians credit this meeting as the very first time a sitting United  States President met with a Latino civil rights group.   Mr. Martinez was a member and active participant in many civic  engagement organizations including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the  American GI Forum, The American Legion, LULAC, and the Knights of  Columbus. He was also an honorary member of the Goliad Rotary Club and  active volunteer for the American Red Cross.   Due to his 35 years of service, Houston and Harris County declared  Benny C. Martinez Day on August 27, 1997, and February 17, 1998. Mr.  Martinez passed away at the age of 85 on December 29, 2019.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring his  legacy by naming the Post Office at 4020 Broadway Street in Houston,  Texas, as the Benny C. Martinez Post Office Building, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia), the vice chair of the  Committee on Financial Services' Subcommittee on Diversity and  Inclusion.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 203, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3544) to require the Administrator of  General Services to transfer certain surplus computers and technology  equipment to nonprofit computer refurbishers for repair, distribution,  and return, and for other purposes, as amended.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Computers for Veterans and       Students Act of 2022'' or the ``COVS Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Access to computers and computer technology is       indispensable for success in the 21st century. Millions of       Americans do not regularly use a computer and research shows       that substantial disparities remain in both internet use and       the quality of access with the digital divide concentrated       among older, less educated, less affluent populations,       especially veterans, low-income students, and senior       citizens.        (2) The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the gap between       those with computer access and those without. Millions of       students, their families, and workers from across the economy       were unable to do schoolwork, work remotely from home, or       connect to loved ones and their communities because of the       digital divide.        (3) Any Federal program that distributes surplus Federal       computers to a public school, an educational nonprofit, or a       nonprofit computer refurbisher for repair and distribution       would benefit from a partnership with a nonprofit       organization, whose mission is bridging the digital divide.

(e) Agency Reports.--Not later than 5 years after the date       of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the       head of each Federal agency shall make a report available to       the public on the number of repairable computers that were       sent to recycling, abandoned, or destroyed.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3544, the Computers for  Veterans and Students Act.   Technology pervades every aspect of modern life, and the gulf between  those who have access to technology and those who do not continues to  widen. Today, millions of Americans still lack access to home-based,  internet-connected computers and technology equipment. In fact,  according to the Census Bureau, only 78 percent of households in the  U.S. owned a desktop or laptop computer in 2018, leaving tens of  millions of households without the resources that are essential for  success in the modern economy.   These disparities were made worse by the coronavirus pandemic,  especially among veterans, low-income students, and seniors. This  digital divide has tangible, life-changing, and often heartbreaking  consequences, preventing people of all ages from completing schoolwork,  working remotely, or connecting with their loved ones.   H.R. 3544 will help address these disparities by ensuring surplus  Federal computers find their way to the households that need them most.   The bill requires the General Services Administration to transfer  surplus computer and technology equipment from Federal agencies to  nonprofit computer refurbishers to repair and distribute to students  and educational institutions, low-income individuals, individuals with  disabilities, veterans, and seniors in need.   The bill also requires these refurbishers to offer relevant computer  and technology training to recipients, further reducing barriers  presented by the digital divide.   I thank Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger for leading this important  bipartisan legislation, along with Representatives  Rob Wittman and  Elaine Luria. Representative Spanberger worked tirelessly to bring the  voices of veterans and students in her district here to the Halls of  Congress as she wrote and championed this bill.   For those who lack access to internet-connected computers and the  skills to use them, H.R. 3544 will unlock doors to new opportunities.  It will also bring a greater return on investment for the American  taxpayer, ensuring Federal information technology assets are used to  their full potential in the fight to close the digital divide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.

After attending Los  Angeles Harbor Junior College for a year and a half, he decided to  enlist in the U.S. Marines to serve in Vietnam.   Upon graduation from recruit training, he was promoted to private  first class and then transferred to Camp Pendleton, California, where  he trained with the 2nd Battalion.   In December of 1966, Private Anderson arrived in Vietnam where he  served as a rifleman. While on patrol, his platoon was ambushed, and an  enemy grenade landed near him and his fellow marines.   Without hesitation, Private Anderson pulled the grenade to his chest  and absorbed the majority of the blast with his body, saving the lives  of the marines around him. Due to his heroic sacrifice, Private  Anderson was the first African-American marine to receive the Medal of  Honor.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring James  Anderson's bravery by naming the Post Office at 101 South Willowbrook  Avenue in Compton, California, as the Private First Class James  Anderson, Jr., Post Office Building, and I reserve the balance of my  time.
