 Mr. Speaker, the war on American energy independence  began on day one of President Biden's administration. That war has hit  Americans hard in the pocketbook, and the cost at the pump, and for  everything else they buy has gone up as a result of this  administration's policies.   All too often we look across the globe and see the cost of those  policies, and we see that in Ukraine right now. Every single barrel of  Russian oil that we buy has at least a quarter of Ukrainian blood in  it. It is time to put an end to it.   Now we have a bill that has been much watered-down, it doesn't have  the teeth in it that it should because this administration does not  seem willing to stand up to this dictator. Now that we are having a  discussion about ending a relationship with one dictator, it seems that  the administration is willing to trade one for three, buying oil from  Venezuela, Iran, and now Saudi Arabia.   This war on pricing has got to come to an end. The war on American  energy independence has to come to an end. It is time for this  administration to open up American energy independence.
