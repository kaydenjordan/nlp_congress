 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Global Respect Act  that is being led by my friend, Mr. Cicilline. I thank him for his  passion and his leadership in the committee on this issue.   Since the Supreme Court's landmark decision legalizing same-sex  marriage in 2015, we have sought out domestic opportunities to ensure  that individuals' basic rights are not infringed upon simply because of  their sexual orientation. We have to make more progress not just here  at home but around the world, where we take leadership on this issue.   Throughout the last century, we have stood for human rights, and in  2016, I was proud to support the Global Magnitsky Act, which imposed  certain restrictions, as you have heard mentioned already. Magnitsky,  however, did not go far enough to protect the LGBTQ-plus community.   In at least 42 countries, there remain legal barriers to freedom of  expression on sexual orientation and gender identity. In at least 51  countries, there are specific laws and policies against the  formation, establishment, or registration of NGOs working on sexual  orientation issues. Nor has Magnitsky dissuaded the persecution of  LGBTQI communities whose rights continue to be violated.    That is why I was grateful to have a part in working on this Global  Respect Act legislation because it will impose needed visa sanctions on  foreign people responsible for such actions.   My own legislation, the GLOBE Act, I think would take a step further  to assert U.S. global leadership in this area and provide the  administration with additional tools to carry out those things  established in this landmark legislation. Some of those would be:  ensuring that foreign assistance and global health programs don't  discriminate against LGBTQ-plus populations, and also ensuring fair  access to asylum for LGBTQ people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the sponsor, and I urge  everyone to vote for this much-needed and very important bill.
