 Madam President, I am very pleased to join with the  distinguished Democratic leader in coauthoring this resolution.                                 S. Res. 583    Madam President, before I speak to it, I do want to speak to the  Flake-Coons resolution.   Certainly, I would have supported it; although, I believe it is the  minimum of what this body should be expressing after what we saw in  Helsinki. This is a moment for bipartisanship and for patriotism  because what I saw in Helsinki speaks to the opposite of standing up to  preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.   In the majority whip's objection to the resolution coming to a vote,  I find it interesting that, among other things, he was talking about  our having more sanctions against Russia, which I will speak to  shortly. We are in the midst of developing a new, strong package of  sanctions as it relates to Russia. So I embrace and welcome him to that  effort if he seeks to actually see real sanctions against Russia.   We have sanctions. There are sanctions that passed by 98 to 2 in this  institution and that passed overwhelmingly in the House of  Representatives, which forced the President to sign it as a result of  there having been overwhelming votes. These were sanctions that were  largely mandatory but have not been fulfilled. So we could start off by  having a robust engagement of the existing sanctions.   I am not quite sure how we start being tough on Russia. One of the  elements of those sanctions was to go after Russia's sales of defense  weapons. Yet here we are, and we are already looking for waivers. There  is a difference between a country that, maybe, has a long history of  buying Russian military equipment, but the S-400--a new anti-defense  system--is a new version. That is not a legacy issue. I am not sure how  we are going to tell one country it can buy the S-400 but tell another  country it can't. It doesn't work. That is how sanctions begin to  crumble at the end of the day. Yet I welcome the response that we  should be having new sanctions.                                 S. Res. 584    Madam President, as it relates to this resolution, it is outrageous  that the White House would not instantaneously and firmly dismiss a  proposition that Russian prosecutors question a former U.S. Ambassador.  Again and again, we have seen President Trump take Vladimir Putin's  word. It is unconscionable that this White House would give anything  other than a full-throated defense of America's Foreign Service, like  Ambassador Mike McFaul, who has served our country with honor and  distinction.   The reason Putin doesn't like Mike McFaul is that as our U.S.  Ambassador, he stood up for democracy and human rights in Russia; he  stood up to the Russian regime; and he promoted American values and  ideals. He spoke truth to power inside Russia. That is why Putin wants  him. Congress shouldn't have to tell America's President to stand up  for America's public servants and its diplomatic corps, but apparently  we have to.   President Trump has repeatedly dismissed Russia's attack in 2016 and  shrugs off the threat it poses today, despite all of our intelligence  agencies and the Director of National Intelligence, just days ago,  saying there are red blinking lights about Russia's continual  engagement and interference in  [[Page S5089]]  the elections that will take place 110 days from now.   This week, he has continuously and directly contradicted his own  national security advisers and, instead, has embraced the line of Putin  and Russian intelligence. Now, I know they have been trying to clean it  up. Yet he has said it so many times and in the same way he said it in  Helsinki. That is what he really believes. Now for him to say something  that is different--wrong time, wrong continent, not too much. He has  spouted talking points that have sounded like they have come straight  from the Kremlin. He has shown a willingness to accede to Putin's  requests to interrogate Americans, a willingness to accept Putin's  denials about Russian interference, a willingness to attack NATO allies  like Montenegro, and a willingness to be a supplicant to Putin's views.   The President keeps claiming he has been tough on Russia. No. It is  Congress that has been tough on Russia by its passing CAATSA, the  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, with broad and  deep bipartisan support. Yet the White House hasn't taken it seriously.  It has ignored a series of mandates in the law. The clear tone and  intent that came from the Helsinki summit was one of accommodation, not  of pressure.   I don't see any other way forward, other than through further  congressional action, to forcefully call out and address the  administration's willful paralysis to Putin's abhorrent behavior. To  date, our efforts have been transformative, but just as the  administration has been prepared to find ways that allow Putin to  circumvent the law and to avoid implementing mandatory provisions of  CAATSA, we must be equally prepared to adjust and adapt by closing  those loopholes.   That is why I will soon introduce comprehensive legislation to  increase pressure to actually implement the law and increase pressure  on Russia for its aggression against the United States and our allies.  Among the considerations we have for this new legislation are to  increase sanctions on Russia's energy sector, to increase sanctions on  its cyber sector, to increase pressure on Russia's oligarchs and those  who are closest to Putin, and to look at Russia's sovereign debt as a  target.   We cannot wait to see whether Russia will attack us in the 2018  election. We know it is in the midst of making that a reality, and we  need to ramp up the pressure. We can't afford to wait.   Based on this President's behavior, we also need to protect our  institutions here at home. That is why we want to include protections  for the Office of Special Counsel. The President has done more to  target Bob Mueller than he has to go after Vladimir Putin, and this  must stop. This effort must be bipartisan, which is why I look forward  to working with my Republican colleagues who truly want to see us fight  back on Russia and nearly all of whom voted to increase sanctions on  Russia last year and place more authority for sanctions alleviation in  the hands of Congress. They were right to support such measures in July  of 2017, and God knows it would now be right to step up and defend  America's interests.   It is time to show the American people that we can be patriots, not  just partisans. It is time to show the world that we can put our  country over party. It is time that we defend America's democratic  institutions against Russia's continued aggression. I look forward to  the resolution and its vote, and I urge everyone to join us in  approving it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
