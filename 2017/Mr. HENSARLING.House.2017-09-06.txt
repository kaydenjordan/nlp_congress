 Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order against the  following provision of H.R. 3354 for failure to comply with clause 2 of  rule XXI:   Beginning with the semicolon on page 535, line 12, through ``(12  U.S.C. 3907(b)(2).'' on page 536, line 14.   This provision proposes to change existing law by altering the  Federal Reserve's conduct of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and  Review regime.   This constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation  of clause 2 of rule XXI. I ask for a ruling from the Chair.   The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on this  point of order?   If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.   The Chair finds that this provision directly amends existing law.   The provision, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of  clause 2 of rule XXI.   The point of order is sustained, and the provision is stricken from  the bill.   Are there any other points of order against the bill?   For what purpose does the gentleman from Texas seek recognition?                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, I raise a point of order against section  7080 of H.R. 3354 for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI.   This provision proposes to directly amend existing law by changing  the statutory quorum requirement of the Export-Import Bank.   This constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation  of clause 2 of rule XXI. I ask for a ruling from the Chair.   The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point  of order?   If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.   The Chair finds that this section directly amends existing law.   The section, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of  clause 2 of rule XXI.   The point of order is sustained, and the section is stricken from the  bill.   For what purpose does the gentlewoman from California seek  recognition?   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I appeal the ruling of  the Chair, and I seek time to debate the appeal.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair  stand as the judgment of the Committee?   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California for 5 minutes to  debate the appeal.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I must say, I am  deeply disappointed by the sinister attempt being made here today to  strip a critical Republican-led amendment from this appropriations bill  that would thwart the will of overwhelming majorities in both Houses  and undermine the work of the job-creating Export-Import Bank.   As of the end of 2016, as many as 50 major transactions, with an  aggregate value of nearly $40 billion, had piled up in the Bank's  approval pipeline. And according to the Ex-Im Bank, if approved, these  transactions would support more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.   The longer we wait, the greater the risk that these pending  transactions will be withdrawn and sourced by our foreign competitors  and the greater the likelihood that jobs that would have otherwise  supported here in the United States will move offshore.   The chairman of the Financial Services Committee claims that striking  this amendment would have ``no budgetary effect'' but this is hardly  the case. President Trump's own fiscal year 2018 budget estimates that  a fully functional Export-Import Bank would generate $587.7 million in  excess funds in the next fiscal year.    The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman will suspend.   The gentlewoman is reminded that debate on the appeal must be  confined to the question of whether the Chair's ruling should be  sustained or not and not the substance of the underlying section.   The gentlewoman is still recognized but must confine her remarks to  the appeal itself.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I would like to continue  to appeal the ruling of the Chair.   I hardly think it is in order, and I would ask the Chair to rule the  request by Chairman Hensarling as not in violation.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is again, Shall the decision of the  Chair stand as the judgment of the Committee?   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  had it.   The Acting CHAIR. The decision of the Chair stands as the judgment of  the Committee.   No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order  except those printed in part B of House Report 115-295, amendments en  bloc described in section 3 of House Resolution 500, and pro forma  amendments described in section 4 of that resolution.   Each further amendment printed in part B of the report shall be  considered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only  by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read,  shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided  and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn by  the proponent at any time before action thereon, shall not be subject  to amendment except as provided by section 4 of House Resolution 500,  and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question.   It shall be in order at any time for the chair of the Committee on  Appropriations or his designee to offer amendments en bloc consisting  of further amendments printed in part B of the report not earlier  disposed of. Amendments en bloc shall be considered as read, shall be  debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their  designees, shall not be subject to amendment, except as provided by  section 4 of House Resolution 500, and shall not be subject to a demand  for division of the question.   During consideration of the bill for amendment, the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective  designees may offer up to 20 pro forma amendments each at any point for  the purpose of debate.   It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of  House Report 115-295.         Amendments En Bloc No. 1 Offered by Mr. Aderholt of Alabama
