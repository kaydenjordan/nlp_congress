 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the bill before  us today.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2988, the Whistleblower Protection  Improvement Act of 2021. In May 2021, I introduced the Whistleblower  Protection Improvement Act, along with Representative Nancy Mace,  ranking member of the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Subcommittee.   Federal whistleblowers serve a critical role by shedding a light on  government corruption, waste, fraud, and abuse and wrongdoing, often  through reporting such actions to Congress. Their disclosures protect  taxpayers' dollars, improve Federal programs, and even save lives.  Unfortunately, the Oversight Committee has seen too many examples of  employers retaliating against whistleblowers. In one instance, the TSA,  the Transportation Security Administration, that provides security at  airports, moved an airport employee hundreds of miles away to a new  duty station when they revealed security flaws at the TSA at the  airports.   In another troubling example, a White House supervisor moved files  beyond the reach of a disabled employee after the employee disclosed  violations of security clearance procedures.   A GAO report earlier this year also revealed that employees at four  scientific research agencies did not report instances of political  interference in scientific decisionmaking out of fear of retaliation  and uncertainty of how to best voice their concerns.   As these examples make clear, whistleblowers often make disclosures  at great personal risk. That is why protections for whistleblowers have  long received bipartisan support in this Congress. I thank my  colleagues, including Representative Mace, for continuing that  tradition today.   The Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act would enact long-overdue  reforms to protect whistleblowers from retaliation to the greatest  extent possible, and to provide meaningful remedies if whistleblowers  still encounter retaliation.   The bill would prohibit agencies from launching retaliatory  investigations against employees who blow the whistle and would limit  the public disclosure of a whistleblower's identity.   The bill would also provide Federal whistleblowers with faster legal  recourse for retaliation claims and would allow them to have their  claims tried before a jury in a Federal District Court. Access to jury  trials has long been a priority of whistleblower advocates.   The last major reform to whistleblower protection was in 2012. I am  proud to continue this important bipartisan effort to protect  whistleblowers today.   The bill we are considering also clarifies that whistleblowers who  prevail are entitled to recover attorney's fees and to receive the  necessary relief to make them whole.   Finally, the bill would make clear that no Federal employee,  including the President or the Vice President of the U.S., may  interfere or retaliate against a whistleblower for disclosing  information to Congress.   The Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act has received public  support from more than 100 stakeholder organizations, including the  Government Accountability Project, the National Taxpayers Union, the  Project on Government Oversight, the Taxpayer Protection Alliance, and  Whistleblowers of America.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter of support from 100  different organizations.                                                     July 14. 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: During the last month, our nation has       been fixated on evidence about threats to our democracy       exposed in the January 6 Select Committee hearings. The       undersigned organizations commend your leadership creating       the January 6 Committee for exposing the truth. The       undersigned organizations now seek your leadership protecting       those who provide the evidence.        The Committee on Oversight and Reform has marked up HR       6762. the Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act (WPIA).       The legislation deserves floor time for a House vote so that       we can highlight its passage on July 30. 2022, National       Whistleblower Appreciation Day. The House has voted for this       reform in the Protect Our Democracy Act. but Senate action       requires standalone legislation.        The WPIA would be the fifth generation of pioneering       whistleblower rights first passed in 1978. These rights have       been excellent global pacesetters that Congress unanimously       has reaffirmed three time since 1978, the last in the       Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012. The two       Achilles heels, however, have been loopholes and lack of       credible due process enforcement.        Those problems only have become worse since 2012. For       example, the administrative Merit Systems Protection Board       has a monopoly on enforcement. but its vulnerability to       political pressure blocked confirmations and led to an empty       Board with a 3,500 case back log. Lacking judicial       independence, its Administrative Judges who conduct hearings       rule against whistleblowers in over 95% of initial merits       decisions.        The WPIA addresses both the loopholes and due process gaps       by providing parity for federal civil service employee       whistleblower rights with those enacted by Congress 16 times       in each or 17 private sector whistleblower law enacted since       2002. To illustrate it would--        Permit jury trials if there is no timely administrative       decision. This would take the politics out of       whistleblowerjustice for federal employees the nation's only       major labor group denied a day in court to challenge       violation of their free speech rights despite making the       disclosures most significant for voters.        Permit lawsuits when retaliatory investigations are opened.       Investigations are a kneejerk first reaction to find any dirt       on whistleblowers that will distract from government fraud,       waste and abuse. As long as a probe is open, it has a broad       chilling effect even if later dropped. This key provision       would establish parity with all other whistleblower laws,       even the Military Whistleblower Protection Act.        Establish realistic legal burdens to obtain temporary       relief. Temporary relief is almost never available under       current law and is essential when cases commonly drag out       over five years. By that time, even winning may be too late       for those who have lost their homes, gone bankrupt frequently       lost their families and had their professional deputations       irrevocably ruined.        Close loopholes that erase the law's benefits. Currently,       Public Health Service (PHS) whistleblowers are excluded from       the Whistleblower Protection Act and limited to military       remedies, as are employees of the National Oceanic and       Atmospheric Agency (NOAA). However, these are the       professionals from whom we need the truth about public health       threats like the pandemic and environmental threats like       climate change. Loopholes in remedies mean that       whistleblowers still can ``lose by winning.'' The WPIA fills       these and similar gaps.        This legislation is a political opportunity supported by       86% of likely voters in a Marist Poll survey just before the       last election, and more than 265 organizations across the       issue and political spectrum have already expressed support       for its passage. It extends the same rights to federal       employees defending the public that Congress repeatedly has       provided to corporate employees defending the shareholders.       We need your leadership, so that those who defend the public       can defend themselves.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill and to  support the heroes and heroines who disclose wrongdoing and corruption  in our government, leading to reforms to make our government stronger  and better able to serve the American people.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the distinguished chairman  of the Subcommittee on Government Operations.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the  distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, there are no more  speakers, and I am prepared to close if my colleagues on the Republican  side are ready to close, as well.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, this bill does not prohibit agencies from investigating  actual misconduct. It merely prohibits launching an investigation as  retaliation for blowing the whistle.   When an agency becomes aware of a disclosure of waste, fraud, and  abuse, the concern of the agency should be addressing those issues  rather than retaliating against the employee who discloses the  problems.   This change fills a critical role created by the 2020 appeals court  decision that held that current whistleblower laws only prohibit a  retaliatory investigation if the investigation ultimately resulted in a  significant change in the employee's working conditions. This decision  ignored the effect that a retaliatory investigation has on a  whistleblower when an investigation is going on. So, I disagree with  the gentleman's statement, and I am now prepared to close.   Mr. Chair, I want to stress the urgency and importance of this  legislation and talk about how important it is to protect our  whistleblowers.   They play a critical role in exposing wrongdoing within the  government, sometimes at great personal risk. They need to be able to  alert agency leaders and Congress without fear of retaliation.   Passing H.R. 2988 would help give whistleblowers the protection they  deserve. The key reforms in the bill would prohibit agencies from  launching retaliatory investigations and extend whistleblowers the  right to a jury trial, which they have long sought, and permit  whistleblowers to receive attorney fees if they win their lawsuits.   This bill establishes new protections for whistleblowers who have a  crucial role in shedding light on government corruption and wrongdoing.   This bill is also strongly supported by well over 100 stakeholder  organizations. Just today, the National Taxpayers Union announced its  inclusion of this bill as one of its ``No Brainers'' list for bills  that Congress should pass. Only a few bills receive this kind of  recognition. This is landmark legislation, both for freedom of speech  and for government accountability.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have cosponsored  this important legislation and spoken in support of it. Mr. Chair, I  strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, pursuant to House  Resolution 1339, I offer amendments en bloc.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer  amendments en bloc.   The amendment offered by Congresswoman Katie Porter would require  inspectors general to report in their semiannual reports the number of  times their office was not able to resolve a whistleblower retaliation  complaint within 8 months of receiving that complaint. This requirement  ensures that inspectors general are promptly investigating  whistleblower retaliation complaints.   The next amendment, offered by Congressman Jake Auchincloss, would  require the Government Accountability Office to examine and report on  whistleblower protection actions, including the timeliness with which  the Merit Systems Protection Board issues rulings on whistleblower  complaints, how often individuals choose a jury trial, and  recommendations to improve the claim review process.                                time  1630    This requirement evaluates whether the whistleblower review process  is effective and identifies areas for improvement.   The amendment offered by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee would  require inspectors general to maintain a mechanism to receive anonymous  whistleblower reports. In certain instances, this offers the protection  and comfort a whistleblower needs to report government abuses and  corruption.   The next amendment, offered by Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger,  would enable whistleblowers, outside the intelligence community, to  appeal adverse security clearance actions to the Merit Systems  Protection Board.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to adopt this commonsense package of  amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the distinguished  chairwoman of the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism and Homeland Security.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss), the vice chair of  the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on  Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   The underlying bill is both landmark legislation for freedom of  speech and for government accountability. I strongly urge my colleagues  to vote in favor of this landmark legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I move that the committee now rise.    MALONEY of New York. I withdraw my motion.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded  vote.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I move that the  Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Veasey) having assumed the chair, Mr. Blumenauer, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2988) to  amend title 5, United States Code, to modify and enhance protections  for Federal Government whistleblowers, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8326.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8326, the Ensuring a Fair  and Accurate Census Act.   The decennial Census is a critical part of our democratic system. In  fact, it is required by the Constitution. The results of the Census  determine the distribution of over $1.5 trillion in Federal funds,  apportionment of the House of Representatives and State legislative  districts, and public and private sector investments.                                time  1645    It is critical that the Census count is complete, fair, and accurate.  The Ensuring a Fair and Accurate Census Act will help make sure that it  is.   This bill is informed by the Oversight Committee's multi-year  investigation into political interference by the previous  administration during the 2020 Census, including the effort to add a  citizenship question despite strong opposition from expert  statisticians and demographers at the Census Bureau.   In fact, the Census Bureau's top data scientist warned that the  citizenship question ``harms the quality of the Census count.''   The Supreme Court ruled in favor with the Democrats and ultimately  stepped in to block the citizenship question, ruling that the rationale  for adding it to the Census ``seems to have been contrived.''   The previous administration took other steps that risked undermining  the independent, nonpartisan nature of the Census. They appointed an  unprecedented eight political appointees where there were previously  only three, and they tried to rush the processing of the Census data,  despite repeated warnings from career staff that this would compromise  the integrity of the Census count.   Partisan manipulation of the Census is simply wrong. My bill would  protect the Census and ensure this cannot happen again, regardless of  which party is in power.   We are considering this legislation at a critical time. While the  2030 Census is years away, the design and planning began at the Bureau  even before the 2020 numbers were released.   As our Nation's largest peacetime mobilization, the Census requires  detailed and thorough planning. However, even the best plans face  challenges in the field, and the 2020 Census faced unprecedented  obstacles.   In the runup to the 2020 Census, the Bureau was consistently denied  the appropriations--the funding that it needed--to execute its  operational plans. Among other impacts, this uncertainty forced  cutbacks in outreach to communities that are considered hard to reach.   The coronavirus pandemic forced the Census Bureau to suspend field  operations at the most critical time; and most damaging, the previous  administration demanded a last-minute, untested question on  citizenship, and installed a record number of political appointees with  unclear duties to get that done.   This legislation would vest key decision-making authority over the  Census in the appropriate Senate-confirmed official, the Census  Director. It would limit the number of political appointees within the  Bureau to no more than four, which is consistent with historical  precedent.   This bill would also require that new Census questions be thoroughly  researched and analyzed, certified by the Secretary of Commerce,  evaluated by the GAO, and shared with Congress before being added to  the Census questionnaire.   This bill will also increase transparency and support long-term  planning by requiring the Bureau to submit its projected 5-year budget  estimates to both the President and Congress.   Finally, the bill codifies existing advisory committees charged with  engaging with hard-to-count communities and advancing best practices in  the field of data science. It also establishes an advisory committee  aimed directly at ensuring the 2030 Census is successful.   I am proud that my bill has the support of four former directors of  the Census Bureau, who served under administrations led by both  Democrats and Republicans. These former directors have 15 years of  experience serving  [[Page H7834]]  as Census Directors supporting five decennial Censuses.   In a statement, they commended the bill's objective and said that it  ``protects the independence and integrity of the scientific mission of  the Census Bureau.'' These former directors concluded, ``trust in our  Nation's official data is essential to the democracy and the economy,  and this legislation will undergird'' and build that trust.   Mr. Chair, I include their statements in the Record as well as an  editorial from ``The Washington Post'' titled: ``The Trump  Administration's Assault on the Census Must Not Happen Again,'' along  with two additional editorials, and a letter from Population  Association of America and Association of Population Centers.   Mr. Chair, this editorial concluded, ``The Trump administration's  assault on the integrity of the Census should be an urgent warning. Too  much rests on the decennial count to allow it to be exploited for  partisan gain.''       Statement by Form U.S. Census Bureau Directors--July 12, 2022   In Support of House Legislation ``Ensuring a Fair and & Accurate Census                                   Act''         We applaud the legislation introduced this week by the       Chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Rep.       Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) that we believe will help preserve       and protect the independence and integrity of the scientific       mission at the U.S. Census Bureau.        Having helped to plan, execute or lead five decennial       censuses serving nine Presidents of both parties, and having       closely observed the 2020 Decennial process, we strongly feel       the reforms in the ``Ensuring a Fair and & Accurate Census       Act'' would help build greater trust and confidence in the       essential data the Census Bureau supplies to the nation.       Collectively, the provisions of this bill strengthen the       professional roles of career scientists, provide greater       transparency into methods and processes across the 130 Census       surveys and censuses, and enhance Congressional oversight       over Bureau functions.        Trust in the nation's official data is essential to the       democracy and the economy, and this legislation will       undergird that trust.      Vincent Barabba,        (1973-76 & 1979-81).

A new       report, released last week by the House Committee on       Oversight and Reform, paints a grim picture of what was       happening behind the scenes.        A draft of an August 2017 memo, prepared by a political       appointee in the Commerce Department, examined the idea of       using citizenship data for apportioning seats in the House of       Representatives, concluding it would likely be       unconstitutional. Later versions omitted that language and       came down in favor of including the question.        The newly released documents undercut the Trump       administration's repeated claims that the citizenship       question had nothing to do with apportionment. The       Constitution plainly states: ``Representatives shall be       apportioned among the several States according to their       respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in       each State.''        At the time, then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other       officials offered various unconvincing justifications for       adding the question, most frequently that it would help       enforce the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court blocked the       move, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. calling the       rationale ``contrived.'' The House report reinforces that       conclusion.        The census is a crucial tool, used not only for       apportionment and redistricting, but also for allocating       approximately $1.5 trillion in annual federal aid to states       and localities. Experts warned that a citizenship question       would frighten immigrants and lead to the undercounting of       minority communities.        Though the question was ultimately not included, the       lengthy and public battle over it appears to have been       enough: The Census Bureau reported that Black, Hispanic and       Native Americans were undercounted at higher levels in 2020       compared with 2010--Hispanics by a statistically significant       amount--while White and Asian Americans were overcounted.       Never mind that this might have backfired on Republicans,       with the bureau reporting it significantly undercounted       populations in Florida and Texas--red states with large       minority communities--and overcounted populations in blue       states such as Rhode Island and Minnesota. The accuracy of       the census depends in no small part on its credibility, which       has been severely damaged.        The next census is in 2030, but--given the scale of the       undertaking and importance of the results--Congress should       work quickly to insulate it from political interference. A       bill recently introduced by Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.),       chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, would do just       that. The Ensuring a Fair and Accurate Census Act would       restrict the number of political appointees at the Census       Bureau, bar the removal of a bureau director without just       cause and require new questions to be submitted to Congress       ahead of time. It would also mandate new questions be       ``researched, tested and certified'' by the commerce       secretary and ``evaluated by the Government Accountability       Office.''        Though it was not able to implement its most drastic plans,       the Trump administration's assault on the integrity of the       census should be an urgent warning. Too much rests on the       decennial count to allow it to be exploited for partisan       gain.                                   ____                  [From the Washington Post, Sept. 13, 2020]              Opinion: The Census Is on the Verge of Disaster                          (By the Editorial Board)         Here is one of the least surprising revelations ever leaked       from the federal government: According to an internal Census       Bureau document, major, uncorrectable errors may result from       forcing the bureau's enumerators and number-crunchers to rush       through the decennial count. House Oversight and Reform       Committee Chair Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) revealed the       document this month, claiming it was a presentation for       Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau. It       shows that the decision of Senate Republicans and the Trump       administration to give the bureau no more time to finish a       count that started late and has encountered pandemic-related       problems threatens to corrupt for a decade the process of       distributing congressional seats and doling out some $1.5       trillion in annual federal aid.        ``A compressed review period creates risk for serious       errors not being discovered in the data--thereby       significantly decreasing data quality,'' the document warns.        To be clear, this would not be the fault of the bureau's       professionals, whom Republicans have put in an impossible       position. They are facing a statutory deadline requiring that       they deliver their count by Dec. 31. The bureau had       previously asked for more time. House Democrats authorized a       deadline extension. Senate Republicans failed to do so, and       the Trump administration ordered last month that door-      knocking conclude by Sept. 30, weeks earlier than the experts       had hoped.        The newly revealed document shows that, at the time the       short timetable was announced, the bureau knew that       ``abbreviated processes or eliminated activities . . . will       reduce accuracy.'' Not only would door-knocking end weeks       sooner, but also the number-crunching needed after the door-      knockers finished their work would be compressed into 92       days. Since 1990, the number-crunching has consumed between       140 and 185 days, according to Ms. Maloney. ``Serious errors       discovered in the data may not be fixed--due to lack of time       to research and understand the root cause or to re-run and       re-review one or multiple state files,'' the document warns.       ``A compressed review period creates risk for errors being       present in the data.''        The only perspective from which this is not a potential       disaster is that of Republicans seeking maximum partisan       advantage. The Trump administration already tried once to       skew the count by adding a citizenship question to the census       form, which would have deterred immigrants, even legal ones,       from responding. The Supreme Court halted that move. Yet       rushing the census might help Republicans because poor and       minority communities tend to be the ones undercounted, which       would make many Democratic-leaning states appear to be less       populous than they are--and therefore due less money and       political representation.        The Senate should have passed a covid-19 relief bill months       ago, with a census deadline extension in it. With the bureau       up against a wall, senators should not wait to agree on the       rest of a relief package to give the counters more time. The       census needs clarity, now.                                   ____            Committee on Oversight and Reform, House of             Representatives,                                                    Washington, DC.        Dear Colleague: I urge you to support H.R. 8326, the       Ensuring a Fair and Accurate Census Act. The editorial board       piece below appeared in the N.Y. Daily News today. The bill       works to improve the operations at the Census Bureau and       guards against political meddling.        The bill has the support of four former, bipartisan,       Directors of the Census Bureau as well as the Population       Association of America and the Association of Population       Centers.                 [From New York Daily News, Sept. 14, 2022]   Keeping the Census Honest: Rep. Carolyn Maloney has the Right Bill to                      Stop Politicization of the Count                      (By Daily News Editorial Board)         Donald Trump and his secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross,       tried to inject politics into the U.S. Census Bureau for the       2020 decennial count of every person in America. They did it       by seeking to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.       But New York  [[Page H7835]]       led 18 states in suing and won before the U.S. Supreme Court       in 2019, which blocked the Trump/Ross citizenship question.        That we know, but now Rep. Carolyn Maloney's Committee on       Oversight and Reform has found even more evidence and proof       that it was all a political ploy, not rooted in any       legitimate demographic reasoning. To prevent future such       manipulation, Maloney has a bill on the House floor today to       protect the integrity of the Census Bureau. We hope that the       measure passes with large majorities of both parties.        After Chief Justice John Roberts and the high court stopped       the citizenship question, Trump and Ross tried again in the       summer of 2020, after the count was completed, with a       memorandum instructing the Census Bureau to exclude       undocumented immigrants from the apportionment process which       divides up the 435 House seats among the states based on       population gains and losses in the prior decade. Again, the       federal courts stepped in and the clearly unconstitutional       maneuver was abandoned.        Still, the sustained efforts targeting immigrants       undoubtedly had the intended effect to dampen the       participation rate of non-citizens, documented or not, which       was Trump's goal from the beginning.        Maloney's bill protects the director of the Bureau of the       Census from meddling by secretary of commerce, an appointee       and supporter of the president. Any new questions on the       census forms must be submitted in advance to Congress and       certified that they satisfy established statistical policies       and procedures (not just because a president wants it). The       Congress is also to receive a biannual report detailing       preparations for the next big count.        We got lucky last time that the courts stopped Trump and       Ross from trying to warp the census numbers. Next time we       shouldn't have to take that risk. Pass the Maloney bill.            Sincerely,                                                Carolyn B. Maloney,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                               Population Association of America,                                 Alexandria, VA, September 12, 2022.      Hon. Carolyn Maloney,      Rayburn House Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Maloney: On behalf of the organizations       we lead, the Population Association of America and       Association of Population Centers, we are writing to express       support for your efforts to enact constructive reforms at the       U.S. Census Bureau. Your bill, H.R. 8326, Ensuring a Fair and       Accurate Census Act, contains several provisions that would       strengthen the Census Bureau as the nation's principal       statistical agency.        We are pleased that the bill, for example, would empower       the Census Bureau to communicate its annual funding needs       more directly to the public and clarify the process by which       the agency adds and approves questions on the decennial       census. Further, we applaud provisions that reauthorize       existing advisory committees, such as the Census Scientific       Advisory Committee and the National Advisory Committee, both       of which have served as effective forums for data users and       experts, including population scientists, to engage with the       Census Bureau.        H.R. 8326 is an important first step to ensure the Bureau       can sustain its critical mission and operations while       undergoing necessary adaptions in preparation for the 2030       Census. We congratulate you on your leadership and look       forward to working with you and your colleagues as it       proceeds through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Dr. Sonalde Desai,                      President, Population Association of America.                                                Dr. Sara R. Curran,                      President, Association of Population Centers.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, this bill is sensible  and is driven by facts uncovered in our investigation and input from  both civil rights groups and professionals at the Census Bureau.   We must have a full, fair, and accurate Census count so that every  American can have faith that they and their communities are receiving  the representation and the services that they deserve. To do that, we  need a nonpartisan, expert-driven Census Bureau. This bill is a strong  first step to meet that goal.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Government Operations for the Oversight Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this bill does not address Congressional apportionment.  It is about making the Census fair and accurate.   Nevertheless, our Census count has never been limited based on  citizenship and there is no doubt that doing so would violate the  Constitution. The 14th Amendment says seats in Congress are based on  the whole number of persons in each State. Persons, not citizens.   Last Congress, I chaired a hearing with four former Census directors  who served under both Democrats and Republicans. All four agreed that  excluding undocumented immigrants from the apportionment count violated  the Constitution. That is also the position taken by previous  administrations, including under Republican Presidents.   In fact, my committee recently uncovered a draft internal legal memo  from the Trump administration about the citizenship question. That memo  admitted that using citizenship data to exclude immigrants from the  apportionment counts would violate, ``over 200 years of precedent.''  That damning language was removed from the final memo used to push the  citizenship question.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Danny K. Davis).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I have no more  speakers on the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   I stress the urgency and importance of this legislation. The United  States Census Bureau is a foundational institution and one that we must  take all necessary steps to protect.  [[Page H7837]]    The Census is for all people and should count every person. Efforts  to politicize the Bureau have real consequences that can reduce  response rates and thereby lessen the representation and resources  available to communities.   I thank my colleagues for speaking in support of this bill, the  former directors and advocates that have lent their support, and I  encourage us all to vote in favor of ensuring a fair and accurate  Census count.   No matter the party affiliation, every one of us has an interest in  providing our best services to our constituents.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 8326  and the underlying amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.
