 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 460.

It is interesting, my friend talks about Pennsylvania's budget, and I  was proud to serve there and be part of the process.   I thought it was a difficult and a broken process there. We would  pass a budget weeks beyond the deadline or sometimes months. There  would be vigorous discussions with the Governor on what that budget  should look like, but at the end of the day, we did it. My friend is  exactly right. We passed a  [[Page H8302]]  budget where expected revenues matched the appropriations that we put  forward.   So it was a little unbelievable to come here and see that we haven't  done that in about, at least, 20 years here. We certainly haven't  balanced the budget in almost our lifetime here. And so as broken as I  thought the process was at the State level, at least at the end of the  process we had a product that balanced the budget.   So I want to just express my appreciation and thanks to Mr. Arrington  for leading this discussion. I share--as he knows, we have had  discussions about this--the deep concerns for the current state of our  Nation's finances. We talk about this. We serve on the Ways and Means  Committee together, and I think Ways and Means Committee members  understand the problems we are faced with if we don't address this.   I also serve on the Budget Committee, and there we talk about the  problems that we are faced with. But this has to extend beyond just  those two committees. It has to extend to our conference and also to  this entire body and entire system of government.   We need to be talking about how this impacts our constituents, how it  impacts people at home, and why they should care about this. Some  people maybe don't even understand that issues of Federal debt and  deficits even matter.   Sometimes I like to put it in simple terms. Think of our national  debt, say, like a balance on a credit card. We all do budgets in our  homes and in our businesses. But think about the national debt. We  can't even imagine the $30 trillion number which, by the way, is about  $245,000 per American. But let's just talk about it as a credit card.  Every one of us will have to shoulder this debt at some point, and we  are going to have to make sacrifices.   If you have credit card debt in your home, then you have to make  sacrifices to pay it down. The higher the balance, the higher the  minimum payment, meaning less money at the end of each month for things  that you would rather spend on than paying down and making that credit  card payment, like healthcare or saving for retirement, whatever it may  be.   If you don't pay down the balance--we haven't done that in a long  time here--it will affect your credit rating. You will become  uncreditworthy. That will result in higher interest rates, and you will  face more payments. It is a snowball effect. That credit rating will  plummet. Not only will you pay more, but then no one will trust you  with a new loan. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the longer you wait to pay  down that credit card debt, the more it grows and grows and grows.   We should all care that every dollar the government spends should be  spent responsibly. It is the taxpayers' money. The taxpayers earned it.  We should be responsible with their dollars. But we certainly haven't  seen the Biden administration doing that. Biden's government has  accrued $4.8 trillion in new debt since taking office. We now owe over  $30 trillion in debt. That is $245,000 per taxpayer. The American  Rescue Plan, the inflation act, the student loan forgiveness, and many  other misguided policies each drastically increase the role of  government in everyday American lives.   Biden's policies over the past year have incentivized people not to  work, rewarded those who have accrued college student loan debt on the  backs of those who have worked hard to pay off their own debt or  totally avoided debt and have weakened America's goal to be a symbol of  freedom in the world.   If we are going to defend the American Dream, then we must fix this  problem. We must fix actually the broken budget process here in  Congress as well, which the gentleman has talked about.   This week we are, once again, going to fund the government on a  massive, short-term, continuing resolution loaded with irresponsible  spending. Over the past 4 years of Speaker Pelosi's leadership in the  House, House Democrats didn't pass a budget resolution by regular order  except to push partisan reconciliation bills that have spent trillions  of dollars.   I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as Republicans, we have made a  commitment to Americans, our Commitment to America. And certainly all  of us in this conference--certainly those of us in the Budget  Committee--will ensure that we do the work, we pass a budget on time  and through regular order, and we stick to it. Republicans will commit  to reducing our spending in order to preserve that American Dream that  we think is so important for future generations.   I thank Mr. Arrington for leading this, and I appreciate the  opportunity to be a part of it.
