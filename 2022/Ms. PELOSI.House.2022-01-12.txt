 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership in  bringing this important legislation to the floor and for yielding.   We owe our veterans everything. They make us the home of the brave  and the land of the free. They protect our democracy. They and their  families make us so very, very proud.   I thank the gentleman again, Mr. Takano, as chair of the committee,  and Mr. Levin for his leadership on this particular legislation which I  will acknowledge in a moment.   First, Mr. Speaker, I want to say, nearly eight decades ago when  Congress enacted the first GI Bill, our Nation made a bipartisan and  unbreakable promise: that every hero who steps forward to defend our  Nation deserves the tools to succeed when they come home. Today, the  House will proudly take another strong step toward fulfilling that  pledge.   On behalf of the Congress, I commend the outstanding leadership of  the committee chair, Mark Takano, who has ensured that the Veterans'  Affairs Committee remains committed to its long legacy of  bipartisanship. I salute the chair of the Veterans' Affairs  Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Congressman   Mike Levin of  California, both for leading on this important legislation every step  of the way and for his lifetime advocacy on behalf of our military  communities.   Every time our Nation seeks to strengthen and expand benefits for  veterans, we have listened closely to our men and women in uniform and  our veterans, taking their insight and expertise into account. We  continue to listen to them today as we continue to build upon our  progress and appropriately honor their service.   On a regular basis we have a meeting with our veterans service  organizations. The American Legion is very much a part of that, as well  as other groups reflecting our involvement in other wars since World  War II, and we still have a few veterans from then.   What is interesting about this legislation today to me is that,  again, it sprang from listening to our men and women in uniform and our  veterans as to what their needs are. That is exactly how the first GI  Bill came to be.   The veterans of World War I, recognizing the disadvantages that they  were at after World War I, came forth with the proposal to have the GI  Bill. So this was passed and signed by Franklin Roosevelt during World  War II at the suggestion of veterans of World War I.   During the dark days of the Second World War and after listening to  the calls of the brave veterans of World War I, President Roosevelt  made clear the urgent moral imperative of supporting our returning  soldiers.   In a message to Congress in November 1943, he said,   ``The members of the Armed Forces have been compelled to make greater  economic sacrifice and every other kind of sacrifice than the rest of  us, and they are entitled to definite action to help take care of their  special problems.''   I am very proud that my father, Thomas D'Alesandro, was in this  Chamber. He was a Member of Congress from Baltimore when the President  said that. His brother would be lost shortly thereafter in the battle  leading up to the Battle of the Bulge.   Less than a year later, Congress enacted the first GI Bill on an  overwhelmingly bipartisan vote marking a turning point in how our  Nation cares for our veterans. In doing so, we made a transformational  investment in our servicemembers, opening the doors to a college  education and home ownership, launching millions of families into the  middle class.   In 2008 it was my great privilege to serve as Speaker as the Congress  took a crucial step to bring these benefits into the 21st century. With  the Post-9/11 GI Bill--passed on a strong bipartisan vote and signed  into law by President George W. Bush--we expanded the promise of a  full, 4-year college education to veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan, and  we ensured subsequent legislation that their families could also take  advantage of that benefit. In 2017 we strengthened this law by  improving benefits and closing gaps in eligibility so that we can best  serve those who served our Nation.   Yet, today, too many veterans still do not receive equal access to  the life-changing benefits they have earned. Over the last few decades,  our valiant reservists and guardsmen have become even more integral to  America's national security strategy. Our reservists often serve side  by side with Active-Duty servicemembers, do the same jobs, and incur  the same risks. And as our Nation has battled the pandemic, our  communities have relied on our guardsmen to help protect our Nation  from the deadly virus.   These heroes are essential to keeping our families and our Nation  safe, but current law falls short of delivering the benefits they  deserve. With the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, we will ensure  that every day our reservists and guardsmen heroes serve in uniform  count toward their GI benefits. In doing so, we will lift up hundreds  of thousands of current and future veterans across the Nation so that  they, too, will have the opportunities they need to thrive in the 21st  century economy.   Let me be clear: ensuring every servicemember has equal access to  hard-earned benefits is an issue of fairness. When the House passes  this legislation today, we will build on the proud, bipartisan progress  forged by generations of lawmakers in this Chamber and in the Senate as  well, we show our heroes that they will always have our unwavering  support, and we honor the sacrifice on the battlefield. The military  vows that on the battlefield we will leave no soldier behind, and when  they come home, we pledge that we will leave no veteran behind.   There is so much more that we can learn from listening to our  veterans and our servicemembers that we must do, so that they can take  their strongest position when they come home.   Mr. Speaker, in this all-American spirit, I urge a very strong  ``aye'' vote for this legislation.   I want to thank the distinguished chairman for his leadership and    Mike Levin for his relentless persistence for the benefit of our  veterans as a member of that important committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.  [[Page H57]]         Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts,  the distinguished chair of the Rules Committee, for his leadership in  bringing this important legislation to the floor tonight to enable us  to fight for voting rights tomorrow when we vote for the legislation.  Many of us will have more to say tomorrow on the substance of that  bill, but I just want to place this action in time.   Today is a historic day because we are taking a big step forward  thanks to the leadership of the distinguished majority leader in the  Senate, Chuck Schumer. We are in a position now to take a step forward  with this rule to enable us to debate the bill tomorrow to fight for  voting rights.   Yesterday, President Biden made it crystal clear that the Senate must  find a path forward to enshrine critical voting rights legislation into  law. That was yesterday.   Today, House Democrats will take another step to defend our democracy  with legislation called the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. We will  send it to the Senate for urgent consideration after we debate it and  vote on it tomorrow.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank   John Sarbanes from Maryland. This is  a bill that we have voted on in the last Congress but also in this  Congress, in this House of Representatives. We voted for the For the  People Act, which is the essence of the legislation we are considering  now. It was H.R. 1 in the House.   In addition to that, it is attached to H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will be part of this package  tomorrow because of the leadership of Chuck Schumer;   John Sarbanes;  Zoe Lofgren; Terri Sewell, who has carried this legislation again and  again; Mr. Butterfield; the distinguished chair of the Judiciary  Committee, Mr. Nadler; and so many people.                                time  2150    We have had this debate over and over again in the House and in this  Congress, so when I hear people say, ``Oh, here comes a bill that has  never seen the light of day,'' no. We had a vote in the House on this  already. We had a vote on this in the House already, and this is as it  came back to us this time from the Senate.   Yesterday, as I said, the President made it crystal clear that we had  to get something done. Again, Mr. McGovern is giving us that  opportunity now. So I just want to say that is why this is necessary.  It has been said in the gentleman's committee this evening--but let me  just be brief because the night is getting on--since we passed the bill  before, and in the course of the year, the Republicans have continued  their assault on voting rights in our country.   Nearly 400 bills were introduced, 20 of them enacted into law, which  not only suppressed the vote, making it harder for people of color and  people with disabilities--people--to vote, but also legislation to  nullify the vote.   It doesn't matter how the people vote; it matters how the people we  appoint decide how they vote. That is not a democracy. It strikes to  the heart of a democracy.   It strikes to the heart of a democracy, and that is why this  legislation is even more necessary than when it was first introduced.  It is a continuation in legislatures across the country of the assault  that was made on this Capitol to undermine the Constitution, the  Capitol, the Congress, and our democracy on January 6.   As the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts mentioned earlier,  there was not even a vote to accept on the part of many on the other  side of the aisle the results of that election. I thank Mr. McGovern  not only for his leadership tonight but for that dangerous day for him  to take over the chair after the security spirited me out because of  threats on my life.   So, again, this is urgent. It is a repeat of what we have done and  done again and again. We are glad that the Senate is ready to receive  this next iteration with very little change from what we had passed  before.   In Georgia, when President Biden delivered a clarion call to defend  our democracy, he said: ``I will not yield. I will not flinch. I will  defend your right,'' he said to folks, ``to vote and our democracy  against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And so the question  [[Page H68]]  is: Where will the institution of the United States Senate stand?''   Well, we will see. We had the question of the filibuster. Now, until  we had this debate on this voting rights and filibuster has become a  discussion, what was your view, Madam Speaker, of what that word meant?   When somebody said they were going to filibuster something or they  were engaged in a filibuster, you thought they were going to talk for a  long time, to filibuster, to talk for a long time, not to obstruct  justice, not to obstruct debate, not to obstruct the majority to be  able to take a vote, to discuss something.   By passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, the Democratic  House will make clear that we in this House stand with the President,  yes, but with the American people to fight for voting rights.   Nothing less is at stake than our democracy. The sanctity of the vote  and the integrity of our elections is what is at stake.   I thank all of our colleagues who participated in this for their  committed leadership for the people in the fight for voting rights.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
