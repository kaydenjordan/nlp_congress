 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Bernard Marie, who recently passed away at the age of 82.   As a young 5-year-old living in Normandy, France, Marie often told  the story of being rushed into his basement by his grandparents in the  early morning of June 6, 1944.   It was there that his family sat for 16 hours in the dark without  food or water before his mother emerged from the cellar to hug an  American GI after realizing their village had finally been liberated  from German occupation.   Marie said that witnessing the D-Day invasion instilled in him a  lifelong respect for World War II veterans, and he was forever grateful  for those who secured his country's freedom.   Later in life, when he moved to the United States, he began hosting  an annual luncheon to honor local World War II veterans wherever he was  living to show his support for them and their families.   When he settled in Roanoke, Virginia, in 2021, he brought the event  with him. These luncheons served as a place for veterans to come  together and share their experiences--some for the first time.   Aside from the luncheons, Marie helped raise money for the National  D-Day Memorial in Bedford. He sat at the bedside of servicemembers when  they were ill. He even worked to award the French Legion of Honor medal  to nearly 150 American veterans. He said that his goal was not only to  honor these heroes but to ensure they were never forgotten.   I was terribly saddened to learn of Mr. Marie's passing. He meant a  great deal to western Virginia, and he will not soon be forgotten.                            ____________________
