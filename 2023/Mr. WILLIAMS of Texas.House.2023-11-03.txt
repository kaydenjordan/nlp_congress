 Mr. Speaker, for the first time in their 63- year history, I am proud to say that after defeating the Arizona  Diamondbacks in game 5, the Texas Rangers are World Series champions.   I have the great honor to represent the Rangers in Texas' 25th  Congressional District. I am tremendously proud of this team who not  only won their first World Series but won a record-setting 11 straight  postseason road games.   Needless to say, this is a historic moment for Texas and Arlington.  It could not have been done without manager Bruce Bochy; series MVP  Corey Seager; all of the players and staff who left everything on the  field; and especially team owners Ray Davis and Neil Leibman; and  general manager Chris Young. Most importantly, I thank all the fans,  the best in the Nation, who showed up to every game decked out in their  Ranger red, their Ranger white, and their Ranger blue to cheer and  support the Texas Rangers.   I am proud to say the Rangers went and took it.   Again, I congratulate the staff and players. May they enjoy the well- deserved celebrations. I look forward to opening day in 2024.   Go Rangers and look fastball.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
