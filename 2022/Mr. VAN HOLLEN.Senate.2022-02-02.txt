 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Cheryl A. Hickmon, national president of Delta Sigma  Theta Sorority, Incorporated and chair of the national board of  directors. A native of Hartford, CT, Cheryl, the youngest of three  children, was born in 1962 to the late Dr. Ned Hickmon and Consuella  Anderson Hickmon. Cheryl passed away peacefully on Thursday, January  20, 2022, at the age of 60, following a battle with a recent illness.  She leaves to cherish her memory two brothers, Ned N. Hickmon and David  W. Hickmon of Hartford, CT, many cousins throughout the United States,  coworkers, many friends, and sorority sisters internationally,  including members of the Hartford Alumnae Chapter.   Cheryl was deeply devoted to Delta Sigma Theta, and her loss will be  felt by many. An active member for 39 years, Cheryl's devotion to Delta  Sigma Theta began in 1982 with her initiation into the Alpha Xi Chapter  at South Carolina State University. She served in multiple leadership  positions at the local, regional, and national levels, including as  Alpha Xi chapter president in 1983, South Atlantic regional  representative in 1984, Hartford Alumnae chapter president in 2009, and  was ultimately elected the 27th national president and chair of the  national board of directors in November 2021. Her leadership has shaped  generations of women across this country and was inspired by a deep  belief in Delta's core values of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and  social action.   Cheryl shared her wisdom, care, and compassion with all who crossed  her path. Her unwavering commitment to making the world a better place  meant Cheryl always sought new opportunities to uplift Americans,  especially Black women. Her passion enabled her to have a profound  impact on many through Delta Sigma Theta and her service with the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the  Children's Defense Fund, and the National Council of Negro Women.  Cheryl will be remembered as a true champion for civil rights and  social justice.   Cheryl's motivation to lend a helping hand to others in need also  shaped her career of more than 30 years as a licensed clinical  laboratory technologist. She supervised the In Vitro Fertilization  Laboratories for andrology and endocrinology at Montefiore's Institute  for Reproductive Medicine and Health. One of her greatest joys was  supporting couples in their journey to become parents.   Cheryl was guided by the motto, ``Don't measure life by the number of  breaths you take but by the number of moments that take your breath  away.'' Her servant leadership in every endeavor she pursued will leave  a lasting and meaningful legacy across this country. I extend my  deepest condolences to her family, friends, and the entire sisterhood  of Delta Sigma Theta. I join each of them in honoring Cheryl's life by  holding up her work as an example, one rooted in mentorship,  enthusiasm, and service to our community.   Rest in peace, Cheryl.                            ____________________
