 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Yom HaShoah,  Holocaust Remembrance Day.   On this day, we honor and remember those who suffered and lost their  lives in one of the darkest moments in human history, the Holocaust.   Yom HaShoah is a day of remembrance, a day to pay tribute to the  millions of innocent men, women, and children who were brutally  murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators, a day to reflect on  those atrocities, and a day to commit ourselves to never forgetting or  ever letting this happen again. Over 6 million Jews were killed.   Earlier today, I joined a number of my congressional colleagues at a  ceremony recognizing this somber day. We were joined by Holocaust  survivors and descendants who shared their stories and experiences,  which were heartbreaking.   As we light candles and say prayers today and this week in memory of  the victims of the Holocaust, let us also renew our commitment to  building a world that honors survivors, respects all faiths, and  ensures that this never happens again.                            ____________________
