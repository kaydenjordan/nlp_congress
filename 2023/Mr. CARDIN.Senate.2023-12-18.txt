 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in strong support of the  nomination of former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley to be the next  Commissioner of the Social Security Administration.   The Social Security Administration is confronting a consumer service  crisis. Today, SSA is serving 50 percent more customers and  beneficiaries with the same staffing it had in 1995. This has resulted  in unacceptable service delays, including 37-minute average hold times  on the 800 number and as much as a 2-year wait for disability  determinations and appeals. The American people deserve better. Recall  that about 66 million Americans--one in five--receive some benefit from  Social Security each year.   Governor Martin O'Malley is the strong operational leader the Social  Security Administration needs right now. He has demonstrated time and  again that by focusing on performance management, smart government, and  data-driven results, he can bring change and accountability to large  organizations and significantly improve government service for the  American people.   His leadership credentials include decades of public service,  including two terms each as mayor of Baltimore and then Governor of  Maryland.   I saw his hands-on approach firsthand as a longtime Baltimore  resident. I was at city hall when Governor O'Malley set up CitiStat  when he was mayor. This is a novel approach I had never seen really  carried out by a chief executive of a city. He brought his agency heads  in on a regular basis with specific objectives they needed to  accomplish, and then on a regular basis he had the statistics to see  whether they were performing as they should, as they indicated they  needed to. That is called accountability. He held his  [[Page S6015]]  team accountable, and the results were incredible.   His signature CitiStat and StateStat initiatives are widely cited as  a model for data-driven government efficiency and effectiveness and won  Baltimore the Innovations in Government Award from the Harvard Kennedy  School in 2004.   Former Maryland Senator Mikulski said at his confirmation hearing  this fall:         The hard-working men and women of the Social Security       Administration need a strong, confirmed operational leader       and the American people need a Social Security Administrator       that works for them. . . . Martin O'Malley would provide the       leadership and the management skills to do that. . . . He has       a knack for organization, understanding the new technology       and how to use technology to be data driven. . . . Governor       O'Malley is not a big government guy. He's a smart government       guy. He believes you use modern management tools to organize       a workforce around a mission, measurable objectives, and also       stay within the budget.    For the nearly 60,000 employees of the Social Security Administration  nationwide, including about 12,000 in Maryland at the Woodlawn  headquarters in Baltimore, I am confident that Martin O'Malley will  honor their service to the American people and that he will lead the  SSA with respect and support for a strong union workforce.   The Governor said at his confirmation hearing:         As mayor, I learned there is no Democratic or Republican       way to fill a pothole. And as a governor, I learned that the       biggest and toughest challenges can only be tackled with some       degree of bipartisan consensus and cooperation. But as both a       mayor and a governor, I developed a discipline . . . for       harnessing data and information technologies in ways that got       the best out of large, siloed organizations of people that       many inside and outside of government thought were too       unwieldy, too slow, or too steeped in excuses to change.    Governor O'Malley continued:         There are two people that are going to be forefront in my       mind. . . . How is the customer being served? And directly       related to that, what is the experience of the front-line       worker? . . . We need to understand what's happening where,       whether we're on track or not, who's doing it well, and who's       not doing it well. When people are actually listened to, when       their word is respected, when their experiences [are]       respected, and we create a winnable game, it has been my       experience, as it was in Baltimore, that people rise to the       occasion. . . . Small things done well make bigger things       possible.    I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Martin O'Malley to  be our next Social Security Administrator.    Madam President, let me just underscore Senator  Whitehouse's role in the CBAM that he has talked about, because that  sets up a level playing field on carbon--the real price of carbon--so  we are not at a competitive disadvantage. We have got to catch up to  what Europe is doing. We have got to join the group. And Senator  Whitehouse has been the champion of pointing out that there is a price  that we all pay because of carbon emissions, and we asked our companies  to do it in a friendlier way. They need to be on a level playing field  with their competitors--of course, China being of principal concern.  These CBAM proposals will establish that level playing field and put  American producers on a level playing field if we join with these  efforts.   Senator Carper, who chairs the Environment and Public Works  Committee, has been the key leader in the U.S. engagement on the  climate agenda. Through his leadership, we were able to pass the  Inflation Reduction Act, which has been the envy of the world, for a  commitment on the energy agenda.   But he also was responsible for the bipartisan infrastructure bill,  and it had a heavy diet of greener transportation programs,  establishing a way that we can electrify our transportation fleet with  charging stations. All that came under Senator Carper's leadership.   And then there is the Kigali protocol. So we were able to ratify that  through our committee, through his leadership. So he has been the real  champion and leader for the U.S. Senate on these aggressive policies to  be a leader in the world on climate issues, and I am proud to serve on  this committee, along with the Presiding Officer. We have a real  champion and leader in Senator Carper.    Madam President, let me again thank Senator Carper for  his leadership on these issues.   We are joined by Senator Markey.   If we would have passed Senator Markey's bill in the Senate that  passed the House, we would not be in this position today. He has been a  leader on climate issues for several decades now and has really been  the champion on raising the consciousness that we all have  responsibilities for this one globe.  [[Page S6018]]    I yield the floor.    Madam President, let me thank Senator Markey again for  his extraordinary leadership.   I want to also acknowledge Josh Klein for the work that he did as our  staff person for COP28.   Madam President, Senator Wyden is on the floor. I know he is planning  to speak on Martin O'Malley to be the next Administrator of the Social  Security Administration, but I want to take this time to thank Senator  Wyden for his leadership on the climate agenda.   We marked up in the Senate Finance Committee the energy provisions  that ended up in the Inflation Reduction Act well before the Inflation  Reduction Act was put together as a package. And it was the work that  Senator Wyden led in the Finance Committee that provides the  predictability to the future of our Tax Code to reward renewable  energies.   We were asked in the COP meetings: What happens if there are changes  in elections, will America still be strong on the climate? And we  pointed out our Tax Code, which we have been able to continue tax  provisions. And Senator Wyden has led the effort to make sure we have a  strong tax base to reward renewable energy sources so that we can do  exactly what Senator Markey said: transition off of fossil fuels to  renewables.   I just really want to acknowledge the work that Senator Wyden has  done on the climate agenda. And he was a very popular person in Dubai,  even though he was not there.    Madam President, I had a chance a little bit earlier this  evening to talk about Governor O'Malley. I just really want to  compliment Senators Wyden and Carper for their comments.   I really want to underscore this one point about Governor O'Malley.  There are a lot of things we can really harp upon, but he is going to  have two people in mind as the administrator of Social Security  Administration. One will be that individual who depends upon the  benefits, receiving those benefits that they are eligible for in a  timely way through determinations and receiving their checks on time  and getting the customer information they need in regard to these  benefits. That is called consumer service; that is called serving the  public. He is going to be laser-focused to make sure they don't have to  wait on a call line for minutes--tens of minutes, as it is today--but  that it can be done in a timely way; that determinations can be made in  a timely way; and that checks are received.   But the second group he will be equally focused on is the workforce  of the Social Security Administration. They have been asked to do more  with less over time. Governor O'Malley knows how to bring out the  strength of the workforce, supporting the workforce in their mission,  rewarding the good service that they perform.   So I think we are going to have a leader at the Social Security  Administration who will understand the responsibilities to the  recipients as well as those performing a public service on behalf of  the Social Security Administration.   I am excited about his willingness to take on this responsibility. I  have seen him take on incredible challenges from being a mayor of  Baltimore and dealing with the challenges we have in our urban centers  to taking on the responsibilities of a Governor and having to deal with  188 state legislators. That is not an easy task.   He will find this challenge one he is ready for, and I am very  excited about the fact we are about ready to vote for his nomination.   I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the 5:30 time for  voting, the vote begin immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
