 Madam Speaker, in the latest edition of the U.S. News &  World Report's ``Best States'' rankings, Utah was ranked the top in the  Nation.   Utah has one of the strongest economies in America because of our  State's pro-market policies, family values, and entrepreneurial spirit.  At the forefront of Utah's thriving economy is the booming technology  industry in my district and across our State.   Today, I recognize Roland Christensen, an entrepreneur, a  businessowner, and an engineer who has made an invaluable contribution  to the Gunnison community and the entire State of Utah.   Raised in the rural town of Gunnison, Roland utilized his expertise  in mechanical engineering to build one of the most successful aerospace  companies in the Nation from the ground up in his hometown.   ACT Aerospace is a defense technology manufacturing leader supporting  our troops with the latest technology to win on the battleground  because of the visionary leadership of Roland Christensen and the  highly skilled workforce of Utah.   Madam Speaker, I thank Roland for all he does to keep Utah the best  place to live, raise a family, and start a business.                            ____________________
