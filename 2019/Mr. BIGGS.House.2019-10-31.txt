 Madam Speaker, I have heard today how much my colleagues  on the other side wish to make this an open and transparent process and  ``this is for we, the people.'' I would really like to believe that.   Yet, after they introduced the resolution, they have another full  week of hearings behind closed doors, and they have scheduled another  full week of hearings behind closed doors.   If this is about transparency, then open it up. If you want the  American people to see it, open it up. Give Members access to the  transcripts. Let the media into the room. Let us participate. Failing  to do so denies transparency.
