 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor my Kansas City Chiefs  for their AFC championship, and their berth in Super Bowl LVII.   Like many Missourians, I could not be prouder of the effort put forth  on the field last night.   Despite having an injured Patrick Mahomes, injuries to several key  players, incredible amounts of outside noise, and the referees against  them the entire game, the Chiefs made short work of the ``Bungles,'' I  mean, Bengals, and sent them off to the off-season.   While I hope Eli Apple has fun in Cancun, I also hope that mayor  jabroni and the rest of the Cincinnati fan base learned a valuable  lesson last night: It is called Arrowhead. It is the loudest, toughest  place to play in the NFL with the strongest fan base.   A special thank you to Patrick Mahomes, Harrison Butker, Travis  Kelce, Chris Jones, and, of course, Joseph Ossai for all their  wonderful efforts last night. We couldn't have done it without you.   And to the Philadelphia Eagles, we will see you in Arizona. Go  Chiefs.                            ____________________
