 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5283.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, today I rise in support of H.R. 5283, legislation  sponsored by my colleague from New York City, Congresswoman  Malliotakis.   This legislation would protect our national parks, prevent wasteful  spending, and hold the Biden administration accountable for its failed  border policies.   The Protecting our Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act  of 2023 would prohibit the use of any Federal funding, leases, or  contracts to construct housing facilities for illegal immigrants on our  Nation's Federal lands.   It would also put an end to the legally questionable lease that the  Biden administration signed with New York City to house thousands of  migrants at Floyd Bennett Field, which is owned and managed by the  National Park Service.   Madam Chair, our national parks have been described as America's best  idea. They are places we go to experience the outdoors and spend time  with our friends, family, and community.   That was true of Floyd Bennett Field, which drew an average of 1  million visitors per year for its ice skating rinks, petting zoos, UC  cadet programs, bird watching, bike races, and much more.                                time  1415    If you go to Floyd Bennett Field today, you wouldn't see any children  on playgrounds or fishermen dotting the shoreline. Instead, you would  see massive tents, hastily thrown together over the last few weeks to  house 2,000 migrants in semi-congregate facilities.   This tent city has been called a recipe for disaster.   Local Democrat and Republican elected officials, the U.S. Park Police  Union, the Legal Aid Society, and the Coalition for the Homeless have  all spoken out against using Floyd Bennett Field as a migrant housing  facility.   The Park Police Union testified before the Committee on Natural  Resources that it was a, ``law enforcement nightmare and public safety  disaster in the making.''   Numerous organizations have raised concerns about inadequate bathroom  facilities, cramped sleeping areas, and hazards for children.   The local fire department said the area is a fire trap and lacks  basic safety features, like fire hydrants. If that wasn't enough, the  entire facility is located in a flood plain that floods even on days  with light rain.   Maybe the Biden administration would have known about these issues  ahead of time had they not tried to get around the National  Environmental Policy Act by improperly declaring this as an emergency.   Perhaps it is no surprise that when the first busloads of migrants  started arriving at Floyd Bennett Field, they turned right back around  and refused to stay there.   Migrant families are now warning each other against staying there,  saying that the site is freezing cold, babies are suffering, it is not  suitable for children, and believe it or not, there are no televisions.   This entire boondoggle has been a colossal waste of time and American  tax dollars.   Why are we here? Because of failed Democrat policies.   President Biden has failed to secure our border leading to a record  number of migrant apprehensions last month.   Liberal New York Democrats have turned New York into a sanctuary city  whose right-to-shelter laws will cost an estimated $12 billion over the  next 3 years just to house undocumented immigrants.   The mission of the National Park Service is to conserve the natural  and cultural resources for the enjoyment of future generations, not  bail out the failed border policies of the Biden administration.   The use of emergency declarations at Floyd Bennett Field is a result  of a man-made problem that President Biden is responsible for.   The border crisis is now everywhere in America, and what is happening  at Floyd Bennett Field is something that highlights the failures at the  southern border. This is the Biden administration's legacy for the  National Park Service.   Congresswoman Malliotakis' legislation will ensure that Federal lands  throughout the country, including parks such as Hot Springs National  Park in my district and the Grand Canyon in the ranking member's home  State, remain natural wonders, not tent cities for illegal immigrants.   Madam Chair, I thank Representative Malliotakis for her strong  leadership on this effort. I support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                  Washington, DC, November 14, 2023.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 5283, the ``Protecting our       Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act of 2023''.       Thank you for collaborating with the Committee on Agriculture       on the matters within our jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill. However, by foregoing       consideration at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over any subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation. The Committee on Agriculture also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees should it become necessary and ask that you support       such a request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 5283, and request a       copy of our letters on this matter be published in the  [[Page H5958]]       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                             Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                  Washington, DC, November 14, 2023.      Hon. Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 5283, the       Protecting our Communities from Failure to Secure the Border       Act of 2023, which was ordered reported by the Committee on       Natural Resources on October 26, 2023.        I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and       appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill. I       acknowledge that the Committee on Agriculture will not       formally consider H.R. 5283 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained therein.        I am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on Agriculture to any conference committee to       consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange of       letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                   Bruce Westerman,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Malliotakis), the lead sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany), the chair of the Subcommittee on Federal  Lands.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Hageman).     Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Virginia (Mrs. Kiggans).                                time  1445     Mr. Chair, it sounds like we have bipartisan support  for H.R. 2, the Secure our Borders Act, which was passed out of this  Chamber that would secure our border and would address the fentanyl  crisis. Maybe some of our colleagues weren't paying attention when we  brought that up and debated it and passed it. Hopefully, they can go  talk to Senator Schumer who represents New York, and get that bill  through the Senate and on President Biden's desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Carl).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. LaLota).    Mr. Chair, may I get an update on the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. D'Esposito).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  State of Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Chair, I believe I have about as much time left as  the Biden administration put into the permitting process on Floyd  Bennett Field. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, again, I encourage my colleagues to support  H.R. 5283, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this commonsense  amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee. This good amendment  will provide transparency and hold the Biden administration accountable  for their ongoing failure to secure the southern border.   Now, it is unfortunate that this amendment is necessary, but the  Biden administration has refused repeated requests from the committee  over the past several months to produce documentation regarding the  exact number of illegal immigrants housed on our Federal lands.   We must ensure that our Federal lands, which have been specifically  set aside for the enjoyment and benefit of American people, are not  used to bail out the Biden administration from their manmade crisis and  emergency and their unwillingness to secure our southern border.   The Biden administration has allowed millions of illegal immigrants  to flood into our country, staggering figures that have strained  communities from our border all the way to New York City.   As Republicans continue to push for border security measures, it is  vital that we ensure that our Federal lands are not being co-opted as  housing for massive floods of illegal immigrants.                                time  1530    This amendment and the underlying bill will ensure that our Federal  lands are not misused.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for offering this  thoughtful amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in  support of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by the gentlewoman from New York.   If this amendment were adopted, it would make this bill probably  worse than where we are with the status quo because it would require  the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to  provide housing when the States couldn't provide the housing.   Therefore, States that have declared themselves sanctuaries, like New  York, could just say they are not providing housing. It is then back to  the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to provide the housing,  which would probably result in more migrant shelters on Federal lands.   Our Federal lands were not designed or intended to encamp migrants,  especially not our national parks. Again, the mission of the National  Park Service is to conserve these areas ``in such a manner and by such  a means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future  generations.'' Nothing about constructing tent cities for illegal  migrants protects this land for the enjoyment of current or future  generations.    The mission of the National Park Service also specifies conserving  unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the  National Park System. Nothing about constructing tent cities for  illegal immigrants conserves the natural and cultural resources of  Floyd Bennett Field or the Gateway National Recreation Area.   This amendment cannot be implemented in a practical manner. It  creates a complex verification system based on subjective standards for  which the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture have no  expertise. This amendment would entangle these agencies further into  our immigration debacle rather than acknowledging they should never  have been included in this debate in the first place.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Hunt) having assumed the chair, Mr. LaMalfa, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5283) to  prohibit the use of Federal funds to provide housing to specified  aliens on any land under the administrative jurisdiction of the Federal  land management agencies, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
