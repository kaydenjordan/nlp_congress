Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 15.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced this resolution along with  Ranking Member Titus of the Subcommittee on Economic Development,  Public Buildings and Emergency Management.   This resolution authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the  42nd Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Event to honor law  enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice.   These men and women put on their uniforms each day to serve and  protect our communities and our families.   Violent crime continues to be a daily tragedy in this country, and we  have seen it, as a matter of fact, again today.   It is critical that we recognize that police officers are doing an  extremely difficult and dangerous job day in, day out, 365 days a year,  to keep Americans safe.   To all the law enforcement officers who put on the badge each day,  who wear it with honor and distinction, we say thank you, and we  support you.   This resolution is just one small way we can demonstrate our support  for these officers and their families and honor the men and women who  lost their lives in the line of duty in 2022, including, unfortunately,  19 individuals from my home State of Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution and reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I reiterate not only my support but my  thanks to the gentlewoman from Nevada for her support of H. Con. Res.  15. And most importantly, for my thanks and support for the men and  women who put their lives on the line each day to protect our  communities and families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
