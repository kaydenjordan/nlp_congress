 Mr. President, one of the topics of discussion right now  here in Washington, DC--actually, there are many different topics of  discussion, but one of those is infrastructure. Depending on who you  ask, you are likely to get different answers on what exactly people  mean when they say the word ``infrastructure.''   When I and my constituents in Texas think about infrastructure, we  think about our highways and bridges. Now, those are two of the big  things that come to mind. We are home to the largest network of  highways in the Nation, as well as the largest number of bridges, and  these structures are supporting more and more Texans by the day. It is  no secret that, in the last decade, Texas has grown by nearly 4 million  people--roughly the population of our neighbor to the north, Oklahoma.  If we want to get all 29 million Texans and our visitors and our  crucial commercial cargo around the State safely and efficiently, we  need a reliable network of transportation infrastructure, and there is  a lot of room for improvement over the status quo.   Every year, the American Society of Civil Engineers evaluates  America's infrastructure and issues a report card that lets us know how  we are doing. Well, America is barely passing with a C-minus. Texas is  faring only slightly better than the rest of the class with a C. There  is no doubt about it--it is time for an investment in our  infrastructure. Now more than ever, that investment must be made  responsibly.   We just spent trillions of dollars to help the American people and  our economy get through a pandemic, and our national debt is at its  highest level since World War II. I have told my friends back home that  this is the domestic equivalent to a world war. We didn't ask in World  War II: How much money can we spend? We needed to defeat our enemies,  and we did. Then we needed to come together responsibly and figure out  how to pay for it.   We don't need to quit spending altogether, but we surely must take a  closer look at what is necessary and what is desirable and what is  something we would like to have but that could be put off for another  day. Think of the Goldilocks principle: not too hot, not too cold. In  this case: not too small, not too big. We need to find the right size,  and we need to agree on what that means.   The most recent highway and transit funding bill that became law was  the FAST Act of 2015. That bill came in right around $300 billion. Last  Congress, before the pandemic hit, it looked like we were poised to  pass a similar bill at roughly the same pricetag. I think we can all  agree that, now, something of that size is probably too small. We need  to invest in our infrastructure--repair our roads, our bridges, our  airports, our levees, and other transportation infrastructure that is  long overdue.   The pandemic has highlighted the need to expand that definition,  though; for example, to strengthen broadband and internet access. For  many Americans, the daily commutes to work or to school have been  replaced by virtual classrooms and telework. Our 21st-century economy  and society depend on internet connections, and we need to do more to  improve access, especially in rural areas, where the big internet  companies don't find it commercially advantageous to offer service.   Republicans and Democrats agree that, this time around, we need a  larger investment in our Nation's infrastructure, but, frankly, the  proposal from President Biden is far too big. The nonpartisan Committee  for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it would cost an additional  $2.65 trillion--roughly nine times the recent highway bill that became  law--and that is on top of the $1.9 trillion that the Senate majority  and the House and the President just passed into law purportedly for  additional COVID-19 relief, although only about 10 percent of it  actually addressed COVID-19. The point is, we have been spending a lot  of money, and we can't keep spending money that we are borrowing from  future generations.   Not surprisingly, only a fraction of the President's infrastructure  bill is dedicated to roads and bridges--5 percent, in fact. The vast  majority of the funding goes toward a long list of programs and  policies that are unrelated to infrastructure--for example, caregiving  for the elderly and disabled; community colleges; programs to improve  diversity in STEM careers. All of those are important topics, but they  are not infrastructure, and we shouldn't be paying for them by  borrowing money from future generations. We ought to figure out  appropriate offsets and pay-fors like we used to do here before the  pandemic hit. Our job is to find the right-sized bill that suits our  needs without going overboard with unnecessary and unrelated spending.   Fortunately, Mrs. Capito, the Senator from West Virginia, is leading  the way to find that Goldilocks just-right fit. She and a number of our  colleagues have outlined to President Biden and our Democratic  colleagues a framework to improve our Nation's infrastructure. The plan  they have proposed comes in at $568 billion--more than we have spent in  the past but far less than the President's proposal.   When we talk about the need for bipartisan compromise, this is a  great place to start. The Republican plan includes nearly $300 billion  for roads and bridges--2\1/2\ times the President's plan for roads and  bridges. It also invests in airports, drinking and waste water, ports  and waterways, broadband, and some of the most urgent infrastructure  priorities in our country.   Last week, Senator Capito and five of our Republican colleagues met  with Vice President Harris and President Biden to discuss a path  forward. They, apparently, had a productive meeting, and the President  seemed to be receptive to many of the ideas that were shared. I hope  this is the starting point for a consensus package that addresses our  infrastructure needs   There is a question that almost nobody wants to talk about, but  thanks to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho,  we actually had a virtual hearing on this this morning in the Senate  Finance Committee to answer the taboo question that nobody really wants  to talk about, which is, How do we pay for it? As I said, this was the  subject of the Senate Finance Committee hearing this morning, and I am  sure some of the ideas that were put forward will begin to start to  take traction and, hopefully, lead us to a way to responsibly pay for  this infrastructure bill.   In the past, funding for infrastructure bills has come from the  highway trust fund, but for years, it has faced severe shortfalls. To a  serious degree, my constituents in Texas have footed the bill for those  shortfalls. We are one of the few States, for example, that receives  less than it contributes to the highway trust fund. In other words, we  are a donor State. For every dollar we put into the highway trust fund,  we get 95 cents back. Well, that is not the same treatment every State  is getting. In fact, we have a lower rate of return than every other  State. If we want to have any long-term success in maintaining our  roads and bridges, we have to bring this formula up to date, and it has  to be equitable.   The smart spending, though, can't stop there. We need to repurpose  the mountain of unused Federal funds from  [[Page S2561]]  the so-called COVID-19 relief bill. States are awash with cash that  they, frankly, don't know how to spend. The massive $1.9 trillion bill  became law without the support of a single Republican because it was so  extravagant and poorly targeted. Case in point: the blue State bailout.  This legislation sent 350 billion additional dollars to State and local  governments, many of which were not facing any budgetary shortfalls.   We have started to see a flurry of news stories in the past few weeks  that have demonstrated exactly why we were opposed to this reckless  spending. For example, California has reported a $75 billion budget  surplus--a massive amount of money. Governor Newsom says this will be  used to pay down past State debts, send direct checks to Californians,  and add to its rainy day fund. In addition to California, you have New  York, Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota. Each of these States is expected  to have more than a $1 billion surplus--again, because of the massive  shuffling of cash out of Washington, DC, into the States that was not  targeted to COVID-19 relief.   This is exactly why we advocated against this tidal wave of funding  for States that were not even operating in the red. Taxpayer dollars  shouldn't be spent to erase the debts of mismanaged States or to add to  their rainy day funds. They have the ability to raise revenue  themselves, so it shouldn't be the responsibility of the Federal  taxpayers to bail them out or to provide them with this huge cash  cushion with their looking to try to find responsible ways to spend it.   Tens of billions of unused dollars from this legislation should be  repurposed to help cover the costs of these investments without driving  our national debt even higher. It is common sense, and I actually  believe that there is a way to incentivize the States to use that  additional cash for infrastructure purposes, whether it is through  modifications and cost sharing between State and local governments.  Many of those States are struggling to find a way, within the  guidelines and guardrails that we have provided for COVID-19 relief, to  spend it anyway, so why not spend it for infrastructure? Maybe there is  a win-win there.   There are a number of ideas now on the table about how to pay for  this infrastructure bill, but I hope we can all agree that the massive  tax hike that President Biden is proposing is not the answer. This  would constitute the largest set of tax hikes in more than half a  century, and these increases would do serious damage to our economy  just as we are coming out of a pandemic-induced recession.   At a time when our economy is already on fragile footing, the tax  burden on Americans would be greater than that of our biggest trading  partners and competitors, and this would have far-reaching consequences  for our competitiveness and our economy as a whole. After all, we know  these tax hikes won't be reflected in lower earnings for CEOs. The  brunt will be borne by consumers, who will pay higher prices, and by  workers, who will earn lower wages, and let's not forget those whose  jobs have disappeared entirely. We are already seeing some price hikes  on some of our most used consumer products, covering everything from  cereal, to diapers, to lumber, and to cars.   This is not the time to increase taxes and drive inflation across our  economy, which is, actually, a tax increase on low- and middle-income  people. We need to find responsible ways to fund an investment in our  infrastructure without hurting our economy and the people we represent.  Right now, it appears that bipartisan progress is being made toward  that just-right-sized policy and for it to be paid for in a responsible  way or, at least, that is my optimistic hope.   So I want to thank Senator Capito for her leadership on this effort  and all those who have been working with our Democratic colleagues and  the administration and encourage them to continue to work with folks on  our side of the aisle so we can get this done on a timely basis.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
