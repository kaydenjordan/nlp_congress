 Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Wenstrup), who is a key leader on healthcare on the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   So we have heard today that we should pass H.R. 3 because you can go  to Canada and get medicines for pennies on the dollar. Here is what  they don't tell you:   There are lots of medicines you can get for zero in Canada because  they are not available. Canadians have access to about half of the  lifesaving cures available here in America.   Guess where they come when they need that cure and that recent  medical breakthrough? They come to America.   What happens when we start acting and behaving like Canada? Who is  going to be our safety net?   Why should patients in America have to choose between affordable  medicines and a lifesaving cure for Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's, or  cancer?   Why should parents with sick children in America be forced to wait  longer for the newest drug breakthrough that could save their life?   Why should Americans face a shorter life?   Because the costliest and most painful drug to me is the one that was  never created.   At the depths of Nancy Pelosi's drug bill is a dangerous trade-off:  lower drug prices in the short term, but fewer lifesaving cures in the  future.   This is a cruel and false choice, which is why this bill will quickly  die with no bipartisan support in the Senate.   As Republicans, we believe we need to do both: lower drug prices and  accelerate new lifesaving cures.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.   It is a fact that drug companies in America spend three times as much  on R&D than on marketing and advertising.   It is a fact that the dangerous Pelosi drug bill robs up to $1  trillion of research and development costs that will not be used for  lifesaving cures in America.   It is a fact, from the Congressional Budget Office, that we will lose  at least 38 new cures as a result of this bill; the Council of Economic  Advisers, 100 new cures; and the California Life Sciences Association  says 9 out of 10 cures that they would be working on will never happen  in America.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), who is a key leader on the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader of the  House.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), one of the leaders in healthcare.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.   When the Republican Congress, in 2003, joined with President Bush to  create the affordable drug plan for seniors, then-Leader Nancy Pelosi  and Democrats tried to kill it. She famously predicted that creating  the part D program for seniors would end ``Medicare as we know it.''  [[Page H10139]]    Can you imagine how many seniors' lives would have been lost if  Democrats had succeeded in stopping the affordable Medicare drug  program that 43 million seniors have come to depend upon? They were  dangerously wrong then, and they are dangerously wrong again.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Nunes), the leader of the Health Subcommittee for the Ways and Means  Committee.    I yield the gentleman from California an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Imagine life under H.R. 3, the Democrats' fewer cures bill. There  will be lower costs for some medicines, no doubt. Both bills do that.  But if you have a rare disease, or your loved one does, whether it is  ALS you are struggling with or dementia or Alzheimer's, if you were a  dynamic person who now is struggling with Parkinson's, cancer,  diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, the hope for your cure may never  come. The waiting for your cure may be years, decades, or never.   The truth of the matter is--and it is undeniable--H.R. 3, the  Democrats' bill, will cause fewer cures here in America.   Don't take my word for it. The Congressional Budget Office estimates  38 cures lost over the next two decades, the Council of Economic  Advisers, 100 cures lost over the next several decades.   California Life Sciences Association said, if we do what Nancy  Pelosi's bill does, nearly 9 out of 10 drugs we would have created will  never exist. There will be fewer cures for Americans when we need it  most.   I will tell you, drug prices are too high in many cases. There is no  excuse for these price spikes, none at all.   But I will tell you what, the costliest drug ever is the one that is  never created, that leaves the ravages of these diseases to these loved  ones who are struggling with them.   We already know this is the case because in Canada, France, these  other countries that H.R. 3 wants to make us look like, they have about  half the medicines we do. When they do get a medicine, they will wait a  year or 2 longer to even get it.   Well, if you have got ALS, if you have got a glioblastoma, you are  done at that point. That is what that bill brings about.   We know, fewer drugs in America, because today, we have created, over  the last several years, 111 new drugs in America. France, this is the  France drug pricing scheme, 11. 111 in America. Eleven in France.   That is their vision of a day in the life of someone with a rare,  deadly disease in America.   Our bill, the Lower Cost, More Cures Act, lowers out-of-pocket costs  for Americans because we crack down on overpriced drugs. We give  seniors, for example, the power and the information to choose the right  place for their medicines, which can lower their chemotherapy by half.   We pull back the curtain on everyone involved in this drug pricing  process. We force drug companies to pay more and shoulder more burden  in the part D prescription plan. We force them to justify their  increases. We force them to list their prices in the ad so we know.   We accelerate; we don't kill lifesaving medical cures. We go further,  further than H.R. 3. We permanently make it easier for Americans to  deduct high medical expenses from their taxes, allowing them to use  their HSAs for over-the-counter medicines, including feminine hygiene  products. We save seniors over $300 a year in the popular Medicare  prescription drug program.                                time  1045    All these ideas are bipartisan. All these can be passed by Congress.  All can be signed by President Trump this year if Democrats abandon  their partisan game and continue what was really good bipartisan work  that got shelved for this bill that dies.   When this is done, let's come back together. Let's work together.  Everyone knows, in good faith, we have to tackle these drug prices.  Let's prove to America that we can actually work together not for  impeachment, not for the junk we are wasting our time on, but for  things that really matter to families back home.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his strong leadership on this. It has been invaluable.   Like impeachment, Speaker Pelosi's fewer cures bill was written in  secret, highly partisan, and is dead when it goes to the Senate. The  President won't sign it. The Senate won't take it up. It is losing  support every day.    Here is an idea. Let's pass a bill. Let's come together. The only  bill that has bipartisan provisions, bicameral provisions, a bill that  lowers prices, deserves to become law, a bill you can be proud of, the  Lower Costs, More Cures Act, our Republican bill.   It doesn't kill cures; it accelerates them. It makes it easier for  patients to use their personal healthcare plans to lower costs for  medicines, holds pharma accountable by insisting they pay more of the  drug costs for seniors. It pulls back the curtain on drug pricing. It  forces these companies to justify their prices. It can help seniors  lower their medicine costs by $300 a year.   Every Member of Congress who pledged to deliver lower costs for  families and seniors and who truly wants more cures for diseases will  fulfill that promise with H.R. 19. I urge support.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to claim time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, at first glance, Mr. Kennedy's amendment sounds  like a good idea. Of course Republicans don't want administration  officials to have a conflict of interest in carrying out their official  duties on behalf of the American people.   But, in reality, this amendment is narrowly tailored to be a petty  jab at the current Secretary of Health and Human Services.   Look, people want more cures and lower drug costs. They don't want  more cheap political shots. Luckily, the underlying bill, H.R. 3,  stands no chance of becoming law, so this amendment means nothing.   We do, as Republicans, oppose H.R. 3's government price-setting  regime because it will kill lifesaving cures for Americans struggling  with the ravages of Alzheimer's and dementia, ALS, Parkinson's, the  many cancers we face, leukemia, pulmonary hypertension--all those  costly and stubborn diseases.                                time  1130    We know, and the Congressional Budget Office has already confirmed,  at least 38 fewer medicines and cures the next two decades. The Council  of Economic Advisers estimates it will be close to 100 lost cures. Even  in the Speaker's home State of California, the California Life Sciences  Association, those small firms that do three-fourths of our clinical  trials to bring new drugs to America, they modeled the gentlewoman's  bill and said nearly 9 out of 10 of the drugs that they would be  working on would never come to market if this Democratic drug bill  becomes laws.   We think, rather than kill cures, you should accelerate it. Because  when you look at the ravages to these families and our loved ones,  really the costliest drug is the one that never gets developed. That is  what we strongly oppose.   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me talk about the underlying bill here.   I was on the Ways and Means Committee when we worked with President  Bush to create the first affordable drug plan for seniors. Then-leader  Pelosi and Democrats tried their best to kill it. They all voted  against it.   The gentlewoman famously predicted that creating the part D drug  program for our seniors would end ``Medicare as we know it.'' Can you  imagine how many seniors' lives would have been lost if Democrats had  succeeded in stopping the affordable Medicare drug program that 43  million seniors have come to depend upon?   Nancy Pelosi and Democrats were dangerously wrong then. Can Americans  afford the pain and lost lives of our loved ones when they are  dangerously wrong again?   We oppose this amendment, and we oppose the underlying bill. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting Chair. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, this amendment requires the Secretary of Health  and Human Services to award grants to hospitals, including critical  access hospitals, located in rural or medically underserved areas to  establish and improve medical residency training programs. The goals in  this amendment are laudable.   But like so much around here, bipartisan work in this area has been  stopped because of impeachment. The rush to impeachment has created a  toxic atmosphere and prevented parties from working on the people's  business, creating a constitutional crisis for purely political  reasons.   It is a nice change to hear this discussion because earlier this  year, we offered in the Ways and Means Committee an amendment to  reallocate these GME slots exactly to these rural and medically  underserved areas. Unfortunately, those amendments were rejected on a  largely partisan basis. I wish the gentleman from Arizona would have  been with us that day because almost all Democrats voted no.   That said, I do have real concerns. This amendment provides more  Medicare-funded payments to hospitals for these GME slots but without  making any immediate reforms that everyone knows need to happen. An  Institute of Medicine report called for innovative approaches to  finance these slots in order to improve the match between the physician  workforce that we need and national healthcare needs.  [[Page H10208]]    Just last week, the Journal of American Medical Association Internal  Medicine published a study and found Medicare is overpaying for GME and  that this wasted money could actually be used to address the physician  shortages in underserved areas.   According to the study's lead author, Medicare GME may be overpaying  some hospitals up to $1.28 billion annually. So instead of creating  another grant program on a bill that is deader than a doornail, let's  make a serious attempt at GME reform.   After impeachment is over, if it wastes all of next year as well as  this, maybe we can build upon MedPAC recommendations, establish a  permanent performance-based incentive program that actually reaches  what I think we as Democrats and Republicans want and create the  standards needed for these rural underserved areas.   These overpayments identified in the report could actually go toward  expanding the teaching health center program, which would be terrific  because that focuses on training in community-based primary care  settings. That is where healthcare providers are needed the most. That  is where they tend to stay to serve the community. That is a win-win  for everyone.   While I look forward to working with the gentleman from Arizona on  ways to reform graduate medical education, I urge my colleagues to  oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close after the gentleman  from Arizona finishes his remarks. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, impeachment has really ruined most of these  bipartisan efforts in healthcare, including the underlying bill.  Democrats and Republicans were working well together. Speaker Pelosi  shut it all down for this partisan, secretly written bill. Impeachment  has stopped most of this.   When and if impeachment is ever done, finished--and I know that  Congressman Green, my colleague, has said that they can impeach again  multiple times--when all of that foolish wasted time finishes, maybe we  can work together. I think it would be tremendous.   I have rural areas, underserved areas. They need these GME slots, and  the whole thing needs to be reformed in a positive way.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment and the underlying bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, though I oppose the dangerous fewer cures act  by Speaker Pelosi because it was written in secret, it is partisan and  it will delay or kill the cures that our patients are hoping and  praying for with Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's, and so many cancers.   This amendment reduces unnecessary costs, administrative burdens  across the healthcare system. I share this goal with my colleague from  Iowa. This amendment includes a lot of just smart ways to achieve this  goal, including identifying best practices, reviewing existing  regulations to see if they are adding unnecessary burdens, and studying  how we might be able to standardize and just automate certain of these  administrative actions.   All of this is pretty good common sense. This amendment would help  the public and, I think, the private sectors and the Federal Government  and States work better together. I hope Mrs. Axne offers this amendment  again on another legislation, maybe one that will become law, because,  obviously, H.R. 3 will not.   And, of course, impeachment has poisoned the water and delayed so  many bipartisan things that are important to the American people. I  hope she continues to offer it. I imagine that that ``Highlights''  magazine on the doctor's table will be all about impeachment. We want  to make it all about healthcare.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time. Let's vote.    Mr. Chair, I would like to claim the time in opposition,  even though I support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this is a good amendment. It would require H.R.  3 include a provision requiring each drug ad on TV to include the list  price of the drug.   I support this policy; Republicans do, as well. It is just a simple  way to increase openness in healthcare, transparency that patients are,  I think, searching for.   In fact, this bipartisan approach is already in the Republican bill  in front of us today, H.R. 19. I don't know why it was rejected in the  initial Democrats' bill. I think perhaps it was written in secret. It  was all partisan measures.   We know, at the end of the day, it is deader than a doornail. But I  think, after that is done, after impeachment--I don't know how many  years that thing goes on and wastes our lives. But after all that  foolishness is done, I hope our Democrat friends will come back to the  negotiating table so we can work on more commonsense, bipartisan ideas  like this one.   Despite my strong opposition to H.R. 3--it is such a cruel and false  choice to force people to choose between lower drugs and lifesaving  cures for Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's, and so many cancers; that is  just wrong--I do support this amendment. I urge my colleagues to  support it, too.   And I hope the gentlewoman from Iowa will continue to demonstrate her  support for more openness by also supporting the bipartisan H.R. 19  when it comes to a vote later today.   Let's vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
