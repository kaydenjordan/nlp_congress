 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Roselle Park  Panthers youth cheerleaders. They earned a national championship and a  bronze medal at the 2019 American Youth Cheer, AYC, national  championships.   The AYC championships are divided into more than 20 divisions, from  small to elite teams. The Roselle Park Panthers won awards in two  different divisions. First, a squad of cheerleaders aged 10 to 15 years  old won the division 14 small level 3 national championship. Then a  team of 7- to 10-year-olds earned a bronze medal for a third-place  finish in the division 10 small level 2 competition.   This is the second time in 3 years that Roselle Park has won a  cheerleading national championship and the third time in the squad's  history.   Along the way, the Panthers were crowned Jersey Shore Champions,  Regional Champions, and Regional Grand Champions. I am extremely proud  of these young people and their accomplishments, and I look forward to  hearing what they will do next.   They are truly winners, and I am proud of Roselle Park, a great part  of my district.                            ____________________
