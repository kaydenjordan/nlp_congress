 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr.  Horsford) for coanchoring this hour.   Elijah Cummings epitomized the virtues of honesty, dignity, decency,  grace, and responsibility. He was committed to his family, to whom I  offer my deepest condolences, and he was committed to his community.  And Elijah was committed to being true to the oath that he took to  preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic.    He did so as chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform  where he carried out the responsibilities of that office with great  ability. Elijah Cummings wielded the gavel with the ability of a giant,  but he was a quiet, unassuming, and a kindhearted man, and unafraid to  sometimes walk alone.   Walking alone, Elijah saw more than many will ever see. That is why  Elijah will continue to be our North Star. His light shines on in the  dark night of his passing; his spirit and his example will live on in  our hearts, to guide us as we live, true to the oath we endeavor to  uphold.   Shine on, Elijah Cummings, shine on.
