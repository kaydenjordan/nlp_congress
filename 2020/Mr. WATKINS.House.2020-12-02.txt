 Mr. Speaker, Kansas recently said good-bye to a very,  very  [[Page H6028]]  special woman, Lavonna Lemons. She was a tough Kansas woman who spent  most of her 71 years helping out other people.   You see, she was a rape counselor. She also helped at a homeless  mission, and she took in abused children. She would often open her home  to anyone in need.   She was a fearless fighter, and the world is a better place because  of it.   On behalf of so many you helped, on behalf of my family, particularly  my mother, Barbara; two of my dear friends; your daughters, Lora and  Leia; from the floor of the United States House of Representatives to  you in Heaven: We love you. We miss you. We will see you soon. God  bless.                            ____________________
