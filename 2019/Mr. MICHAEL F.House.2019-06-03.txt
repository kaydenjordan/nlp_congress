 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the Honorable Fred  Keller, be permitted to take the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, it is my  pleasure to welcome our new colleague representing the 12th District of  Pennsylvania, Fred Keller.   Mr. Keller comes from Kreamer, Pennsylvania. He comes to us from the  Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he served five terms.   Before his first election, Mr. Keller worked for 25 years in a  factory producing kitchen cabinets, working his way up to manage the  plant.   He also started his own real estate business. His record of hard work  and commitment to public service will surely serve this Chamber well.   I am looking forward to working with you, Mr. Keller; and on behalf  of the Pennsylvania delegation, I want to welcome you to the House of  Representatives.   It now gives me great pleasure to yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield to our  newest colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Fred  Keller.
