 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate this, and I am glad we are having the  opportunity to bring this resolution to the floor.   At this time I am pleased that we are going to be able to get to the  documents that are being requested in this resolution. I am pleased  that if there is going to be a resolution that it is the one that the  Senate put forward in a bipartisan fashion. This is what we asked for  in the Rules Committee last night, and I am glad that it has come  forward today.   The question in hand--and we have heard lots of comments, some of it  rehashing old history, some of it rehashing history that was disproven  by the Mueller Report--but at the same time we are questioning what the  DNI's authority is in this situation, according to statute. I think it  should be discussed.   In this situation where the DNI determined that this should not be  sent to Congress, but also did not, in review of the complaint--because  the complaint was given to DOJ for appropriate review, DOJ officials  reviewed the complaint in light of legal issues identified by the IC IG  in his cover letter and determined that no further action was  warranted.   Tomorrow we are going to hear from the DNI in the Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence, which I think is appropriate.   As I pointed out last night in the Rules Committee, I don't think  that the other side would be happy if we only heard from the DNI and  not the IG. So it is appropriate that we do that.   He talked about the timely fashion of it. I think it is appropriate  that you go through the Department of Justice and make sure you are  doing everything right, and we need to hear from the DNI tomorrow.   We also have received the transcripts of the conversation between the  President of Ukraine and the President of the United States. The  President made supposedly, and is being accused of making, a mysterious  promise to Zelensky in return for Ukraine reviving an investigation  against Joe Biden and his son. In fact, there was no such promise. The  President wanted allegations of corruption potentially involving an  American official to be investigated.  [[Page H7923]]    What I see in this transcript is the President of one country  speaking to a President of another country about trying to eliminate  corruption within their government.   The other comment that had been made is the President offered a quid  pro quo related to military aid for Ukraine. There is no quid pro quo  in that conversation. There is no mention of an aid package to Ukraine  at all. It is not in there at all. So while one might want to keep  saying that, it is not in there.   Another myth, the President urged President Zelensky to work with  Rudy Giuliani to investigate Biden's involvement in securing the firing  of a Ukrainian prosecutor eight times.   Fact: The President mentioned Rudy Giuliani in that conversation only  after Zelensky mentioned him first and referred to Biden in only one  exchange.   I, myself, have some confusion on what the rules are within the  intelligence community and involving the executive branch. A couple of  years ago in an open hearing, when we were discussing with John  Brennan--this was in an open hearing--the former CIA director,  obviously an expert in intelligence, when I asked him about the  conversation between President Obama and President Medvedev where it  was caught on tape where he said:         I'll have more flexibility after my election.    Medvedev said:         I stand with you, and I will let President Putin know.    I asked him if that was a red flag. His answer was:         I am not going to comment on a private conversation between       two heads of state.                                time  1500    Since that time, I have wondered what the rules are within the  intelligence community. Are conversations between two heads of state  completely off-limits within the IC? I don't know. I have asked that  question time and time again. I have asked some high-ranking officials  who should know the answer to that, and I have gotten no answer.   What I have heard in the testimony here today, I heard someone say,  ``favor,'' ``favor,'' in response to the potential of this President  asking for a favor. I did not see that, and I don't know who made the  quote. I would like some clarification on that.   Where we stand right now is kind of a recurring playbook. It is  always moving the goalpost, right?   We want to see these documents.   Okay. The President has given you the documents.   Okay. We are going to see what the whistleblower had to say.   And now, what do we hear? Well, I am concerned that there may be more  out there that we are not getting.   It is always moving the goalpost.   Listen, I speak in favor of this resolution. We should get to it,  move on with the business of the country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the renowned minority whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Louisiana an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Spano).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an  additional 1 minute.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me make a few comments, if I can.   This was reviewed by the criminal division of DOJ today that found no  violation whatsoever.   Let me make another point, because I have heard accusations along the  way that certain entities here in Congress don't care about  whistleblower protections.   We do care. We care about the whistleblower process. We care about  their protections. Let's be perfectly clear on that. As Republicans,  and sitting on the intelligence committee, we recognize the value of  this process. We are for it.   We have heard a lot of comments, yesterday especially, that were made  that would imply guilty until proven innocent when we haven't even seen  the whistleblower claim. We just got the transcripts of the President  with the President of Ukraine today, and we don't even know the  circumstances of the claim.   I don't know if anyone on the other side has had contact with the  whistleblower, but I know nothing about this whistleblower except that  there is a whistleblower. And I have not seen the complaint, and I look  forward to seeing it.   We have been through a lot as a country. Time and time again, our  country gets challenged--challenged from outside, challenged from  within. We have been through a lot.   As Mr. Spano alluded, we are about ready to go home. Yet we have got  an urgent matter on our hands, we have been told; yet leadership is  saying: But just go home.   Well, if this is such an urgent matter, why are we going home?   And I also will bring up the point again that tomorrow we are  scheduled to hear from the DNI. Let's give that process its due, and  let's know facts before we speak and before we pass judgment. That is  all we are asking to do.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I heard something before, that no one asks for a favor  that doesn't want something in return. You know, when my wife asks me  for a favor, I don't ask for something in return, I have got to tell  you.   And I have to say, I agree with what Mr. Welch had to say today. I  thank the gentleman for his words. We do have an oversight, but we also  have a process in our country.   So I am very curious to hear tomorrow, fortunately, in an open  hearing, what the DNI has to say, and how he may have interpreted the  law differently, or DOJ did. And I think that the American people  deserve that, and I am glad it is going to be in an open hearing.   There is a lot we can talk about. We can go back and forth on this.  But I will tell you, amongst my constituents, what I hear at home is  that there is a lot of hypocrisy out here.   When you talk about having oversight, or quid pro quo, and you are  only willing to look at one side of it, or one event of it, or one  possible event of it, I should say, only willing to look in one  direction, you lose the trust of the American people. You lose the  trust of the American people.   When I was a child, I watched the Watergate hearings. Do you know  what I was impressed with?   You had both sides of the aisle seeking the truth, regardless of who  was in power or who was in question.   We haven't seen that for 3 years. So, let's get this resolution on  the floor. It is a foregone conclusion. We are all in agreement. This  is something we want brought forward. Half of it already has been, and  the other half is being delivered at 4:00.   That is what we were here to debate today, this resolution. You  wouldn't know it was a resolution we were all in favor of. So let's  have our vote and move on.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
