 Mr. President, on October 16, 2021, the Colonel  Benjamin Logan Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution will  present a special award to a great modern-day patriot with roots in  Russellville, KY.   Retired U.S. Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Jerry Humble was born in Russell  County, KY, but being the son and grandson of Methodist ministers, he  and his family moved several times, eventually settling in  Russellville, KY, where he attended high school and lettered in four  sports. He accepted a football scholarship to Western Kentucky  University, in my hometown of Bowling Green, where he was defensive MVP  his senior year.   Logan County native, Margaret Jane Hollingsworth, his high school  sweetheart--and fellow WKU graduate--became Jerry's wife in 1968 and  began an amazing partnership with him in service to their country.   In the midst of the Vietnam war, Jerry enlisted in the U.S. Marine  Corps and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Beyond Vietnam, his  34-year career included service in Desert Storm and other operations,  including commanding Marine Forces in Korea. He was recognized with the  Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Navy Distinguished Service Medal,  Legion of Merit with two Gold Stars and Combat V, Meritorious Service  Medal with one Gold Star, Joint Service Commendation Medal with oak  leaf cluster, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with one Gold  Star, Navy Achievement Medal, and Combat Action Ribbon.   His military career has been featured in a number of books and  publications, he has appeared on a host of national media broadcasts,  and he has testified multiple times before the U.S. Congress.   Jerry's commitment to our Nation did not end in his retirement. Many  public and private organizations have benefited from his leadership,  including serving as the cabinet secretary for homeland security for  the State of Tennessee.   It is highly fitting that this distinguished U.S. Marine Corps  veteran will receive the Colonel Benjamin Logan Award from his fellow  Logan Countians and that we further honor him by this permanent tribute  to his exemplary service to our Nation as recorded in these  remarks.                            ____________________
