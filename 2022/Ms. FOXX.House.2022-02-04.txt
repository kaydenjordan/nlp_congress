 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Members on both sides of the aisle want more transparency and  accountability in postsecondary education, but that is not what this  amendment accomplishes.   This amendment is a Trojan horse for violating privacy rights of  students through colleges and universities.   Many of my colleagues who support this amendment are not completely  informed or have not thought through the implications of some of its  provisions.   This amendment would direct the Federal Government to create a data  system that tracks every college student in America through their adult  lives without their consent and without giving them the ability to opt  out.   This sounds more like a scheme the Chinese Communist Party would  manufacture than a bipartisan amendment to a bill meant to combat  Chinese influence.                                time  0930    Don't be fooled. This amendment might use words like ``security,''  but in reality, it puts the privacy of Americans at risk.   Some of these Federal agencies have already been hacked by Russian  intelligence and fraudsters. Who is to say it won't happen again?   I don't trust foxes in my henhouse, and I surely don't trust  Washington bureaucrats with a database of the personal and private  information of my children and grandchildren, or yours.   And what will the Biden administration do with the tax records,  Social Security information, and the private data of Americans? The  answer is simply, exert more control.   This amendment isn't about transparency or accountability, but about  giving Washington bureaucrats the ability to choose winners and losers  among institutions of postsecondary education. For example, the Pell  grant provisions herd Americans looking for alternative career pathways  into the same colleges and universities that failed them in the first  place while blocking them from pursuing programs offered by career- focused schools simply based on their tax status--even if these  institutions can meet the 11 pages of arbitrary and prescriptive  guardrails the amendment puts in place.   This amendment does nothing to improve our broken system of  postsecondary education. Instead, it exacerbates our skills gap and  labor shortage and forces Americans to concede their privacy to an  administration that looks more and more like the authoritarian regime  we are supposedly trying to combat.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, giving this same administration that  weaponized the Federal Government against concerned parents the power  to collect sensitive information about all college students, whether  they accept financial aid or not is unacceptable.   I am not surprised that Democrats are trying to use this amendment to  overhaul postsecondary education without holding a single legislative  hearing or markup. Democrats have a track record of bypassing the  legislative process when it suits their ends. We must resist the  Democrats' egregious power grab.   Madam Speaker, this is a moral issue. I strongly encourage my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Levin amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
