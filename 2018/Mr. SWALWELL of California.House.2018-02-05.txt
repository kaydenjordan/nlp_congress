 Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber last week,  the President came and touted that the stock market was roaring and the  unemployment rate was down. Today, he called us traitors for not  applauding those numbers.   A couple of days later, Speaker Ryan said a secretary at a public  high school noticed that her pay had gone up $1.50 a week because of  the GOP tax cuts.   Mr. Speaker, the economy is not the stock market. It is not the  unemployment rate. It is us. It is how we are doing. The stock market  only matters if you are able to invest in it; and the unemployment rate  only counts if you have a job you can count on, where your paycheck  grows and you can plan for retirement and save for a better future.   Mr. Speaker, the measurement of the economy is how we are doing. If  you are only getting six quarters from a tax cut that gives millions to  the richest among us, you are not doing very well. You deserve a much  better deal.                            ____________________
