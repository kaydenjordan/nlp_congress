 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to  me.   I would think that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the  Republicans, would get tired of trying to take healthcare away from  Americans, particularly right now.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act would  actually make such incredible improvements and make healthcare more  affordable, but, no.  [[Page H2632]]    The bill includes the No More Narrow Networks Act that I actually  introduced that would ensure that consumers can access more  comprehensive, equitable, and timely healthcare within their own  insurance network now. It also includes the Protecting Consumers from  Unreasonable Rates Act and allows the Federal Government to help lower  prices when those rates, those premiums are too high.   This is a great bill. You should be for this.
