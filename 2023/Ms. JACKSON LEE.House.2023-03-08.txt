 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  International Women's Day and to recognize that there are many faiths  in this Nation, but in some of our faith the Book of Proverbs talks  about the virtuous woman. I would like to emphasize that theme in its  broadness.   The virtuousness of women across the land and around the world is to  be able to acknowledge the very unique and specific duties and  responsibilities and vulnerabilities that women have and to celebrate  them in every aspect of life.   Today, in America, women get up and go to work in blue-collar labor  jobs for low hourly wages--from waitresses to bus drivers to working in  the building trades to being in jobs that barely make ends meet--tough  jobs--but giving them a better way of life. They have never refused  their assignment. They are the caretakers. They are the loving moms.  The little ones grab their legs and look to them for hope and survival.   I pay tribute to those women, the everyday women, ordinary women  doing extraordinary things. Thank you to America's women.    Then I take to this podium to honor those women in conflict, the  women protecting their children in Ukraine, fighting in the battles in  uniform in the Ukrainian military.   I honor those women who fell in battle. I honor those women who fell  under the vicious bombing and brutality of Russia's desperate Vladimir  Putin in this horrible war with Ukraine.   I honor the women in Sudan. I honor the women from Pakistan to India.  I honor the women in Syria and Turkiye in the midst of this horrible  earthquake. I honor impoverished women, women who are barely surviving  on the continent of Africa and South and Central America. I honor the  migrant women who are struggling to give their family a better life.   It is important that I recognize and honor the civil rights fighters.  This weekend, we spent time honoring Bloody Sunday that our late  colleague John Lewis reminded us of, the moment of fighting for voting  rights. We know that Sister Boynton, Coretta Scott King, so many  women--Viola Liuzzo--fought in the civil rights movement nonviolently  and are no longer here with us by loss of life from natural causes but  others who were simply murdered because they believed in civil rights.   I am here to honor those in my own community. It is important to take  note of Willie Bell Boone, Beulah Shepard, Etta Crockett, who is  fighting for her life, but has been an enormous strength in our  community, believing in not only civil rights but the process of voting  and empowerment.   I honor my grandmother Olive Jackson; my grandmother Vannie Bennett;  my big grandmother Mrs. Sims. I honor--called big mother, of course--my  mother, Ivalita Jackson; my Aunt Valrie Bennett, and my other close  aunts, Sybil Gooden and Sarah Jackson.   These women molded me and indicated that in spite of the segregated  life you lived in, that all things are possible.                                time  1030    It is important today, as we honor the international women suffering,  fighting still for their freedom and their dignity, that we honor those  who have fallen by way of age or disaster.   We honor those in my own community in Houston. I honor my former  women mayors, Kathy Whitmire and Annise Parker, in Houston, Texas, and  recognize that women are still striving.   On this day, I make a pronouncement that I want to take a hammer to  the scourge of domestic violence with brutality and guns against women.  I want to stop the scourge of human trafficking, where young girls and  women are the largest victims.   When we come to this podium to talk about International Women's Day,  we must come with action and maybe even an iron fist that is, in fact,  strong and nonviolent but with a commitment that we will stand for  things that will draw us to make life better for these women who are  there every single day.   I want to make sure that I pay tribute to those who molded me outside  of my home. Thank you to the teachers of America, some going  unapplauded, some going unappreciated, some going uncompensated. Thank  you to America's teachers. I could not be where I was or am today  without public school education. Who was in it? It was our teachers.   Madam Speaker, I say to you: International Women's Day is a day of  honor and a day of action.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the ranking  member of the committee and the chairman of the committee, and my  colleague from the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Florida,  because this is a thoughtful initiative dealing with a question that  Congress must confront, and that is the AUMF in its totality. We have  had it since 2001, and I believe that is an important discussion.   I would like to distinguish, however, what I think is an area that  does not warrant the removal of 900 of our troops. It is a tough area.  It is an area in Syria where if you talk to Syrian Americans, Mr.  Speaker, they want the people of Syria to be protected.   In my meetings with the President of Syria so many years ago, I had  hoped for a new vision with Syria. I had hoped for an ally with  Syrians.   Syrian Americans want democracy. In this instance, we are on the  border in a very tough location, and I have to look at the humanitarian  question. I have to look at the issue of the protection of women and  children as well as the Kurds. The Kurds have no one but us, and the  opposition has a strong ally as well.    I recognize the fact that we all want peace, but in  this instance--also in the midst of the crisis of the earthquake--we  knew the stories and heard the stories that the Syrians in that area  were not getting help because of the conflict and fighting. That is  tragic that we allow people to be desperate and need humanitarian aid  because they cannot get the protection they need.   It is important for the stability of that area, for the protection of  women and children, and to save lives that at this time we do not  withdraw our troops.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose the underlying legislation  and to respect the gentleman for the discussion that I think we should  have.    How grateful I am to be on the floor with the  distinguished gentleman from New York and, of course, our distinguished  ranking member, who has really laid out the parameters of this  legislation. I certainly acknowledge the manager of this underlying  legislation and offer my thoughts, with a little bit of consternation.   I cherish the Constitution and cherish the First Amendment. It is  first for a reason: The Founding Fathers were wise enough, even with  some of the failings of the Constitution, including the existence of  slavery--but they were wise enough to understand that the core of  democracy is, in fact, the freedom to express, the freedom to  associate, the freedom to access, the freedom of religion. The First  Amendment captures all of those elements.   I am somewhat lost to connect this legislation to the protection of  free speech. I do know that this is part of the unending obsession that  my friends on the other side of the aisle have with Mr. Biden,  President Biden, and his son.   All investigations that are relevant and that are concerning the  American people's integrity or national security are important, but how  do you stretch this legislation to suggest that it is a question of  free speech in the decisions being made to hold or not hold on purposes  that may be business purposes, for all we know, Mr. Chair? It may not  be free speech.   I would say that there are many other instances that free speech has  been stifled. We cannot discuss the history of African Americans  through the misrepresentation of critical race theory.   We are getting orders in our States like Texas to not engage in  diversity, equity, and exclusiveness.    This bill does not deal with free speech. This bill  is a gotcha bill, and I ask my friends if we can, in a coordinated  manner, discuss some of the important issues of the day that really  need addressing.   I know that we will do the debt ceiling in months to come, but I  would argue that we should protect the First Amendment, give everybody  a right to freedom of speech and freedom of what they hear.   If they would join me on that, I would welcome their support in what  true free speech is. We can hear, and we can speak. That is important.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I acknowledge the ranking member and  the chairman of the important Oversight and Reform Committee and the  work that they do to ensure that government agencies work well.   As they do so, I would expect that their efforts would meet all tests  of credibility and, as well, the four corners of the Constitution.   I have tried to study this legislation. However, it concerns me,  again, because it would make it more difficult for Government agencies  to share pertinent information with important stakeholders to keep our  country safe.   With no clear exceptions for national security, this legislation  would add burdensome and unworkable reporting requirements and a 72- hour waiting period which could be detrimental to our democratic  institutions during times when communication is necessary to protect  our democracy.   This bill is seeking to limit the lawful activities of Federal law  enforcement agencies, and it is a threat to our national security.   All of us stand on this floor and stand shoulder to shoulder with law  enforcement. Our firefighters are here on the campus. We stand shoulder  to shoulder with them. I am afraid, Mr. Chairman, this legislation  would not show our confidence in those who have to do the job.   So I offer an amendment that provides a response to the section on  severability that keeps the remaining portions of the act in place  should a portion of the act or amendment made by the act be held to be  unconstitutional. The insertion of such a severability clause in this  bill is telling of the complete lack of faith, I believe, in the  constitutional viability and credibility this entire bill aims to put  forth.   While the general purpose of the severability doctrine clause is used  to direct courts on what to do with a statute or a part of it, if a  provision is invalidated, Congress is actually discouraged from using  express severability clauses given it is unnecessary due to the court's  strong presumption in favor of any such need for severability.   Moreover, Congress assumes its laws are constitutional. This should  be constitutional. As such, the primary application of a severability  clause is for the functionality of the statute and whether the  surviving provisions are capable of functioning independently.   This is not free speech. The majority is denying our Federal officers  free speech to do their job to protect America.   So the included general severability clause in H.R. 140 is not  intended to provide clarity to the court on particular specific  sections of this bill, but rather, it is an ill attempt to save a  poorly written bill and one that steps on the First Amendment rights of  our hardworking patriots--our Federal employees--because it is  anticipated that this bill may be held unconstitutional.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Goldman).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First of all, let me thank the gentleman from New York for his  clarification. He was in the hearing. He heard the witness ask for  relief. But I would say that gentleman did not ask to have, at the core  of the relief, a legislative initiative rooted in far-right conspiracy  theories despite the clear lack of evidence that any Biden  administration official violated the First Amendment or censored  Americans or social media platforms.   We want to make sure that we are safe and have national security, but  at the same time, how are we going to amend the Hatch Act and really  shut down those who are involved in law enforcement and national  security?   We saw what happened on January 6. We need all of the communications  and intelligence that we need, not only to protect our law enforcement  but to protect the United States of America.   My amendment is necessary, Mr. Chairman. It is necessary because the  court's presumption is that the statute is constitutional. If there is  a section that is found unconstitutional, the court will yield to this  idea that they will look at it in a manner to discern what are the  facts.   My amendment simply says that to put this in the legislation, you are  then going to have a guardrail against this bill being found  unconstitutional.   With that in mind, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, which is a clear expression of the law.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 6 which  would strike Section 2, Subsection (e), the severability provision in  H.R. 140--the Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act.   Subsection (e) of Section 2 in H.R. 140 ``provides a severability  clause that keeps the remaining portions of the Act in place should a  portion of the Act, or an amendment made by the Act, be held to be  unconstitutional.''   The insertion of such a severability clause in this bill is telling  of the complete lack of faith  [[Page H1193]]  in the constitutional viability and credibility this entire bill aims  to put forth.   While the general purpose of the severability doctrine clause is used  to direct courts on what to do with the statute or a part of it, if a  provision is invalidated, Congress is actually discouraged from using  express severability clauses given it is unnecessary due to the court's  strong presumption in favor of any such need for severability.   Moreover, Congress assumes its laws are constitutional. As such, the  primary application of a severability clause is for the functionality  of the statute and whether the surviving provisions are capable of  functioning independently.   To include a general severability clause in H.R. 140 is not intended  to provide clarity to the courts on particular or specific sections of  this bill, but rather it is an ill attempt to save a poorly written  bill that is anticipated to be unconstitutional in part or in whole.   Such a provision does not belong in this legislation and does not  comport with traditional intended uses for such a doctrine typically  preserved and carefully applied by courts (not legislators) in  reviewing statutes in question as to unanticipated functionality or  constitutionality concerns.   The entire bill as written is problematic, and such a clause would  not save it.   For these reasons, I ask that my colleagues vote yes to the Jackson  Lee amendment No. 6 to strike the severability clause of H.R. 140.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor where I am always  reminded of the privileges of this Nation. That is why we fight so hard  to end voter suppression, oppression, and the denial of the right to  vote.   This institution is the cradle of democracy. This past weekend we  were in Selma, Alabama, where really the first start of democracy and  the right to vote was reignited in the 20th century.   As Nigeria, our ally and friend, begins to look at its national  elections, I call upon the Nigerian diaspora to insist on democratic  and safe elections and to be assured that the count is accurate and  that the people's voices are counted.   As the chair of the Nigerian Caucus in the United States Congress, I  must insist that our ally gives the same rights and privileges that we  fight for in the United States: the unfettered right to vote and for  the vote to count.  [[Page H1200]]  The fact is that the vote is your birthright and it is your voice.   I hope that the Nigerian Government and all of those in the Nigerian  diaspora will stand for democracy and the right to an unfettered vote  in the Nigerian elections.                            ____________________
