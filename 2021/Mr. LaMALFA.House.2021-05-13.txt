 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  pipelines to our Nation's energy use and national security. It should  be obvious, but with Colonial Pipeline being out of commission this  week and the resulting gas shortages, price spikes, and long lines at  the gas pump, this highlights the importance of this method of transit.  Pipelines offer guaranteed, reliable delivery and are cheaper and safer  than any other delivery method.   The extremely rare event of a pipeline being out of commission shows  how much we often take them for granted. We have 2\1/2\ million miles  of energy-related pipeline in this country. If it can be completed, the  Keystone Pipeline, the fourth phase, only 1,179 miles, would make our  energy security even stronger. I am hopeful that the events of the past  week will cause the Biden administration and many of my friends across  the aisle to rethink their hostility toward this project.   Let's work on protecting these systems from cyberattacks. Let's work  to build redundancy systems to operate when these attacks get through.  But let's also remember what the alternative is when dogmatic policies  get in the way and take options off the table. We will continue to need  these fuels for the foreseeable future, and I hope we can agree to  smart courses of action to embrace the most efficient and safe manner  of delivery.                            ____________________
