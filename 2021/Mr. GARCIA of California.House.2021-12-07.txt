 Madam Speaker, I want to commend both sides  of the aisle for a rather strong National Defense Authorization Act and  commend the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) for his revisions.   Madam Speaker, it is a good top-line NDAA, it makes the strategic and  tactical level investments necessary to catch up and keep pace with  China. A lot of this technology that we are investing in is developed,  built, and tested in my district, the 25th Congressional District.   This removes red flag provisions. It allows for those who don't want  to get vaccinated to be separated from the service with an honorable  discharge.   Clearly, I support this bill and it is an excellent NDAA. I do think  we need to do better when it comes to our troops' base pay. Some may  tout the 2.7 percent pay increase. I see it as anemic, frankly, and it  is actually aggravating the pay gap between military servicemembers and  their civilian counterparts.   With record inflation, our troops, especially the junior enlisted,  continue to be hammered financially. If we want to deter threats and  win wars in the modern battlefield, which we have to, we need to  attract and retain more talent.   If we want to end things like conscription, and we should, we need to  better incentivize our enlisted ranks to join and stay in. I urge  support.
