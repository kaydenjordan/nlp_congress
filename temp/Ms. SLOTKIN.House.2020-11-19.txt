 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a lifelong servant  of the Lansing community, Mr. Mark Anthony Brown, who passed away  November 9. I had the honor of knowing him and to have learned much  from him.   Born and raised in Lansing, and devoted to Lansing until his final  days, he lived with relentless desire to improve himself and those  around him. He was an integral part of many Lansing organizations, from  the local branch of the NAACP to the Mayor's Diversity Inclusion  Advisory Board. In every endeavor, he was dedicated to making sure that  underrepresented voices were heard when decisions were made.   Mr. Brown was a man who was loved deeply. Guided by faith, with his  family as his north star, he never stopped working for his community.  Above all, Mr. Brown believed in the power of genuine connections  across race, creed, background, and belief. He was a unifier who  brought people together to better Lansing, and I will be forever  grateful to him.   Today, I am thinking of those closest to him: His mother, his  brothers and sisters, his aunts and uncles, and his four children.   I speak these words today so that his legacy is forever remembered in  the permanent Record of the people's House, letting all who read it  know: Mark Brown made a difference.                            ____________________
