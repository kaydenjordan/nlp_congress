 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if you are like me, a Member of the Senate  in the hallways this week, I think the two questions that have come up  over and over again were about the NATO meeting that just transpired in  the last couple of days and the upcoming meeting on Monday between  Vladimir Putin and President Trump.   I had intended to come to the floor and speak about policies toward  China on trade. There is a lot to cover.   There was an article this morning in the Associated Press about how  the Chinese Government has turned the American business class into  lobbyists. They are basically telling these guys that are doing  business in China: You should go back to Washington and lobby your  government to stop imposing tariffs on us or you guys are going to pay  a price. But I will have time to talk about that next week. That was  really my intent.   I want to focus on the meeting on Monday between President Trump and  Vladimir Putin because there is a lot of hyperbole. Someone came up and  asked: Are you concerned that the President will meet one-on-one with  Vladimir Putin and nobody else in the room?   I said: First of all, I guarantee someone else will be in the room  because Putin doesn't speak English and President Trump doesn't speak  Russian. It will not be a productive meeting if one or two other people  aren't there. That should be the least we should focus on.   We should take this stuff seriously. It is an important and serious  meeting. I don't take a back seat to anyone in terms of being clear- eyed about Vladimir Putin, and I want to talk about that today a little  bit.   I want to start out by saying: Let's all take a deep breath and be  reasonable. It is not unusual for the President of the United States to  meet with the President of Russia because, of the 16,000 nuclear  weapons on this planet, 90 percent of them are possessed by these two  countries--almost equally divided. This is the reason other Presidents  have met with President Putin or whoever the leader is of the Russian  Federation. And that is why those meetings are important and will  continue.   That said, it is important--when we analyze these meetings, what we  hope they are about, and what we hope they will produce--to understand  not just who you are meeting with and what they do but to understand  why they are doing it. If you do not understand what the other side  wants and what motivates them, then the meetings are not nearly as  productive, and neither is our analysis or the suggestions we make  about our policy toward that country.   First is understanding Vladimir Putin. I have never met the man. I  don't think you need to meet him to believe a couple of things about  him. First, is he is a very suspicious human being himself--suspicious  of others. I think his KGB background has probably influenced that. He  also grew up in the Cold War in Russia in the Soviet Union when  Russians didn't even trust each other.   Imagine growing up in a society where people spy on each other, and  you don't know, if you say something to your friend in school, if he  will report you to the authorities--not to mention the authorities  themselves looking at you all of the time. Then imagine actually being  a product of their intelligence services.   I think when you grow up in that era, in a place like that, you are  naturally going to be suspicious of other people, and you are going to  ascribe to them attributes. So that is the first thing.   By the way, I think that also informs his view of the United States.  It is impossible, I believe, for someone like this to grow up in that  era, in that place, working where he did, and not have deep suspicions  and views--negative views--about the United States and the West at- large.   The second thing that is pretty apparent just by watching him, is  this guy is competitive. He views everything as a personal thing.  Personal-level dominance is important to him, but, more importantly,  his relationship with the United States is a competitive one. I think,  by and large, he views the world as a zero-sum game, but he most  certainly views the relationship between the United States and Russia  as a zero-sum game--meaning that in any sort of interaction we are  having with Vladimir Putin, there is no scenario in which he envisions  that we both do well. He believes there is only so much success in the  world, and the more we have of it, the less he has of it. I do believe  it informs all the decisions he makes. There can be only one winner.   I think he is also deeply driven by his personal image. I will tell  you that he probably wouldn't last 2 weeks in American politics where  people are habitually mocked, and if you run for public office or you  are a public figure--whether it is social media or the like--everyone  gets ridiculed, mocked, and attacked. I am not sure he could ever put  up with that sort of scrutiny. He is probably sensitive about it.   The one thing you can tell by watching him is that this is a person  who works very hard to control his emotions. He never wants to look  angry. He never wants to look as though he is afraid of something or  worried about anything. He never wants to look as though he is in doubt  about anything. He is very image-driven, and that drives a lot about  how he controls his emotions.   But the other thing that I think is common sense is, if you grew up  as a spy in the KGB, you know how valuable personal information is and  how personal information about you can be weaponized. So that is why we  know very little about him as a person--his personal life, his health,  or any of these things. You would never know about it other than what  he allows us to see--photos of him on a horse without his shirt on or  whatever else he wants to show us that day--because he wants to control  the personal information that is available.   He also wants to be able to control how his image is portrayed. The  image he wants to portray is twofold. No. 1, he wants an image that  portrays Vladimir Putin as an important world leader, an indispensable  world leader; he is the guy that matters, and in every major crisis on  this planet, he is a person whose opinion, views, and positions have to  be taken into account. That drives a lot of the decisions he makes. It  is the reason they are in Libya right now. It is the reason they are in  Afghanistan right now. It is the reason he is trying to figure out how  he can finagle his way into the talks with North Korea. It is because  he wants to be an indispensable world leader, and there should not be  any major discussion on the planet that he is not in the middle of. So  oftentimes he injects himself into these things for that reason.   That is tied to his second end goal, and that is the one that drives  most of what he does. He wants to restore Russia as a great world  power, equal to the United States of America. He cannot do that  economically. The Russian economy's GDP is $2 trillion, which makes it  roughly the size of some of our States here in the United States and  also roughly the size of Italy, Spain, and other countries. So he is  not an economic superpower; therefore, he can only be an asymmetrical  superpower, meaning the use of things that are not traditional, such as  cyber warfare, his role on the security council, and the military--the  ability to project power and to threaten with nuclear weapons and also  with their conventional capabilities to invade neighboring countries or  to intervene in places like Syria.   Ultimately, what drives him most of all--in addition to being,  personally, an indispensable leader--is that he wants Russia and the  United States to be viewed as equal powers on the world stage.   I think it is pretty clear from what he has said publicly that he  views the 1990s as an era of humiliation for Russia. He looks at the  end of the Cold War until the time he took over just in the last few  years, and he sees that Russia was weak and America was strong, and we  were preying on a weak Russia.   By the way, that is probably how he views the world. He views the  world as a zero-sum game, a place where the weak are preyed on by the  strong. Therefore, they must be strong, and they must be seen as equal  to us.  [[Page S4941]]    Understanding all of that and any interaction with him is critical to  having a positive, productive, or, at a minimum, not damaging  interaction. If we go in with any illusions that this is, somehow,  someone who, if we just get along with him better or if we work on some  things together, then he is going to change behavior and be less  problematic, that is a fool's errand. At the end of the day, if you  believe the world is a zero-sum game and if you believe that the  competition between the United States and Russia is one in which every  time we win, they lose, and vice versa, then it is going to be very  hard to find areas of interest that we can truly work on for the mutual  benefit of both countries.   That does not mean that you are unnecessarily antagonistic. The  bottom line is that the United States is both economically, militarily,  and diplomatically superior to the Russian Federation Government in  terms of our influence and our ability to do things in the world. When  you are stronger--not an image, necessarily, but in reality--it should  give you a level of security to be able to figure out ways in which we  can work on things that are good for our country but also not lose the  wisdom of understanding that you can often fall into traps. What we do  not want is to fall into traps.   By the way, on this whole point of strong versus weak, I know a  number of my colleagues had the opportunity to travel to Moscow during  the last recess. It is interesting how it was covered in the American  media--how they portrayed the visit--and how the Russian media  portrayed it. I know many of them are frustrated by this. The Russian  media basically portrayed them--again, it is state-controlled media, so  they are going to portray it any way they want. But they almost made it  look as though weaklings from America had gone over there. They were  very frustrated by this. It just tells you--it gives you insight into  the way they view things in the world. That is why you will very rarely  see an interaction that they couch as a meeting that is respectful.  They always want to put Putin in a dominant position, and they always  want to put Russia in a dominant position.   By the way, one of the tactics Putin uses to accomplish this is  before meetings even happen, he announces ahead of time that a deal has  been struck, almost as if to trap you into the deal. Obviously, since  he is announcing the deal, it sounds as if it is something he came up  with.   All of these are interesting points, but where do these conversations  lead us? There are a few things I think we need to keep in mind. The  first is invitations to work together. They will probably happen, and  he will probably announce them before the visit. One, he will say: Why  don't we work together on counterterrorism? A lot of people would say:  Well, that makes a lot of sense. They don't like the terrorists; we  don't like the terrorists. So why can't we work with Putin to go after  the terrorists?   Ideally, the answer would be: Yes, we have strong disagreements about  a lot of things. Whether it is an ISIS element or an al-Qaida element,  if we have a chance to work together on it, then we should pursue it.   There is a problem, though, and this what I hope everyone is clear- eyed about. They are not very good counterterrorism partners. To begin  with, their capabilities are just not very good. We have seen that in  Syria. They are not targeting terrorists. They are bombing schools and  hospitals, and they are--not only have they committed war crimes, but  they have assisted Assad in committing war crimes.   If you were going after terrorists, you would go to the places where  the terrorists are. For much of that conflict, they have largely spent  their time going after nonterrorist rebels--or at least non-al-Qaida,  non-ISIS rebels. They are going after those rebels instead. So they are  not very good at counterterrorism. They are not very capable.   The other thing is they use that as an opportunity to spy on us. When  you are cooperating together militarily, you are embedded alongside  each other and sharing information, so that gives you a lot of  opportunity to spy on the people you are working with. We need to be  wary of that.   Any effort to work together on counterterrorism has to be real. It  has to be truly about terrorists, and it has to protect the United  States and our information.   The second thing they love to talk about is: Well, why don't we work  together on arms control? There are two problems with arms control. It  sounds good on paper. The first is they cheat and they violate it. They  deny it, but they violate it. The other is that they are for arms  control as long as the arms that are being controlled are the ones we  have more of or as long as the arms that are being controlled are the  ones we are technologically superior in. They seek to use that as an  advantage.   It is difficult because if you go out and you talk to people and say  ``Hey, the Russians want to work together on arms control,'' everyone  says ``Well, that is a great idea.''   I understand. It sounds very good on paper, but the reality of arms  control is something very different. It means this: We are going to  look for opportunities to cheat on our end, and we are going to try to  strictly enforce it on your end.   Remember, it is a zero-sum game. If they enter into a  counterterrorism relationship with us, it will be one in which they win  and we lose because Vladimir Putin does not foresee a cooperative  agreement with anyone, especially the country he is in direct  competition with.   If it is an arms reduction agreement, remember, it is a zero-sum  game. He is motivated by the desire to win at our expense, and he will  use arms control as an opportunity to do that if he can structure it  appropriately.   The other thing we hear him talk about is cyber. People chuckle about  that. Imagine a cyber deal with the Russian Federation under Vladimir  Putin. But, again, Vladimir Putin knows that the U.S. private sector  and government have cyber capabilities that are superior to his. So if  he could come up with some sort of cyber agreement that would create  rules which take away our advantage but allow him to continue to cheat  and deny they are cheating--zero-sum game--he would be able to jump on  top of us. These are things we want to keep an eye on.   The other thing to keep an eye on moving forward in this relationship  is the unexpected. One of the things you have seen in his behavior and  the zero-sum game sort of analysis of our relationship with them is  that any time he sees an opportunity to do something because we are  distracted or because the world may not act, he takes advantage of it:  2007 in Georgia; 2013 and 2014 in Ukraine. We could see the Ukrainian  hostilities resume. The world is focused on North Korea. We are focused  on the arguments regarding NATO. We are focused on the trade situation  with China, Canada, Mexico, and everyone else. Everyone is talking  about something different, and Ukraine is falling off the headlines.   You could wake up one morning and all of a sudden realize that  hostilities have resumed or maybe it will be a massive cyber attack.  Maybe it will be ramping up their involvement in places such as Libya  or Afghanistan or one morning we will wake up and realize they have  deployed significant military assets to one of those two countries--or  both, for that matter.   It would be very reminiscent of what we saw him do in Syria, when he  saw the--and the excuses would be: The Russians were already there. We  are working with the government. They have invited us to come in and  bring more people to help them. You would have to foresee that.   The one thing I think we should anticipate Putin will push very  strongly on is to get the United States to completely pull out of  Syria. What he ideally, probably, wants is some sort of ``international  process'' to resolve it but an international process in which Russia  not only is a key player, but they get to stay in Syria; they get to  keep their naval base; they get to keep their air assets; they get to  keep a unified government in Syria that is friendly to them, all  supervised by the international community. But the United States has to  leave first.   He would love nothing more than an opportunity to set up that sort of  scenario because in a zero-sum game situation, he foresees a world in  the next 5 years in which Russia has significant  [[Page S4942]]  military and other assets in Syria permanently, potentially in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and Libya, and all of a sudden, the countries in the  Middle East are saying to themselves: You know, Russia's Vladimir Putin  is a guy who can be an interlocutor, a mediator of the disputes in this  region. This is a person we should be working with. This is a person  who actually is more reliable to work with in the Middle East. He would  love nothing more than that, and he would be able to do it without  committing 100,000 troops or 50,000 troops or a large loss of Russian  personnel. It is a zero-sum game, great power politics, the notion that  he wants to be equal to the United States.   Imagine if he could create a scenario in which--if he hasn't done so  already--Russia and the Middle East, under Vladimir Putin, are at least  as important as, if not potentially more important than, the United  States, a situation in which they have permanent military assets and a  friendly regime in Syria, potentially in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and  other places, and the United States is pulling out of Syria, being  forced to reduce its presence in Iraq and in other places. They become  de facto more important in the Middle East, and he takes one step  toward achieving the goal of reaching parity with the United States of  America as far as being an influential global power.   By the way, these efforts to increase their influence would not be  limited just to the Middle East. You could foresee them doing this in  the Western Hemisphere. I read an article a few days ago. It was a big  fanfare. They opened up what they call a counterdrug school in  Nicaragua. I can only tell you that while it may very well be called a  counterdrug school, anytime a country welcomes an unlimited number of  Russian military personnel and others, they are welcoming in spies and  influence agents and the ability to project power. They have long  wanted permanent--or at least semipermanent--basing opportunities in  the Western Hemisphere like those they had during the Cold War.   They already have intelligence facilities. They already have a  presence in Cuba. They would love nothing more than to get into a place  or to expand their presence in a place like Nicaragua and even  potentially Venezuela, for that matter. We need to keep an eye on all  of these things.   This is an important conversation, but it oftentimes gets lost in all  of the rhetoric that is going on around the elections and American  politics. We have to understand very clearly that we are not dealing  with Belgium here. We are dealing with Vladimir Putin, who has used the  world as a zero-sum game, the strong versus the weak, and who is trying  to position Russia and himself as the strong versus others whom he  hopes he can weaken.   There is no interaction between us and them in which he does not want  to come out ahead. He does not feel there is such a thing as a mutually  good deal. The only good deals for him are deals in which they win and  whomever he is dealing with loses, especially if it is the United  States.   I will wrap up by saying that, with all of this in mind, I would not  diminish the threat that Russia continues to pose to our electoral  system, to our society, and to our politics. The No. 1 objective of  Russian efforts in 2016--and it would be their No. 1 objective moving  forward--is encouraging infighting in our politics. They have a clear  understanding of American politics and its nuances--our societal  divisions, the things we like to fight over, how we fight over them,  and where we fight over them, and they have figured out and have gotten  even better at being able to drive those narratives.   When people ask ``What was the real goal of those efforts in 2016?''  beyond anything else, it was not electing one person or another. His  No. 1 objective--No. 1 objective--was to leave a country, the United  States, deeply divided, at each other's throats, constantly fighting.  No matter who won that election, that is the result he wanted, and that  was the result we were going to get. Those efforts continue.   The second effort that I think they have as a priority, by the way,  is to create pro-Russia constituencies in the United States. What I  mean by that is there are people in American politics who actually take  the Russian side or the Putin side of a debate. You have already seen  the early phases of that in some places. It is still a minority thought  process, but it is not unusual in many cases these days because it has  gotten wrapped up in other things that are going on.   It is not outside the realm of the possible that you could see the  growth of some pro-Putin element. It is maybe not like what you see in  Europe or in Russian-speaking parts of Europe--but some pro-Russian  types of constituencies in the United States. Whether that is somehow  wrapped up around partisanship or the like, these remain their goals.  Remember what I told you earlier. They cannot compete with us  economically, but if they can divide us from within, it weakens us, at  least in his mind. It is one of the things he can point to and say:  Look how weak America is. All they do is fight with each other. Their  democracy is a fraud, and look how strong we are because there is no  dissent, there is no infighting going on in my Russia.    Obviously, what he doesn't tell you is that whoever fights against  him winds up dead or in jail and that there is no press by which people  can fight with him anyway. So these are the things to keep in mind as  we move forward because the tools that remain at his disposal are still  very significant. For example, I could foresee the time or day where--a  lot of times there is a lot of focus in America about what if they go  into the ballot box and change the votes. That is probably much harder  to do because of the way we conduct elections in this country--so  decentralized.   Here is what a cyber actor could do. They could change party  registration. They could go into the database and suddenly erase a  bunch of voters. Imagine if they do so by being able to use analyticals  to identify here are the people in this town who we think are likely to  vote for this candidate or that candidate. We are going to knock out a  bunch of them so that on election day, a bunch of people who support  certain candidates go vote, and they are told they are not registered.  If you get enough people to do that and enough of those people complain  to the press, we are going to see stories saying: Guess what.  Supporters of candidate X or Y were not allowed to vote in the  election. Fraud. Democracy is dead. We could foresee that at some point  in the future. It is a real threat.   We could see Vladimir Putin taking the next step and doing here what  he has done in parts of Europe; that is, creating an enemies list,  politicians he believes are anti-Russia and targeting those  individuals, targeting them with information he steals by hacking their  emails, disclosing documents, even doctoring fake documents; perhaps  doing something like deepfake, which is something we will be talking a  lot about next week. That basically is off-the-shelf technology you can  buy right now where you can produce a video that without the proper  technology, you could not tell it is fake, where a person is saying  something they never said or is doing something they didn't do--a  doctored video that looks real. Imagine that, on the eve of an  election, a video pops up online--and the media starts to report it--of  a candidate saying something offensive they never said or taking a  bribe because of a doctored video that looks real, and unless you are a  technical expert, you can't tell. It is called a deepfake. They are not  that hard to make, and they are not that hard to make for someone with  off-the-shelf technology.   Imagine if a nation state decides to use it. You could foresee them  targeting specifics races.   They have, as I said, a pretty good understanding of American  politics. You could foresee where they would say: There is a  congressional race or a Governor's race or a Senate race somewhere in  the country that is going to be a really big deal. It has an outsized  influence on American politics, and that is the race we are going to  interfere in. We are going to do something to impact the outcome of it  because we think that will further our narrative one way or the other.   We have to be clear-eyed on all of these things as we go into this.   I would say, perhaps, the greatest goal Vladimir Putin would have in  the short term is weakening NATO, not just limiting its expansion but  weakening its resolve. NATO, at the end of the day, beyond military  hardware  [[Page S4943]]  that is a part of it, is no better than the true commitment of a nation  to a member of NATO to live up to the organizing documents and  commitments we make to one another; meaning that we have a commitment,  along with our partners in NATO, that if one of us is attacked, we have  all been attacked. That has only been invoked one time in its history,  and that was after September 11, 2001.   If he somehow could not just keep us from expanding NATO but begin to  undermine it from within, it would be an enormous victory because,  again, for him, it would be a sign that America is diminishing, that  the threats against him are diminishing, and his influence and Russia's  role in the world has increased.   So this is an important meeting. It probably will not be the last  time they meet, but more important than the meeting are the issues at  play between the leader in Russia who views everything as a zero-sum  game, in which either he wins or America wins, but it can't be mutually  beneficial.   We have to deal with him. He possesses a significant percentage of  the world's nuclear weapons. Between the United States and Russia, we  have 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons in these two countries.  We do have to talk to him, but we need to be very clear-eyed; that is,  that it is a complicated but important relationship, and we should  clearly understand what motivates him and what motivates his decision  making and what their ultimate goals are in any conversation we have.
