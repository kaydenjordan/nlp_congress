 Mr. Speaker, last week, Federal officials announced  California water allocations for water year 2022--this one--this spring  right now where growers are getting ready to plant--or would be.   Despite their hard work as growers, their productivity and  responsibility of feeding the rest of the Nation being on their  shoulders, they were put dead last in line for water allocations. That  is right. Behind even the mindless dumping of freshwater into our  oceans to save nonexistent fish.   Even though California farmers produce most of the Nation's fruit,  nut, and vegetable crops, many received zero percent of their  allocation--this at a time of many bare store shelves in the grocery  stores, this time of crisis of an international proportion where we  should be making our own energy and our own food crops.   We are going to become more reliant on imported food if we don't grow  this 2022 crop year because we are growing next year's crop right now-- including on my rice farm at home.   These water allocations will indeed have drastic consequences for the  farmers, their employees, and the small towns that they populate all up  and down California and indeed other States as well.   So growers are at their wit's end. We need President Biden and others  to reallocate and prioritize water for farmers, not for fish.                            ____________________
