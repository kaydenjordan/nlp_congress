 Mr. President, I see that my colleague and classmate is  here on the floor. I got to hear his speech earlier today, and it was  one of the best speeches that he has given and the best instruction  that all of us should listen to.   He has far more experience than just the time that he was a classmate  with me, because he served in the House as well. He is Mr. Agriculture  and has solved a lot of problems in those areas, and it has been a  pleasure to be here with him. And I leave with him. He has done an  outstanding job.   We also like some of the same literature.                                  The Budget    Mr. President, it has been an honor to serve as the chairman of the  Senate Budget Committee for the past 6 years. There is no question that  these have been challenging times. They have culminated in the current  pandemic that we continue to confront. Throughout all of these  challenges, I am proud to say that the committee has played a key role  in working to address the fiscal challenges facing our Nation. We put  in place policies that helped grow our economy and improve the  congressional budget process.   Now I need to make a clarification for anybody who might be  listening. The Budget Committee is not the spending committee. That is  the Appropriations Committee. The Budget Committee does a roadmap that  is supposed to provide some discipline for the people doing the  spending. That is where we need to do a lot more work.   I want to start off by telling you a little budget story. My youngest  daughter and her family are strict budgeters. They follow Dave Ramsey's  principles, and the whole family participates in monthly allocation of  their resources. It has made a huge difference in their ability to pay  off things and to enjoy life.   A year ago, my older daughter picked up my granddaughters from their  after-school activities and said: How would you like to go to  McDonald's for dinner? Of course, they were thrilled.   My daughter said: Well, maybe we ought to call your parents and see  if they would like it too.   At this point the older daughter, who I think was 11 at the time,  said: Who is paying?   And she said: I am.   She said: Oh, OK, because we have already used our eating-out budget.   That is family participation in budgeting.   As a result, I also have the youngest granddaughter, who saved up for  an Apple watch. Do you know how much restraint of spending that is so  you can reach the goal that you want and buy what you really need? That  is good budgeting.   We can do good budgeting, but we have to have good appropriations to  follow it up too.   The committee has had some real successes over the past 6 years.   We passed four budgets, including the first balanced 10-year  blueprint approved by Congress since 2001.   We also played a key role in helping pass the most sweeping update of  our Nation's tax system in more than 30 years. The passage of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act started with the approval of the FY 2018 Senate  Budget Resolution. That resolution started the process to construct  legislation that reduced tax rates for millions of Americans and  modernized our antiquated Tax Code. It also supported responsible  energy development that will keep energy affordable and provide a long- term supply for American energy.   Oversight was also a critical part of the committee's work. During my  time as chairman, we worked to ensure the Federal Government was  accountable to the public by boosting transparency, by improving  Federal financial management, by identifying duplication of Federal  programs, and by approving Federal information technology.   Increasing the transparency of our congressional budget process has  also been a major priority. After becoming chairman, I restarted the  practice of publicly releasing regular scorekeeping reports--which we  publish on our committee website--that show how we spent the money.  More recently, we developed information on the budgetary effects of the  various COVID-19 bills. We can get those online.  [[Page S7399]]    Providing information like this on an ongoing basis is one more tool  for committees and taxpayers alike to see how the current law stacks up  against the budget we are required to adhere to. Scorekeeping reports  operate just like regular checkups with the dentist or doctor to help  identify risks and find solutions before more serious problems emerge.    In 2015, we also began regular public oversight hearings with the  Congressional Budget Office. This was the first CBO oversight hearing  in more than 30 years. Because of our efforts, CBO now regularly  publicly releases information, tracking its forecasting records, the  accuracy of estimates and projections, and the data it uses in its  work.   While we have had some successes, there are still many serious  challenges facing our Nation. Even before coronavirus came to our  shores, our country was moving down an unsustainable fiscal path. The  pandemic has only accelerated this, with Congress approving COVID  relief legislation that would add more than $2.6 trillion to our debt  so far. In the near-term this spending, necessary as it may have been,  translated into an overall deficit of $3.1 trillion in fiscal year  2020, more than triple the amount recorded the previous fiscal year.  CBO's most recent ``Long-Term Budget Outlook'' paints an even more dire  picture of deficits and debt rising to unprecedented levels if current  laws remain unchanged--and this represents the best-case scenario.   For decades, CBO, the Government Accountability Office, economists,  and Members of Congress have been raising the alarm that if we  continued on this course, our debt would explode with potentially  devastating economic consequences, leaving us unable to fulfill the  promises of the past. That day always seemed a long time away. But time  waits for no one, and tomorrow is fast arriving.   By 2023, barely 2 years away, CBO projects that debt as a percentage  of GDP will reach an all-time high of 107 percent. By 2050, debt could  reach 195 percent of gross domestic product--which is the amount of  actual production we do in the United States--and the annual deficit  would reach 12.6 percent of GDP. That is where the tax money comes  from.   Spending as a percent of GDP will rise 31.2 percent by 2050,  primarily due to--this is very important--due to rising Social  Security, healthcare costs, and net interest spending.   CBO projects that net interest spending will exceed all discretionary  spending in 2043 and will exceed Social Security by 2046. By 2050,  spending on interest will be larger than any single program. That is  the interest on the debt. That doesn't pay down any debt. That is just  the interest on the debt. By 2050, it will be the single largest  program.   Now, that is assuming we continue with the extremely low interest  rates that we get now. We are not even close to the national average.  We are way below the national average. The national average would be 5  percent. If that were to happen, the only thing we would be able to  fund would be interest on the national debt. You didn't hear me mention  Social Security or Medicare or education or military or any of those  things. That is why I have been mentioning this so often. Interest will  eat us alive.   The amazing part of everything I just said is that this is the rosy  scenario. Increases in spending or interest rates that are higher than  the low rates assumed by CBO means that the outcomes are more severe  than currently recorded. CBO expects rising deficits will have major  negative economic consequences, including lower investment and output  and a greater chance of a fiscal crisis. CBO notes that high and rising  debt would also constrain policymakers' ability to borrow in response  to future unforeseen emergencies, leaving the United States vulnerable  in the face of potential disasters while also risking our national  security.   CBO is the Congressional Budget Office, and it is a nonpartisan  office that helps to make these evaluations. As I mentioned earlier, we  are actually holding them accountable by having them come in and  explain what they projected and how it matches up with what actually  happens. So we should pay attention to them. I actually think that they  come up with fairly low numbers.   I don't want to leave this body with nothing but doom and gloom. It  is not too late to turn things around. We can be successful if we work  together.   Contrary to what most people believe about Congress and what is  reported in the media, I know both parties can work together. I have  seen it firsthand as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee and my work with Senator Ted Kennedy and, again,  here on the Senate Budget Committee and my work with Senators  Whitehouse, Kaine, Warner, King, Van Hollen, and others.   Bipartisanship will be key as Congress works to tackle our fiscal  challenges. Instilling the Federal budget process with regular action  and predictability, active legislative oversight and spending  transparency--that is all critical to strengthening our democracy and  reducing our Nation's unsustainable spending and debt.   Since taking the helm of the Committee, we have held more than a  dozen hearings on the topic of budget process reform, soliciting expert  testimony from a variety of sources, including economists, academics,  State and local leaders, former chairs of the Budget Committee, and  even people from other countries. This has been one of my top  priorities as chairman, and we have had some early successes in this  effort.   This includes the committee's unanimous bipartisan approval of new  budget rules that included budget process reforms, which have led to  more orderly, meaningful, and transparent consideration of the budget  resolutions in the committee. We followed those hearings by introducing  and passing legislation, the Bipartisan Congressional Budget Reform  Act, which represented the first bipartisan budget reform approved by  the Senate Budget Committee since 1990.   I want to repeat that. In a bipartisan way, we passed a Congressional  Budget Reform Act, and it represented the first bipartisan reforms  approved by the Senate Budget Committee since 1990. A key focus of  budget process reform is to make congressional budgets easier to pass  and harder to ignore, while encouraging regular order in the normal  funding process. If budgets are going to be a useful governing tool,  they must matter. Budgets are the foundation by which we govern, the  way we establish what matters most to our Nation, and where we agree  limited resources should be focused.   We have seen time and again that when budgets are treated as an  afterthought or as a wish list, our ability to legislate effectively  and fulfill our most basic constitutional duties is made more  difficult, if not impossible.   To restore budgets to their proper role, they must be enforceable,  and they should increase fiscal accountability in Congress. If  lawmakers approve a budget, they should stick to it. To that end, my  bipartisan budget process reform legislation would make a number of  important reforms, including creating a new enforcement tool that could  be used only for reducing the deficit. I realize that we may not get  this bill across the finish line before I complete my service, but I  hope others will take up the effort and ensure the key parts, including  fiscal accountability, are included in future reforms. I have had the  assurance from both Members on this side of the aisle and the other  side of the aisle that that is a possibility and a priority.   Next year, lawmakers will be confronted with the construction of a  new budget and spending bills, and for the first time in almost a  decade, it will be without spending caps. We have had some self-imposed  limits on our spending before called spending caps, and it has been  very irritating to people who want to spend money. But now they can do  that because this will be the first time in almost a decade without the  spending caps contained in the Budget Control Act.   Of course, even under the Budget Control Act, Congress regularly  ignored the fiscal limits it contained, but starting next year, there  will be no budget caps to guide overall funding levels or to curb  Federal discretionary spending--no limits. This could be and should be  a cause for great concern, but it is also a chance for us to work  together to find a way to begin the process to address our fiscal  challenges.   Of course, I mentioned that that is just curbing the Federal  discretionary  [[Page S7400]]  spending. That is the little dab of money that the appropriators  actually get to make a decision on, and 70 percent of what we do is  already passed without a single vote from this body. And that number-- we keep trying to shift discretionary things over to mandatory so  people can be assured that the money will be spent, but seldom do we  ever put any money with the new mandatory item.   But beyond the annual funding fight, our country faces an even more  daunting fiscal crisis: the rapidly approaching depletion of several  Federal trust funds. That includes the Highway Trust Fund next year. It  also includes Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. We have 4 years  on that, 2024. There is the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, 2026, and  the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, 2031. Those are trust  funds that are approaching depletion, running out of money.   OK. In the CBO's latest baseline, total scheduled spending for all  pending trust fund programs will exceed their dedicated revenues by  $12.3 trillion over the next 10 years. This accounts for the majority  of the $13 trillion in cumulative deficits CBO projects the Nation will  run over this period--depletion of the trust funds.   What happens when these trust funds run dry? Current law requires  their spending to automatically be reduced to match their income. This  means real cuts to crucial programs. I mentioned Social Security. It  would have to go down to the amount of money that we actually receive  going out to recipients of Social Security. That could be a big and  immediate hurt.   So, again, a real challenge awaits next Congress as my tenure comes  to a close. I am proud of what the Senate Budget Committee  accomplished. We helped to improve the fiscal health of millions of  Americans by passing the most comprehensive tax reform in a generation.  We have also committed ourselves to working to improve the  congressional budget process so Washington and Congress can get a  better handle on what we are spending and where it is going, including  a new tool that could be used only for reducing the deficit. We have  worked to boost fiscal transparency, improve Federal financial  management, identify duplication of Federal programs, and improve  Federal information technology. But there is much more that needs to be  done, and now those challenges will be passed to the next chairman.   While I have highlighted the problems, I am also leaving a roadmap  with possible paths forward. I would ask all of my colleagues to work  closely together to address these issues, as we can no longer push them  off for someone else to fix later. We need to find the common ground.  Tomorrow is here, and we have to start making those choices not only  for ourselves but for our kids and our grandkids and our country   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
