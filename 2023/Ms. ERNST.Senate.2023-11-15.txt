 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have had the firsthand  opportunity to see the impact that small businesses have on local  communities and the work of dedicated public servants to ensure that  they remain the backbone of the economy. Today, I would like to  recognize Mr. William Shear, a public servant who has dedicated over 20  years to America's small businesses and wish him a happy retirement.   Mr. Shear serves as the Director of Financial Markets and Community  Investment at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO. In this  role, he has distinguished himself as an expert on the Small Business  Administration's disaster assistance lending, government contracting,  and small business credit programs. In his time at GAO, he served as  Acting Director for Physical Infrastructure and was Assistant Director  of Financial Markets and Community Investment. Mr. Shear is a graduate  of the University of Chicago with both a master's degree in public  policy and a Ph.D. in economics. In addition to his time at GAO, he is  a former lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught  city and regional planning.   Mr. Shear is no stranger to the Senate Committee on Small Business  and Entrepreneurship. As the Director of Financial Markets and  Community Investment, he has testified numerous times before the  committee as a champion of saving the American taxpayer their hard- earned dollars. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater  Horizon disaster, and Hurricane Sandy, Mr. Shear was there to provide  answers with his insight and knowledge on disaster assistance. His  testimonies provided the committee with meaningful solutions that  assisted the small businesses in our home States and communities.   I want to congratulate Mr. Shear on his outstanding career at GAO. We  appreciate his dedication to America's small businesses and the  expertise he provided to the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship. I would like to associate myself with the comments of  the chair.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am privileged to be on the floor this  evening in what in the military we would call a joint operation. So  this evening, I am joining my marine colleagues, Senator Sullivan of  Alaska and Senator Young of Indiana, and my Air Force colleague from  the great State of South Carolina. I, of course, served 23 years  between the U.S. Army Reserve and the Iowa Army National Guard,  deploying once for Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2004, where I  was the company commander of 150 soldiers that ran convoys from Kuwait  up into Iraq, supporting our warriors to the north.   We are also joined in the chair this evening by another veteran, the  Senator from Michigan in the chair, Mr. President, Naval reservist. So  we truly are a joint operation under the color of purple. So thank you  so much.   I am going to throw down just a little bit of how we got into this  situation and a little bit more about who I am because I am pro- military, obviously, but I am also pro-life as well. I served in the  Iowa State Senate. And during the time that I served in the State  senate, I was a pro-life leader. I was the go-to gal for our pro-life  issues in the Iowa State Senate, participating and leading in  legislation to advance life, as well as participating in marches for  life, in the great State of Iowa.    Coming into the U.S. Senate, then I became a member of the pro-life  caucus. I have led on a number of efforts when it comes to life.  Predominantly, though, one that our pro-life community has really  appreciated is the effort to defund Planned Parenthood and redirect  those dollars to eligible providers of women's healthcare, such as  community health centers.   In February of 2023, we saw President Biden unveil his abortion  travel agency plan. OK? What does this mean? It means that President  Biden decided that he would send young women--whether they were family  members, whether they were servicemembers--he would allow them to  travel. He would send them to other States to receive abortions, that  being supported by taxpayer dollars.   We feel this is wrong. It goes against the Hyde amendment. That is  where President Biden put us.   Secretary Lloyd Austin implemented that plan in February, again, of  2023. And in March of 2023, then I led--I led--on the effort to  overturn this policy. I introduced and led the legislation to reverse  the DOD's travel abortion policy.   It was twice voted on in the Armed Services Committee during the  National Defense Authorization Act process--twice voted on; twice  defeated in the committee. Now, that is in the U.S. Senate.   So, again, I am pro-military, and I am pro-life. I also do not relish  the fact  [[Page S5561]]  that I am standing on the floor this evening as we try and bring these  nominations forward, but I understand the national security risks that  are out there and the detriment to readiness as we continue to hold  over 450 of the finest men and women that have served their Nation  honorably under the flag of our Nation in our uniform.   So I will go through one by one. I have a binder full of nominees,  and I do hope that our colleague from Alabama will allow us to bring  them up one by one for a voice vote. Again, I have many biographies  here--fabulous, incredible men and women.   And with that, I will yield to my colleague from South Carolina.    Thank you to my colleague from Indiana. I truly appreciate  it.   I will now go through the biographies of the men and women who  rightfully deserve to be promoted, to be moved into their next position  of authority.   And I am going to start by continuing with MG Heidi J. Hoyle,  Calendar No. 48, for the grade of Lieutenant General and deputy chief  of staff for the U.S. Army. And I would like to highlight MG Heidi J.  Hoyle, who is currently the director of operations for the Office of  the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics.    Upon her graduation from Virginia in 2004, she was assigned as an  instructor in the Department of Systems Engineering at West Point. She  served as the 242nd Ordnance Battalion executive officer, with a  deployment to Afghanistan and support of Operation Enduring Freedom.   In 2010, she was selected for command of the Special Troops Battalion  of the Third Sustainment Brigade in Fort Stewart, GA. And while  stationed there, she deployed in support of the Iraq war.   She has distinguished her career, having been awarded the Legion of  Merit, folks, not just once, not twice, but three times. She has been  awarded the Bronze Star Medal not once but twice.   This is an extraordinary woman. And I will point out that I enjoyed  my service very much. I appreciated my time in service. But I also have  a daughter who is serving now. And my daughter--to MG Heidi J. Hoyle,  General Hoyle, I hope that my daughter is following in your footsteps.  My daughter is assigned to the 3rd Sustainment Brigade in Fort Stewart,  GA.   So to MG Heidi J. Hoyle, I bring you up this evening. I will not be  asking for a live UC this evening because we know that it will be  objected to and filibustered, and I think you deserve better than that,  General Hoyle. You have given your entire adult life in service to our  Nation, under extremely difficult circumstances, and you have been  awarded, again, the Legion of Merit three times and the Bronze Star  Medal twice.   I am proud to be a staunch advocate of the U.S. Army community and,  once again, standing up for valiant individuals who have answered the  selfless call to serve.   As more of our servicemembers are under attack by Iran-backed  proxies, we must fight for our U.S. Army community and get them in the  fight. And that is why I raise voice for MG Heidi J. Hoyle and her  promotion to Lieutenant General because she cannot do it herself.   Next, I am going to move on to Col. Terence G. Taylor. I rise today  to talk about a few officers within Calendar No. 82, which contains  Col. Terence G. Taylor for the grade to Brigadier General. That is a  one-star General.   Col. Terence G. Taylor is currently the commander of the 380th Air  Expeditionary Wing. Col. Terence G. Taylor is responsible for the  wing's Armed Overwatch mission, encompassing intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance and command and control reporting  center assets.   Colonel Taylor is also responsible for theater security cooperation  and agile combat employment, dynamic force employment missions in  direct support of the U.S. Air Force's central and the United States  central command priorities.   Colonel Taylor earned his commission through the Reserve Officers'  Training Corps Program at the University of Virginia in 1997.   Colonel Taylor's prior assignments include serving in the Department  of State's Bureau of Counterterrorism, where he was responsible for  directing political and operational responses to international  terrorism and implementing America's global counterterrorism policies  in coordination with numerous government departments and agencies.   Colonel Taylor has numerous degrees, including a master of arts in  strategic studies at the Air War College and a master of arts in  national security and strategic studies at the American Military  University.   And this is why I am stepping forward tonight and not asking for a  voice vote but sharing the biography of the admirable service of Col.  Terence G. Taylor and his promotion to Brigadier General because as a  member of the military, he is apolitical and cannot lobby Members of  Congress. So while he has no voice, while Heidi Hoyle has no voice, I  am giving them voice tonight.   I am moving on to another admirable individual who is being denied  her promotion this evening. Again, I am directing my ire at President  Joe Biden and at Secretary Lloyd Austin for the policy that they have  put in place for the abortion travel agency plans. It is horrific. It  is horrific. Our ire goes to them. But what we see is maybe the plan to  reverse that is holding some of these individuals who rightly deserve  to be promoted hostage.   So the individual I am addressing right now is COL Sara E. Dudley.  She is an officer within Calendar No. 94, which contains a list of Army  officers who have been selected for the grade of Brigadier General.  Again, a one-star.   Specifically, COL Sara E. Dudley is a vital part of Special  Operations Command. Colonel Dudley is a proud West Point graduate who  took and embodied the skill sets and leadership tools that she learned  there to be a lifelong learner, a lifelong participant in our U.S.  military. She earned a Harvard MBA and a Yale University fellowship  through the War College.   She has honorably served her country as a warfighter during Iraqi  Freedom, where I had served. She also served during Operation Enduring  Freedom and, most recently, during her third deployment overseas, in  support of the Combined/Joint Forces Land Component Command during  Operation Inherent Resolve.   She is a decorated warfighter, distinguished herself with honor,  having been awarded for meritorious achievement several times  throughout her career. I firmly believe that Colonel Dudley's  qualifications, record, and character have earned her this promotion.  Again, I am giving voice to her because she has no voice.   The next person I will address is for Rear Admiral (lh) Jeromy B.  Williams. He is an officer within Calendar No. 102, which contains a  list of Navy officers who have been selected for the grade of Rear  Admiral. I will highlight Rear Admiral (lh) Jeromy B. Williams. He is  the deputy director for special operations and counterterrorism in the  J-3 of the Joint Staff.   Rear Admiral Williams is a native of Las Vegas, NV. And after  graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1993 with a degree in  aerospace engineering, he immediately reported to seal training and  graduated in January of 1994.   His operational assignments include two tours as assistant platoon  commander, joint commissioned observer commander, assistant operations  officer, platoon commander, troop commander, SEAL team operations  officer, and executive officer. Later, he became a squadron commanding  officer, then served as deputy major commander, and then as commodore.  Most recently, he served as deputy commander, Special Operations Joint  Task Force Iraq for Operation Inherent Resolve.   A distinguished graduate of the U.S. Naval War College, Rear Admiral  Williams holds a master's in national security and strategic studies.  He was further selected by the Chief of Naval Operations as a Navy  military fellow, and he served on the Council on Foreign Relations.   So as a 23-year combat veteran and retired lieutenant colonel of our  great U.S. Army and as an ardent supporter of our Special Operations  community, I am proud to stand up for this valiant officer who has  answered the selfless call to service and earned this promotion. I  firmly believe that Rear Admiral Williams's qualifications, record, and  character make him exceptionally eligible for this promotion. He has no  voice on the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight. That is why I am giving  him a voice.   The next individual is Brig. Gen. Justin R. Hoffman. I am rising  today to talk about a few officers within Calendar No. 110, which  contains a list of Air Force officers who have been selected for the  grade of Major General. That is a two-star General.   First, I would like to begin with Brig. Gen. Justin R. Hoffman, who  is a special assistant to the commander of Air  [[Page S5569]]  Force Special Operations Command. This command is the Air Force  component of the U.S. Special Operations Command.   General Hoffman was born in Austin, TX, and earned his commission  from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1995. He spent most of his career in  Special Operations aviation assignments, deploying extensively.   He is a command-rated pilot, having flown more than 5,500 hours, of  which more than 1,800 are combat hours. He has flown the NC-130H and J  models for the Commando II, which flies clandestine, low-visibility,  infiltration and exfiltration of Special Operations forces, primarily  flown at night to reduce visual acquisition and intercept by airborne  threats in politically sensitive or hostile territories.   He also has flown the U-28A Draco, which is part of the U.S. Air  Force Special Operations Command, and manned airborne intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance fleet. While commanding this aircraft,  Brigadier General Hoffman supported humanitarian operations, search and  rescue missions, and Special Operations missions.   I would also like to note that Brigadier General Hoffman dedicated a  portion of his career to this esteemed body here in Congress, having  served as the Director of Legislative Affairs for U.S. Special  Operations Command.   It is officers like this that I am proud to be a staunch advocate of  within the Special Operations community because, right now, folks, the  world is on fire, and we need more Special Operations Command officers  in the fight, not out of the fight. This is why I give voice tonight to  Brig. Gen. Justin R. Hoffman and his promotion to Major General.   You can see, as I am moving through these biographies of these  incredible men and women who are being denied their promotion on this  very night by individual vote on the floor of the Senate--you can see  that they have storied legacies in their contributions to these great  United States of America. It is without having these men and women and  those who came before them in our great United States of America that  we would not have life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. Those  things cannot be achieved without the men and women who protect our  country and its values.   Next, Mr. President, I would like to continue with Calendar No. 110.  Again, a list of Air Force officers who have been selected for the  grade of Major General. I would like to highlight Brig. Gen. Rebecca J.  Sonkiss, who is currently the deputy commander of the Air Force Special  Operations Command, the deputy commander of the forces who execute  worldwide deployments and assignments to unified combatant commanders,  the deputy commander to approximately 20,800 Active-Duty Reserve, Air  National Guard, and civilian professionals within the Special  Operations community.   This is no slacker, folks. Brigadier General Sonkiss has had an  incredible career, starting with her acceptance and subsequent  graduation from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1994. She commanded the  15th Airlift Squadron through two deployments, was the vice commander  of the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan,  and commanded the 62nd Airlift Wing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and the  89th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Andrews.   She is a command pilot with more than 4,400 hours, including 1,377  combat hours in nine different Air Force-manned and remotely piloted  aircraft, including the EC-130 Compass Call, which disrupts enemy  command-and-control communication systems, and the RQ-1 Predator, which  is an intelligence collection asset, capable of offensive air support  against enemy targets.   She has distinguished her career, having been awarded the Defense  Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and a Bronze Star. And,  again, I am proud to be a staunch advocate of the Special Operations  community and, once again, stand up for these valiant individuals who  have answered the selfless call to serve.   As more of our servicemembers are under attack by Iran-backed  proxies, we must fight for our Special Operations community and, once  again, get them into the fight. That is why I am giving voice this  evening to Brig. Gen. Rebecca J. Sonkiss and her promotion to Major  General.   Again, I am going to say, these biographies are incredible. They  are incredible. But that is why many people here on the floor--those  that might be in opposition to the individual votes tonight on the  floor--they don't want these read. They don't want these biographies  read because we are putting the human element out there and showing the  United States of America the valiant--the valiant--service of these men  and women.    Again, every one of these individuals has given their entire adult  life in service to our great United States of America--our great United  States of America. We would not have the country we have if we didn't  have men and women who were willing to sacrifice everything-- everything--for this country.   Mr. President, the next one is Brig. Gen. Claude K. Tudor, Jr. Again,  it is under Calendar No. 110, a list of Air Force officers who have  been selected for the grade of Major General. Brigadier General Tudor  is currently the director of operations in the J-3 for U.S. AFRICOM. As  the director of operations, Brigadier General Tudor provides oversight  and direction for all operations divisions at AFRICOM, including  working with partners to counter transnational threats and malign  actors, strengthening security forces, and responding to crises in  order to advance U.S. national interests and promote regional security,  stability, and prosperity.   Brigadier General Tudor was commissioned through the ROTC Program at  Troy State University in Alabama and has spent the majority of his  career in Special Operations ground combat assignments, deploying  extensively.   Prior to AFRICOM, Brigadier General Tudor served as the commander for  the Combined Special Operations Joint Task Force-Levant and chief of  staff of Headquarters Pacific Air Forces.   He has several degrees, including a master's in business management  from Troy State University, a master's in strategic intelligence from  the Joint Military Intelligence College, and a master's in strategic  studies from the U.S. Army War College. He has distinguished his career  having been awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal, two Legion of  Merits, and a Bronze Star.   He has also been the Air Force combat control officer of the year not  once, not twice, but three times. We need officers like Brig. Gen.  Claude K. Tudor, Jr., to stay in the fight, and I am giving him voice  on the floor of the Senate this evening--actually, at 2 in the morning.   Mr. President, again, I am rising today to highlight the career of  Maj. Gen. David A. Harris, Jr., U.S. Air Force, who is Calendar No.  186. Major General Harris has been selected for promotion to Lieutenant  General--that is a three-star General--and to be the deputy chief of  staff for Air Force Futures at Headquarters U.S. Air Force.   Major General Harris is currently the deputy commander of the Ninth  Air Force, Air Force Central, and deputy, combined forces air component  commander, of the U.S. Central Command in Southwest Asia.   As the deputy commander, he is responsible for the command and  control of air operations in a 21-nation area of responsibility,  covering Central and Southwest Asia.   He graduated from ROTC and received his commission from the  University of Alabama in 1993. He is a master navigator and basic  parachutist with more than 2,500 flying hours, having flown in support  of Operations Deliberate Force, Allied Force, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi  Freedom, Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, and Inherent  Resolve.   He has a bachelor of science in aerospace engineering, a master of  military art and science from the School of Advanced Military Studies  at Fort Leavenworth, a master's from the National War College, and was  a national security fellow at Syracuse University. Major General Harris  has commanded the squadron group and wing level. He has served as vice  superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy, deputy director of  operations for Joint Special Operations Command, and the director of  strategic plans, programs, and requirements for Air Force Special  Operations Command.  [[Page S5570]]    Prior to the current position, Major General Harris was the director  of integration and innovation and deputy chief of staff for strategy,  integration, and requirements at Headquarters U.S. Air Force.   It is officers like this that I am proud to be a staunch advocate of  in the Air Force community because, again, with the world on fire, we  need more Air Force command officers in the fight, not out of the  fight. That is why I am giving Maj. Gen. David A. Harris, Jr., tonight,  a voice, because he cannot do so on the floor of the Senate.   Mr. President, now I would like to continue by highlighting MG David  M. Hodne. He is Calendar No. 190, and he is selected for the grade of  Lieutenant General. MG David M. Hodne is currently assigned as special  assistant to the director of the Army staff with the office of the  Chief of Staff of the Army.   Hodne attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, graduating in  1991 with a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering.   He later earned a master of arts in military studies in  unconventional warfare from the American Military University. Hodne has  command of the U.S. Army Infantry School and served as the Commanding  General of the 4th Infantry Division in Fort Carson, CO, assuming  command on August 19, 2021, and relinquishing it to David S. Doyle on  June 13, 2023.   General Hodne was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal; the  Legion of Merit three times; the Bronze Star Medal not once, not twice,  not three times, ladies and gentlemen, but four times; and a Purple  Heart, which means he was injured in the line of duty.   Again, I am proud to be a staunch advocate of the U.S. Army  community, and once again, I am standing up for valiant individuals who  have answered the selfless call to serve.   That gentleman, again, was MG David M. Hodne for promotion to  Lieutenant General.   Next, I rise today to talk about MG Karl H. Gingrich, Calendar No.  224, who is being selected for the grade of Lieutenant General to be  deputy chief of staff of the U.S. Army.   MG Karl H. Gingrich became the director of program analysis and  evaluation in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff at U.S. Army  Headquarters. As the director of program analysis and evaluation, he is  responsible for developing the program objective memorandum, which  allocates resources in line with broader DOD guidance.   Prior to his current assignment, Major General Gingrich served as the  director of capability and resource integration at USCYBERCOM, which  included building the joint cyber warfighting architecture, which  covers everything from data management to command and control at  CYBERCOM.   Major General Gingrich's operational experience includes tours  supporting Operation Enduring Freedom.   Major General Gingrich holds multiple graduate degrees from the  University of Louisville, Air University, and the National Defense  University.   So this evening, again, we will not be voting on MG Karl H. Gingrich,  but he has earned this promotion, and I do hope we can resolve this  very soon.   Next, I rise to talk about MG John B. Richardson IV, Calendar No.  233, who has been nominated to be Lieutenant General and commanding  general of the First United States Army.   John B. Richardson IV was born in Baltimore, MD. He attended the  United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated in 1991. In  fact, he was the fifth member of his family to attend West Point,  exemplifying a commitment to service.   Major General Richardson was commissioned as an armor officer in 1991  from West Point. He is a proud armored cavalry man. His first  assignment was with the 1st Armored Division, serving as a tank platoon  leader with 4th Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, in Friedberg,  Germany. He served in Iraq as the squadron operations officer in the  2nd Armored Calvary Regiment, and again, a year later, he deployed as  an aide-de-camp to the commanding general of Multi-National Security  Transition Command.   I am so proud of General Richardson, and I am glad to be able to  stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight and voice his  qualifications.   Again, MG John B. Richardson IV and his promotion to Lieutenant  General and commanding general of First United States Army.   Next, I am going to rise on behalf of Maj. Gen. Michael G.--oh let me  start over; this is a tough one, folks--Koscheski. OK. This gentleman  has a tough name. He also has a tough job. We hope we can get him into  that tough job.   So I apologize, General. I owe you a beer.   OK. Calendar No. 239. He is being nominated to be deputy commander,  Air Combat Command. Maj. Gen. Michael G. Koscheski--I think I got it  right that time--is the commander of 15th Air Force, Shaw Air Force  Base, SC. Fifteenth Air Force organizes, trains, and equips its  headquarters to prepare for and execute expeditionary tasking.   The General received his commission from the United States Air Force  Academy in 1992. That is the same year I received my commission as  well--only from Iowa State University. He has served as an F-15E  instructor pilot, a weapons officer, and a flight examiner. He is a  command pilot with more than 2,800 flying hours. He has flown more than  650 combat hours over Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.   He is a decorated officer, with awards to include the Defense  Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters,  the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force Achievement  Medal.   Again, I am proud to be a staunch advocate of the Air Combat Command  community. We need officers like this in the fight, not out of the  fight, and that is why I am giving voice to them this evening.   Next, we move on to Lt. Gen. Donna D. Shipton. I am rising to talk  about Lt. Gen. Donna D. Shipton. She is Calendar No. 240 for the grade  of Lieutenant General and deputy commander of the Air Force Life Cycle  Management Center with the Air Force Materiel Command.   Lieutenant General Shipton received her commission in 1991 as a  distinguished graduate of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps  upon graduating from Clemson University. She also has a long list of  graduate degrees, including a master's in national security strategy  from the National War College, a master's in space systems from the Air  Force Institute of Technology, and a master's of arts in organizational  management from George Washington University.   She is currently the military deputy with the Office of Assistant  Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  Prior to her current position, Lieutenant General Shipton was the  deputy director for the National Reconnaissance Office, NRO, where she  assisted the director in managing the strategic and tactical operation  of the NRO.    I truly believe we must stand up for the security and protection of  our Nation, and I am proud to recognize this deserving officer who  earned this promotion and highlight her selfless call to service. That  is why I am voicing my support this evening for Lt. Gen. Donna D.  Shipton and her promotion to Lieutenant General and deputy commander,  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Air Force Materiel Command.   Next, I am rising to talk about an officer--Calendar No. 243--MG  William J. Hartman. He has been nominated to be Lieutenant General and  deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command.   MG William J. Hartman is currently commander of Cyber National  Mission Force. A native of Mobile, AL, Major General Hartman is a  distinguished military graduate of the University of South Alabama,  where he received his commission through the Reserve Officers' Training  Corps as an infantry officer.   Major General Hartman served in multiple positions as an infantry,  military intelligence, and cyberspace operations officer, with  assignments in the United States, Italy, Germany, the Republic of  Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Turkey.   Major General Hartman has commanded a company battalion brigade and  special mission unit and served as the senior intelligence officer at  the battalion and the regimental level for the 75th Ranger Regiment--he  is a bad mamba jamba--and multiple tours as a SOCOM Joint Task Force J- 2.  [[Page S5571]]    He is a decorated officer, with awards to include the Legion of Merit  with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star Medal with oak leaf clusters,  the Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf clusters, the Joint  Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster,  and the Army Achievement Medal with oak leaf clusters.   It is officers like this that I am very proud to represent on the  floor of the U.S. Senate.   We need more folks operating within Cyber Command because we know  that the world is on fire. We are in a new era. Cyber absolutely needs  more officers like this in the fight, not out of the fight.   Again, this gentleman, hailing from the great State of Alabama, MG  William J. Hartman and his promotion to Lieutenant General.   Next, we have LTG John S. Kolasheski. Oh my goodness. OK. I owe a lot  of beers tonight. It is an Army thing, Air Force thing. You got it.   Calendar No. 244. He is being nominated to be Lieutenant General and  deputy commanding general of U.S. Army Europe-Africa.   The Lieutenant General was commissioned as an armor officer and holds  a bachelor of science in management from Bucknell University and a  graduate's degree in engineering management from the University of  Central Florida.   Lieutenant General Kolasheski has had a variety of command and staff  assignments, to include deputy chief of staff, U.S. Army Forces Command  at Fort Liberty, commandant of the United States Army Armor School,  deputy commanding general for the 1st Infantry Division, the deputy  chief of staff of strategic communications for NATO, and that is just  to name a few.   He is a decorated officer, with awards to include the Distinguished  Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion--oh gosh; get  this, Senator Sullivan--Legion of Merit with five oak leaf clusters.    Heroes. And a Bronze Star Medal with three oak leaf  clusters.    It is officers like these whom I am proud to be a staunch  advocate of because the Army community needs them. We need more Army  command officers in the fight, not out of the fight. This is why I am  standing up tonight in support of LG John S. Kolasheski and his  promotion to deputy commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe-Africa.   Next, we have COL Jack J. Stumme. I am rising to talk about Jack J.  Stumme. He is a Colonel under Calendar No. 284 for the grade of  Brigadier General.   COL Jack J. Stumme is currently serving with the U.S. Army Europe- Africa as a command chaplain. Colonel Stumme has given years of service  to our military and to his faith, serving as command chaplain for  United States AFRICOM, the 18th Airborne Corps, and a staff chaplain  for the Office of the Chief of Chaplains.   I firmly believe that Colonel Stumme's qualifications, record, and  character make him exceptionally eligible for this appointment, and I  speak with experience here. Our chaplains truly do God's work for the  men and women who serve. That is why I am providing a voice this  evening for Chaplain Stumme and his promotion to Brigadier General.   Next, I rise in support of Col. Matthew S. Allen. Matthew S. Allen is  an Air Force officer--Calendar No. 336--and he has been selected for  the grade of Brigadier General.   I would like to highlight Col. Matthew S. Allen, whom many of us know  because he works directly with Members of Congress. Colonel Allen is  the director of the Office of Legislative Affairs for U.S. Special  Operations Command, the position dedicated to maintaining the good  relationship between U.S. Special Operations Command and Congress.   And you will notice that a number of these biographies that I read  earlier this morning, they were those who served within Special  Operations Command and Joint Special Operations Command.   He is the direct link on all legislative issues that deal with  Special Operations resources, authorities, and oversight, collaborating  directly with the House of Representatives and us here in the Senate to  ensure full authorization of U.S. Special Operations Command's annual  budget.   Colonel Allen grew up in a military family with assignments all  across the globe. He graduated high school in Fairfax, VA, received his  commission from the U.S. Air Force Academy, and was selected as a  special tactics officer following graduation.   Prior to his current assignment, Colonel Allen was the commander of  the 24th Special Operations Wing, where he prepared special tactics  forces to conduct special operations against threats to the homeland  and to protect U.S. interests abroad.   Colonel Allen has been privileged to command at the squadron group  and wing levels and led joint operations for Special Operations task  forces throughout the Middle East, the European theater, and the Indo- Pacific region.   He has served in Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and  Inherent Resolve and was the recipient of the Air Force's 2006 Sijan  Leadership Award. He has spent his career in Special Operations, the  air staff joint operational assignments, as well as numerous combat and  contingency deployments.   I personally know Colonel Allen. He is an incredible officer within  the Special Operations community. He definitely is an officer we need  in the fight.   I thank you and salute you, Colonel Allen, and I do hope that we are  able to move you on very soon to your well-deserved appointment to the  grade of Brigadier General.   Next, I rise to highlight the career of Maj. Gen. Sean M. Farrell,  U.S. Air Force, who is Calendar No. 339. Major General Farrell has been  selected for the grade of Lieutenant General and has been appointed to  the position of deputy commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.   Major General Farrell is currently the deputy commanding general of  Joint Special Operations Command. In this role, he oversees the study  of Special Operations requirements and techniques, ensuring joint  interoperability and equipment standardization.   In addition, he prepares assigned, attached, and augmented forces to  conduct special operations against threats to protect the homeland and  U.S. interests abroad.   He was commissioned through the Reserve Officer Training Corps at  Florida State University. He has a bachelor of science, a master of  science from Wright State University, and a master of science in  national resource strategy from the National Defense University.   He is a command pilot with over 3,500 flight hours in the AC-130H  Spectre--that is bad; that is bad--AC-130W Stinger, AC-130U Spooky--we  all know Spooky, Dan, right?--and C-130E Hercules aircraft, and has  flown combat missions in Bosnia and Afghanistan.   He has commanded at the squadron group and wing levels, having  commanded the 16th Special Operations Squadron, the 27th Special  Operations Group, and the 1st Special Operations Wing.   He has distinguished his career, having been awarded the Defense  Meritorious Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Distinguished  Flying Cross with valor device for acts of heroism above what is  normally expected while engaged in direct combat with exposure to enemy  hostilities and personal risk.   It is officers like this that I am proud to be a staunch advocate of  within our Special Operations community. We need more Special  Operations command officers in the fight, not out of the fight. And  that is why I stand tonight and give voice to Maj. Gen. Sean M. Farrell  on his promotion and his assumption of position at U.S. Special  Operations Command.   Next, I rise in support of BG Lawrence G. Ferguson. He is Calendar  No. 384, which contains a list of Army officers who have been selected  for the grade of Major General. BG Lawrence G. Ferguson is the  commanding general of 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne).   Brigadier General Ferguson is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force  Academy, who cross-commissioned into the U.S. Army.   He attended the Army Ranger School, then served with the 101st  Airborne ``Screaming Eagles'' Division. He earned a master's degree in  American  [[Page S5572]]  history from Mississippi College, and he was an Army War College Fellow  at Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy.   He served with the 7th Special Forces Group and has commanded at all  levels from Captain through Colonel and served throughout Latin America  and the Middle East. He has served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Iraqi  Freedom, and Inherent Resolve in the Army's special missions unit.    His experience has included, more recently, deputy commander of  operations, 82nd Airborne Division; chief of staff, U.S. Army Special  Operations Command; commanding officer, 10th Special Forces Group  (Airborne); and chief of staff, 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne).   And this evening, again, I am giving voice to those who cannot on the  floor of the U.S. Senate this evening, BG Lawrence G. Ferguson on his  promotion to Major General.   Next, I rise to talk about another officer within Calendar No. 384,  and this officer has been selected for the grade of Major General. Now,  this is BG Steven M. Marks, who is currently the deputy commanding  general for 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne).   Are we seeing a pattern here? A pattern here? OK.   Brigadier General Marks was raised in Columbia, MO--State to my  south--and earned his commission from the University of Missouri ROTC  in 1982.   He served in a variety of tactical assignments in the Airborne Field  Artillery Regiment and Special Operations units.   He is a graduate of the U.S. Naval War College and has a master's  degree in defense analysis from the Naval Postgraduate School in  Monterey, CA.   Brigadier General Marks has commanded in Afghanistan at every rank  from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel and serving most recently as a  commander of Special Operations Task Force Northeast.   He commanded the U.S. Army Garrison in Italy before returning to  Joint Special Operations Command as the director of J5.   He is a decorated officer with awards to include the Defense Superior  Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, and the  Meritorious Service Medal.   And, again, it is officers like this that I am proud to stand for on  the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am a staunch advocate of those within  our special operations community. We need more of these men and women  in the fight, not out of the fight. And that is why I stand tonight for  BG Steven M. Marks and his promotion to Major General.   So, folks, that does conclude the nominees that I had for this  evening, and I want to reemphasize that it is the bad policy of the  Biden administration that we are in opposition to. All of us here--I  know all of us--are adamant supporters of life. We stand for life. But  we also stand for other innocents and the innocent men and women who  are serving in uniform today and continue to serve without advancement  in their career fields while their families are hanging in the balance.   My colleague from Utah mentioned earlier: We have so many executive  orders. We see the executive branch running away, taking additional  authorities--and I am paraphrasing. It is because Congress has gotten  lazy and sloppy. Those were two of his words--lazy and sloppy. Members  of Congress didn't want to do the work. But aren't we getting lazy and  sloppy when we hold hostage innocent people?   I understand that we have the opportunity to do these holds, but  sometimes we have to work very hard to overcome adversity, just as  these men and women have.   So let's find a way. Let's lobby other Members here within this body  because that is our job to do so, not hold these members hostage to  ever-changing demands.   Now, we would have asked for individual voice votes tonight because  that is what has been asked for in the past but, unfortunately, has not  been honored.   So, again, I stand for life. I will be an ardent supporter of life,  and I will continue combating that, but I will not do it at the expense  of these individuals. I will work with other members to find a way to  overturn this egregious policy which President Biden and Secretary  Lloyd Austin have put into place. So let's find a way to overturn the  policy and advance these men and women.   And with that, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, I do want to thank my colleagues for coming  to the floor this evening and especially Senator Dan Sullivan of  Alaska, a Colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve, a fine marine. He has  deployed in service  [[Page S5578]]  to our Nation. And, as well, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  and Senator Todd Young of Indiana--all veterans, all have served in  uniform, understand the significance, the importance of getting these  nominees over the finish line. Again, all pro-life, my colleagues here  as well--adamantly pro-life. We are pro-life.   There has got to be another way to overturn this policy, change the  policy. That is our jobs. It is not the jobs of these nominees. It is  our job to make sure the policy is right.   It is President Biden's fault we are in this situation. It is Lloyd  Austin's fault that we are in this situation. It is Chuck Schumer's  fault that we are in this situation.   And I understand that a Senator has the prerogative, has the right,  in this body to put blanket holds on nominees. But, folks, you know, my  mom and dad always had a saying: Just because you can do it doesn't  mean you should.   Yes, you can put blanket holds on these nominees, but what is that  doing to our Nation right now? It is not solving the travel policy.  That is our job. We have to figure this out. And it is not getting  these men and women into the positions that are needed for our  readiness and our national security.   So we, as pro-life Senators, need to figure this out, and we need to  work with our House Members. We need to work with the majority here in  the U.S. Senate and find a path forward. It is up to us to do that.   Again, thanks to my colleagues for coming down tonight for, one,  supporting life--we all support life--but also supporting the military.  We can have not just pro-life Senators and not just pro-military  Senators; we can have both. And that is whom we are representing  tonight.   Thank you, Senator Sullivan. I will yield back to the Senator from  Alaska.
