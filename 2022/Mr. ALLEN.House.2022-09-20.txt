 Madam Speaker, we should empower our workforce to  flourish. However, Washington Democrats are fixated on dragging us back  to an outdated model via their PRO Act, which would strip workers of  their freedoms and force every American worker to either join a union  or pay dues to a union in order to keep their jobs. This is not the  American way.   Freedom of choice is what makes our economy strong, and every  American should have that choice. Our workforce is constantly evolving,  and we need creative, forward-thinking legislation that gives workers  and small businessowners both stability and flexibility. That is why  Senator Tim Scott and I introduced the Employee Rights Act.   Our bill protects independent contractors, entrepreneurs, gig  workers, franchisees, and anyone else seeking to earn a living on their  own terms. The Employee Rights Act puts workers in the driver's seat by  giving them the protections they need to choose for themselves how to  earn a living and build a future for their families.   Republicans stand with the 21st century worker. It is time our labor  laws did the same.                            ____________________
