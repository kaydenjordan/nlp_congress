 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of these  appropriations bills on the floor.   I thank the full committee chairman, Rodney Frelinghuysen, for his  dedication to regular order. We are committed to fulfilling our  constitutional responsibility and pass these bills before the end of  the fiscal year, and I commend the relevant chairmen and ranking  members for their hard work on these bills.   One of the most important duties of Members of Congress is to provide  for the United States Armed Forces. The Military Construction and  Veterans Affairs appropriations bill does just that. In particular,  the bill provides $50 million in force protection funding for each of  the services. This money could be used for access control points, air  traffic control towers, and fire stations.    This funding is particularly important for bases near my  congressional district: March Air Reserve Base and Camp Pendleton.  March Air Reserve Base is busier than ever, including managing the  deployment of over 4,000 troops every month. In order to ensure the  safety of these brave men and women, a new main gate complex is needed.   At Camp Pendleton, the fire stations are in dire need of replacement.  Of the top six fire stations identified for replacement by the Navy,  five are at Camp Pendleton. Of the full-time stations, all but three  are spartan wood-  [[Page H4902]]  frame structures built in the 1940s. The funding in this bill would  start the process of replacing old, outdated fire stations with  contemporary structures able to respond to the needs of our United  States Marine Corps.   I also support the Energy and Water portion of the bill put forward  by my friend Mike Simpson. The robust funding for the Bureau of  Reclamation will go to critical infrastructure, including $134 million  for water storage projects. The bill includes language directing FERC  to continue working with the industry on cost-effective ways to  increase the resilience of our electric transmission system. This is  especially important following one of the worst fire seasons in  California's modern history.   The bill also provides strong funding for the Army Corps of  Engineers, allowing them to update and improve water projects  throughout the country. The report contains much-needed language for  the Murrieta Creek project in my own district. The report highlights  that the project is critical to the health, safety, and protection of  the communities of Murrieta and Temecula.   Finally, the bill also repeals the disastrous Waters of the United  States rule that would significantly restrict the ability of private  landowners to make decisions about their own property. Deciding how  water should be used is a State and local issue, not the Federal  Government.                                time  1600    Mr. Chair, I thank the full committee chairman and ranking member,  the relevant subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, and staff for  their diligent work.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of the bill.
