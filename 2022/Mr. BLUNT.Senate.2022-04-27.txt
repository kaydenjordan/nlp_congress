 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mr. David  Hauck on his retirement and recognize his 35 years of dedicated service  to the Congress and the American people.   A native of Minneapolis, MN, Dave began his Capitol Hill career while  still a graduate student at American University, working part-time as  an elevator operator in the Senate. After completing his degree, he  spent 5 years working on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where  he served as hearing coordinator and systems administrator.   Following his time on the Foreign Relations Committee, Dave became  the assistant director of the Congressional Special Services Office. In  2008, Congress established the Office of Congressional Accessibility  Services and made Dave its founding director. For over 29 years, Dave  has worked to ensure that individuals with disabilities, including  Members, staff, and visitors to the Capitol, have the best possible  access to facilities and events throughout the Capitol Complex. In  addition to helping Congress create and staff the Office of  Accessibility Services, Dave also worked with Congress throughout the  construction of the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center--CVC--to make the CVC  accessible to all visitors.   Dave and his team have handled the day-to-day accessibility needs of  Congress and played an important role in every major event Congress has  seen over the last three decades. Dave has been a staunch advocate for  the accessibility community throughout countless joint sessions of  Congress, the lying in state or lying in honor of many beloved  Americans, and the inaugurations of seven Presidents. When I chaired  the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies for both  President Trump and President Biden's inaugurations, my staff and I saw  firsthand how invaluable Dave's expertise on accessibility issues was  to planning a seamless inauguration.   Today, it is my pleasure to thank Dave for his many years of service  and to congratulate him on his retirement. I wish him the best in his  next chapter, as I am sure so many here do.                            ____________________
