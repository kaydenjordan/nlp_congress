 DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to the Reverend Dr. Clay Evans who passed a few days ago and is  known worldwide as a religious leader and gospel singer.   There is nobody in the Chicagoland area who has not experienced  Reverend Clay Evans. He was actively involved in the political and  social life of the city. He was noted for many things, and one of those  that he is noted for is having been the person who ordained the  Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson.   Madam Speaker, he will be sorely missed, and we express condolences  to his family.  [[Page H9248]]                                ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join  with Representative   Bobby Rush, who reserved the time to talk about  an event that occurred 50 years ago when I guess Bobby was pretty much  still a teenager and I was a young adult.   The event took place in our city, the city of the big shoulders, the  city of Chicago, the city that sits on a lake founded by an African  American, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. An event took place where the  Chicago police, led by an assistant State's attorney, invaded the  province of a group of young leaders known to be members of the Black  Panther Party. They raided the group while they were inside asleep.  They shot up the building and killed two of the leaders.   One was a young gentleman, 21 years old, Fred Hampton, articulate,  graduated from high school with honors, head of the youth NAACP, but a  member of the Black Panther Party. Another young fellow was an  outstanding American, the son of ministers and churchgoing people. The  apartment was raided, and these two individuals were killed,  assassinated.   It is my understanding that one of the reasons that Congressman Bobby  Rush is alive today--he was supposed to have been there but had gone  home to his apartment rather than spending the night where the Panthers  were. As a result, he was spared.   Obviously, there was a hue and cry, and there were years of activity  and litigation.   Madam Speaker, it is good to see that Bobby has arrived. I just said  that fate is such that he is here today, as opposed to being where Fred  Hampton and Mark Clark are, wherever that is, because as fate would  have it, he went someplace else.   Of course, as fate would also have it, I can't help but note that I  spoke with one of Father George Clements' sons the other day, who I  understand helped to kind of conceal and hide him out while the police  were looking for him. Fortunately, fate intervened.   The activity caused a big hue and cry from the community. As a result  of that, people began to look differently at what was known as law  enforcement misconduct, police brutality. Sometimes law enforcement  individuals take matters into their own hands, not worrying about what  judges might do or judges might say, or courts of law, but would  sometimes become executioners.   As a result of that, the African American community, of Chicago  especially, changed its approach to politics. While there was a big  Democratic voting bloc, they decided--we decided, because I was voting  age. Bobby may not have been, but I was voting age. We elected a  Republican, Bernard Carey, to be the State's attorney for Cook County.   That also led to, ultimately, the changes that elected Harold  Washington, the first Black mayor of Chicago, which evolved,  ultimately, into the election of Barack Obama as President of the  United States of America, because that is where his beginning was. That  was the base.   I just happen to have represented the Hampton family in the  congressional district that I represent. Until recently, not a year  went by that I didn't spend some time with the Hampton family, that is,  with Fred's mother, his father, and his brother, Bill, who carried on  the work. As a result of that, that work is still going on.   I know that, on Sunday, in the community where I live, there is going  to be a demonstration or an acknowledgment. I wouldn't call it a  demonstration. A group of people is going to go to the location where  Fred and Mark were killed, and they are simply going to pay tribute.   I pay tribute now, and I pay tribute to my colleague U.S.  Representative Bobby Rush because it was Bobby who initiated this  Special Order. Madam Speaker, because of the Congressman, I am here.   It has been a pleasure to know that our paths have been crossing one  way or another for more than 50 years because I sat in the funeral home  that night after Fred and Mark had been assassinated. My brother  happened to be a friend of Trey Rayner, and we sat kind of keeping  vigil.   My other good friend Frank Lipscomb and I, we were both young  schoolteachers. We went over to the house that afternoon after we left  school and peered and peeked and walked through. We were, quite  frankly, afraid but wanted to see with our own eyes, and so we did see.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) and  thank him for initiating this Special Order.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Rush so much.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have left.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend  their remarks on the subject of my Special Order.
