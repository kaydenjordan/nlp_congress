 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.  [[Page S5849]]         Mr. President, each week that you see me standing  here means another week in which the Senate of the United States has  sat out doing anything to address climate change and another week of  carbon pollution streaming into our atmosphere and oceans. Carbon  dioxide from burning fossil fuels is changing our atmosphere and our  oceans. We see it everywhere. We see it in storm-damaged homes and  flooded cities. We see it in drought-stricken farms and raging  wildfires. We see it in fish disappearing from warming, acidifying  waters. We see it in shifting habitats and migrating contagions.   All these harms we see carry costs--real economic costs--to  homeowners, business owners, and taxpayers. That cost to homeowners,  business owners, and taxpayers is known as the social cost of carbon  pollution. It is the damage that people and communities and States  suffer from carbon pollution and climate change. The Office of  Management and Budget last calculated the social cost of carbon to be  around $49 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. If you just do some  simple math, you can multiply the total measured U.S. emissions coming  from energy production alone in 2016--that is emissions of over 5.7  billion tons of CO2--by the $49 cost per ton. It is pretty  simple math: $49 times 5.7 billion tons gives you about $280 billion.  So $280 billion is the annual cost that the fossil fuel industry  offloads onto the American public in harm from the carbon dioxide  emissions. That is a big number and a big consequence--$280 billion per  year.   There was a more complex analysis than my simple math that was done  by the International Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund has  a lot of smart people. They don't have any conflict of interest that I  am aware of in dealing with this issue. Their calculation puts the  annual subsidy just in the United States of America for the fossil fuel  industry at $700 billion per year.   So is it my simple math where the social cost of carbon is $280  billion per year or is it what the International Monetary Fund  calculated at $700 billion per year? Whichever it is, it is a big  enough harm to the American public that you would think we might do  something about it here in the Senate. But of course, we don't because  that huge social cost of carbon, that huge subsidy gives the fossil  fuel industry the biggest incentive in the world to--instead of fixing  up its situation and cleaning up its mess--come over here and instead  mess with our politics so that our ability to deal with this issue is  silenced by their political muscle and manipulations.   One way in which they play this game is to populate the climate  denial machinery with one-eyed accountants--accountants who can only  see the pollutants' side of the ledger. Honestly, we hear their  testimony. The only thing they see is the cost to polluters of reducing  their pollution. They don't see the public harm side of the ledger.  They pretend it is a liberal conspiracy cooked up by the Obama  administration. Or say you are the Republican chairman of the House  Science Committee and you say: The social cost of carbon is a ``flawed  value . . . to justify the [EPA's] alarmist reasoning for support of  the Clean Power Plan and other climate regulations.''   Actually, if you take away the bad words ``flawed'' and ``alarmist''  and all of that stuff, the statement is actually true. There is a value  to avoiding carbon pollution, and defending that public value from the  polluters does justify the Clean Power Plan. This is the social cost of  carbon. Let's go back for a minute to 2006, when the Bush  administration's National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  put out a rule for vehicle fuel economy standards. There was some  dissatisfaction with that rule. States and other stakeholders  complained that this rule failed to take into account the social cost  of carbon emissions from cars--something that should matter for a rule  that is looking to reduce emissions from cars. Well, that went up on  appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and in 2007,  the Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. The court acknowledged that there  is a cost of carbon pollution, and that cost is ``certainly not zero.''  So it told the agency to go back, redo the rule and to come up with a  real social cost of carbon. Thus was born the legal requirement that  agencies consider a social cost of carbon in decisions.   Because of this decision, the Bush administration produced a wide  range of numbers up to $159 per ton of carbon emissions. The Obama  administration continued the effort to calculate a social cost of  carbon. An interagency working group, including scientists and  economists from across the Federal Government, relied on existing  scientific literature and on well vetted scientific models to produce a  first standard in 2010, with additional updates in 2013, 2015, and  2016.   When Federal agencies didn't apply any social cost of carbon, courts  corrected them. In 2014, a Federal judge in Colorado faulted the Bureau  of Land Management for failing to account for greenhouse gas emissions  when it approved an Arch Coal mine expansion in the Gunnison National  Forest. The court suspended the approval until the Bureau of Land  Management either used the social cost of carbon or gave a valid  explanation as to why not. When agencies did use the social cost of  carbon, their decisions were upheld. In 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Seventh Circuit upheld the Department of Energy's use of the  social cost of carbon in the agency's standards for commercial  refrigeration equipment. The industry objected, and on appeal, the  Seventh Circuit said: No, they did the right thing putting that in  there.   Just last month, a three-judge panel from another U.S. circuit court  of appeals--in this case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia Circuit--ruled that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  has to consider the effects of carbon emissions that would result from  building three pipelines in the Southeast. Specifically, the ruling  directed FERC to either better calculate the project's carbon  emissions, using the social cost of carbon, or explain why it didn't  use it.   Also last month, another U.S. district court blocked another coal  mine expansion in Montana, citing the agency's failure to assess the  environmental effects of coal. Specifically, the judge referenced the  agency's failure to include any social cost of carbon.   Just last week a Federal appeals court in Denver told the Bureau of  Land Management that its lack of analysis on the climate effects of  four coal leases in the Powder River Basin was ``irrational'' and told  them to start over.   It is not just Federal courts. Agencies at the State level are also  using the social cost of carbon pollution in their activities. The New  York Public Service Commission affirmed the importance of the social  cost of carbon in its zero-emissions credit program. The Illinois State  legislature also incorporated a social cost of carbon into its zero- emissions credit program, and prevailed in a challenge in the courts.  These State zero-emissions programs were the programs that were rolled  out to help existing nuclear energy providers against competition by  natural gas plants. The carbon price allowed carbon-free nuclear  generation to better compete in the wholesale markets.   Up in Minnesota, since 1993, the Minnesota Public Utilities  Commission has required utilities to consider the estimated cost of  carbon emissions in planning for new infrastructure projects. This  year, the commission voted to raise its social cost of carbon to $43  per ton.   The Colorado Public Utilities Commission recently ordered the local  utility Xcel to use the social cost of carbon in its resource planning  documents. Colorado told its utilities to use $43 per ton starting in  2022 and to ramp up to nearly $70 per ton by 2050.   It is not just Federal courts and State agencies. Private companies  in the United States and around the globe are incorporating the social  cost of carbon into their own operations and accounting. Investors are  beginning to demand that corporations perform this kind of analysis in  order to qualify for investment. Big investors like Black Rock have  taken on big companies like Exxon in order to break through the denial.   Just last week, the Washington Post reported that 1,200 global  businesses either have adopted or are adopting a carbon price in some  form. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions found that companies  like Microsoft,  [[Page S5850]]  Disney, the insurance giant Swiss Re, Unilever, Shell, BP, the mining  corporation Rio Tinto, and General Motors have all taken steps to put a  price on their own use of carbon.   Courts have made it the law for agencies to use the social cost of  carbon. States are deploying the social cost of carbon. The business  community recognizes and is incorporating into its financial planning  the social cost of carbon. Yet here in Congress and down at the Trump  White House, the leaders of the Republican Party continue to ignore  climate change, pretend it doesn't exist, and ignore the very real  costs that society bears from carbon pollution.   It goes without saying that the storm that has just ravaged Florida  was spun up by warmer ocean waters, carried more rain because of warmer  air, dumped more rain, and pushed storm surge further into Florida  because of risen seas and those other characteristics.   Are we seeing any action? No. The President in March issued a  sweeping Executive order rolling back Federal energy and environmental  standards. It disbanded the interagency working group, and it asserted  that the social cost of carbon was ``no longer representative of  governmental policy.'' Nice try with that, given where the courts are.   Of course, the House and the Senate Republicans followed suit by  introducing a pair of bills by Congressman Evan Jenkins on the House  side and our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, on our side  that purport to prohibit the Federal Government from using the social  cost of carbon in rulemaking and in regulatory processes. Of course,  you can't do that, and those laws aren't going anywhere. Why? Because  they violate a very basic principle both in courts and in  administrative agencies. That very basic principle is at the heart of  the rule of law, and it is that facts have to be factual and that  conclusions have to be logical. Any decision that fails this standard-- that is, to use the administrative law terms ``arbitrary and  capricious'' or ``not based on substantial evidence''--fails as a  matter of law. Although Congress, of course, is bound and gagged by the  polluters and their front groups, it is going to be hard for those  polluters to try to stop the social cost of carbon in courts and  administrative agencies. Despite the efforts of ExxonMobil and the Koch  brothers to make America their fossil fuel banana republic, we still  are a rule-of-law country and those rule-of-law principles that facts  must be factual and that conclusions must be logical are too basic for  our courts and administrative agencies to ignore.   In our courts and administrative agencies, lying and misleading can  be exposed on cross-examination, for instance, and lying and misleading  gets you punished, unlike in Congress where lying and misleading have  been fossil fuel tactics for decades and sickeningly successful ones  backed up by huge political muscle.   The failure in Congress and the remedy in the courts is one reason  the Founding Fathers designed our government that way so that even  where political branches of government were captured by special  interests, there would still be a path for the truth, and there would  still be a means for justice to have its way.   If the courts and the States and so many major businesses are all  behind recognizing the social cost of carbon, who is behind the  President and our Republican colleagues in denying that it is real? In  my experience, it is powerful trade associations like the American  Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council, the National  Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others  that have a distaste for any honest assessment of the social cost of  carbon.   Right now, since the costs of those industries' pollution is  offloaded onto the rest of us for free, why not? Why would they want to  start paying for the harm they cause right now?   Think tanks and front groups funded by the Koch brothers and other  polluters have vigorously fought against recognizing the fact of the  social cost of carbon for years. These groups have neutral sounding  names--maybe even friendly sounding names--like the Competitive  Enterprise Institute, the American Energy Alliance, the Heritage  Foundation, FreedomWorks--my personal favorite--the Heartland  Institute, a group so good that it put up billboards comparing climate  scientists to the Unabomber. It is really a classy contribution to the  debate.   One thing this crowd of bad actors does know is how to throw its  weight around, especially since the Citizens United decision threw open  the floodgates of special interest money into our politics. That is  what has put Congress in the thrall of the polluters. It is an indecent  and wrong place for us to be, but with any luck, the adherence of  courts and administrative agencies to the rule of law--the principles  that facts must be factual and conclusions must be logical--will help  us get out of the political trap that the fossil fuel industry has  constructed.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Florida.
