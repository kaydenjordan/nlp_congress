 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 78, the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act. This bill would require the SEC to do an  absurd amount of time-consuming, duplicative cost-benefit analysis  before they can even propose a rule. This is the fourth time, Mr.  Chairman, that we are voting on this partisan bill because the previous  three times the bill has been rejected by the Senate and President  Obama has strongly opposed it.   But let's be clear about what this bill is not about. It is not about  ensuring that the SEC conducts a cost-benefit analysis on the rules. If  that were the case, then no legislation would be necessary. The SEC is  already required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and has already  adopted internal guidance on economic analysis that mirrors the exact  requirements of this bill before us today. So the problem is not that  the SEC doesn't currently conduct cost-benefit analyses or that it does  it poorly; the real goal of this bill is simply to give the industry  more chances to sue the SEC on cost-benefit grounds when it issues  rules the industry does not like. That is essentially the only thing  that would change if this bill were signed into law.   The SEC's cost-benefit analysis would be the same, but the industry  would have more opportunities to sue the SEC over alleged flaws in the  cost-benefit analysis. And the threat of a lawsuit would force the SEC  to divert even more of its scarce resources to cost-benefit analysis,  which would delay the key reforms and undermine the SEC's ability to  protect investors--their core mission.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, as they have in three  previous votes before this body.   I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I enter into the  Record the following letters of opposition to H.R. 78 signed by the  Consumer Federation of America, Americans for Financial Reform, the  California State Teachers' Retirement System, and the Council of  Institutional Investors. These institutions represent various groups  such as investors, consumers, public pension plans, labor unions, and  communities of color.                                                 Consumer Federation                                                      of America,                                                   January 10, 2017.    Vote NO on H.R. 78, the ``SEC Regulatory Accountability Act''--Bill   Would Paralyze the Agency's Ability to Protect Investors and Promote                              Market Integrity         Dear Representative: This week the House is expected to       vote on H.R. 78, the ``SEC Regulatory Accountability Act.''       The bill imposes burdensome new rulemaking requirements that       would prevent the agency from responding in a timely manner       either to emerging threats in the marketplace or to industry       requests for guidance or legal interpretations. As such, it       threatens to undermine the stability and integrity essential       to healthy capital markets, with harmful consequences for       investors, capital formation, and the overall economy. I am       writing on behalf of the Consumer Federation of America to       urge you to vote no when the bill is brought to the floor for       a vote.        The bill is being promoted as a measure to enhance cost-      benefit analysis at the Securities and Exchange Commission       (SEC). And, in that regard, certain of the bill's       requirements are relatively benign, such as the requirements       that the agency discuss the nature and scope of the problem       it is intending to solve when it engages in rulemaking,       carefully analyze available alternatives, and consider the       costs of the various alternatives as well as their relative       effectiveness in determining on a course of action. But these       are things the SEC already does, having learned the painful       lesson that failure to do so can result in its rules' being       overturned in court. Indeed, both the Government       Accountability Office and the SEC's Office of  [[Page H432]]       the Inspector General have in recent years praised the agency       for the extent and quality of its cost-benefit analysis.        Other of the bill's provisions are far more harmful. The       following are among the most serious problems with this       legislation:        It requires the agency to adopt, not the most cost-      effective regulatory approach, but the least burdensome       approach. As such, it prioritizes minimizing regulatory costs       over promoting regulatory effectiveness.        The bill requires the agency to consider a number of       specific factors in assessing regulations, including their       effect on efficiency, competition, and capital formation as       well as investor choice, market liquidity, and small       business. Not included are any specific requirement to assess       their impact on investor protection or market integrity,       stability, and transparency.        If the Conunission fails to address concerns raised by       ``industry groups'' related to costs and benefits, it must       explain its reasons. There is no comparable requirement to       explain any decision not to address investor concerns.        It imposes these burdensome new requirements, not just on       regulations, but also on agency orders, interpretations, and       other statements of general applicability ``that the agency       intends to have the force and effect of law.'' Firms seeking       a timely response from the agency staff on issues important       to their business are likely to face significant delays if       the legislation is enacted.        It requires the agency to engage in a constant       retrospective review of all its regulations every five years,       regardless of whether there is any cause for concern with a       particular regulation. Since the bill doesn't include any new       funding authorization to provide for this review, and       Congress has been highly reluctant to provide funding       increases commensurate with the agency's workload, the       inevitable result is that the agency will be forced to take       resources away from other more important regulatory       priorities to fund this generally meaningless exercise.        While a reasonable and balanced analysis of costs and       benefits can promote effective rulemaking, this legislation       goes far beyond what is reasonable or balanced. It would tie       the SEC in procedural knots, keep its focus on an endless       review of existing rules rather than emerging issues, provide       endless grounds for legal challenge, causing a serious drain       on agency resources, and undermine the agency's focus on its       central mission of protecting investors and promoting market       integrity and stability. Indeed, the bill would exacerbate       rather than ameliorate the most serious short-comings in the       agency's current regulatory process--its inability to       complete rulemakings regarding pressing issues in a timely       manner.        For these reasons, we urge you to vote ``No'' when H.R. 78,       the ``SEC Regulatory Accountability Act,'' is brought to the       floor for a vote. The only ``accountability'' this       legislation promotes, is the SEC's accountability to the       firms it is supposed to regulate rather than the investors it       is supposed to protect.            Respectfully submitted,                                                     Barbara Roper,      Director of Investor Protection.                                   ____                                                   AFR Americans for                                                Financial Reform,                                   Washington, DC, January 12, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial       Reform, we are writing to express our opposition to HR 78,       the ``SEC Regulatory Accountability Act''t6espite the fact       that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is already       subject to more stringent economic analysis requirements than       any other Federal financial regulator, and has greatly       increased its investment in economic analysis in recent       years, this legislation would impose a host of unworkable       bureaucratic and administrative requirements on the agency.       While they are justified using the rhetoric of ``cost benefit       analysis'', these requirements appear designed not to improve       SEC economic analysis but instead to make create major new       barriers to effective agency action.        The most prominent new requirement would mandate that the       SEC identify every ``available alternative'' to a proposed       regulation or agency action and quantitatively measure the       costs and benefits of each such alternative prior to taking       action. Since there are always numerous possible alternatives       to any course of action, this requirement alone could force       the agency to complete dozens of additional analyses before       passing a rule or guidance. Placing this mandate in statute       will also provide near-infinite opportunities for Wall Street       lawsuits aimed at halting or reversing SEC actions, and would       be a gift to litigators who work on such anti-government       lawsuits. No matter how much effort the SEC devotes to       justifying its actions, the question of whether the agency       has identified all possible alternatives to a chosen action,       and has properly measured the costs and benefits of each such       alternative, will always remain open to debate.        Like other agencies, the SEC is already required to conduct       economic analyses under the Paperwork Reduction Act, the       Congressional Review Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.       Unlike all other financial regulators, the SEC also has       additional statutory requirements to examine how each rules       affect market efficiency, competition, and capital formation.       The SEC has also issued binding internal guidance on economic       analysis for rulemakings that closely follows Executive Order       12866 and OMB Circular A-4, and has more than tripled its       spending on economic and risk analysis since 2012.        Despite these already existing commitments to economic       analysis, this proposal would load the agency with a crushing       burden of additional administrative burdens under the rubric       of ``cost-benefit analysis''. In addition to the enormous       task of identifying and analyzing every available alternative       to a course of action, the agency would be required to       perform half a dozen new analyses in addition to its current       requirements concerning market efficiency, competition, and       capital formation. These new requirements include analyses of       effects on small business, market liquidity, state and local       government, investor choice, and ``market participants''.       Notably, no new requirements concerning the protection of       investors or preventing another financial crash are included.        This legislation also requires the SEC to review every       single regulation in effect within one year after the passage       of this Act, and again every five years thereafter, with an       eye to weakening or eliminating such regulations. This will       be an enormous drain on SEC resources and a distraction from       addressing emerging issues in our ever more complex financial       markets.        This legislation is transparently an effort to paralyze the       SEC and to empower Wall Street lawyers to overturn its       decisions, not to improve its analysis or decision making. We       urge you to reject it.        Thank you for your consideration. For more information       please contact AFR's Policy Director, Marcus Stanley.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.                                   ____                                          California State Teachers'                                               Retirement System,                                                   January 10, 2017.       Re H.R. 78--SEC Regulatory Accountability Act.       Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: I am       writing on behalf of the California State Teachers'       Retirement System (CalSTRS) to express our concerns regarding       the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act--H.R. 78.        CalSTRS' mission is to secure the financial future and       sustain the trust of California's educators. We serve the       investment and retirement interests of more than 914,000 plan       participants. CalSTRS is the largest educator only pension       fund in the world, with a global investment portfolio valued       at approximately $193 billion as of November 30, 2016. We       have a vested interest in ensuring shareholder protections       are safeguarded within the U.S. Securities and Exchange       Commission's (SEC) rules and regulations, and thereby are       keenly interested in the rules and regulations that govern       the securities market. CalSTRS fully supports the mission of       the SEC, which is to protect investors, maintain fair,       orderly and efficient markets, promote competition and       facilitate capital formation.        As a long-term shareholder, and fiduciary to California's       teachers, we believe it is vital to avoid unnecessary       regulatory costs that could obstruct the efficiency of the       capital markets and the economy. CalSTRS relies heavily on       the SEC shareholder protections in allocating capital on       behalf of California teachers. However, CalSTRS is unclear on       how the provisions of H.R. 78 would improve the cost-      effectiveness of the SEC rulemaking process with the addition       of these cumbersome, unnecessary and seemingly duplicative       steps. As you know the Office of Inspector General, Office of       Audits (OIG) issued a report, Use of the Current Guidance on       Economic Analysis in SEC Rulemakings, which provided six       recommendations to strengthen the SEC's economic analysis       process. The report by the OIG found in its sample review       that the SEC ``followed the spirit and intent of the Current       Guidance as well as . . . justification for the rule,       considered alternatives and integrated the economic analysis       into the rulemaking process.'' The proposed ``SEC Regulatory       Accountability Act'' requires the SEC to address any       industry's or consumer group's concerns on the potential       costs or benefits in its final rule, including an explanation       of any changes that were made in response to these concerns       and if not incorporated, reasons why.        Since this report, the Division of Economic and Risk       Analysis (DERA) at the SEC has devoted considerable resources       to integrate the six recommendations, having already       addressed what is being proposed in the ``SEC Regulatory       Accountability Act.'' We fully endorse the SEC's current       process, which ensures a robust cost benefit analysis in       rulemakings. The SEC, DERA and Office of the General Counsel       are highly committed to a cost effective rulemaking process       as evidenced by the current diligent economic analysis in the       SEC proposed and final rulemakings.        The proposed amendments to Section 23 of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 through H.R. 78 are unnecessary as DERA       currently fulfills the actions outlined in this bill. We       believe H.R. 78 is redundant and unneeded  [[Page H433]]       with the steps already taken by the SEC in their economic       analysis processes. Also alarming is that H.R. 78 is being       brought directly to the House Floor for action without any       consideration or vetting by the Committee on Financial       Services. CalSTRS does not support circumventing the vetting       process with an immediate vote, bypassing comprehensive       safeguards. If this this bill is pushed through an immediate       vote, we are concerned important rulemakings to enhance       investor protection will cease at the SEC, thereby impacting       shareholder protections and the mission of the SEC.        We respectfully ask that our views be entered into the       record. We would be happy to discuss our perspective on this       issue with you or your staff at your convenience. Thank you       for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                        Jack Ehnes,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                               Council of Institutional Investors,                                                   January 11, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Minority Leader Pelosi: I am writing       on behalf of the Council of Institutional Investors (CII).       CII is a nonprofit, nonpartisan association of public,       corporate and union employee benefit funds, and other       employee benefit plans, foundations and endowments with       combined assets under management exceeding $3 trillion. Our       member funds include major long-term shareowners with a duty       to protect the retirement savings of millions of workers and       their families. Our associate members include a range of       asset managers with more than $20 trillion in assets under       management.        The purpose of this letter is to express our opposition to       H.R. 78, which we understand is likely to be considered on       the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives (House).        As an association of long-term shareowners interested in       maximizing long-term share value, CII believes it is ``vital       to avoid unnecessary regulatory costs.'' However, it is not       clear to us how the provisions of H.R. 78 would improve the       cost-effectiveness of the U.S. Securities and Exchange       Commission's (SEC or Commission) existing thorough rulemaking       process or somehow benefit long-term investors, the capital       markets or the overall economy.                SEC's Existing Economic Analysis is Extensive         The Commission's rulemaking process is already governed by       a number of legal requirements, including those under the       federal securities laws, the Administrative Procedure Act,       the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Small Business       Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 and the       Regulatory Flexibility Act. Moreover, under the federal       securities laws, the SEC is generally required to consider       whether its rulemakings are in the public interest and will       protect investors and promote efficiency, competition and       capital formation.        Since the 1980s, the Commission has conducted, to the       extent possible, an analysis of the costs and benefits of its       proposed rules. The SEC has further enhanced the economic       analysis of its rulemaking process in recent years. That       process is far more extensive than that of any other federal       financial regulator.     H.R. 78 Would Unnecessarily Impede the SEC from Protecting Investors         The provisions of H.R. 78 create a false and misleading       expectation that the SEC can reasonably measure, combine and       compare the balance of all costs and benefits of its       proposals consistent with its mandate to protect investors.       As explained by Professor Craig M. Lewis, former chief       economist and director of the SEC's Division of Economic and       Risk Analysis: ``[W]ith regard to investor protection, the       Commission is often unable to reasonably quantify the related       benefits or costs.''        H.R. 78, if adopted, would impose upon the SEC a costly,       time consuming and incomplete analysis in which the       Commission would be hard pressed to determine that the       benefits of a proposal or rule ``justify the costs of the       regulation.'' As a result, we believe the provisions of H.R.       78 would unnecessarily impede the ability of the SEC to issue       proposals in furtherance of its mission to protect       investors--the element of its mission that, in our view, is       most critical to maintaining and enhancing a fair and       efficient capital market system consistent with economic       growth.                H.R. 78 Should Be Subject to a Public Hearing         Finally, as indicated, it is not clear to us how the       provisions of H.R. 78 would improve the cost-effectiveness of       SEC rulemaking or benefit long-term investors, the capital       markets or the overall economy. Moreover, we believe it is       unlikely that the House could demonstrate that the benefits       to investors of H.R. 78 justify the costs of implementing the       bill. In that regard, perhaps before the House votes on H.R.       78, the committee of jurisdiction; the House Committee on       Financial Services (including its fourteen new members)       should conduct a public hearing on the bill. The hearing       might include testimony from the SEC, investors, and other       knowledgeable market participants about, among other issues,       the potential costs and benefits of the proposed legislation.        We would respectfully request that you oppose the passage       of H.R. 78.        Thank you for consideration of our views. If we can answer       any questions or provide additional information on this       important matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                      Jeff Mahoney,      General Counsel.                                   ____                                Better Markets         Fact Sheet on H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act         H.R. 78 amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and       requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to       follow burdensome new procedures before it issues any new       rules.        The SEC is the federal agency responsible for protecting       investors and markets by regulating securities professionals       and much of the financial industry, including most of the       activities on Wall Street. H.R. 78 would impose significant       new and onerous requirements on the SEC, which would make it       much more difficult to effectively regulate Wall Street and       protect investors and our markets.        Specifically, H.R. 78 requires the SEC to undertake       extensive cost-benefit analyses of every proposed rule, and       requires the SEC, before even proposing a new regulation, to       first identify every ``available alternative''--an impossible       standard to meet--and to then explain why each of those       alternatives was insufficient. Not only would this bog down       the agency with endless analysis of all possibilities, but it       would also result in endless litigation as industry       participants sue to overturn rules they don't like; industry       would only have to assert that the SEC hadn't considered some       alleged ``available alternative'' for the rule to be thrown       out. This would effectively paralyze the SEC from issuing any       new rules, leaving investors, customers and our markets       unprotected.        Not just new regulations would be impacted; long-      established, decades-old rules that have kept the markets       operating effectively for years would also be in jeopardy.       H.R. 78 requires the SEC to review every regulation on its       books within one year, and repeat the exercise every five       years. Because H.R. 78 does not provide additional funding       for the SEC, it is inevitable that these requirements would       overwhelm the agency, which would have to divert its already       limited resources away from policing Wall Street to endlessly       reviewing rules.        Although H.R. 78 requires the SEC to consider a rule's       impact on the financial industry, there is no such       requirement for the SEC to consider its benefits to the       public. H.R. 78 does not explain why the SEC should weigh a       rule's costs to the industry more than it weighs its benefits       to the American taxpayer.        Importantly, the SEC already does extensive economic       analyses of its rules. Former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro       testified before Congress that ``The SEC's substantive rule       releases include more extensive economic analysis than those       of any other federal financial regulator.'' Independent       reviews by the Government Accountability Office and the SEC's       Inspector General concluded the SEC's economic analyses were       of a high standard and appropriately ``reflected statutory       requirements to consider certain types of benefits and       costs.''        As noted by the Council of Institutional Investors,       requiring SEC to do cost-benefit analyses like those proposed       in H.R. 78 would ``undermine effective investor safeguards''       and ``paralyze the [SEC's] regulatory activities.'' Former       SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said these efforts were attempts       by Congress to ``emasculate'' independent agencies like the       SEC ``under the false guise of modernization.'' In an article       entitled ``The Trojan Horse of Cost Benefit Analysis,'' John       Kemp, a market analyst at Reuters, said bills like H.R. 78       ``are not really about cost benefit analysis at all. . . .       The standard they seek to enforce would be impossible to       meet.''         115th Congress --January 2017     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes  to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), a member of  the Financial Services Committee.   Mr. Al GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I am absolutely amazed this legislation has progressed to this point.  This is not a panacea. This is not legislation that will prevent some  harm being done to mom-and-pops. This is about Wall Street. This is  about multimillion-dollar corporations. It is not unusual here for  those who would benefit from the use of those who live on Main Street,  they would benefit from it by saying that the bill is for Main Street  when in fact it is for Wall Street.   This bill should properly be labeled the bill that the SEC rulings  would come under stagnation, litigation, and decimation as a result of,  because the way the bill is worded, there will be much litigation, and  that litigation will tie the SEC up in court for many years. That will  create the stagnation  [[Page H434]]  which will cause the SEC to be ineffective; and, as a result, the SEC,  in terms of its rulemaking, will be decimated.   Let's talk for a moment about a cost-benefit analysis. That is a very  simple formula that can be used if you want to refinance your home and  you want to get a different interest rate over a different period of  time. All of the numbers associated with it are quantifiable. But if  you want to do cost-benefit analysis in terms of fraud prevention, the  prevention of fraud is not quantifiable; it is not knowable.   Bernie Madoff made off with approximately $64 billion, and in so  doing, he perpetrated one of the biggest frauds ever perpetrated on the  United States of America, the American people. If we had a regulation  in place to prevent that fraud that Bernie Madoff perpetrated, there  would be no way of knowing that he would have perpetrated the $64  billion fraud. You can't quantify legislation that prevents the fraud.   If we had legislation in place to prevent the downturn in 2008, that  would have prevented the 327s, the 228s, the teaser rates that  coincided with prepayment penalties, the no-doc loans. If we had  regulations in place to prevent it, then we would never have known the  harm it would have caused the economy.   That is what this bill will do. It will put the SEC in a position  such that it cannot produce the rules to prevent the fraud that we can  never measure. It is not knowable how much fraud will be prevented by  the rules that the SEC promotes and produces.   This legislation also does not allow the SEC to move at the speed of  innovation. Innovation moves quickly. The SEC has to be able to produce  rules to match the speed of innovation. This is why it was difficult to  do something about what was happening to the economy leading up to  2008. We didn't have the speed necessary, and now we are going to put a  further burden on the SEC such that the SEC won't be able to respond to  these new products that are coming on the market. And make no mistake,  they will come on the market.   The stock market crash of 1929 was something that rules and  regulations could have prevented. They were not there. They put them in  place. Glass-Steagall was one of them. It took 66 years, but they got  Glass-Steagall. I don't know how long it is going to take them, but  they intend to get Dodd-Frank. This is the first step in the direction  of making Dodd-Frank impotent.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I would like to share with my colleagues and the American public how  American organizations that work day in and day out to fight to protect  investors, consumers, minorities, workers, and pension plans view this  bill.   The director of investor protection of the Consumer Federation of  America states: ``This legislation goes far beyond what is reasonable  or balanced and, indeed, the bill would exacerbate, rather than end the  most serious shortcomings in the agency's current regulatory process,  its inability to complete rulemaking regarding pressing issues in a  timely manner.''   The general counsel of Council of Institutional Investors stated:  ``We believe the provisions of H.R. 78 would unnecessarily impede the  ability of the SEC to issue proposals in furtherance of its mission,  its mission to protect investors.''   Finally, the Americans for Financial Reform stated: ``This  legislation is transparently an effort to paralyze the SEC and to  empower Wall Street lawyers to overturn its decisions and sue and not  to improve its analysis or decisionmaking process.''   I urge my colleagues to heed these warnings and to really hear what  these representatives of the public are saying; and I urge them to vote  ``no'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   My Republican colleagues, regrettably, want to impose cost-benefit  analysis that tilts towards industry costs because they know something  that they don't want the American people to know. An impartial cost- benefit analysis of Wall Street reform rules would inevitably  demonstrate how wildly beneficial such rules are to the U.S. economy  and to the lives of everyday Americans.   Earlier this week, the bipartisan think tank, Third Way, found that  Dodd-Frank's bank capital rules will add $351 billion--as in B,  billion--to the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. This report  presents a cost-benefit analysis that shows that, while lending becomes  slightly more expensive when banks are required to maintain higher  capital levels, the benefits of mitigating another financial crisis  greatly exceed any costs. This report is one of many which Republicans  intentionally ignore.   Reducing the likelihood of another financial crisis does not come  without cost, but the costs are worth it. Let us not forget the  widespread human suffering that has been felt across this Nation  because of the financial crisis. The 2008 financial crisis destroyed  8.7 million American jobs, wiped out $2.8 trillion in retirement  savings of ordinary Americans, and led to the foreclosure, the loss--15  million Americans lost their homes due to financial mismanagement in  this country.   If those aren't significant costs for policymakers to consider, then  what else is?   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I want to point out that with Dodd-Frank and the reforms that the  Democrats put in place, our economy bounded back faster and stronger  than all of Europe. And I must say that one of the areas that we need  to work on, where we are falling behind in our economy, is exports. We  need to support exports.   Despite all the talk that we hear from Republicans about enacting  policies that support jobs and job creation, and the slew of tweets  from the President-elect discouraging American companies from moving  U.S. jobs overseas--and I support his efforts to stop our companies  from going overseas--one proven job creator has remained on the  sidelines, and that is the U.S. Export-Import Bank. This Bank has  played a critical role in opening up international markets to U.S.  exporters, which, in turn, helps create and preserve jobs here in  America.   The export-import banks of our competitors are supported by those  countries five times more than what we do here in America. In fact, the  ability of the Export-Import Bank to even operate, even though it makes  money and has succeeded in building up American exports, has been  hamstrung by the leadership of my good friends and colleagues on the  other side of the aisle.   In recognition of the Bank's success and supporting U.S. jobs over  the past 80 years, in December of 2015 the House and the Senate voted  with overwhelming majorities to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.  Despite this broad support, the Bank has remained hamstrung because,  with three empty seats on its five-member board, the Bank lacks the  quorum it needs in order to approve transactions over $10 million.   Although President Obama nominated two individuals to serve on the  Ex-Im's bipartisan board, the Senate Republican leadership refused to  consider them, and Ex-Im's board remains without a quorum. They can not  approve these exports. I think it is a national scandal.   Indeed, it has been more than 18 months since the Export-Import  Bank's board was last able to consider transactions, which has limited  its ability to ensure U.S. workers and businesses of all sizes are able  to compete around the world for contracts, as well as support jobs for  the many small businesses that contribute to the supply chains for  these high-value exports.                                time  1515    In fact, the bank currently has 50 transactions in its pipeline  valued at nearly $40 billion, which, if approved, would support more  than 100,000 American high-skill and high-wage jobs. I intend to bring  this to the attention of the President-elect.   So, as we talk today about how these Republican bills will create  American jobs, I think it is important that we look at the GOP's full  record on job creation or, might I say in this case, job prevention. As  their record shows, Republican leaders have been all too willing to let  U.S. jobs slip away to our foreign competitors.   Until Congress restores Ex-Im to full functionality, U.S. companies  selling expensive capital goods such as aircraft, locomotives, nuclear  reactors, and turbines will remain at a unique competitive disadvantage  because their foreign competitors all enjoy ample financing from their  home-country export credit agencies--enough to easily knock U.S.  companies out of the competition. This is unfair.   We cannot compete and win in the global economy unless we support our  businesses. We will lose global market share in key sectors such as the  satellite industry, aerospace, and telecommunications. We will lose  tens of thousands of jobs as some of the biggest U.S. exports suffer  declining overseas sales, and, eventually, some of  [[Page H436]]  these companies would be forced to move jobs to where export credit is  still available. We have seen this reported in the news daily where  they are moving to our competitors.   So, in short, we need to support the Export-Import Bank. We need to  not hamstring the SEC by requiring it to have unnecessary, time- consuming, duplicative rules that are already in place and that allow  people to sue them more easily.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  care, as President-elect Trump does, about job creation to be opposed  to this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
