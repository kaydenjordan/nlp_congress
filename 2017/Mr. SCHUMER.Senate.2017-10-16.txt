 Madam President, first, on the issue of healthcare, last  week, President Trump committed two  [[Page S6384]]  acts of pointless sabotage of our Nation's healthcare system. He signed  an Executive order that would give insurers more latitude to sell  temporary, junk plans that are not only incredibly risky to the  consumer but undermine the rest of the healthcare market by drawing  healthy Americans out of the pool. Even worse, President Trump decided  to stop the cost-sharing program, which reduces premiums, deductibles,  and copays for 7 million Americans a year. There is literally no upside  to the President's decision to end the cost-sharing program.   Because of the President's actions, premiums will go up between 20  and 25 percent, according to the CBO. Just today in Pennsylvania, we  saw premiums rise by 30 percent as a direct result of the President's  actions. Deductibles and out-of-pocket costs will go up by thousands of  dollars. Deficits will rise by $194 billion because the government will  have to pay more in subsidies to make up for the lack of the cost- sharing program, and the marketplaces will become less stable because  more people will go uninsured.   The Republican Governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, may have said it  best:         It's going to hurt people. It's going to hurt kids. It's       going to hurt families. It's going to hurt individuals. It's       going to hurt people with mental health issues. It's going to       hurt veterans. It's going to hurt everybody.    That is from Republican Governor Brian Sandoval.   Another point that the President should hear is that nearly 70  percent of the Americans who benefit from these cost-sharing payments  live in States that Donald Trump won in the election.   Make no mistake about it--the President is deliberately undermining  our healthcare system with these two actions. When premiums go up  because of this action, the blame will fall on his shoulders.   There is a way out. The way out of all of this is for Congress to  aggressively pursue a bipartisan healthcare bill that will take cost- sharing out of the President's hands by locking in the payments. For  many months, Democrats have been pushing to stabilize the markets and  to work toward a bipartisan agreement that would keep premiums down for  millions of Americans. Senators Alexander and Murray have been  negotiating a package that would include cost-sharing as well as some  provisions that the Republicans want. These negotiations began long  before the President's decision to end cost-sharing last week. I am  encouraged by the progress of the negotiations, and I am hopeful that  we are nearing an agreement that makes clear that we have no intention  of supporting the President's reckless efforts at sabotage.   If President Trump is now supportive of an agreement that stabilizes  and improves the existing system under the Affordable Care Act, we  certainly welcome the change of heart. We have been asking for this for  a long time. We hope that our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, in their realizing the damage the President has done, will join  us in strengthening, not in sabotaging, the healthcare system.
