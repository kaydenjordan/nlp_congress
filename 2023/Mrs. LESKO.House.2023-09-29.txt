 Mr. Speaker, I am in support of funding the government so  our military, Border Patrol officers, and other dedicated employees  that are protecting our Nation can continue with their job and get paid  while they are doing it.   I am also in support of House Republicans pushing and demanding that  the Senate secure our border by including the bill that we have already  passed out of this House, H.R. 2.   One of the biggest crises in our Nation right now is a result of this  administration's disastrous border policies.   President Biden's policies have allowed 233,000 border crossings in  just August of this year compared to 50,000 just 3 years ago under  President Trump.   Biden has invited 211,000 additional migrants to fly directly into  the United States from their home foreign country.   Biden has accepted 263,000 additional more migrants to apply for  asylum via his new CBP One app.   Biden has allowed 151 migrants to enter our country that are on the  terrorist watch list--and that is just who we have caught.   Biden has allowed migrant women and children to get raped by cartels.  His policies have allowed young migrant children to be sold into sex  slavery. His policies have allowed fentanyl to flood our border and  kill our citizens.    This has got to stop, and Republicans are here to stop it and protect  our Nation.   House Republicans have already passed a bill to secure our border  that is now sitting over in the Senate waiting to be heard. Schumer  won't even bring it up for a vote.   It is time for the Democrat-controlled Senate to pass our border  security bill. It is time for the insanity at our southern border to  end. It is time to pass this bill and pressure the Democrats in the  Senate to secure the border.
