 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work when it comes to water in California.   Mr. Chairman, water is not optional, not in my district, not in  California, not anywhere. But over the past 5 years, my constituents  have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a  catastrophic drought.   This past winter, heavy rains and snowfall have brought much-needed  relief. In fact, there was so much water this past winter we ran out of  room to store it.   But we cannot always expect a year to bring monsoon-level rains and  record snow. What happens if next year's rain and snowfall is average,  or below average, or we have another drought? The Federal and State  regulations that keep us from pumping and storing water will come back  to haunt us.   The water bill passed by this body and signed into law last year was  a downpayment on California's future. Today's legislation is another  major investment in our State's future.   So let's look at pumping. There is no reason--absolutely no reason-- we should prioritize potential benefit to fish over real benefits to  families. This legislation increases delta pumping and will bring  immediate relief to two-thirds of California south of the delta.    But a long-term solution demands more pumping. While California's  population has doubled since the 1970s, we  [[Page H5510]]  haven't completed a single major storage project in that time.   Now, that is worth restating. While California's population has  doubled since the 1970s, we have not completed a single major storage  project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future  if we depend on inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years ago?   Currently, five reservoir projects have been stalled in regulatory  and red tape for decades. If these reservoirs alone are built, we could  store between 1 to 1.5 million acre-feet of additional water in our  State. So we need to build more storage as soon as possible.   Last year's water bill jumpstarted the process for building new  reservoirs in California and the West. It was a bipartisan bill, with  the vote being hundreds of votes out of the House, more than 70 in the  Senate.   Today's legislation builds on that by requiring the Federal  Government to finally finish the feasibility studies for the five  storage projects in California. Then we reform the permitting process  so other projects aren't held up for years trying to get approval from  a dozen different agencies.   So I want to thank Congressman David Valadao for his hard work, his  persistence on this issue. Ultimately, American citizens haven't gotten  the water they need because their government was failing them. Last  year's bill was the start to change all that. Today, we take another  major step to bring our communities the water they contract and pay  for.                                time  1730    Now, Mr. Chairman, you are going to hear a lot of people on this side  of the aisle talk about the need from California. Unfortunately, on the  other side of the aisle, it looks like you will just hear from one.  That should show you the need and desire of why this bill is so  important.
