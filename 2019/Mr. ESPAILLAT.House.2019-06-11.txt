 Mr. Speaker, I have seen with my very own eyes the way  migrants at the southern border, particularly children, are treated  under U.S. custody. It is so appalling, we would not ever accept one of  our own children being treated in such conditions in any country across  the world. Young toddlers go days without proper hygiene, nutrition, or  medical treatment.   These awful conditions have led to the deaths of minors at the hands  of our government, like Felipe Gomez Alonzo, who was just 8 years old.   If this administration's plan is to mistreat refugees to prevent them  from coming here, it clearly is not working. Just think, if they would  rather risk this treatment than remain in their home countries, how bad  must it be there?   America is better than this. We must treat immigrants better than  this. We must treat refugees better than this. We must treat children  better than this.   Mr. Speaker, the whole world is watching.                            ____________________
