 Mr. President, four words are inscribed in the stone  above the U.S. Supreme Court: ``Equal Justice Under Law''--``Equal  Justice Under Law.'' In many ways, the story of America has been about  making those words true for all Americans. Sometimes we take bold steps  forward. Other times, unfortunately, we take disturbing steps backward.   We all know that when the Constitution was written, there was not  equal justice under law. That is pretty obvious. So many people were  excluded from voting and other rights. But we have tried to move  forward, and that is one of the beautiful things about America. We keep  moving forward. We push.   But, unfortunately, today America finds itself in one of those  frightening moments of regression--of regression. A few months ago,  tens of millions of women saw their fundamental right to choose taken  away before their very eyes. Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion,  suggested that other rights, like the freedom to marry protected in  Obergefell might come next.   The mere thought should make us sick to our stomachs. The Senate has  a responsibility now to act. Because of this threat, the Senate will  hold a vote on the Respect for Marriage Act in the coming weeks so that  no American is discriminated against because of whom they love.   My colleagues Senators Baldwin and Sinema and others have worked for  months to build bipartisan support for this legislation. I applaud them  for their efforts. I hope that we will get at least 10 Republicans to  join us to pass marriage equality through the Senate. If the Respect  for Marriage Act can win significant Republican support in the House,  there is no legitimate reason for Republicans in this Chamber to stand  in the way.   Over the past few weeks, we have heard many on the other side say:  Well, this vote isn't necessary.  [[Page S4498]]    They say marriage equality is not something Americans spend a lot of  time thinking about anymore. They want us to believe that the Supreme  Court would never do something as reckless as reversing the precedent  of marriage equality that millions have relied on for years.   Well, where oh where have we heard that before? The very same people  who suggested that Roe was established precedent now want us to think  that the Supreme Court won't go further, even though a sitting Justice  on the highest Court in the land openly said something to the contrary,  and he is often joined by four others.   Lest we forget, marriage equality was not the law of the land a  decade ago. Discrimination against LGBTQ Americans still continues to  this day. Now MAGA Republicans have escalated their rhetoric against  same sex marriage and want to normalize gender discrimination.   MAGA Republicans seem to make it their business to pick on certain  groups, not to do things that are positive and move things forward but  to sort of just point their fingers at someone and blame them for some  abstract reason that really doesn't hurt them at all.   That is where this Republican Party--unfortunately, too many of  them--are headed, led by these MAGA Republicans and often fomented by  former President Trump.   Earlier this year--here is what I am talking about. This isn't pie in  the sky. The Texas Republican GOP, earlier this year, even adopted a  party platform. This is of the largest Republican State in the country,  the one with the most congressional representatives. The Texas GOP  adopted this year a party platform that said ``homosexuality is an  abnormal lifestyle choice.''   Let me repeat that. The largest Republican State in the country, its  Republican Party, captured by MAGA fervor--absurd fervor--said  ``homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle choice.''   Just yesterday, a judge said that employers can deny access to  medication if they believe it would encourage homosexuality. And we all  know that these MAGA Republicans and their ilk, led by this man named  Leonard Leo, with billions of dollars of dark money, use the courts to  move America backward--move the courts to move America backward. And  that is what happened yesterday with this judge coming up with this  absurd, obnoxious, despicable resolution.   I trust that that radical view of that judge and of that Texas GOP is  not something many of us embrace here in this Chamber. But we can't act  as if our fundamental rights will stay safe if we aren't willing to  safeguard them through legislation. If we are going to let these MAGA  judges--rightwing, appointed by Leonard Leo and the Federalist  Society--if we are not going to let them move America backward, then we  have an obligation to act.   So let me make clear that a vote on marriage equality will happen on  the Senate floor in the coming weeks, and I hope there will be at least  10 Republicans to support it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the related subject, obviously, of  judges, today the Senate will continue fulfilling its constitutional  duty to confirm more judges to sit on our Federal judiciary.   It has really been a productive week here on the floor when it comes  to judges. Yesterday, we confirmed John Lee to serve a lifetime  appointment as circuit judge on the Seventh Circuit, the first Asian  American to ever sit on that court.   Today, we will confirm another circuit judge--Andre Mathis--to sit on  the Sixth Circuit. When confirmed, Mathis will be the 78th judge we  have confirmed under President Biden--more than President Trump, more  than President Obama, more than President Bush had confirmed up to this  point. It is a great record. We are proud of it, and we aren't done.   Later this afternoon, we will begin working on our third--our third-- circuit court judge of the week, Salvador Mendoza, to sit on the Ninth  Circuit. After we vote on cloture today, Members should expect to vote  on his confirmation as early as the beginning of next week. Moving  forward, it will be one of our top priorities to confirm as many judges  as possible. It is one of the best things we can do with our time here  on the floor, especially given how many MAGA-type judges President  Trump and the Republican majority appointed.   The lion's share of legal disputes never make it to the Supreme  Court, giving those who preside in the lower courts immense power to  affect the lives of the American people. And, of course, when they get  it wrong--as they have all too frequently recently--the results can be  disastrous.   Just yesterday, a hard-right judge in Texas, as I mentioned, stripped  away Americans' rights to access preventive care. Over 150 million  Americans could now be at risk of losing everything from breast cancer  screenings to cholesterol screenings, free vaccinations, mental health  assessments, and so much more. Add that to the previous case I  mentioned before, and you can see that judges are out of control, far  away from what most Americans want, foisted upon us by the Republican  Senate majority, President Trump, and a small band of rightwing, MAGA  billionaires.   In the long run, this decision could mean more people get sick or die  needlessly simply because they can't afford preventive care to stay  healthy. That is the kind of thing that is at stake when it comes to  judges.   It is a frightening reminder of the difference between our side and  the hard right, the MAGA hard right, the extreme MAGA hard right.  Whether through judges or legislation, the hard right remains  obsessed--obsessed--with stripping away people's rights to affordable  healthcare. It is dangerous. It is malicious. It is wildly out of step  with the American people.   Democrats want something different. We want to protect people's  healthcare, not destroy it. We want judges who will preserve long- established precedent, not obliterate it, who will move us forward on  our fight to equality, not take steps backward. And in the coming weeks  and months, we will maintain a laser-like focus on confirming judges  who will do the kinds of things that we believe must be done in  America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S4509]]     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 1033.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, September 8, be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today, we take a solemn and somber pause.  A few minutes ago, we learned the sad news of the passing of Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the longest reigning Monarch in British  history. I join with Leader McConnell, with my Senate colleagues, and  with all Americans to offer deepest sympathies and prayers to the royal  family and to the people of the United Kingdom.   I never had the honor of meeting Her Majesty the Queen myself, but I  admired much about her until the very end. It is hard to fathom that  today we have to say goodbye because, after all, most Americans--to say  nothing of the British people--have never lived in a world without Her  Majesty the Queen.   It is a marvel to think that in the same year of Her Majesty's  coronation, Harry Truman was in the White House. The world was still  coming out of the shadow of the Second World War, entering a bold,  uncertain, unchartered future.   In her time, she came to know 15 different Prime Ministers, 14 U.S.  Presidents, traveled to well over 100 countries, and made over 200  official state visits. She was the first British Monarch ever to  address a joint session of Congress. And thanks to her, the special  relationship between the United States and the UK gained even more  special significance.   Her reign saw the dawn of the atomic age, the age of the internet,  the fall of the Soviet Union, an unprecedented global pandemic. She  didn't just witness the great turns of history; she helped shape them  over the seven decades--seven decades--of her reign. And every step of  the way, she was precisely the kind of leader the moment demanded.   In times of hardship, she was both strong and comforting. In times of  joy, she was gracious and dignified. She was a rock, the living  embodiment of the virtues that lie at the core of the nation she so  proudly led. I dare say we will never see a leader quite like her for  as long as we live.   So, today, we join the people of the UK and the royal family in  mourning the loss of Her Majesty the Queen. May she rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Mendoza nomination be considered expired; that  the Senate  [[Page S4510]]  vote on the confirmation of the nomination at 5:30 p.m. on Monday,  September 12; and that following the disposition of the Mendoza  nomination, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  Freeman nomination.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. on Monday,  September 12; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Montecalvo nomination; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed during Monday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator McConnell.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
