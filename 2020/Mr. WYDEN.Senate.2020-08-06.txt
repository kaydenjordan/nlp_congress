 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senate  Republicans have spent much of this week offering this idea of a 1-week  extension of the $600 unemployment insurance supplement. They have done  this as an alternative to spending the week doing real negotiating,  which is what I and many Senate Democrats have been calling for, for  not just days but weeks and weeks--literally, months--as we called for  an advanced proposal.   In my view, the only thing worse than what the Republicans have done,  cutting off desperately needed unemployment insurance to millions of  families and communities, would be to allow a bill to pass that  promises money without actually delivering it. That is snake oil, and I  am going to be very specific in describing why that is the case.   Even if this short-term extension were to pass, experts and State  agencies have said in very clear terms that States don't have enough  time to reprogram their systems and avoid a lapse in benefits. A lot of  them just have, as my colleague from Ohio knows--I was talking about it  for days in the Finance Committee room--that these State unemployment  systems are not equipped to switch the benefits on and off. These  short-term extensions won't work and don't work administratively.   Nobody following this debate has to take my word for it. That is what  the National Association of State Workforce Agencies have said.   I think there was a comment about, well, this is an image problem. It  is a problem of the national media. Well, I would say, colleagues, the  national media has been repeating what I just said, which are the exact  views of people who aren't Democrats or Republicans, they are the  administrators of this crucial program.   A short-term extension isn't enough for the hard-working Americans  relying on this lifeline who don't have jobs to go back to. What about  next week and the week after? There is going to be promises for week  after week that also can't get the money to people so they can make  rent and buy groceries.   The only responsible route is to agree to the extension that really  looks to economic conditions, ties these benefits to economic  conditions and then lower the payments only when it is appropriate to  do so, and that means when the economy is in recovery, not when it is  facing the kind of dramatic contraction that we all were so concerned  about last week.   To me, this is all part of an effort to deflect the fact that when  I--and I am just going to talk about myself specifically--but Senator  Schumer, the Speaker sent letter after letter calling for negotiations  because everybody knew there was a cliff. I said it repeatedly. I said:  Don't go home, Leader McConnell. Stay here. This cliff is coming, end  of July, last weekend, when people got the checks.   So there was a comment about unemployed folks being pushed off the  cliff. Well, I am here to tell you, it was Senate Republicans by their  inaction who pushed those workers off the cliff.   Now, what is needed is a long-term solution that ensures the extra  $600 remains available for as long as this devastating crisis  continues.   I heard my colleagues talk about workers. A lot of workers who were  laid off once and then brought back have been laid off again. That is  really representative of the challenge.   I also want to mention, as we talk about ideas--I heard my colleagues  talk about it--another big snake oil idea coming out of the White House  that somehow an Executive order is going to accomplish all of this. We  hear the words ``Executive order.'' That sounds like it is going to be  fast. Man, that sounds good. Executive order; let's move fast. In  actuality, it would throw the States in chaos. It would be tied up in  the courts. It would slow everything down, just like each of the Senate  Republican legislative proposals so far. For example, they all still  try to drive the idea of wage replacement. We have seen problems with  getting the amount out initially, the $600. Wait until you see what  happens with the Republican wage proposals.   There is a path here, and that is to negotiate in good faith. My  Republican colleagues have been stalling on negotiating in good faith  because they thought somehow--and I find this a real head-scratcher-- they could win a war of words by insulting the American worker and  claiming that they are kind of lazy, that they don't want to work and  the like.   I will tell you, on the Finance Committee, I hear continually from my  friend from Ohio who talks about the superior work ethic of Ohioans.  Now he is out here talking about how everybody is not willing to work  and unemployment benefits are causing folks to stay home rather than  work because they are too generous. I think that is just a bunch of  hogwash. I believe Americans believe deeply in the dignity of work.   We just had a nationwide townhall meeting about the unemployment  issue, and people were saying: I can't believe they are calling us lazy  and saying we don't want to work. I get a job offer on Monday night,  and I will be up there at the crack of dawn on Tuesday.   That is what workers are saying. So this idea that they are staying  home because they don't want to work--besides, it is a violation of the  rules of the program as well--I think is just hogwash.   I would also like to put into the Record right now the latest  assessment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics about what is really  going on out here, because the issue is not workers being lazy; the  issue is scarcity of jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics--again, not a  political operation--has reported that there are four unemployed  Americans for every job out there. Let me repeat that. Not politicians.  Not anecdotes. Not somebody who said something to somebody else. Those  are the facts, colleagues. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that  there are four unemployed Americans for every job out there.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Bureau of  Labor Statistics analysis showing the paucity of jobs   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYED PERSONS PER JOB OPENING, SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics.     I will just say that I am stunned that colleagues are  saying that American workers are out trying to scam the system and  really don't want to work and all of these things that I think suggest  a very different picture than what I hear from workers and, by the way,  what I hear from my friend from Ohio when he is in the Finance  Committee.   I have a final point. The Republicans knew the cliff was coming in  May when the House passed the Heroes Act. They knew the cliff was  coming in June. I am just going to walk this through because I heard:  Oh my goodness, all of the Democrats are involved in pushing workers  off the cliff.   The Republicans knew the cliff was coming in May. That is when the  House passed their bill. They knew the cliff was coming a few weeks  after that when Senator Schumer and I introduced and tried to get  passed a piece of legislation that was really based, I say to my friend  from Ohio--and something I heard our friend from South Dakota, Senator  Thune, talk about--Senator Thune said: You know, I get it. When folks  are hurting, the benefits have to be used to pay the rent and buy  groceries. But when unemployment goes down, the benefit should taper  down.   That is essentially what the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, and  I offered--to tie unemployment insurance to the realities of what is on  the ground in the American economy.   Republicans knew the cliff was coming in May. They knew a few weeks  later that Senator Schumer and I tried to actually pass a bill that, as  I developed it and brought it to our leadership and showed it to  colleagues, was really to a great extent sparked by what our friend  from South Dakota, a Member of the Republican leadership, said: Well,  let's kind of recognize that when the economy gets better, the benefit  tapers off.   Republicans knew the cliff was coming in July when again Leader  Schumer and I tried to provide certainty for American families and  communities by passing our bill. Did they come to the table with  earnest proposals?   Senate Republicans have spent the week on this idea of a 1-week  extension, which the people who run the programs--the people who are  the most knowledgeable, who don't have election certificates, who are  experts in the field--are saying would not deliver to the people who  are desperate to buy groceries and pay rent. It would not deliver the  funds they so desperately need for quite some time.   These proposals are not serious. They are political theater.   The cliff is here. As Americans families fall over it, I am just  stunned that we are hearing Republicans say: You know, it is OK to  offer these proposals.   I have seen a number in elevators, leaving town. I am going to be  here. I am going to be here because I think when workers are hurting  and they can't make rent and they can't pay groceries, you stay at it.   The Senator from Ohio knows that is how we got to $600, because when  Secretary Scalia folded his arms and said he couldn't really do  anything that would present a real benefit, we spent 3 days--3 long  days--and we said on our side: You are not going to stiff the workers,  and we will just average the benefit. Some would get more, some would  get less, but we would give everybody in America who, through no fault  of their own, has been laid off a chance to pay the rent, buy  groceries, and at the same time keep the economy afloat.   For all of those reasons, and especially reflecting my disappointment  that after--and I just walked everybody through it--one effort to go  and negotiate; a couple of weeks later, another effort; then in July,  another effort. But nothing happened. In fact, I stood right where I  am, as benefits were about to expire, and I said: How can the  Republican leader basically say we are going home? When they asked him  about moving anything to really meet the needs of the workers, the  press reported--everybody was quoting the press--that the Republican  leader laughed.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, excuse me. I object.    Mr. President, Senator Stabenow said some time ago that  this is not just another Thursday. She and my eloquent colleagues,  Senator Coons and Senator Hassan, who has just left the floor, have  shown how painfully true Senator Stabenow's statement is about letting  this not be just another Thursday here in the Senate.   With Republican colleagues headed home for the weekend, perhaps for  weeks, I want to take stock for a moment of all of the very crises the  country faces while American families and communities don't have the  luxury of a weekend. There is the COVID crisis, which Senator Stabenow  and Senator Coons just talked about, with more than 50,000 newly  confirmed cases and 1,000 or more deaths a day with a total of 4\1/2\  million cases in our country to date.   There is the joblessness crisis. Enhanced unemployment benefits have  expired. Tens of millions of Americans are out of work, with millions  walking on economic tightropes.   My colleagues are reading the letters. This is not based on some  kinds of media reports. They are reading directly from what their  constituents are saying, and I want to make sure everybody knows this,  having listened now for days to our colleagues saying that the big  problem is that somehow the American worker doesn't actually want to  work. Senator Stabenow and I have heard that repeatedly in the Finance  Committee room. I think it is insulting to the American worker.  [[Page S5257]]    We had a nationwide townhall sponsored by the Town Hall Project on  unemployment issues recently, and people would say things such as this:  If I heard about a job on Monday night, I would be there at the crack  of dawn on Tuesday morning to get that position.   So, as we take stock of these crises, the COVID crisis, the  joblessness crisis, I think what we ought to do is add the crisis of  legislative malpractice that we are seeing with this Senate Republican  walkout today, heading home instead of working, as Senator Coons has  said, in a bipartisan way to get the coronavirus rescue bill.   I have not seen anything like this in my time in public service: The  biggest public health disaster in over a century, the worst level of  unemployment since the Depression, an economy that barely holds on, and  tomorrow's jobs report will almost certainly show that any hope for a  V-shaped recovery that Donald Trump talked about is long gone.   Republicans delayed and sat on their hands for months. I think the  Presiding Officer heard me walk everybody through the calendar, how  weeks passed, months passed. We made offer after offer for negotiation.  Senator Schumer and I developed a proposal that to a great extent was  based on some of the thinking of Senator Thune.   I always think of my friend from Delaware, who is the champion of  bipartisanship. That proposal was based on Senator Coon's--excuse me,  Senator Thune's thought that, you know, if unemployment is high, people  need a benefit so they can make the rent and pay for groceries. Then  Senator Thune said: But, you know, when unemployment goes down, the  benefits should reflect that as well. He said that.   So Senator Schumer and I wrote the unemployment insurance bill to  reflect that. The unemployment benefits would be tied to economic  conditions on the ground.   Yet what we have seen is that somehow Senate Republicans can now  leave in good conscience for the weekend, possibly the August recess,  when the Senate hasn't passed a bill to help all of those Americans who  are sick and jobless.   Our job is to legislate on the big issues, not to run home and  campaign. Our job is to sit down, negotiate, and find solutions. Mitch  McConnell, on the basis of this morning's newspaper, doesn't seem to  even show up at the negotiating table.   Now, as I mentioned, we have been warning for days and weeks and  months that enhanced unemployment benefits were going to expire at the  end of July. Republicans sat on their hands.   Earlier, we heard Senate Republicans talk about how they had a 1-week  proposal which, of course, wouldn't--based on the unemployment  experts--get any real help to people who need that money for rent and  groceries anytime soon. The Senate Republicans said: You know, workers  are going over the cliff.   Well, the fact that Republicans have sat this debate out is what  pushed those workers over the cliff--pushed them over the cliff--as we  warned week after week after week that the economy was cratering and  permanent layoffs are increasing.   Senator Merkley has joined us. We hear all the time at home and in  the Pacific Northwest about people who got laid off once, things seemed  to be getting better, they got brought back, and they were laid off  again. So it seems--when Senator Stabenow points out that this is not  just another Thursday in the Senate--that the economy is headed in the  wrong direction.   I am just going to spend a couple of minutes, as we talk about this  issue of how things are definitely not right here on this Thursday in  the Senate, on the question of what would it take for Senate  Republicans to get serious about working with us on a coronavirus bill  now? How bad would it have to get? One-quarter of a million Americans'  lives lost? Half a million? How many jobless? 40 million? 50 million?  Does the economy need to contract even more than it did in the second  quarter before Senate Republicans say they are going to work with  Democrats to help the economy and help the Congress?   Back in March, there was a basic deal between the American people and  the government to try to make sure that there was an effort to try to  provide help for people as the pandemic took hold in this country.  Senator Stabenow and I were sort of the point people as it related to  the big issues in the Finance Committee. Senator Stabenow, doing her  usually terrific job on the big health issues, and I spent days and  days hearing essentially from the Labor Secretary, Secretary Scalia,  about how he really wasn't going to push hard for much of anything  except business as usual. But after that difficult period that went on  for days and days in the Finance Committee, we actually got the $600  extra per week, each week, and modernized the unemployment program. As  Senator Stabenow knows, back when the program began in the 1930s,  nobody knew about a gig worker or the self-employed, or the independent  contractor, or freelancers, and the like. There was a sense that we  would be working on unemployment for a long time, particularly the way  it was administered, because the States have these kinds of bronze-age  technologies. One of the frustrating parts of this period is that even  though millions and millions of Americans have gotten those extra  benefits, that is really cold comfort to the many people who haven't  been able to get through the system and who haven't been able, call  after call after call, to get their claim resolved. Yet there was the  beginning, based on that vote, of a strategy to help people get through  the economic hardship.   Right now, the Trump administration and Republicans in the Congress  are breaking that deal. The virus is out of control, spiking in so many  States. The key economic lifeline for jobless Americans is getting  yanked away. It is just unconscionable.   And, now, just in the last few hours, there is talk that Donald Trump  is looking at possibly tomorrow, Senator Stabenow, tearing up the  Constitution and ordering a cut in the Social Security and Medicare tax  on his own. This will not give a dime to the millions of families who  have lost jobs during the pandemic but will put thousands of dollars in  the pockets of every lawyer and wheeler-dealer who can pay themselves a  salary while sitting at home.   What really concerns us--and I have been involved in these issues  since my Gray Panthers days--is one thing that Donald Trump is talking  about, Senator Stabenow, and that is draining the Social Security trust  fund and bringing closer the day when Social Security benefits will be  cut. So for all of those people who are, say, in their late fifties,  and they have worked so hard and done difficult labor year after year  after year just hoping--hoping--to be able to get Social Security, now  Donald Trump is talking about draining the Social Security trust fund,  cutting the Social Security and Medicare tax on his own. It sure seems  like he has a monopoly on bad ideas.   He is also talking about some kind of Executive order on enhanced  unemployment benefits, which he actually doesn't have the authority to  issue--one more Donald Trump ``con'' oil, an additional bit of snake  oil.   With respect to the unemployment issue and his idea of an Executive  order, what he would do there is throw State workforce agencies into  chaos. As we talked about, so many States have faced real challenges in  getting benefits out to all the deserving Americans.   We have been trying, on the Finance Committee. Senator Stabenow has  been a big champion of improving technology. We got $1 billion for the  State agencies. We are trying to get more. Donald Trump's proposal  would just end up hurting the jobless Americans counting on benefits  even more. If Donald Trump were serious about extending enhanced  unemployment coverage, he would be working with Democrats on extending  the benefits instead of fighting them.   I am going to close with this, and it is a response to something I  have heard from many of my Republican colleagues who seem to have  recovered their sense of fiscal conservatism that disappeared when  Donald Trump was inaugurated. I heard some of them say that passing  another COVID bill would amount to sacrificing our children's futures.   Here is what is worse for American children: growing up at a time  when their parents can't find good-paying jobs because of double-digit  unemployment, getting evicted from their homes  [[Page S5258]]  in the middle of a pandemic and becoming homeless, having to skip meals  because their family can't afford enough food each month, going to  school in a district that laid off teachers and staff due to the  coronavirus recession, which means packing too many kids into  classrooms, which can be dangerous.   Let's forget about all of that same old Republican deficit talk. It  is the same old routine from a decade ago and a decade before that and  a decade before that. The Republican deficit talk was nowhere to be  found when they passed--over the opposition of Democrats on the Finance  Committee--a $2 trillion tax handout overwhelmingly benefiting  multinational corporations and the wealthy.   Americans struggle with the pandemic and the joblessness crisis right  now. The Senate needs to deal with it right now.   As Senator Stabenow said--she eloquently launched this important  discussion, and I know my friend from Oregon is here to be part of it-- it is certainly not another Thursday in the Senate, not another garden- variety, end of the week when you have enhanced unemployment benefits  expiring, and 160,000 Americans dying. It is unthinkable--unthinkable-- that anybody could be going home when there are so many challenges  right in front of us.   I hope the majority leader, Senator McConnell, and my Republican  colleagues understand the power of what Senator Stabenow has basically  outlined, because there are times on a Thursday afternoon in the Senate  where I think you could say you wouldn't have the kinds of challenges  we are talking about. This is not one of them. This is one where, on  issue after issue, there are crises: the COVID crisis, the joblessness  crisis, and now we have a legislative malpractice crisis by Senator  McConnell leading his Senators.   I urge him to come back, work with us, bring about the negotiations  we need, as I said again and again, on unemployment.   I am not going anywhere--not anywhere. This is one of the most  important causes I have ever had the opportunity to be a part of. Even  with all of the challenges with unemployment, I can only imagine,  Senator Stabenow, how much more hurt there would be in America without  those millions of people getting the money for groceries and rent and  paying medical bills and car insurance and keeping the lights on.   We need the majority leader and Republican colleagues in the U.S.  Senate to work with us. There is no time to waste. They ought to be  recognizing the power of what Senators have said here today. That  negotiating needs to take place now rather than having yet another  break for Senators to pursue other kinds of matters   I thank my colleagues.   I yield the floor.
