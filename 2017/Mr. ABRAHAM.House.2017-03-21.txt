 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a practicing physician who  believes that we must repeal the disaster that ObamaCare has brought us  and return to a patient-centered system.   My patients have dealt with skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable  deductibles, and a formulary so restrictive it is an insult to call it  a real treatment.   Medicaid expansion is no better and gives only the illusion of sound  coverage. These patients can't find doctors. They can't find  specialists who will see them, which results in more hospital  admissions, more unnecessary hospital referrals, more expensive trips  to the emergency room, and higher costs to the program and to the  taxpayers.   There is nothing compassionate about cramming more people into a  failed system just so politicians can score political points. All they  have done is force a second-class insurance onto first-class people.   All Americans deserve better than ObamaCare. We can provide a better  healthcare delivery system for them where everyone has access to  affordable care, and it starts with the passage of the American Health  Care Act.                            ____________________
