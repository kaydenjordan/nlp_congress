 Madam Speaker, a few weeks ago, 28 young, impressive  women shared their talents in the Miss New Jersey competition. The  competition has been around for almost 100 years and since that time  has evolved into a fantastic celebration of some of the best young  individuals in south Jersey.   The Miss New Jersey competition was the first to offer a talent  category, and this past year the competition focused even more on  aptitude and intellect over outward appearance. This year the  candidates were able to emphasize their individual styles and their  individual passions, and all of the young women spoke about different  social impact initiatives that mattered greatly to them.   One of my wonderful spring interns, Alyssa Rodriguez, placed in the  top 11 with her platform of social media awareness. She made south  Jersey so very proud. Miss Jade Glab of Belmar, New Jersey, was crowned  Miss New Jersey with her platform of healthy children, strong America.   We are proud of all the contestants and the intellect and the  compassion they bring to all of their communities, and I am most proud  of our contestants from south Jersey.                            ____________________
