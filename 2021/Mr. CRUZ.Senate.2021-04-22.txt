 Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1456,  which I have introduced, along with Senator Kennedy from Louisiana.                             Additional Cosponsor    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagerty also be  added as a cosponsor to the amendment.    Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. It  targets the ongoing discrimination that is being directed against Asian  Americans by colleges and universities across the country, including  preeminent institutions such as Yale and Harvard, which are denying  admission to qualified Asian-American applicants in favor of  underrepresented minority groups. The U.S. Department of Justice was  suing Yale for its discrimination against Asian Americans until the  Biden administration dismissed that lawsuit.   My amendment, simply put, would prohibit institutions of higher  education from receiving any Federal funding if they have a policy or  if they engage in discrimination against Asian Americans during the  recruitment review of applications or admissions.   I urge the adoption of the amendment.   I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kennedy.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Senator Lee's  amendment No. 1425.   Despite the protections of the First Amendment, over the course of  the pandemic, many States have placed heavy-handed restrictions that  have limited Americans' freedom to gather for worship, to meet in  smaller groups for religious purposes, or even to sing praise and  worship.   At first, many Americans accepted these restrictions. Our Nation was  grappling with the new and deadly virus, and the restrictions were only  supposed to be temporary. But as the weeks and months dragged on,  States lifted restrictions on restaurants, on casinos, on museums,  while keeping tight restrictions in place for synagogues, for churches,  for temples, for mosques, and other religious gatherings.   Senator Lee's amendment requires the Department of Justice to  investigate whether the government applied the same rules to religious  groups that were applied to similar nonreligious organizations and  businesses and whether those restrictions complied with the First  Amendment.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lee's written  remarks on his amendment be inserted into the Record.    I urge adoption of the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
