 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her leadership,  and the ranking member, also.   Mr. Speaker, today we honor our fallen servicemembers to award them  with this Congressional Gold Medal. I am proud to be a cosponsor of  this legislation, H.R. 5142.   On August 26 at 9:44 a.m., an explosion from a suicide terrorist  bombing in Afghanistan killed 13 of our servicemembers. One of those  servicemembers was my constituent, Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza  from Rio Bravo.   He was born in Laredo and graduated from the city's Lyndon B. Johnson  High School in 2019. His mother, Elizabeth Holguin, and his father,  Victor Dominguez, and his brothers and sister, Angel, Victor, and  Delilah, mourn his loss and are endlessly proud of David and his  service.   When we attended David's funeral in Laredo, we all knew that families  across the United States also mourned their loved ones. David joined  the Marine Corps with the intention of protecting our Nation and  demonstrating his selfless acts of service to his country. He embodied  the American values of grit, dedication, service, and valor.   May Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza and our fallen servicemembers  forever be honored and never be forgotten.
