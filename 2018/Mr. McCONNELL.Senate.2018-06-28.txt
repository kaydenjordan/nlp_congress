 Mr. President, I want to take another opportunity to  pay tribute to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced yesterday that he  will retire from active service and assume senior status at the end of  July.   Justice Kennedy deserves our sincere thanks for his service and our  congratulations on a truly remarkable career. He served our Nation on  the Federal Bench for 43 years, 30 of which he spent as an Associate  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   His contributions to American jurisprudence have been many. In  particular, he has earned our gratitude for his steadfast defense of  the vital First Amendment right to political speech.   We congratulate Justice Kennedy, his wife Mary, and their entire  family on this well-earned retirement. We wish them every happiness  during the additional time they will get to spend together in the years  ahead.                  Filling the Upcoming Supreme Court Vacancy    As I stated yesterday, the Senate stands ready to fulfill our  constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump's  nominee to fill the vacancy that Justice Kennedy's retirement will  create. The Senate will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy's successor  this fall.   This is not 2016. There aren't the final months of a second-term,  constitutionally lame duck Presidency with a Presidential election fast  approaching. We are right in the middle of this President's very first  term.   To my knowledge, nobody on either side has either suggested before  yesterday that the Senate should process Supreme Court nominations only  in odd-numbered years. The situation today is much like when Justice  Kagan was confirmed in 2010 and when Justice Breyer was confirmed in  1994 and Justice Souter in 1990. In each case, the President was about  a year and a half into his first term.   So just as on numerous other occasions, the process to confirm  Justice Kennedy's successor will take place this year. As in the case  of Justice Gorsuch, Senators will have the opportunity to meet with  President Trump's nominee, examine his or her qualifications, and  debate the nomination. I am confident Chairman Grassley will capably  lead the Judiciary Committee  [[Page S4690]]  through the confirmation process that lies before us.   The President's nominee should be considered fairly and not subjected  to personal attacks. Unfortunately, far-left special interest groups  are already calling on Senate Democrats to oppose anyone--anyone--on  President Trump's long list of potential nominees. The ink wasn't even  dry on Justice Kennedy's resignation letter before my friend the  Democratic leader seemed to echo that right here on the floor--that  none of the exceptional legal minds on this list would be tolerable to  him.   Think of that. These are 25 Americans from all over the country who  have excelled in their professions. The idea that any of them--let  alone all of them--would be automatically unacceptable is totally  absurd.   Unfortunately, I am afraid this may just be a precursor of all the  unfair attacks to come, both from inside and outside the Senate.   Fortunately, we have every reason to expect an outstanding selection.  President Trump's judicial nominations to date have reflected a keen  understanding of the vital role judges play in our constitutional  order: interpreting the law fairly, applying it evenhandedly, setting  aside personal preferences, and assessing what the law actually says.  These traits have characterized the excellent nominees the President  has sent to the Senate. I look forward to another such nomination.   Mr. President, on another matter, we hope to wrap up our  consideration of the farm bill, a victory for American agriculture. All  week, I have highlighted some of the ways this important legislation  will support the family farmers whose harvest feeds America and  supplies the world.   It is an understatement to say this bill comes at an opportune time.  American farm communities need stability, and they need  predictability--and they need it urgently.   The industry is filled with uncertainty. There are volatile world  markets. There are persisting low commodity prices. There are natural  disasters beyond their control. All of these things make it harder for  our growers to go about their business. They depend on the kind of  long-term certainty that this legislation will provide.   This subject is extremely important to me, as the proud senior  Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky and as a Member who has  served on the Agriculture Committee since my first day in office.  Agriculture is in the bones of our State. It is a huge part of who we  are. From soybeans and corn to hay and tobacco, to poultry and  livestock, Kentucky agriculture encompasses a multibillion-dollar  industry that supports thousands and thousands of good jobs in nearly  every corner of the Commonwealth. Kentuckians know as well as anyone  just how important American agriculture is, and we understand as well  as anyone all of the unique challenges it faces.   That is why I am pleased to support this bill, which will bolster the  safety net programs for our producers. It will also enhance  infrastructure investment in rural communities on everything from local  water projects to broadband internet, to helping curb the drug epidemic  in rural America. And it gets Washington out of farmers' way in areas  where bureaucracy is holding them back.   One such area is industrial hemp. Consumers across America buy  hundreds of millions in retail products every year that contain hemp.  But due to outdated Federal regulations that do not sufficiently  distinguish this industrial crop from its illicit cousin, American  farmers have been mostly unable to meet that demand themselves. It has  left consumers with little choice but to buy imported hemp products  from foreign-produced hemp.   Fortunately, this farm bill will change that. It builds on the  success of the pilot program I initiated 5 years ago and will break  down the major Federal barriers that prevent American farmers from  fully exploring the burgeoning hemp market. When this becomes law-- subject to proper regulation and oversight--U.S. producers will no  longer be barred from this legitimate U.S. market.   I am also proud of how this farm bill has come about. The chairman  and ranking member, Senators Roberts and Stabenow, assembled it through  an exemplary bipartisan committee process that included 73 amendments.  Here on the floor, 18 more bipartisan amendments were adopted in the  substitute amendment. It was my personal hope that we could have had  even more amendment votes, but the Senate is a consent-based  institution, and Members have the ability to object. Nevertheless, the  transparent and open leadership of Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member  Stabenow has been commendable.   Now the time has come to deliver. The farm bill is too important a  subject to keep our farmers and their families waiting. After all, the  groups charged with advocating on their behalf overwhelmingly support  it. More than 500 industry groups and advocates representing  agriculture, food, nutrition, hunger, forestry, conservation, faith- based and research interests have already publicly backed the Senate  bill. Nearly 70 such groups had this to say in a recent letter to  Congress: ``During a prolonged recession in agriculture, failure to  pass a farm bill on time would undermine the financial security of  America's food, fuel, crop and fiber producers.''   The Senate must not fail that test. It is time to pass the farm bill.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, on another matter, it has been a little over 6 months  since this Republican Congress passed historic tax reform legislation.  Already, we have seen big headlines: millions of worker bonuses, plans  for thousands of new jobs, and billions of dollars being invested here  in the United States; individual companies announcing billions in new  American investments; small business optimism at its highest level  since President Reagan's first term.   But these national headlines don't tell the whole story on their own.  This week, I have discussed how tax reform is already transforming  American families' kitchen-table conversations: how lower rates and  larger deductions are letting them pocket more of their hard-earned  money and how our new corporate tax structure has already started  paving the way for higher wages.   If you pick up a local paper in almost any State, you will find yet  another angle to this story. From Montana to Florida, Americans are  paying less to keep the lights on. That is right. Despite warnings from  our Democratic colleagues that tax reform savings would never reach  consumers, utilities all across America are already making that happen.   In my home State of Kentucky, the new Tax Code led to announced rate  cuts of up to 6 percent for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas &  Electric customers.   Just this month, Idaho Power announced a 7-percent rate cut for  consumers.   In Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Edison is one of 17 utilities that is  planning to deliver rate savings, thanks to the new tax law. On July 1,  more than half a million customers in Philadelphia can expect their  electric bills to drop by as much as 8 percent.   Help with the monthly bills, higher take-home pay, and new job  opportunities because American enterprise is thriving are what tax  reform means around middle-class kitchen tables. This is why  Republicans passed this historic law.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 836.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.

Mr. President, I ask for a division vote on the  resolution of ratification.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar Nos. 951 through 973 and 975  through 993 and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in Air  Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy; that the nominations be confirmed;  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be  in order; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in  the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
