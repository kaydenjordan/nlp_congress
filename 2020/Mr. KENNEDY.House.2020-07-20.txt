 Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Congressman Panetta and  Congressman Hastings for their leadership and their work on this issue  in bringing this amendment to the floor.    When President Trump came into office, Mr. Speaker, he turned allies  into adversaries and autocrats into accomplices. He saw friendship and  loyalty as weakness and saw dictators as his new best friend. That has  led to American foreign policy that is now in shambles. It has rendered  American leadership meaningless in parts of the world and has left a  vacuum that continues to be exploited by nations like Russia and China.  It has torn treaties that reinforced global peace to shreds.   One of those, the Open Skies Treaty, has ingrained transparency and  accountability around the world. For nearly two decades, it has  strengthened peace across the United States, Europe, and Russia. Now  our President has tried to reduce the hard work of fostering that peace  to shambles. Even as he follows those dictators into unrest and  potential violence, we will not follow, and certainly no Americans  yearning for peace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect peace and to vote for  this amendment.
