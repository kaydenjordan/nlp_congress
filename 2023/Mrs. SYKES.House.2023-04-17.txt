 Madam Speaker, I was absent for today's vote so that I  could help find a path forward for my community following today's grand  jury decision to not indict Akron police officers involved in the fatal  shooting of Jayland Walker.   Had I been present, I would have voted yea on rollcall No. 183 and  yea on rollcall No. 184.                             personal explanation
