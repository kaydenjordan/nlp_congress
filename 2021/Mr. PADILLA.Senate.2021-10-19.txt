 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Prevent Release  of Toxics Emissions, Contamination, and Transfer Act. The PROTECT Act  would add certain PFAS chemicals to the list of hazardous air  pollutants under the Clean Air Act.   The Environmental Working Group recently identified nearly 30,000  potential industrial dischargers of PFAS into the air and water. Yet  there are currently no restrictions on industrial PFAS discharges under  the Clean Water Act or the Clean Air Act, leaving communities  vulnerable to the devastating impacts of PFAS pollution.   While it is well documented how toxic PFAS chemicals are prevalent in  the water supply, it is less well known that PFAS chemicals are also  emitted into the air.   This legislation would add PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and GenX to the list of  hazardous air pollutants regulated under section 112(b) of the Clean  Air Act. It would also direct the EPA to create a list of categories of  major sources and area sources that emit PFAS within 2 years and give  the EPA a 5-year deadline to finalize the subsequent regulations.   The EPA has acknowledged that ``air emissions of PFAS from industrial  sources is now recognized as a significant route for PFAS releases to  the environment and is evidenced by deposition as well as their  presence in rainwater.'' Yet PFAS air emissions aren't currently  regulated under the Clean Air Act or any other anti-pollution law.   Adding PFAS to the EPA's hazardous air pollutants list would build  upon work done by States to limit air emissions from industrial  facilities and greatly expand the number of facilities that would have  to adopt technology to reduce PFAS emissions.   I thank my colead Senator Shaheen for her tireless leadership  fighting PFAS contamination and protecting vulnerable communities and  Congresswoman Stevens for successfully shepherding this legislation  through the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the PROTECT Act  as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Prevent Release  of Toxics Emissions, Contamination, and Transfer Act.
