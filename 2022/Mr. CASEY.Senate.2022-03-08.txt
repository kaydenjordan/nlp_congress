 Madam President, I am here today for two purposes. I will  start with the first.   The first is to rise in support of advancing the nomination of  Elizabeth Watson to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Congressional  and Intergovernmental Affairs at the Department of Labor.   Ms. Watson is a highly qualified nominee who was nominated in April  of last year, almost a year ago now. She has spent most of her career  advocating for workers through labor and economic policy.   Ms. Watson previously served as labor policy director and chief labor  counsel on the House Committee on Education and Labor. Given her labor  expertise and commitment to public service, she would be an enormous  asset to the Department of Labor.   It is past due that the Senate confirm her nomination.   Ms. Watson is one of many excellent pro-worker nominees that have  been put forward by the Biden-Harris administration.   Working families and unions built the American middle class, and  working families and unions helped to make the Nation what it is  today--the strongest, most powerful nation in the world.   Every worker in America deserves to be paid a living wage and treated  with  [[Page S1049]]  dignity and respect. Over the past few decades, corporations have  worked to undermine and weaken workers' fundamental rights to organize  and collectively bargain. We should, for example, pass the PRO Act,  which would safeguard and strengthen workers' fundamental right to  organize and ensure that workers are able to decide whether or not to  join a union through a fair process.   It would help restore fairness to an economy that has been rigged  against workers for too long. We owe it to workers and families to  create an economy that works for them, not for corporate interests.  Pro-worker nominees, like Elizabeth Watson, will help us realize this  goal. The Senate should advance her nomination.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the following  nomination: Calendar No. 687, Elizabeth Schoff Watson, of Maryland, to  be an Assistant Secretary of Labor; that the nomination be confirmed  and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in the  Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Madam President, I rise this evening to share the urgent  need to pass a bipartisan bill, a piece of legislation we have been  working on for years now that will save the lives of children.   Every year, emergency rooms across the country treat over 22,000  preventable injuries--22,000 preventable injuries--caused by falling  furniture, like dressers or television sets. On average, roughly half-- half--of those injured are children, and of the vast majority of those  killed by furniture tip-overs, some 81 percent are children. Eighty-one  percent of all those killed by furniture tip-overs are children.   The death of a child is an unspeakable loss. There is no way to  calculate it, and if you haven't lived through it, I don't think any of  us can understand what some families have lived through. Yet in  America, the most powerful Nation on the Earth, in less than 20 years,  more than 460 children have been killed by these furniture tip-overs,  and that number is the reported fatality number.   Compounding the grief and loss that these families experience is the  fact that these deaths might have been prevented.   The answer here is pretty simple: mandatory stability standards that  would make our homes safer for our children. For years now, Senator  Klobuchar, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Cotton, and I have led a  bipartisan effort to pass the STURDY Act.   Here is what all of the letters in that acronym stand for: The Stop  Tip-overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth. We call it the STURDY  Act.   The STURDY Act would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission  to create a mandatory stability standard for furniture. That is all it  does. It would create a mandatory stability standard. It would require  companies to ensure their products are tested for safety and stability  before being sold. It is a simple, commonsense requirement that will  save the lives of children and prevent injuries.   Families in Pennsylvania and across the Nation have been waiting too  long for the Senate to act. There are families like the Lamberts and  the Collases who have experienced every parent's worst nightmare--the  loss of a child. These families have given my staff permission for me  to share their stories tonight on the Senate floor. These are two  stories I will start with.   You can see on my left, Katie Lambert.   Katie Lambert, in 2005, was 3 years old, just 3 years old. Her mom  Judy describes her as ``everything a three-year-old child should be-- full of love and spontaneity.''   Katie loved Thomas the Tank Engine; she loved Buzz Lightyear; and, of  course, she loved her older brothers.   Katie's family had just moved into their new home in Huntingdon  Valley, PA, in Southeastern Pennsylvania. One day, Katie was playing in  her room while her mom painted the room next-door. Suddenly, Judy heard  an ``awful crash'' as she described it. Judy ran into the room to find  3-year-old Katie crushed beneath a tall, mirrored wardrobe. The  wardrobe had been on carpet and was unstable.   Judy said:         While we don't know what Katie was doing, she was probably       dancing and watching herself in the mirrors. She may have       bumped up against it or tried to open one of the doors or       maybe the vibration of her dancing in the room was just       enough to cause it to become unstable and fall forward on       her.    That is what her mom Judy said.   You can see in this photograph a beautiful little child, Katie  Lambert, who died on that day. As her mom Judy held her, waiting for an  ambulance to arrive, Katie took her last breath. She would have been 21  years old this year, and Judy wonders what she would be like today.  What would she look like as a young woman? What college would she have  chosen and what career path? Would she like spicy food like her  brothers do?   Judy Lambert wanted me to share a message today, and it is quoted  right here on this poster:         Please, do everything you can to ensure that no other       family suffers the pain we do.    So said a mom about what we should do when we think of this child.   Then, Judy went on to say:         I am begging you to pass the STURDY Act now.    We should listen to her words and act.   The second child I will talk about tonight is Curren Collas. Another  family, the Collas family, experienced a similar tragedy in their home  in West Chester, PA.   Curren was just 2 years old--2 years old--with blond hair and deep  blue eyes that his mom Jackie described as ``soulful.'' Curren loved  his cars. He would carefully display his collection of them in a  perfect line.   In February of 2014, Jackie walked into Curren's bedroom to wake him  for the day. She discovered Curren's five-drawer dresser had fallen on  him. Curren was trapped between it and his bed. As she waited for an  ambulance to arrive, Jackie tried to resuscitate Curren but was later  told by the paramedics that he had no vital signs when they took over.   In the months after Curren's death, Jackie would sometimes stumble on  his toy cars, hidden around the house--reminders of her spirited son,  Curren.   Obviously, Jackie and her family's lives will never ever be the same.   Here is what she told us in memory of her son. She said:         Even if I live until 100, it's going to be before Curren       and after Curren.    Just two stories tell us all we need to know about why we have to  pass this bill. We could tell a lot more from Pennsylvania and so many  other States that are represented by those Senators I mentioned and  represented by Senators from other States. There is no reason--no  reason at all--for families to endure this unimaginable grief, but,  tragically, families across the Nation share similar stories of losing  children to these horrific furniture tipover accidents. You will hear  more of their  [[Page S1050]]  stories from my colleagues in the days ahead.   In the memory of Katie and Curren and so many others who were lost to  their families--killed in these tragedies--we must pass the STURDY Act.  It is not complicated. It is not complicated at all. We must ensure  that the furniture sold to consumers is tested--tested for safety and  tested for stability. Congress must do all it can. We in the Senate  must do all we can to ensure that no more children--no more children-- are harmed or killed by furniture tipovers.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Pagan nomination be considered expired, with  all previous provisions remaining in effect.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
