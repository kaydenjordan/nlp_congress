 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Illinois for his leadership on this bill; and also to Congressman  Thompson for all he has done to bring this to where it is today,  because millions of students and workers are eager to advance into  good-paying, high-skilled technical careers.   From childcare to manufacturing, to carpentry or computer science,  jobs that require technical training are in high demand, and we want to  make sure that students across the country have the skills they need to  get hired and develop their careers.   With this bill, we will help strengthen the Perkins career and  technical education program that reaches over 11 million students every  year. This bill will help policymakers measure what does and does not  work in career and technical education, allowing us to build on past  successes. It will ensure our CTE programs are aligned with the needs  of high-demand growth industries to make sure that America is  competitive globally, and it will support work-based learning and  apprenticeships, and our early education and childcare workforce.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    This will bring the Perkins program into  the modern, 21st century global economy. This has broad bipartisan  support.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this act, and I urge them to  fully fund the CTE programs and reject the proposed cuts of $168  million.
