 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Equality  Act, important legislation that will secure the civil rights of our  LGBTQ community.   Our LGBTQ friends, neighbors, colleagues, and community members  [[Page H656]]  should not miss an educational opportunity, or be denied housing or  credit, because of who they are or who they love.   I was proud to help pass the Oregon Equality Act when I was in the  State legislature. The same arguments were being made back then, in  2007, that some of our colleagues are making today. Do you know what  came to pass? Those concerns did not come to pass. What happened? The  law brought dignity, security, and peace of mind to the LGBTQ  community.   It is long past time that LGBTQ Americans across the country have the  same protections. As the chair of the Civil Rights and Human Services  Subcommittee, I have heard from students and workers who were  discriminated against, people who were deeply harmed by antigay and  transphobic attacks.   Today, I am thinking about the trans people in Oregon and around the  country who are bravely standing up for equality. We stand with you. We  will keep working to create a world where you are safe, free, and  supported.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Cicilline for his leadership.
