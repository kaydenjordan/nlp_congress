 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come, and it is my  pleasure to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the  majority leader.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 17, 2017, on page H2169, the following appeared:  Mr.  Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority  leader the schedule for the week to come, and it is my    ========================= END NOTE =========================     (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I must hasten to add that the gentleman from  California added a little comment that ``it is known.'' I don't share  that view, Mr. Speaker, that it is known that the Affordable Care Act  is failing.  [[Page H2170]]    In fact, we had a hearing yesterday when the former Director of the  Congressional Budget Office appointed by Democrats testified on the  Affordable Care Act and testified on the American Health Care Act. Lo  and behold, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Elmendorf agreed with the present CBO  Director. In other words--and everybody in America ought to be pleased  on this because they all are asking for bipartisan--the former Director  appointed by Democrats of the CBO agrees with the Republican Director  of the CBO, who just came down with his advice and counsel to the  Congress just a few days ago.   That ought to give pause to those who are pressing to pass a bill,  which would result in the loss by 24 million Americans of their  insurance and would result in the increased costs to almost every  American of their insurance.   Now, yes, there are some Americans who would choose not to have  health care. Then they would get sick or they would get in an  automobile accident or something else would happen where they would  require medical care, and they would not be able to pay for it. Guess  what? We would all pay for it.   That is what was happening before the Affordable Care Act. It is  still happening with some who choose either to pay their contribution  toward health--some people call it a penalty; I call it a  contribution--to meet their personal responsibility, as the Heritage  Foundation suggested, of having provisions that, if they get sick, they  will be able to pay for it.   Now, last week, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader had some quotes from  people who did not like the Affordable Care Act. At this hearing that  we had, we had a number of people, and I want to quote some of them:         I certainly never imagined I would have a child who would       rely so much on a government program like Medicaid.    This child, Mr. Speaker, suffers from Rett syndrome, which is a  neurology disorder that strikes mostly young girls with normal  development for the first 18 or 24 months of their life. Then their  development is arrested and, in fact, in some respects, there is a  retreat in their abilities.   She went on to say:         Medicaid provides skilled nursing care, which allows us to       raise our daughter, Caroline, in our home instead of a       hospital or institution.    Of course, a hospital or institution would be far more expensive, Mr.  Speaker.   She went on to say:         This allows my husband and me to hold jobs and take care of       other family needs. The House Republican plan for Medicaid       would put my daughter's life at risk, and my family is       terrified.    That was Marta Conner, mother of a child with Rett syndrome covered  under Medicaid.   I titled yesterday's hearing: The hearing that the Republicans  refused to have on the American Health Care Act or the Affordable Care  Act itself.   This quote is by a doctor:         In public debate in Congress, the actual people can be       obscured by graphs and numbers. But, ladies and gentlemen,       every day in clinic, I am one-on-one with the real people,       real Americans who could take steps closer to health or       suffer more with this Congress' decision. I urge you and your       colleagues to reject the American Health Care Act and,       instead, strengthen the Affordable Care Act.    To that extent, Mr. Speaker, as the majority leader knows, that  testimony joined hundreds in the medical field: The American Medical  Association, associations of physicians with particular skill sets, of  hospitals, of insurance companies, of patients, of providers, of urban  hospitals, suburban hospitals, rural hospitals, and literally hundreds  of people intimately involved in the healthcare system who are urging  us not to pass the American Health Care Act and to leave in place but  improve the Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, I have indicated to many on this side of the aisle that  we are prepared to work to improve any piece of legislation that has  been passed and particularly a piece of legislation which affects so  many Americans. Unfortunately, we have not had that opportunity since  this bill, the Affordable Care Act, was first considered and passed.   This week, the Congressional Budget Office released their estimate  and impacts of the House Republicans' bill to repeal the Affordable  Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, as the majority leader knows, President Trump, in this  body and at that rostrum, promised insurance for everybody that is much  less expensive and much better. He has not offered such a bill. The  American Health Care Act certainly does not provide that.   In fact, the CBO--both Republican and Democratic directors--opined at  least 24 million people will lose their insurance and, by 2026, there  will be 58 million people in America without health insurance.   Mr. Speaker, the majority leader has indicated this bill will be on  the floor next week. I hope that everybody takes the opportunity to  read the CBO report and the testimony given in yesterday's hearing on  the bill. It was the first and only hearing that was held on the bill  that will be on the floor. Previous hearings on the Affordable Care Act  are not good, and previous hearings that there are alternatives out  there don't deal with the bill that is going to be on the floor next  Wednesday or Thursday.   Senator Susan Collins has said of the bill that is going to be on the  floor:         It should prompt the House to slow down and reconsider       certain provisions of the bill.    She was referring, of course, to the CBO report.   Senator Bill Cassidy from that liberal leftwing bastion of Louisiana  said:         Can't sugarcoat it. Doesn't look good. The CBO score was,       shall we say, an eyepopper. I also hope it was a thought       provoker.    And Senator Rob Portman, who served in this body for many years,  said:         I am concerned about the Medicaid population. That is the       biggest part of coverage for Ohio.    That is why their Governor, a Republican, and Rob Portman, a  Republican who served on the Ways and Means Committee, is urging  caution and has great reservations about the bill that has been  announced to come to the floor.                                time  1200    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the majority leader whether or not  he can confirm whether changes will be made to the repeal bill, that is  the American Health Care Act, that was reported out of the Budget  Committee, whether he can confirm whether or not the repeal bill will  be changed before it comes to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Reclaiming my time, just to clarify, Mr. Speaker, that the  bill to which he is referring is not the bill to which I was referring.  I was referring to the Affordable Care Act and improvement of the  Affordable Care Act.   He is now referring to the American Health Care Act which, we think,  bears no resemblance to the Affordable Care Act.    Of course, with the Affordable Care Act. We think the bill  that has been, as I said, Mr. Speaker, offered will devastate many  individuals, millions and millions and millions of people in this  country. We have said that pretty clearly.   But more importantly, the CBO Director, appointed by Republicans,  said that in his report, which was, by the way, Mr. Speaker, given  after, after it was considered in either one of the  [[Page H2171]]  committees, either the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Ways and  Means Committee.   They did not wait for the CBO report. My opinion, Mr. Speaker, they  did not wait for the CBO report because they knew how devastatingly  negative the CBO report would be to the legislation they were  considering.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    I certainly will do that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.  People, I am sure, listening to this colloquy must get confused because  they hear one representation from somebody who sounds pretty  reasonable, my friend, Mr. McCarthy, and then they hear exactly the  opposite from me. So they will have to make a judgment.   The bill that is going to be on this floor next week was introduced a  week ago Monday. It was marked up less than 42 hours later.   My friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, said: I love to listen  to constituents. Not a single constituent on his side of the aisle or  my side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, had the opportunity to testify on  this bill. Not a single one of my constituents, or the majority  leader's constituents, had the opportunity to know what the CBO said  was going to happen; that 24 million people  [[Page H2172]]  would lose their insurance, 14 million next year; that Medicare would  be put at risk; and Medicaid would be gutted by 2021. Not a single  constituent was listened to because they had no opportunity to come and  say: this is what I think.   The testimony to which I referred was yesterday. I don't know the  dates on the letters that the gentleman just read, but perhaps they  were just within the last few days.   But I will tell that 63-year-old woman that what this bill does, if  you got a 60 percent increase, will up that by 66 percent because you  are going to go from a 3-to-1 ratio to a 5-to-1 ratio on which seniors,  and 63 years of age, regrettably, from my standpoint, are referred to  as seniors. The bill that is going to be considered will allow the  insurance company to do a 5-to-1 ratio, rather than a 3-to-1 ratio, so  that 60 percent is going to go up by 40, maybe get to 100 percent.    Mr. Speaker, the American people know about transparency. That means  they can see something.   The gentleman says: Well, now it is online. Yes, they had 40 hours,  give or take, to see this bill from Monday night to Wednesday, when it  was marked up, and it was marked up and passed in the Ways and Means  Committee in the dead of night, sort of like they passed the  prescription drug bill, at 5:59 in the morning. The majority leader  wasn't here. I was here. Perhaps there is a predilection to middle of  the night. By the time the Energy and Commerce Committee passed it,  they had been in session for over 24 hours and were bleary-eyed.   As I told him last week, Mr. Speaker, my folks were not up at 4 a.m.  watching the Energy and Commerce Committee. And I would tell him  further that--he said the bill was now online and people had an  opportunity to read it. Perhaps, Mr. Majority Leader, Mr. Speaker, that  is why the Affordable Care Act has now got more support from the  country than it has had at any time since its existence; where there  are 49 percent of Americans who now like the Affordable Care Act.  Perhaps the reason that is happening now is because they have had the  opportunity to see the alternative that the Republicans have offered  and are offering on Wednesday.                                time  1215    This bill that they offered is going to significantly raise--I will  tell Colleen--her out-of-pocket expenses.   And, yes, under their bill, the CBO says that perhaps the premiums  will go down. Why will the premiums go down? Why does insurance go up  and down? Because the risk goes up and down; and the greater the risk,  the more the cost. But if you don't allow people who are sick people to  get into the system because they can't afford it, then the risk goes  down. When the risk goes down and you shut people out of the system and  24 million people are out of the system, yes, of course, the rates go  down because you are insuring the healthy.   Now, Americans know that very well because they know they have  automobile insurance--which, by the way, they are mandated to have in  almost every State, if not every State. Why are they mandated to have  it? So the rest of us are protected when we have an accident or we are  protected from our rates going up because there is not a broad spectrum  of the insured so that the risk can be minimal for the insurance  company.   So I say to my friend that CBO has told the truth. The Americans are  seeing that, and they don't like that. I would urge those on the other  side of the aisle to be very careful when they vote either Wednesday or  Thursday on this bill because this bill is going to have a very  detrimental effect on the American people.   Now, I understand there are going to be two other bills. There are  going to be four bills on the floor, as I understand it. Can the  gentleman inform us of when we will see the details of this additional  legislation?   I yield to the gentleman.    The third bill and the fourth bill.    Are they available now to be reviewed prior to them coming  up later in the month?   I yield to the gentleman.    Lastly--and I know you are glad to hear that comment, as  are the folks waiting to do 1-minutes--we have received a letter from  Secretary Mnuchin on March 8. It was directed to the Speaker, Mr.  Leader, and like most Secretaries of the Treasury, he is hoping that we  will pursue financially responsible and confidence-building policies.   I won't read the whole letter, but he says in the last paragraph:  ``As I said in my confirmation hearing, honoring the full faith and  credit of our outstanding debt is a critical commitment. I encourage  Congress to raise the debt limit at the first opportunity so that we  can proceed with our joint priorities.''   Mr. Speaker, I ask the majority leader whether that is going to be  scheduled in the near term because, on March 15, we met the debt-limit  extension. This administration and every previous administration have  taken steps to prolong the time before we default by using extra  mechanisms so that we are, in effect, not investing in the retirement  system or something else and paying our debts.   I have indicated publicly, Mr. Speaker, and I reiterate here, that I  will urge my side to support a debt-limit extension if it is clean.  What I mean by ``clean,'' if it does not incorporate something that is  not agreed to and there is not a consensus on. By that I mean, simply,  if there are things that we have a consensus on that need to be passed,  certainly including those in the debt-limit extension would not be  objectionable. But if there are items in that bill designed to force us  to vote for what is a responsible policy but takes something that we  obviously very strongly disagree with, we will not do so.   So my questions to the majority leader are: A, can we expect a clean  debt-limit extension? B, can we expect that in the near term, as  Secretary Mnuchin requests, so that we can put that matter behind us  and not undermine confidence in our fiscal posture as a nation?   I yield to my friend.    It will probably be my last question. I have an additional  observation.    Mr. Speaker, I ask that the gentleman's words be taken  down. I have never had such a vicious attack made on me.   But I must admit I was deeply disappointed last night. My  congratulations to the young men at Xavier and their coach, but my, my,  my, I was disappointed in the quality of our play. We have got a great  group of young people playing, but it was not their night.   I am sure that I will pick another team sometime as the March Madness  continues. What I would hope, though, is we would not have March  Madness on this floor next week.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.  [[Page H2173]]         I guess the answer to that question, Mr. Speaker, is what  will determine an upset. Will the American people be upset? Will the  Republicans be upset? The answer to that question remains in the hands  of our Republican colleagues, because what I want to do in observation,  I disagree with all three of the propositions that the majority leader  said in his closing statement.   This is not going to reduce the budget. Yes, on its face, they give a  $600 billion tax cut to the wealthiest in America. Where do they take  it from? Medicaid, some of the poorest people in America. That is where  that money comes from.   Premiums are going to go up. Deductibles are going to go up. You can  quote me on this 2, 3 years from now. I don't think your bill is going  to pass. But if it did pass, that is what would happen. You won't be  able to test me because I don't think the bill is going to pass. It may  pass this floor, but it will not become law.   The majority leader's statement, Mr. Speaker, that that is what the  American people are expecting, I disagree with that. What the President  of the United States said he was going to give to the American people  is insurance for everybody. The majority leader ignores the 24 million.  He hasn't spoken about that. He spoke about some other observations in  the CBO report, as did Speaker Ryan. I don't blame him. I would try to  point to some positive indicators myself.   I think this is going to up the deficit, it is going to up costs, and  it will decrease the insured and make hospitals have more uncompensated  care. We will have this debate next week, Mr. Speaker.   But on the last issue, I would hope, Mr. Leader, that we do agree on  fiscal responsibility. I happen to believe, as you know, the debt limit  issue is a phony issue, a totally political issue. It has been used as  a political issue on both sides of the aisle. There should be no  question but of course the United States is going to pay its debt, of  course the United States is going to pay people whom it has bought  things from, and of course it is going to pay people moneys that they  have been promised. Of course it is going to do that. This is not about  new spending. It is about spending that we have already incurred.   I would urge the majority leader to bring a clean bill to the floor.  I will work with him. We will get the overwhelming majority of  Democrats to vote for that. Let's not blame one another for the debt.  There is plenty of opportunity to do that, and both sides are guilty of  that result.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has nothing further he wants to say, I  yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr.  Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority  leader the schedule for the week to come, and it is my    ========================= END NOTE =========================     America cannot turn our back on the scourge of sex slavery.
