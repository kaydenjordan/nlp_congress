 Madam Speaker, it is a good time for  Pennsylvania. Some would say we are on a roll.   The Phillies made it to the World Series; Jalen Hurts is the MVP; and  the Eagles are the best team in football.   Last November, Pennsylvanians spoke loudly. Josh Shapiro was elected  our Governor and Austin Davis our Lieutenant Governor, and we begin  this term with newly elected Democratic Speaker of the House Mark  Rozzi, our Senator John Fetterman, and nine Democratic Congress Members  representing us here in D.C.   Just like the entire Democratic Caucus, Pennsylvania Democrats are  united and determined to make a difference for everyday people on  issues like gun violence, addiction, and providing high-quality  education, which makes me eager to, once again, serve alongside  returning Members Matt Cartwright, Brendan Boyle, Dwight Evans, Mary  Gay Scanlon, Susan Wild, and Chrissy Houlahan, and with dynamic new  Members like Summer Lee, an activist lawyer and first Black woman to  represent Pennsylvania in Congress, and Chris Deluzio, an Iraq war  veteran and voting rights attorney.   Pennsylvanians sent a congressional delegation to Washington that  looks like Pennsylvania and, with Governor-elect Shapiro, we will  govern for all.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is a crime now to kill a  child born alive. In fact, in May of 2013, a Philadelphia man was  convicted of first degree murder in the killing of three infants. He is  now serving life without parole.   Either my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are unaware of  this already existing crime with a penalty of life without parole, or  this is another extreme political stunt.   Let me be clear: Abortion care is healthcare, and that has been true  for a very long time. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  not interested in medical truths. No. Instead, they are interested in  scaring people, outlawing all abortions and criminalizing anyone they  can.   Politicians have no business making unsound medical decisions. We are  legislators, not doctors.   In the unfortunate case when a child is born with fatal disabilities,  this legislation will deny parents a say in how their child spends the  final minutes, hours, or days of his or her life, whether hooked up to  a medical device or in the arms of their parents.   Expectant parents have enough worries. They should not have to worry  about extreme politicians in their doctor's office or hospital thinking  they somehow know better.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 26.
