 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a World War II  veteran and hero from my district, Mr. Edward Carvell.   Born in November 1926 in Caernarvon Township in eastern Lancaster  County as the 10th of 16 children, Mr. Carvell served as a sergeant in  the United States Army, serving in the 24th Division in both the  Philippines and Japan. He was the second member of his family drafted  into service. He followed the path of an older brother.   I learned of Mr. Carvell's exemplary service when my office assisted  with submitting his story to the Library of Congress Veterans History  Project. I am so thankful that we could be involved in making sure his  experience serving in the United States Armed Forces and the stories of  many other brave servicemen and -women are preserved.   As we mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II this year,  I am deeply appreciative of Mr. Carvell's sharing his story, and I am  thankful for the service of so many uniformed men and women from  Lancaster and Southern York Counties.   I would encourage all of my colleagues to participate in the Veterans  History Project so our brave veterans' experiences can be preserved and  honored in the Library of Congress.                            ____________________
