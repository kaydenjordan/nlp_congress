 Mr. President, Leader Schumer said since last week that  he intends to introduce a resolution purporting to support law  enforcement.   In 2020, ``defund the police'' became the rallying cry of the radical  left. Every day for the next 2 years, officers reported to duty despite  a campaign saying that they didn't deserve money for even bulletproof  vests; and 1,146 of those officers died protecting Americans. I don't  remember Democrats taking to this floor to defend law enforcement back  then. Instead, they blocked resolutions that condemned attacks against  officers.   By April of 2021, antipolice protests and Democrat silence were all  but routine. And we know what happened: Police morale plummeted.  [[Page S1332]]    Still, officers rushed toward danger that those of us in Congress  should thank God that we never have to face. Iowa Sergeant Jim Smith  was one of those officers. On a Friday night in April 2021, he got a  call for backup. It took him to the house of Michael Lange. Lange had  just assaulted another police officer and barricaded himself inside  with a shotgun.   Sergeant Smith led the entry team. They had just cleared the basement  and were about to reach the main floor when Lange ambushed them. Lange  fired two shots into Sergeant Smith's chest. Then he gloated to the  other officers, and this is what he said:         I'll kill you like I killed your buddy.    All Sergeant Smith ever wanted was to be a police officer. When the  antipolice rioters came, he and his tactical team guarded the Iowa  State Capitol. They were spat on and insulted. They had frozen water  bottles and rocks thrown at them. But they held the line. And when the  time came, Sergeant Smith laid down his life holding a thin blue thin.   He never got to see this pro-FBI resolution. He didn't witness the  uptick in police popularity as blue cities descended into violent  crime. But I would imagine that the folks who loved Officer Smith must  be wondering where this all was back then and why the FBI seems to  matter more than State and local officers.   Of course, this isn't to say that there aren't good FBI employees.  There are plenty of them. I and my Republican colleagues have made our  support for law enforcement clear time and again. I would, however,  like to know where our Democratic colleagues have been with respect to  the blatant political bias in the leadership of the FBI and the  Department of Justice.   On March 1 of 2023, Senator Graham and I wrote to Attorney General  Garland and Director Wray regarding the more than 130 attacks on  Catholic churches since the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs and the  fact that the FBI has largely failed to investigate those violent  attacks by leftist extremist groups. Instead, as we wrote to Director  Wray, elements of the FBI have labeled Catholics as extremists and  lumped them together with violent White supremacists with no  justification.   There is nothing extreme or suspicious about worshipping God  according to the dictates of your conscience.   Our letter also pointed out that the Biden Department of Justice has  aggressively targeted pro-life advocates for selective prosecution.  This includes the Department's political prosecution of Mark Houck for  allegedly violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. He  had an altercation with an abortion clinic volunteer who allegedly  verbally harassed his 12-year-old son.   Even though local authorities declined to press charges, Mr. Houck  was arrested--arrested at gunpoint--by the FBI in front of his  terrified family. He was eventually found not guilty by a jury after a  very short deliberation.   Let's also not forget that, for many years, our Democratic colleagues  politically weaponized the FBI against my and Senator Johnson's Biden  family investigation. On July 13, 2020, then-Minority Leader Schumer,  Senator Warner, then-Speaker Pelosi, and then-Chairman Schiff sent a  letter with classified attachments to the FBI. The letter targeted the  Grassley-Johnson Biden family investigation to try and falsely tie it  to Russian disinformation.   On July 16, 2020, mere days after the July 13 letter, then-Ranking  Members Wyden and Peters wrote a letter to me and Senator Johnson  asking for a briefing from the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force. The  FBI did the bidding of our Democratic colleagues and briefed us,  accordingly, on August 6, 2020.   The contents of the FBI briefing were later leaked to the Washington  Post, even though the FBI promised us confidentiality. The leak was  just another act in a long line of efforts to falsely label the  Grassley-Johnson good government oversight work as--you guessed it-- Russian disinformation.   The Wall Street Journal editorial board hit the mark with their piece  that they entitled ``The FBI's Dubious Briefing: Did the bureau set up  two GOP Senators at the behest of Democrats?''   As I noted in the last Congress, protected whistleblower disclosures  to my office make clear that the FBI has within its possession very  significant, very impactful, and very voluminous evidence with respect  to potential criminal conduct by members of the Biden family. Based on  protected whistleblower allegations, I know the FBI falsely labeled  that evidence as Russian disinformation to bury it.   To date, the Biden Justice Department and the FBI haven't challenged  the accuracy of these allegations. They can't because my staff has  independently reviewed records to support the allegations.   And you can't forget the now-debunked Steele dossier, a document  funded and created by Democrats and the Clinton campaign, a document  that was actually subject to Russian disinformation. The FBI's willing  and disastrous use of it to investigate candidate and then-President  Trump sent our country into a tailspin for years.   So let's not kid ourselves right here, right now, as we are talking  about a resolution to back law enforcement. The facts bear out that it  is our Democratic colleagues who have consistently used Federal law  enforcement to their political benefit, and, in the process, they have  degraded the trust the American people once placed in Federal law  enforcement.   Accordingly, this resolution offered by my Democratic colleagues  reeks of political gamesmanship. It is not a serious effort. Let's  truly honor the heroes in law enforcement and the daily sacrifices they  make for the American people by offering more than a tone-deaf  political resolution that further divides the country.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of  Joshua Jacobs to be Under Secretary for Benefits at VA. I will do so  for reasons I have already stated publicly in the Record when I paused  consideration of his nomination last month. I placed that hold to bring  attention to serious ethical lapses and the VA's complete stonewalling  of my inquiry into those issues.   Veterans Affairs, for 2 years, has chosen the path of inattention and  disrespect, not just to this Senator from Iowa, but more importantly to  the Senate, the people I represent, and all Americans who believe in  honest government.   I began my inquiry 2 years ago into serious conflicts of interest at  the VA, concerns that it had failed to protect sensitive and  confidential information about publicly traded companies, and the  shocking and potentially illegal--and fully documented--termination of  a person the VA suspected of being a whistleblower. The VA failed to  cooperate on all counts.   These are matters that are in the VA's own best interest to resolve.  It doesn't do the VA or anyone else any good, and it certainly does no  good for our veterans, for these serious matters to be swept under the  rug.   At my request, VA's inspector general investigated the serious  allegations I raised of potentially criminal conflicts of interest and  confirmed them to the extent possible. However, he wasn't able to  finish his investigation and determine whether criminal activity  occurred because the subjects refused to cooperate. The conflicts of  interest were known to senior VA officials, who did nothing to stop  them and instead assured the conflicted official they would make the  issue go away, and they did, until I raised my inquiry. Documents show  a VA official berated the whistleblower, removed their key duties, and  then fired them.   VA did not cooperate with my investigation, and that has left serious  questions unanswered. It waited nearly 9 months and after four letters  to respond at all, and even then, it was only to refuse to provide  answers. After 2 years, we are still waiting for those answers.  [[Page S1335]]    And if you think this is all old news, just last month, I raised new  allegations obtained by my office about potential contract  irregularities at VA. It appears from public records that the VA has  awarded lucrative contracts to former VA officials who resigned under  ethical clouds. We need answers to that and all the other questions I  have raised, and I will not stop pushing for those answers. My staff  counts over 30 questions that VA to date has not fully responded to,  after six oversight inquiries from my office and multiple attempts to  gain their cooperation.   Mr. Jacobs, the nominee before us today, served as a senior adviser  to various VA Secretaries and was there as the VA obstructed my  inquiry. He had a front row seat at VA through a string of failures and  crises, from the Phoenix wait list scandal, to VA's failures in  processing claims for victims of sexual trauma, veterans' claims  backlogs, delays in the GI Bill modernization initiative, and a host of  challenges and scandals.   Mr. Jacobs has never adequately explained his role in these matters  or what potential role he may have played in VA's lack of  responsiveness to congressional inquiries. In addition, for reasons I  explained in my public hold statement on his nomination March 14, I  found his responses to my questions for the record to be woefully  inadequate and evasive. Where is the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  in making sure the VA and this nominee are held accountable? After 2  years of that same pattern from the VA, the Senate should not confirm  this nominee. VA can and must do better in responding to congressional  inquiries and fulfilling its role of serving veterans and the American  people. I will vote no.                            ____________________
