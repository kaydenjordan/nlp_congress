 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1159) to amend the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 to require  periodic reviews and updated reports relating to the Department of  State's Taiwan Guidelines.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1159         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERIODIC REVIEWS AND UPDATED REPORTS OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S TAIWAN GUIDELINES UNDER                     THE TAIWAN ASSURANCE ACT OF 2020.         Section 315 of the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (Public Law       116-260; 134 Stat. 3100) is amended--        (1) in subsection (c)(1), by adding at the end before ``;       and'' the following: ``and any successor document or related       document disseminating such guidance''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(d) Periodic Reviews and Updated Reports.--        ``(1) In general.--For as long as the Department of State's       guidance that governs relations with Taiwan described in       subsection (a) remains in effect, the Secretary of State       shall conduct periodic reviews as described in subsection (a)       and submit updated reports as described in subsection (c) not       less frequently than every two years following the submission       of the initial report described in subsection (c).        ``(2) Matters to be included.--Such updated reports shall       include--        ``(A) a description of how the guidance meets the goals and       objectives described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of       subsection (b); and        ``(B) an identification of opportunities and plans to lift       self-imposed restrictions on relations with Taiwan.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Taiwan assurance implementation  act, my bipartisan legislation to ensure the United States engages  Taiwan in a way that deepens our relationship with this important  partner.   Taiwan faces an unprecedented threat from an increasingly capable and  erratic People's Republic of China. Xi Jinping has said that so-called  reunification with Taiwan is a core goal of his great rejuvenation  campaign, and Chinese Communist Party officials have made clear that  they are not afraid to use force to achieve this goal.   Mr. Speaker, our own intelligence community has assessed that the PRC  is investing in military capabilities that will enable it to take  Taiwan by 2027, but we do not need intelligence to tell us what we  already see. The PRC is flying bombers and fighter jets into Taiwanese  airspace and waters, threatening to sanction Taiwanese businesses, and  harassing Taiwanese Government officials.   If we are to defeat China's plan to replace the United States as the  world's preeminent power, we cannot be ruled by fear. That means boldly  standing by our friends and partners, particularly Taiwan.   We must increase our economic ties, defense relationship, and  political support of Taiwan's democratic system. Unfortunately, our own  State Department has often unilaterally censored or restricted its  engagement with Taiwan.   Hiding behind opacity and red tape hurts our partnership with Taiwan  at a moment when we need to be standing shoulder to shoulder with our  allies and partners. Any waffling invites bullies like Xi and Putin to  push the envelope.  [[Page H1312]]    This is why the Taiwan Assurance Act, or TAA, was enacted with strong  bipartisan support in 2020, but the threat Taiwan faces has only grown  since then. This bill amends the TAA to ensure that the State  Department's policy of engagement with Taiwan is appropriate to today's  geopolitical challenges. We must acknowledge the growing threat Taiwan  faces and help build resilience to that threat.   I was proud to introduce this bipartisan bill along with the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), who has been an absolute  champion for Taiwan for so many years.   It received unanimous support during markup by the Foreign Affairs  Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, the geopolitical situation surrounding  Taiwan is changing rapidly. Our relationship with Taiwan must be  flexible enough to meet these new challenges.   Unfortunately, the State Department's classified Taiwan contact  guidelines are often not conducive to a robust relationship with  Taiwan, and Congress has little insight into the decisionmaking behind  these guidelines.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, the bottom line of this legislation is this:   H.R. 1159 would reauthorize the bipartisan Taiwan Assurance Act of  2020, strengthen its reporting requirements, and require greater  transparency from the State Department.   It would ensure the United States is approaching its relationship  with Taiwan in a manner that strengthens our  [[Page H1313]]  relationships with democratic partners who are under threat by  aggressive dictatorships, and it would ask the administration to  identify opportunities to lift remaining self-imposed restrictions on  engagement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge each of my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan bill. I thank the ranking member, Mr. Meeks, and I thank the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for joining me in supporting  this unanimously out of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 406) to provide for the treatment of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations as an international organization for purposes  of the International Organizations Immunities Act, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 406         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Providing Appropriate       Recognition and Treatment Needed to Enhance Relations with       ASEAN Act'' or the ``PARTNER with ASEAN Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION TO THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN                     NATIONS.         The provisions of the International Organizations       Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.) may be extended to the       Association of Southeast Asian Nations in the same manner, to       the same extent, and subject to the same conditions as such       provisions may be extended to a public international       organization in which the United States participates pursuant       to any treaty or under the authority of any Act of Congress       authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for       such participation.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, is  of immense strategic and economic importance to the United States of  America.   This powerhouse region joins the Indian and Pacific Ocean regions and  serves as a conduit for global trade. Southeast Asian states are  increasingly vital to the prosperity of the U.S. economy, generating  hundreds of thousands of American jobs and investing more in our  economy than China and India combined.   Home to one of the world's largest and youngest populations and  numerous key shipping routes, ASEAN represents the future of growth in  the Indo-Pacific. It is an important region that cannot be forgotten  and is certainly not forgotten by the People's Republic of China.   The PRC is actively looking for ways to expand their footprint in  ASEAN, whether it be through infrastructure projects, predatory  lending, or police training. A growing number of Southeast Asian  countries no longer believe that China's intentions are benign. Our  partners are seeking assurance of U.S. support as they try to maintain  economic independence from China and defend their territorial claims in  the South China Sea.   To strengthen our relationship with Southeast Asian Governments and  counter PRC influence, we must find ways to deepen our relationship  with the ASEAN.   The United States has worked closely with ASEAN for more than four  decades, and 15 years ago, we became the first nonmember to name an  ambassador to ASEAN.   This bill will build on that legacy of cooperation and will enhance  ties between the United States and this critical region of the world.  It will accord ASEAN representatives in the United States the same  diplomatic immunities we provide other regional organizations, such as  the EU or the Organization of American States. This is a tangible  demonstration of our commitment to that organization.   I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro). I would also thank my  good friend from California, Young Kim, for introducing this important  bill. I have the great privilege of being co-chair and cofounder with  Mr. Castro of the ASEAN Caucus.   I am very sorry that Mr. Castro is unable to join us on the floor  today but want to convey our prayers and very best wishes for his full  and speedy recovery, Mr. Speaker.   This bill received unanimous bipartisan support during committee  markup and deserves our full support today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  [[Page H1314]]  Kim), my good friend and colleague, who chairs the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific and is the Republican coauthor of this  bill.     Mr. Speaker, in closing, we have a national interest in  sustaining U.S. leadership in Southeast Asia, supporting human rights  and respect for democratic freedoms, and articulating our strategic  priorities.   We will find willing partners in our many friends and allies in the  region who share our grave concerns regarding China's growing power,  but we must demonstrate that these partnerships are a key U.S.  priority.   H.R. 406 sends an important message to the region: The United States  values its important relationship with ASEAN, and we strongly support  its mission to promote stability and growth in Southeast Asia.   I urge my colleagues to join me, Representative Young Kim,  Representative Castro, and Ranking Member Meeks, along with Chairman  McCaul, in supporting H.R. 406.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
