 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4738, the  COVID-19 American History Project Act.   I am proud to co-sponsor this bill and stand with my friend,  Congresswoman Letlow, who knows better than most the devastation of  this pandemic.   Two years ago this month, an unknown virus swept across the world,  taking lives and changing others forever. Our way of life was brought  to an abrupt halt, and even now, we are still trying to claw our way  back to normal.   Our State was hit hard and early. Nearly 70,000 New Yorkers lost  their lives to COVID-19. Too many families are now missing fathers,  mothers, brothers, and sisters. Too many friends are lost.   Hardly anyone has made it through the last 2 years unscathed. It is  unlikely that those of us living through this pandemic will ever forget  these years of strife.   What about those after us? Only by preserving and remembering times  of difficulty can we ensure that future generations are prepared for  what may come their way.   Mr. Speaker, the memories of our friends and loved ones lost to COVID  deserve to live on. The memory of Luke Letlow and that of hundreds of  thousands of Americans like him deserve to live on.   This bill would ensure that they do and that their loss will serve as  a reminder for future generations.
