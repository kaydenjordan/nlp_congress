 Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 5 and urge my  colleagues to do so as well. This bill will reform our regulatory  system and reduce burdens on our farmers, ranchers, and businesses.   H.R. 5 will create a more streamlined, transparent, and accountable  regulatory process and give the American people a stronger voice in  agency decisionmaking.   Requiring agencies to choose the lowest cost rulemaking option and  providing additional opportunities for judicial review will ensure that  regulations are narrowly tailored, addressing the issues at hand; and  this will reduce the burden on farmers, ranchers, businesses, and  everyday citizens.   This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 18, insert after line 8 the following:        ``(5) After notice or advance notice of a proposed rule       making, the agency making the rule, and any person acting in       an official capacity on behalf of the agency, may not       communicate, and a person who receives Federal funds from the       agency may not use those funds to communicate, through       written, oral, electronic, or other means to the public about       the proposed rule in a manner that--        ``(A) directly advocates, in support of or against the       proposed rule, for the submission of information to form part       of the record of review for the proposed rule;        ``(B) appeals to the public, or solicits a third-party, to       undertake advocacy in support of or against the proposed       rule; or        ``(C) is directly or indirectly for publicity or propaganda       purposes within the United States not heretofore authorized       by the Congress.      Such prohibition shall not apply to communication that       requests comments or provides information regarding the rule       in an impartial manner.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. This  amendment will prohibit Federal agencies from using taxpayer dollars to  advocate on behalf of a rule or generate comments to overwhelm the  record with one point of view.   A GAO report documents how the EPA created a campaign to generate  comments in support of the waters of the U.S., or the WOTUS rule. This  is not how government, or the rulemaking process, should work.   The comment period should be a time for agencies to hear from the  public about what is good, what is bad, and what needs to be fixed with  a proposed rule. In my opinion, agencies too often take laws passed by  Congress and then turn them into something that is unrecognizable. That  is why this amendment is needed and has the support of the American  Farm Bureau Federation, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and  the National Association of Home Builders, among others.   This is a commonsense amendment that will improve the bill, and I  urge my colleagues to vote in support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully claim the time  in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment which  would prohibit Federal agencies from making any public communications  that would promote a pending regulatory action.   We can all agree that the rulemaking process should be transparent,  flexible, and accountable to the public. But rather than achieve this  goal, my colleagues' amendment would decrease transparency in the  rulemaking process and burden agency rulemaking with little  corresponding benefits to the public.   A variety of statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act and  agency specific statutes, already prescribe the method that agencies  may communicate to the public with regard to proposed rules. Agencies  should, and indeed are required by law to, communicate why rules are  beneficial to the public. For example, in 2014, the Department of  Defense proposed a rule to protect servicemembers and their families  from predatory lending schemes. In a press release discussing the rule,  the Defense Department highlighted the benefits of the rule such as  ``this proposed rule would better protect Active Duty servicemembers  and their families from excessive debt.''   This plain language explanation of the proposed rule would be flatly  prohibited by this amendment. Indeed, there is little that an agency  could discuss about a pending rule that would not be considered to be  promoting the rule within the meaning of this amendment.   In the context of the proposed deregulation actions, in 2003, Bush  administration officials posed with chainsaws and scissors next to a  stack of papers to promote efforts to cut red tape. It is doubtful that  this form of public communication would be permissible under this  amendment. By the way, to see the Bush administration officials with a  chainsaw and scissors going at regulations reminds me of what we are  doing here today.   In the context of a veto threat of a similar antiregulatory proposal  last Congress, the Obama administration stated that similar  requirements would prevent agencies from efficiently performing their  statutory responsibilities and potentially lead to a less informed  public.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  so as well.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) who is the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    I have no further speakers, Mr. Chairman. I just want  to say that some of us who have been chairmen of committees and passed  legislation around here, sometimes what comes back you don't even  recognize from what you passed legislatively. This bill and this  amendment will help solve that problem, to some extent. So I encourage  my colleagues to support the amendment and support the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
