 Mr. President, today I wish to speak on the important  topic of women's health, which has been under attack by the Trump  administration.   Through its policies and the actions of its officials, the Trump  administration has undermined women's health at every opportunity.   In the first year of the Trump administration, we have seen attempts  to block access to Planned Parenthood, restrict women's access to birth  control, legislation to ban certain medical procedures, the creation of  new government offices to undermine women's healthcare, and judges  nominated who openly oppose women's privacy rights.   Scott Lloyd, the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR,  is the perfect illustration of this deeply disturbing trend.   Federal court documents and extensive media reports show that Mr.  Lloyd has used his official office to prevent unaccompanied minors at  ORR shelters from accessing legally available reproductive healthcare.   In one case, a 17-year-old young woman, referred to as Jane Doe, was  transferred to an ORR shelter after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.  While in government custody, Jane Doe discovered she was pregnant and  sought access to an abortion. She satisfied all requirements under  Texas law and secured her own funds to pay for the procedure. In spite  of this, ORR officials repeatedly blocked her from accessing care. Jane  Doe went to court and was granted approval to obtain the procedure.  Nevertheless, the Trump administration's Department of Justice cruelly  appealed the decision, alleging that the government has an interest in  blocking her personal decision.   Since Jane Doe's case, it has been uncovered that Trump  administration officials have directly intervened in other similar  cases. There are reports that Mr. Lloyd has denied young women access  to their lawyers. Additionally, he has implemented policies that  violate young women's medical privacy rights. It is also concerning  that, as someone with no medical expertise or training, Mr. Lloyd has  personally pressured young women about their medical options. In court  documents, Mr. Lloyd acknowledged that he has never approved a request  for the procedure and even admitted that he has denied such requests in  the cases of rape victims. This is shocking, particularly considering  that many of the young women who come into ORR custody have fled sexual  and gender-based violence in their home countries.   On top of that, some of these young women go through harrowing  experiences along their journey to the United States, during which they  are at risk of being trafficked, kidnapped, and raped. Blocking them  from making their own determinations about their health and bodies only  adds to the trauma they have already experienced.   In light of Mr. Lloyd's shocking actions, I have called on him to  resign.   I find it appalling that the Trump administration believes women-- undocumented or otherwise--do not have the right to control their own  bodies and make their own healthcare decisions. Young women do not lose  their right to make their own healthcare decisions just because they  are in government custody.   ORR is responsible for protecting the well-being of the most  vulnerable people: those who have been tortured, children who arrive in  the country alone and without a parent, and individuals fleeing  persecution.   It is imperative that the leader of this office uphold this mission,  rather than advancing his own personal, political agenda. We have an  obligation to treat young women in government custody with the dignity  and respect they deserve.   The Trump administration needs to stop attacking women and start  recognizing their right to control their own bodies, medical decisions,  and destiny.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution  that honors one of the most venerable institutions in our State: the  University of California.   The resolution before us commemorates the one hundred and fiftieth  anniversary of the founding of the University of California, a  noteworthy milestone that must be celebrated by recognizing all of the  achievements. I would like to thank my dear friend, Senator Harris, for  joining me and supporting this endeavor.   Throughout its history, the University of California has become a  foundation, and a beacon of hope, for the State of California and the  Nation as a whole. It embraces the same spirit and tenacity that  defines our great State.   The University of California has grown from one campus in Berkeley to  a system of 10 top-ranked universities, five notable and top-notch  academic medical centers, and three affiliated National Laboratories,  all impacting far reaches of the State.   We should recognize the University of California for what it is: the  finest and most accessible public university system in this country. It  was established on the premise that college is for everyone and  designed with every Californian in mind. That is why the University of  California's Board of Regents in 1870 decreed that women be admitted  equally with men, 50 years before the adoption of the Nineteenth  Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.   Diversity has always been a cornerstone of the University of  California. Because of its progressive and forward-thinking ways,  notable alumni include Jackie Robinson, who shattered the Major League  Baseball's color barrier; Sally Ride, the first American woman in  space; and the countless number of students and faculty members who are  the first generation in their families to attend college.   Today, the University of California has more than 273,000 enrolled  students and employs more than 223,300 faculty, staff, and other  academics. It has graduated more than two million living alumni.   The University of California is also a national leader in scientific  discovery and medical advancement, enabling transformational solutions  for healthcare and the environment, enhancing our Nation's defense  while reducing the global threat from terrorism, and addressing other  emerging national security and energy challenges. It established itself  in the fields of nuclear physics and biotechnology, revolutionized  agriculture, and helped the movie industry mature, all of which are now  multi-billion-dollar industries. Through its faculty and alumni, the  University continues to drive technological innovation and actively  partner with the private sector.   Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like to end with a  small anecdote. Every year in our household, we always look forward to  the ``Big Game.'' For the uninitiated, this is the biggest college  football game of the year: the Stanford Cardinal versus the California  Golden Bears. This is the oldest college football rivalry in the West,  which began in 1892, and still continues to this day. I do not hold it  against those who attended Berkeley, but I will be happy to gloat when  my Cardinal beat the Bears. I am not one to boast, but it must be noted  that Stanford has won more ``Big Games'' than Berkeley.   All quips aside, as we commemorate this momentous occasion in the  storied history that is the University of California, we must remember  the past and present, with an eye towards the future. The challenges  before it are great, but the potential that lies within itself is even  greater. I know and believe that the University of California will  continue to push boundaries, explore the great unknown, stand up for  American values, and continue to solve the world's most complex  problems. Here is to another exceptional 150 years.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
