 Mr. President, for the elite, the powerful and the well  connected, the Republican tax law has turned out to be manna from  Washington. The benefits of the tax law are about as one-sided as it  gets, and middle-class Americans come up on the losing end.   It sure is one-sided when the price of admission for any middle-class  tax relief is an investor handout big enough to pave Wall Street in  gold. Democrats pushed for a tax cut that was centered on the middle  class, but Republicans turned their one-sided wish list into law.   It sure is one-sided to have a massive tax handout to multinational  corporations, a lower top rate for the fortunate few, and a massive tax  cut in the estate tax that touches only the wealthiest, while working  families get handed only temporary relief.   Those are the policies that are the essence of the Republican tax  law. Yet the American people hear over and over again that the benefit  of the proposals are going to work their way to the middle class and  that those folks will get bulging wage increases.   So I would like to start by getting a few facts straight. First, just  a few hours ago, corporations crossed the $200 billion mark in stock  buybacks this year. These stock-buyback bonanzas drive up the value of  investment portfolios for CEOs and high fliers, and they are now coming  in at a rate 30 times greater--30 times greater--than worker bonuses.  They are on pace to double the amount from the first quarter of last  year.   Now, there was a whole lot of happy talk about this Republican tax  bill last winter, but I don't remember--and I sat through a lot of  markups in the Finance Committee and debates on this floor--I didn't  hear anybody say there ought to be a stock buyback stimulus act.   The wealthiest 10 percent of earners own 84 percent of all of the  stock held by Americans. So when it comes to these buybacks, a huge  majority of families are on the outside looking in. All the moms and  dads who balance the rent, the groceries, and the cost of gas and  electricity don't get much of anything out of a corporate handout that  gets swallowed up by these buyback bonanzas for big-time investors.   Second, when you talk about tax cuts producing massive stock  buybacks, you are talking about sending huge amounts of cash overseas  directly into the pockets of wealthy investors. That is because more  than one-third of all U.S. corporate stock is owned by investors  outside of the country. So under the Republican tax law, American  taxpayers are on the hook, borrowing billions and billions of dollars  to make wealthy foreigners even wealthier.   We heard a whole lot about how working families were going to get  lifted up in Portland and in Topeka and in San Antonio, but the reality  is, the folks who are getting enriched are in Beijing and Moscow and  Panama City.   Finally, you don't have to take my word for it that these corporate  windfalls overwhelmingly benefit those at the top. Fourteen years ago,  the Federal Government gave corporations what is known as a  repatriation holiday--a big tax break to bring back cash from overseas.  What the American people heard back then sounds pretty familiar today.  Corporations were going to invest in workers and equipment, and the  money would trickle down to the middle class. That didn't work out  either. More than 90 percent of the corporate cash windfall went to  goodies for investors and CEOs. Once again, very, very one-sided.   Not even two decades later, the American people are still being fed  the line about how their one-sided tax plans are going to deliver  bulging paychecks to the middle class.   A few weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin came to the Finance  Committee. He was asked who really benefits when the Republican tax  bill showers all of this cash on multinationals. He said: ``Even if  there are share buybacks . . . that capital is recycled back into the  economy. It just doesn't sit in banks, it goes back into the economy.''  That sounds an awful lot like trying to put a new spin on the failed  theory of trickle-down economics.   In my view, middle-class families are sick and tired of being told to  wait for the benefits to somehow trickle down to them. From the get-go,  our message on taxes was that if Senators were interested in real  middle-class tax relief, we would be at the head of the line to work on  it. I have been involved in a bipartisan bill. On this side, we were  ready to go for a bipartisan approach focusing on the middle class.  Instead, Republicans moved at breakneck speed to pass a one-sided bill  that would fatten the accounts of the wealthy, the powerful, and CEOs  around the world.   It is time for the Treasury Secretary to stop peddling the old  huckster's line that somehow all of this is going to work out for the  middle class if they would just wait long enough. That is not going to  work because this bill was never about middle-class folks. We see it in  the numbers. We see it in the fact that what the middle class gets is  temporary, but now we know, while middle-class families keep waiting  for the promises to come true, these stock buyback bonanzas, these  investor windfalls are just going to keep rolling on in.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Mr. Russell Vought is nominated to be the  Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. My view is, he  has radically misguided budget priorities. He has long opposed  bipartisan compromise. I am especially concerned about his well- documented history of inflammatory rhetoric. If confirmed, he would be  the point person in charge of the President's budget. He is on record  supporting an extreme fiscal strategy--one that would really threaten  the full faith and credit of the country by engaging in debt ceiling  brinkmanship, but I also oppose Mr. Vought's nomination because of his  extreme vote on the budget and refusal to reach across party lines.   So we have an obligation to look at his extreme views, especially his  vitriolic comments he has made, and to consider them among the recent  examples of individuals who made similar comments and were deemed unfit  for service.   Carl Higbie, a Trump surrogate during the 2016 campaign, was  appointed as chief of external affairs at the Corporation for National  and Community Service. He resigned from his taxpayer-funded post in  shame after his history of hateful, bigoted rhetoric was brought to  light. That history included saying he didn't like Muslims because he  hated their religious ideology and even flatly admitted he was proud to  be a racist if it meant being against Muslims.    Rev. Jamie Johnson was appointed last April to lead the Center for  Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. He, too, resigned in  disgrace after media reports drew scrutiny to his use of racist  rhetoric. During a 2008 interview, he said that African Americans had  ``turned America's major cities into slums because of laziness, drug  use, and sexual promiscuity.'' He also said extremist terrorist groups  were representative of all people of the Muslim faith.   For a person taking a job intended to promote partnerships, it was  certainly important to call his job performance into question.   William Bradford was appointed to lead the Energy Department's Office  of Indian Energy in 2017. He resigned after the media drew attention to  comments  [[Page S1268]]  he made calling for the military to target Muslim women and children  and equating American colleges to ``Jihadi training camps.''   None of these individuals resigned because of their religion. In the  United States--and I feel this so deeply--every person is free to  practice the religion of their choosing and hold any and all beliefs.  The reason these three individuals resigned from their positions was  because their intolerant comments cast serious doubt on whether they  were capable of working on behalf of all Americans.   That brings me to Mr. Vought's nomination. He has a long history of  using inflammatory rhetoric to demonize his political opponents, and he  just seems to abhor compromise. He has said that if Republicans fail  ``to beat back the forces of the left,'' then ``we will lose our  country to tyranny.'' Addressing a group of conservative activists in  2014, he said: ``The left increasingly elects ideological storm  troopers to Congress.'' After he was nominated, the American Civil  Liberties Union criticized his nomination because he had previously  claimed that Muslims had a ``deficient theology'' and flatly stated  that all Muslims ``stand condemned.''   When I met with Mr. Vought, I asked him to clarify his inflammatory  rhetoric. I always think it is important to give somebody a chance to  break from the past, and I hoped to hear a softer approach. He chose to  stand by what he said. In fact, he doubled down.   So I will close with this. In my view, nothing should have changed in  the time since Mr. Higby, Reverend Johnson, and Mr. Bradford resigned  in shame. This incendiary, vitriolic rhetoric is disqualifying.   One of the first requirements of nominees for public office is to  respect Americans from all walks of life. This is true when you are  talking about a position like the OMB Deputy Director which holds  enormous influence over the Federal budget. Mr. Vought has a clear,  documented record of disrespecting and demonizing those who think  differently than he does, and I consider that disqualifying.   This administration may tolerate those who spew vile rhetoric, and  maybe they believe it is right to reward them with powerful roles in  government, but the Senate does not have an obligation to let the  standards of decency and tolerance degrade in this manner.   For this reason, I oppose the Vought nomination.   I yield the floor.
