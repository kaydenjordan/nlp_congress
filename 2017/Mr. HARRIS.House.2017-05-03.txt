 Mr. Speaker, I hope that tomorrow the House has the  opportunity to deliver on the promise that the President made and  Republicans made to finally repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  which is crumbling around us.   Mr. Speaker, we do everything we said we would do. Maintain coverage  for preexisting conditions and guarantee it, check. In fact, with the  MacArthur amendment and the Palmer amendment, we establish high-risk  pools that will actually bring down the premium costs for people with  preexisting conditions, as it will for all Americans.   Guarantee coverage and renewability, check. Coverage for people up to  age 26 on their parents' plan, check. No discrimination based on  gender, check.   And most importantly, in the Medicaid program, we not only preserve  but strengthen coverage for our elderly, sick, disabled, and pregnant  women on that plan.   Mr. Speaker, it is about time we repeal and replace the Affordable  Care Act.                            ____________________
