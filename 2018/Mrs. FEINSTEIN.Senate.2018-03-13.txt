 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss S. 2155. It is  called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  Act. One would think from the title that I would be all for it, but as  one who went through the drop in the economy when we were on the brink  of collapse, I believe this is a very bad bill.   Let me go back to that time. Banks were teetering and over 300 would  fail in the next 3 years. For perspective, only three banks had failed  in the year of 2007. Unemployment was skyrocketing. We lost $19  trillion in household wealth. Americans lost nearly 9 million jobs.   In my State of California, more than 2 million people were  unemployed, 3\1/2\ million mortgages were at risk, and nearly 200,000  people filed for bankruptcy.  [[Page S1654]]    Now that the economy has recovered and unemployment has decreased  from its high point of 10 percent during the crisis, I worry that my  colleagues have forgotten the magnitude of this crisis. I simply  cannot.   I remember sitting in caucuses hearing from our top financial  officials about the potential for a total collapse of our economy.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner testified to the House Financial  Services Committee that ``our financial system failed to do its job and  came precariously close to failing altogether.'' That is not an  exaggeration. For those of us who were here, who listened to the  economists, who heard what was happening, we feared a total collapse.  Personal conversations I had with these economists carried the most  dire warnings. We should never get close to that point again.   Congress spent more than $400 billion on something labeled TARP,  Troubled Asset Relief Program, to help stabilize the economy. It was  very controversial at the time, but we have since recouped more than we  spent on that bank program.   Congress then passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act in 2010, putting in place policies to prevent another  financial crisis, including strong protections on the largest banks.  Now, just 8 years later--how quickly we forget--we are considering  loosening these protections.   Have we forgotten the lessons from 10 years ago and the devastating  consequences for American families?   As with any bill we pass, I am open to looking at how it has been  implemented and making adjustments as needed. For Dodd-Frank, I agree  that community banks and credit unions shouldn't be regulated the same  way as the largest banks in the country. I am open to adjusting some of  these regulations for them, but this bill simply goes too far. It goes  beyond targeted relief for small institutions.   The nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, says the  probability of a large bank failing or another financial crisis will go  up if this bill is enacted. One provision I am particularly worried  about would roll back regulations and supervision for banks with assets  between $50 billion and $250 billion. These aren't just small community  banks we are talking about. Instead, this would apply to some of the  largest banks in our country.   Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote that  Countrywide, National City, and GMAC were all below $250 billion and  ``required billions of dollars in official capital assistance and debt  guarantees either for themselves or their acquiring institutions.''   Here is what Phil Angelides, who served as chairman of the Financial  Crisis Inquiry Commission, said about this particular provision:         The bill's provisions to lift the asset threshold for       enhanced prudential standards and supervision from $50       billion to $250 billion would substantially reduce oversight       over 25 of the nation's 38 largest banks, including       institutions of over $100 billion in assets that were deemed       ``Too Big to Fail'' in 2009.        A number of financial institutions with less than $250       billion triggered the need for bailout assistance during the       crisis and history has shown, time and time again, that the       failure of financial firms that are not among the largest       mega-banks can pose systemic threats to financial stability.    In addition to weakening these requirements, the bill can also weaken  capital requirements for even the largest banks.   Sheila Bair, former Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, said this could lead up to a 30-percent capital reduction  at some banks. Just think of that. She also raises a question that we  should all take a moment to reflect on: Why does Congress want to start  designating banking activities as low or no risk, when expert financial  regulators were so wrong prior to the crisis?   Finally, this bill would amend the SAFE Act that I authored to ensure  mortgage brokers and lenders meet minimum standards. This was necessary  to curb the abusive lending practices we saw leading up to the  financial crisis in which many consumers were taken advantage of  through predatory lending.   This was a serious problem in California. Between March and June of  2008, 406 defendants were charged in 144 mortgage fraud-related cases,  and approximately $1 billion in losses were attributed to these  fraudulent acts.   The SAFE Act created a new system of registration and licensing that  included background checks, education requirements, and testing to  ensure that mortgage brokers and lenders could meet basic standards.   The bill before us, interestingly enough, would allow mortgage loan  originators to operate without a license--without a license--for up to  120 days if they move from a bank to a nonbank or across State lines.  Allowing this transition period without ensuring that lenders have  passed the licensing test we required in the SAFE Act weakens the  protections we put in place for consumers.   Before I conclude, I want to say that I appreciate this is a  bipartisan bill. It has gone through the Banking Committee. I also  understand the interest in ensuring regulations are appropriately  tailored to the size and activity of financial institutions, but I am  really worried that Members here have become too comfortable in our  economic recovery and have forgotten where the path of deregulation  ends.   I oppose this bill because it simply goes too far in deregulating  some of our largest institutions and weakening the protections we put  in place to prevent another financial crisis.   If we don't learn from past failures, we are doomed to repeat them.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letter of Phil Angelides.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                      Sacramento, CA, March 5, 2018.      Re S. 2155.       Hon. Mike Crapo,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and           Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing,           and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.        I am writing this letter to express my strong opposition to       S. 2155 by Senator Crapo which would weaken the financial       system safeguards and taxpayer and consumer protections put       in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The       provisions of the bill, particularly when coupled with the       clearly expressed deregulatory agenda of the Trump       Administration and its key financial regulators, will once       again put us on the path of exposing American taxpayers, our       financial system, and our economy to significant risk.        As Chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,       which conducted the nation's official inquiry into the causes       of the financial crisis, I am deeply troubled by the       potential passage of this legislation, considering the       magnitude of the economic and human damage caused by the       crisis and the effectiveness of post-crisis reforms in       stabilizing our financial system and economy. That the Senate       is taking up this bill on the floor at this time is       particularly astounding given that next week will mark the       10th anniversary of the collapse of Bear Stearns, one of the       seminal events in the unraveling of our financial markets       that plunged our nation into the Great Recession.        Before the financial crisis abated, the federal government       and the nation's taxpayers provided trillions of dollars of       financial assistance through two dozen separate programs,       including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), to bail       out Wall Street. Even with this historic and unprecedented       government response, the consequences of the crisis were       dire. Millions lost their jobs and their homes, cities and       towns across the nation were devastated, and trillions of       dollars in wealth were stripped away from hard working       families and businesses. The aspirations of millions of       Americans were crushed in the financial assault on our       nation, with all too many families and regions still       struggling today from the fall-out of the crisis.        Without any compelling public policy rationale--other than       the deceptive guise of aiding regional and community banks--      this bill now seeks to undo key bulwarks of public protection       designed to avert future crises. Indeed, its provisions would       put us on the road to re-creating conditions that the FCIC       concluded led to the 2008 crisis. While the bill purports to       be the ``Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer       Protection Act'', only the ``regulatory relief'' portion of       its title bears any relationship to reality. Like the       ``Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000'', which       ensured that over-the-counter derivatives would remain hidden       in a dark market, or the House ``Financial CHOICE Act'',       which would eviscerate the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, S.       2155's benign name deliberately obscures its detrimental       effects.        Below are just some of my specific concerns with the       legislation.        First, the bill's provisions to lift the asset threshold       for enhanced prudential standards and supervision from $50       billion to $250 billion would substantially reduce oversight       over 25 of the nation's 38 largest banks, including       institutions of over $100 billion in assets that were deemed       ``Too Big To Fail'' in  [[Page S1655]]       2009. A number of financial institutions with less than $250       billion triggered the need for bailout assistance during the       crisis and history has shown, time and again, that the       failure of financial firms that are not among the largest       mega-banks can pose systemic threats to financial stability.       While the bill purports to allow the Federal Reserve to       ``reach back'' to institutions with more than $100 billion in       assets, those provisions would be legally difficult to       implement, given the likelihood of financial industry       litigation; undermine the very purpose of having enhanced       prudential standards in place prior to the emergence of       risks; and undercut the Federal Reserve's current broad       authority to impose such standards.        Secondly, while existing law allows the Federal Reserve to       tailor financial stability rules for banks over $50 billion       in assets, this bill would now require the Federal Reserve to       do so for the banks still subject to enhanced prudential       standards--those with assets over $250 billion. There is       legitimate concern that this change, from ``may'' to       ``shall'', will be implemented to reduce scrutiny of the 13       biggest banks in our nation.        Third, the bill will weaken stress testing of major       financial institutions by, among other things, reducing the       timeframe for testing from semi-annually for the nation's       biggest banks to ``periodically'', which could be as       infrequently as once every three years. What public purpose       could possibly be served by diminishing the understanding by       regulators of how major financial institutions would fare in       the event of adverse financial and economic conditions?        Fourth, as Secretary Mnuchin himself has indicated, the       legislation is likely to be implemented in a manner that       deregulates 10 foreign megabanks--including but not limited       to firms such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank--heightening       the risk that those banks could infect and debilitate our       nation's financial system.        Fifth, the bill would punch a new hole in leverage ratios,       leading to a substantial reduction in required capital at       certain large banks, a troubling reversal of the drive toward       stronger capital requirements in the wake of the crisis. The       need for enhanced capital at major financial institutions has       been one of the areas of broadest consensus emanating from       the 2008 meltdown. It should also be noted that this proposal       is wholly outside the realm of the bill's stated purpose of       aiding regional and community banks.        Finally, this bill begins to chip away at the post-crisis       reforms made to the woeful mortgage lending standards that       the FCIC found to be a primary cause of the crisis. There is       no sound policy rationale or good public purpose served by       exempting most financial institutions from reporting mortgage       lending data which they already collect; eliminating escrow       requirements for subprime loans; or giving lenders a       liability shield for adjustable rate mortgages underwritten       at low teaser rates.        Based on the above concerns, I urge the Senate to reject S.       2155. Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                 Phil Angelides,                                  Chairman, Financial Crisis Inquiry                                            Commission (2009-2011).     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to discuss  climate change. I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for being a vocal  advocate for addressing this issue.   Climate change is real. It is happening all around us, and we can't  afford to ignore this fact any longer.   This past year, global temperatures were up 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit  over the historical average. Millions of Americans came face-to-face  with extreme weather events like deadly wildfires and powerful  hurricanes, and these extreme weather events are only expected to get  worse.   If no action is taken to significantly reduce greenhouse gas  emissions, the world will warm 7 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.  Rising temperatures will bring increasingly more severe droughts,  destructive floods, deadly wildfires, and strong coastal storms. Rising  temperatures are also warming our oceans, threatening to melt both  polar icecaps.   Last summer, the world watched as an iceberg the size of Delaware  broke free from Antarctica's Larsen C ice shelf. Scientists are now  studying how the entire shelf may collapse and projecting what that  would mean for the even larger West Antarctic Ice Sheet as oceans  continue to warm. That sheet--twice the size of Texas--contains enough  ice to raise sea levels by more than 10 feet.   That much sea rise would submerge more than 25,000 square miles of  the United States that is home to more than 12 million Americans.   Rising seas and the loss of coastal land aren't the only threats we  are facing due to climate change. The effects it is having on our water  supply is deeply troubling.   California is home to the largest agriculture sector in the United  States.  [[Page S1674]]  Our growers need access to plenty of water to help feed the whole  Nation. As temperatures rise, we are seeing fewer and fewer days below  freezing, greatly reducing mountain snowpack which is a critical source  of water in the West. Extreme heat is also making it harder for  agriculture workers to safely work outside. In the Central Valley,  average temperatures are projected to rise 6 degrees by the end of this  century. It is not just people who work outdoors who are feeling the  health effects of climate change. Warmer temperatures are expanding the  range of disease-carrying pests such as ticks and mosquitos. Lyme  disease cases have tripled in the last two decades, and tropical  diseases are now appearing as far north as the Gulf Coast.   Californians know all too well the effects of climate change. We are  still recovering from an historic drought and the most destructive  wildfire season on record. But we may be in another drought by next  year if we don't get more rain soon.   In the absence of leadership from the Federal Government, California  is stepping up and taking action. California is still honoring the  Paris Agreement even though the President pulled the United States out.   By 2030, California will reach 50 percent renewable electricity,  double energy efficiency, and reduce emissions to 40 percent below 1990  levels. California has also grown to become the sixth largest economy  in the world, showing you can still grow your economy while making  smart investments in clean energy.   President Trump and his allies in Congress need to wake up. We can't  afford to ignore an issue as important as climate change any longer.   The American people demand action.
