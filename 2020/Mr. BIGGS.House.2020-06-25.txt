Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding some  time to me.   Madam Speaker, we consider something very serious today, and that is  reformation of policing. And we are, as Federal elected officials,  reaching into State and local police agencies. And if this bill were to  become law, we are imposing the values of us collectively--because that  is the way this works--on those State and local agencies.   Madam Speaker, when we had this debate in the Committee on the  Judiciary, it was often pointed out by some on my side of the aisle  that there was movement afoot to defund, and in some cases, even  eliminate police agencies at the local and State level. And that was  viewed as a ruse, as a deflection from the issue. But in reality,  indeed, this bill itself will have that effect.   Madam Speaker, see, on the front side of it, you have a radical group  of folks, people who are agitating to actually defund or eliminate  police agencies--whether they are affiliated with any of my colleagues,  I don't know. We have had some Members of this body suggest that their  own police departments are cancerous and should be amputated. We have  seen that.   And then on the other hand, though, this bill actually is a rear- guard action.   So you have a frontal attack on State and local police--eliminate  them. Then you have a rear-guard action. That is what this does. It  brings power to control local and State police to this body.   Madam Speaker, as my friend from California said earlier, one of the  most unique things about policing is it is tied to community. So we  need to consider that. We need to consider that this bill will actually  have the impact that so many seem to want, and that is to attenuate  State and local policing. So when we start talking about qualified  limited immunity and the proposed elimination of that in this bill, I  recall that there were several Members from my side of the aisle that  wish to see that. I mean, Mr. McClintock said he would like to see it  done away with. Others said the same thing. But there were also efforts  and attempts to modify the qualified limited immunity rules.   Madam Speaker, now why is this important? Because you need to  understand that QLI does not protect a police officer from charges for  illegal or unconstitutional conduct. It just doesn't. But when you  totally eliminate it, the same protections that are there for, whether  it is a schoolteacher  [[Page H2467]]  or social worker or some other government worker, police officers will  now be left without protection whatsoever. And the result will be, it  will be harder to recruit, train, and retain police officers. We are  not going to have the best police officers we can get anymore.   Madam Speaker, so what is going to happen, then, is you are going to  see fewer police officers. So you are going to see, for instance, in  one of the big cities in my State, hundreds of vacancies already there.  You will see that move to thousands of vacancies. You will see fewer  police on the street. Those police who are there will have to make a  calculated cost-risk-ratio assessment.   And that assessment will be this: If I get involved in this  particular situation, what will be the risk to my family going forward?  If you want police officers to make that calculation, I can guarantee  you they will say it is better if I sit in my car. I will wait till  this situation has been ameliorated and then I will step forward. So  you will have less policing, fewer officers, and that will mean higher  crime. More crime.   Madam Speaker, I can't help but comment on something that was said by  the chairman earlier today, something that was iterated the other day  in our Committee on the Judiciary hearing on this, where a gentleman  said at that time the same thing that the chairman said today, that  effectively antifa was a fiction. It was imaginary. It was like a  unicorn, for Pete's sake.   I refer them to a CNN article from, I believe, it is 2018, where a  couple of CNN reporters interviewed leaders of the antifa movement and  iterated that some members don't want to advocate for violence but  others do because they have an objective and they believe that violence  will help them get their objective. I don't think CNN thinks antifa is  a fiction. Apparently, here, we do, though.   Madam Speaker, but I have to say that as we are talking about taking  away--back to the QLI--qualified immunity, one of the members of the  Committee on the Judiciary said, Well, look, here is what will happen:  We just tell the police officers to go get an E&O policy, get an errors  and omissions policy, like I have to do as an attorney or like doctors  have to do.   Well, I viewed that statement at the time as an accidental omission  that elimination of qualified limited immunity will actually leave  police officers unprotected and subject to the avaricious litigation of  trial attorneys. And I say that as a guy who was a trial attorney. I am  really familiar with how that works.   So this bill will nationalize policing while at the same time result  in higher crime, less policing, less safety. That always means there  will be less respect for rights for individuals in this country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate his  staunch and relentless pursuit of freedom, his defense of our liberty  and this tremendous country.   I am going to take a few minutes and talk about some things that are  going on in the country today that I think need to be addressed. As we  ruminate upon these things and consider the direction of this Nation, I  feel like I need to, quite frankly, express my gratitude to that thin  blue line that spends so much time working, training, making sacrifices  on our behalf, the men and women of the police agencies, local, State,  and Federal.   Every day that they put on that uniform, every shift that they put on  that uniform, at any time day or night, and go out, they understand  that they could be called upon to sacrifice the full measure of who  they are on our behalf, and I thank them.   In fact, I was recently talking to a friend of mine who is a police  officer, and he expressed to me his concerns because what we are seeing  is inexplicable, inexplicable to the rational mind. We understand  protests. We appreciate protests. The First Amendment guarantees us  that right. We get to stand up. We get to express our disapprobation of  our government.   In fact, I think back to Thomas Jefferson, and he was asked one time  why he refused to take action against a particular individual who  slandered him repeatedly. He said: You know what? My friends know the  truth and believe me; my enemies will never believe me; and this  individual can say what they want to say.   We believe that to be true. So we understand protests. What we don't  understand so much is when it becomes lawless rioting where you imperil  somebody's right to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. That is  the problem that we are going through today.   Tonight, apparently, one of the statues or monuments was to be  dragged down tonight. They have rescheduled the spontaneous tear-down  for tomorrow. We will see how that goes for them.   The point is, we recognize that we have God-given freedoms. We set  many of those forth in the Constitution of the United States, and we  have spent 200-some-odd years trying to defend those trying to move  toward a more perfect union.   So I give my gratitude to the men and women of our police agencies.  You may be wearing blue, you may be wearing green like the Border  Patrol, but you all sacrifice for us to have our freedoms.   I want to talk briefly now, if it is okay with my host, about the  bill that was passed out of the House earlier this evening. I have the  privilege of serving with the gentleman from Texas on the Judiciary  Committee, so we got to hear the markup and the efforts to run that  through, and we also got to offer amendments.   I know that the good gentleman offered an amendment. I know I offered  an amendment. They were not entertained. In fact, we were ridiculed for  offering the amendments.   The implication by many in that committee was that by merely offering  an amendment to that bill, we were racist. That was the implication of  what they said. It is unfortunate because nothing could be further from  the truth. We were trying to get at some very important changes in that  [[Page H2510]]  bill, which would make it a viable bill, would make it work, perhaps.   But one of the things I find most intriguing is the elimination  completely of qualified limited immunity, and I will tell you why. We  grant qualified limited immunity to many who work in government. We do  that because they are asked to do a hard job, and they won't be able to  do that job without taking some personal risks.   But the elimination of qualified limited immunity means that not only  will those who are criminally reckless or criminally culpable but those  who are merely negligent or even those who follow the procedures to the  letter who don't violate a constitutional right, who don't violate a  law, will be exposed. Not just them, but all of their finances will be  subject to garnishment, execution. Houses can be lost, their families  left in ruin and desolation.   So I posit that because when we were trying to offer amendments to  actually provide reforms that we thought would be good and necessary,  yet provide some protections, we were rebuffed and told that our  attention was nonsensical. Then, on the other hand, if we would just  grant them passage of the bill, maybe they would allow us to amend it  later.   Well, of course, we couldn't stop the passage of the bill. We are a  majoritarian body. But here is what this means. If you are a police  officer with 19 years in, you know what that means for you? That means  you are sitting in your car when somebody needs help. Why would you get  out and risk your family and everything you have worked for, for 19  years, on a potential liability?   Now, there will be those that make this sacrifice because that is the  kind of men and women who enter the police force. But you put them at  such a serious risk, they have to make an almost risk-reward  calculation every time they encounter a situation that would call for  police contact.   So, that is what happens. There will be many younger on who will do  the same. Others 5 years in, they will say: You know what? I am going  to change careers. I can go somewhere else where I don't expose my  family.   What this ultimately means is more vacancies in the big cities. In my  State, the big cities have hundreds of police vacancies. You won't fill  them because you can't recruit. You can't recruit, you can't train. You  can't train, you can't retain.   You are going to have seriously decimated police forces, certainly,  in the big cities. One of our colleagues, he said: Oh, the police  should just go get E&O insurance like lawyers and doctors. Not really  viable.   They said, well, the department will remain liable. Well, so will the  individual. But if you have joint and several liability and it comes  back to the department, and you have a department with five officers in  it, they can't afford E&O insurance, nor can they afford to take care  of this situation.                                time  2130    Departments will be decimated large and small. What does that mean?  You are going to see increased crime, higher crime rates. That is what  this bill that was voted out of this House today will produce, mark my  words. And right now we are having unrest throughout the Nation.   I tell you that I am grateful for the police from the agencies State,  local, and Federal who are willing to stand in that breach. I call upon  our FBI Director to make arrests, and I call upon our U.S. Attorney  General to charge and prosecute those who have engaged in criminal  conduct.   The number one call I get is for a restoration of law and order. That  is what they want. That is what my constituents want. And it doesn't  matter the political party. That is across the board.   So I conclude with these remarks. This country is at a crossroads. It  could be the leftist, Marxist point of view that we allow to take over  in this Bolshevik-type of conduct that is going on, or we can resort  and restore the law and order and the freedoms that we have long held  dear and make sure those freedoms apply to every citizen in our  society.   I have great and tremendous hope in these people. I know our  President has that same hope, and I believe we are going to get there.  We are going to restore this, and we will be at peace, and we will be  prosperous again.
