 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters of  opposition, one from the North America's  [[Page H8573]]  Building Trades Unions, and one from the United Brotherhood of  Carpenters and Joiners of America.                                            North America's Building                                                   Trades Unions,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million skilled       craft professionals who comprise the 14 national and       international unions of North America's Building Trades       Unions (NABTU), I urge your opposition to H.R. 3441, the Save       Local Business Act. If enacted this piece of legislation       would have a devastating impact on the construction industry       which is dependent upon a variety of contractor and       subcontractor relationships.        Unfortunately, many low road contractors in the       construction industry are becoming increasingly skilled in       shielding themselves from legal liabilities through layers of       subcontractors. Contractors use subcontractors or labor       brokers that either pay their employees off the books or       intentionally misclassify them as 1099 subcontractors. When       that is done, income taxes are not deducted, and Social       Security and Medicare taxes are not paid, as well as       unemployment contributions, workers' compensation premium and       overtime.        H.R. 3441 purports to save businesses by making it       extremely difficult for the National Labor Relations Board       (NLRB) and U.S. Department of Labor to find employers jointly       liable for violations of the law. If enacted it would have       the unintended consequence of promoting a low road       contracting model in which those who willfully commit labor       violations are unaccountable, to the disadvantage of law-      abiding employers and their employees.        This piece of legislation would further induce bad actors       to perfect their efforts to undermine the labor standards in       our industry, making it more challenging for American workers       to achieve access to the middle class. It would also create a       competitive disadvantage to high road contractors who obey       the law. As such, I strongly urge your opposition to this       harmful legislation.            Sincerely,                                                     Sean McGarvey,      President.                                   ____           United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America,                                Washington, DC, September 19, 2017.      Re Opposition to HR 3441, the Save Local Business Act.       Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: I write to       respectfully express our opposition to HR 3441, the Save       Local Business Act, because it will provide a safe haven for       unscrupulous contractors in the construction industry who use       a system of subcontractors to deliberately shield themselves       from liability for abusing workers and stealing jobs away       from law-abiding businesses, even as they knowingly profit       from it.        Regrettably, while most companies in the construction       industry are legitimate, responsible employers, we are also       home to many who excel in illegal employment practices. This       fact is well known and widely acknowledged. The trend is for       contractors to use subcontractors or labor brokers who either       intentionally misclassify employees as independent       contractors or, more often, pay employees off the books. They       find two benefits in their schemes. First, through violating       wage, tax, immigration, workers' compensation and other       employment laws, they can shave up to 30 percent off of their       labor costs and underbid law-abiding businesses. Second, if       laws are enforced, contractors use the subcontract       relationship as a shield against liability and replace       offending subcontractors or labor brokers with others that       will do the same.        There is one vulnerability to their schemes. Under the Fair       Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and National Labor Relations Act       (NLRA) these contractors are frequently joint employers with       their subcontractors or labor brokers. The contractors keep       time, supply building materials, discharge workers, provide       training and daily supervision.        H.R. 3441 closes that door by making it exceedingly       difficult to find joint-employer liability. Under the bill,       businesses cannot be joint employers unless they have direct,       actual and immediate control over the essential terms and       conditions of employment--a remarkable reversal of decades of       law. Moreover, a contractor and labor broker need only split       up responsibility over essential terms, and joint employment       is defeated. Indeed, it is arguable that under such an       arrangement there may be no employer at all.        It cannot be forgotten that construction contractors that       scheme to cheat workers out of overtime, wages and the right       to collective action also fail to comply with federal and       state employment tax laws. In Texas alone federal tax losses       from cheating contractors has been estimated to cost the       federal government over 81 billion.        This is not to suggest that legitimate, law-abiding       contractors should not use subcontractors, or that there are       not thousands of legitimate, law-abiding contractors and       independent contractors across this country. But it must be       recognized that abusive subcontracting schemes as described       above are also prevalent in our industry and that this bill       would make it even harder to crack down on these illegal       practices.        Despite its name, HR 3441 is a blue print to violate the       law and drive law-abiding employers out of business and make       it more difficult for working men and women to reach the       middle class. The law needs to protect workers and       responsible businesses--not put them in jeopardy.            Very truly yours,                                               Douglas J. McCarron,                                                 General President.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3441, which is  falsely called Save Local Business Act. The new name should be ``Crush  Local Workers Act.''   I am happy to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  I look forward to helping small businesses and helping them raise  wages, but this bill does neither. It empowers corporations, and it  depresses wages.   Employers are relying more and more on subcontractors and permanent  temporaries. These temporary staffing agencies employ around 3 million  people. That is about one-fifth of all the new jobs created since 2009.   I have fought to raise wages for over two decades for workers. This  bill lets corporations keep wages low by subcontracting out their work.  They are subcontracting their conscience to put profits over people.   This bill makes it nearly impossible for workers to hold temporary  staffing agencies responsible for unfair labor practices or wage theft.  It denies employees a voice in the workplace. It prevents workers from  joining unions, collective bargaining, which go ultimately to help  raise wages.   We should be lifting workers' wages up, not trying to crush them.   I will remind our colleagues that, from 1930 to 1984, the courts were  the ones who were making these joint employer decisions, and it was  Ronald Reagan's administration who first made this change. It was the  Reagan administration who first made this change.   The Obama administration brought it back to where it was, yet,  apparently, people are forgetting those very important facts.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to vote against this  crush local workers act.
