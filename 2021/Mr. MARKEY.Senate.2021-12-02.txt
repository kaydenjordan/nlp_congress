 Mr. President, I want to spend a quick moment saying a  fond thank-you and farewell to a staff member of mine who is leaving.   My deep gratitude to Ashley Harrington, who is off to great  adventures. Our sadness at her leaving is matched only by our  excitement for her as she starts her next chapter.   Thank you for your dedication, your humor, your invaluable skills. We  are going to miss you throughout our entire office.                       Nomination of Rachael S. Rollins    Mr. President, I come here today to speak in support of Suffolk  County District Attorney Rachael Rollins, nominee to serve as U.S.  attorney for the District of Massachusetts.   The fact that I and my Senate partner, Senator Warren, have to come  to the floor at all in support of this qualified, respected, effective  law enforcement official is a testimony to the unprecedented  partisanship of my Republican colleagues. It is truly outrageous.   Before I share more about District Attorney Rollins' record of  accomplishment--a record that my Republican colleagues have  intentionally distorted and mischaracterized--I want to explain how  politically partisan this U.S. attorney nomination process has become.   In September, the Judiciary Committee held a rollcall vote on Rachael  Rollins' nomination to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of  Massachusetts. She was voted out of committee on an 11-to-11 vote. All  Democrats voted aye; all Republicans opposed the nomination.   With this vote, Judiciary Committee Republicans eviscerated a three- decade precedent of voice votes for U.S. attorney nominees for all 50  States--every single time. The committee had last held a rollcall vote  on a U.S. attorney nominee in 1993. And based on a review of available  materials, before the 117th Congress, the Judiciary Committee had only  ever held a rollcall vote on three U.S. attorney nominees: in 1993,  1982, and 1975.   The Senate last required cloture on a U.S. attorney nominee in 1993  but ultimately confirmed that nominee by voice vote. And--listen to  this--the Senate last held a rollcall vote on the floor of the Senate  on a U.S. attorney nominee in 1975. We have held more impeachment votes  on the floor of the Senate than votes on U.S. attorney nominees since  1975.   This obstruction of District Attorney Rollins' nomination is  unwarranted, unfounded, and unprecedented. Let me underscore that last  point. During the Trump administration, Judiciary Committee Democrats  agreed to voice vote all 85 U.S. attorney nominees who came before  them, despite disagreements with multiple nominees' records and  ideology. All 85 of those U.S. attorneys in the Trump era were  processed by the Judiciary Committee and received a voice vote with no  recorded opposition. And the Senate, likewise, confirmed all 85 by  unanimous consent on the Senate floor during the Donald Trump era.   The opposition to Rachael Rollins is nothing more than a deeply  partisan ploy to score political points at the expense of the record of  a respected, qualified, courageous, Black, female, progressive district  attorney. It is offensive, and it is not in service to public safety-- in Massachusetts or across our Nation.   Let me tell you about District Attorney Rachael Rollins and why her  record has garnered supported from all corners of the law enforcement  community in Massachusetts and New England and from Republicans and  Democrats alike.   District Attorney Rollins has public safety in her blood. Her father,  a second-generation Irish American, fought in the Vietnam war and later  worked as a corrections officer. Her maternal grandparents are from  Barbados, and her mother is a first-generation American.   She represents the very best of what this country is all about:  opportunity, public service, and plain old hard work.   As the district attorney for the county encompassing Boston and  surrounding cities, District Attorney Rollins has a demonstrated record  of success as a prosecutor. She leads an office of 300 employees,  including more than 150 lawyers who handle 25,000 new criminal case  filings and 1,000 criminal investigations annually. She leads a very  busy office efficiently and effectively.   On the most serious crimes, her record is unassailable. In 2019,  Rollins' first full year in office, the homicide unit's number of  completed trials increased by 21 percent. Boston homicides declined by  31 percent in 2019, making it the lowest number in decades.   And she aggressively prosecutes drug trafficking. Between January 1,  2021, and October 12, 2021, just this year, the Suffolk County DA's  office has prosecuted 147 trafficking cases. Of those cases, 98  involved charges of trafficking fentanyl, accounting for 67 percent of  total drug trafficking prosecutions. District Attorney Rollins has  prosecuted more drug traffickers than her predecessor.   I have personally met with and talked with District Attorney Rollins  on multiple occasions about the opioid epidemic that is being fueled by  fentanyl. There is no one more dedicated to ending that scourge than  she is. She is committed to using the DA's office to hold fentanyl drug  traffickers fully accountable, and her record proves that.   Her record on investigations is equally remarkable. In 2020, the  homicide unit expanded its investigations by 44 percent. The major  felony unit increased its by 22 percent, the human trafficking and  exploitation unit by 19 percent, and the special prosecutions unit by  33 percent. Under District Attorney Rollins' leadership, her office is  as active as it has ever been in going after the most serious crimes in  Suffolk County.  [[Page S8890]]    But her excellence doesn't end there. District Attorney Rollins has  demonstrated a commitment to working with law enforcement to advance  community safety and build trust between the community and law  enforcement officers. She and her office are a true partner for  colleagues, and it is reflected in the coordination that they  prioritize.   In June of 2020, she organized a key discussion with law enforcement  executives from Greater Boston to have an open dialogue about policing  practices in light of the racial reckoning that followed the murder of  George Floyd. With her leadership, District Attorney Rollins and the  law enforcement executives signed a letter committing to change and  ensuring that there would be open communication on that topic.   District Attorney Rollins recognized the historic moment law  enforcement was confronting in the wake of the Floyd murder, and she  actively reached out to her law enforcement partners to show a united  front in their commitment to justice. Rachael Rollins is proof that you  can enforce laws and promote justice and that the community wants both.   As a result of this leadership, the Suffolk County law enforcement  executives wrote a letter in support of her nomination to serve as U.S.  attorney for the District of Massachusetts. In that letter, they  highlighted the respect she has for the work they do to keep  communities safe.   And in the wake of two incidents of hate against the Jewish community  that occurred this summer, District Attorney Rollins led the response,  using the resources of her office to investigate the incidents  transparently and fully. She personally ensured that there would be a  focus on this issue. She attended vigils for both events to ensure that  there would be a commitment that was heard that the safety of the  communities that had been directly impacted would be protected.   In a letter from the Anti-Defamation League of New England, it said  of her actions: In the aftermath of the incidents . . . she  demonstrated true allyship and solidarity with the affected  communities. The importance of her commitment to this ideal cannot be  overstated.   Rachael Rollins is a prosecutor at her core, but she also believes in  restorative justice and is one of Massachusetts' greatest advocates for  victims of crime. The local organizations that advocate for the rights  of victims and their families--including Mothers for Justice &  Equality, the Children's Advocacy Center of Suffolk County, the Boston  Area Rape Crisis Center, and the Boston Medical Center's Violence  Intervention Advocacy Program--all wrote letters in support of Rollins'  nomination.   Mothers for Justice wrote that District Attorney Rollins'  ``determination to bring [to justice] those who commit crimes against  community is needed at the highest levels of Federal prosecution.''   The Children's Advocacy Center of Suffolk County describes her as ``a  leader who clearly prioritizes the needs of children and families-- bringing an approach which is both victim-centered and squarely focused  on offender accountability.''   District Attorney Rollins is clear-eyed in her commitment to  justice--justice for victims, justice for families, justice for  children, and justice for the communities that have not historically  benefited from a system that has punished color, class, and creed. She  is working to restore faith in the system by building a system that  works for everyone.   Before she was district attorney, from 2007 to 2011, she served as  assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts. There she  prosecuted civil and criminal cases, defended the Federal Government  and Agencies in civil suits, and recovered damages for fraud and false  claims submitted to the government.   Based on this record, she has the support of many law enforcement  organizations and political leaders.   About District Attorney Rollins, a group of several current and  former major city police wrote:         We do not always get along. In fact, we have disagreed       strongly on issues. What we can say is that she respects us       and the work we do to keep our communities safe. She can       admit when she is wrong. She can also be incredibly       persuasive when she is right. The constant throughout every       encounter we have is a mutual respect and a willingness to       learn from each other.    So, for my Republican colleagues, let me share the bottom line  statistic: Crime is down in Boston. Despite the continued rise in crime  nationwide in 2021, murders in Boston have dropped by one-third so far  this year. According to data from the Boston Police Department, there  have been 32 homicides in the first 9 months of 2021, down from 45  homicides this time last year. Murder is down in Boston. The city also  saw a decrease in many types of violent crime, including domestic  assault. Property crimes, such as auto thefts and burglary, are also  down in the city of Boston during her tenure as our district attorney.   We know there is much more work to be done to ensure public safety  and to promote justice, but under District Attorney Rollins'  leadership, Boston is on the right trajectory.   Most of what we have heard from my Republican colleagues--in the  committee hearing and out here on the floor--is simply untrue. Suffolk  County District Attorney Rachael Rollins is a strong Black woman,  committed to racial justice with a better record on crime than other  old-school prosecutors, and it just plain scares them.   Her approach scares them because it is working in Boston. It can be a  model for the rest of the country. Rachael Rollins is not soft on  crime; she is smart on crime. Yes, District Attorney Rollins is a  progressive prosecutor. But more importantly, she is an effective  prosecutor. Her extensive law enforcement credentials and proven track  record of reducing crime and supporting victims is clear, and it is  undeniable. She is the right candidate for U.S. Attorney in  Massachusetts, and Senator Warren and I deeply and proudly recommend  her to the Senate for confirmation.   I have known District Attorney Rollins since she babysat for my  brother's family. She is a dear friend and a loved friend, and I have  been so fortunate to know her. And Massachusetts has been so fortunate  to have her as one of our top law enforcement officials. She is one of  the smartest, most effective, most respected leaders in the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and her record proves that,  unequivocally.   Despite the Republican effort to politicize her nomination and  mischaracterize her record, I am confident that she will be confirmed  as our next U.S. Attorney.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on this discharge motion, as  unnecessary as it should be, and to support the confirmation of Rachael  Rollins as the next U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.   I yield the floor.
