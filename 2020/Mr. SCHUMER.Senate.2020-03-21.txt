 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, negotiations on the third phase of the  coronavirus legislation went late into the night last night and will  continue through the day today.   I have spoken to Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Mnuchin several times,  as well as President Trump, to keep them apprised as we continue the  work through a number of issues. In fact, I just had a very good, very  detailed phone call with Secretary Mnuchin--or ``Steve and Chuck,'' as  he prefers to call it. We discussed many of the outstanding issues, and  we are making very good progress. I have every expectation that this  progress will continue throughout the day. Democratic negotiators will  meet with their Republican counterparts throughout the day to continue  hammering out the details.   The Senate is here, we are working, and we are all eager to come to a  bipartisan agreement as soon as humanly possible.   There are still a number of priorities that Democrats continue to  fight for in the package that is now being assembled.   As I have made clear, Democrats have two primary goals, broadly  defined, in this next phase of coronavirus legislation. One is to  address the impending public health crisis head-on with a massive  infusion of resources to our hospitals, our medical facilities, and our  other public health infrastructure. The second priority is to put  workers first. In fact, our proposal, which we laid out as early as  Monday, is entitled ``Workers First.''   Democrats want to do as much as possible to prepare our healthcare  system, and we want to give Americans who are most immediately affected  by the economic slowdown ample relief so they can weather the storm  over the long haul. So, on healthcare, Democrats are fighting for a  Marshall Plan for our public health infrastructure.   We need hundreds of billions of dollars for ventilators, testing  equipment, gloves, masks, ICU beds, and PPE, or personal protective  equipment, for our frontline medical workers.   I spoke to the head of the nurses union in New York yesterday. They  are short of masks. These brave nurses are going to work, doing their  job, but they don't have the right equipment that they need.   Money must go to our hospitals and our nursing homes, our community  health centers, and our State and local governments. This can neither  wait for a future bill nor a supplemental package. We need it right  now, not 2 weeks from now.   A senior doctor at Maimonides hospital in Brooklyn, NY, wrote to me  yesterday. Here is what the doctor said:         I'm writing to you in a move of desperation. Currently, we       have severe shortages in the basic necessities needed to       fight the disease and protect health care workers. Disposable       masks and gowns are in such short supply, we re-use them       until they fall apart. We don't have adequate supplies of       supportive medicines. Beds, ventilators, nurses and critical       care doctors are also needed. We need a national response to       this disease.    I urge my colleagues to hear the urgency and strain in this brave  doctor's voice, the desperation in his warning. If we don't provide  these resources right now, what is already a dire situation will--not  could--become catastrophic. It will affect hospitals everywhere: big- city hospitals, medium-sized suburban hospitals, and small rural  hospitals. Many of them will go under in a short period of time.   So we need a Marshall Plan for our public health infrastructure, and  it must be in this legislation, in the opinion of the Democratic  caucus.   As we have made clear from the beginning, we must also put workers  first. That means a dramatic expansion and reform of unemployment  insurance. We need unemployment insurance on steroids. Some are calling  it ``employment insurance.'' It must be easier to access. It must cover  many more Americans during this crisis, including Americans who have  nontraditional employment.   It must provide more generous benefits. Workers who are laid off  should receive a paycheck equal to what they were receiving while  employed. Workers must be protected, whether they work for businesses  small, medium, or large.   The plan we have would allow them to get unemployment insurance  quickly. They would be furloughed. So they would stay as employees-- even though they weren't working--of their employer, so that when, God- willing, this crisis ends, they can go back to their employer and the  businesses that are now closed and decimated can start running again.   We propose that this be not just a one-shot deal but a paycheck every  work period, and it should go for as long as the crisis lasts. We want  to fund it for at least 4 months, maybe 6. If the crisis ends more  quickly, of course, we might be able to terminate it, but we need to  give the workers of America the assurance that they will have  paychecks. The same amount of resources that they had before this  crisis they should have now, and it will occur ongoing until we beat  this horrible disease.   There are other things we must do for American families as well. We  should greatly expand paid sick leave and family leave. We need to  expand food assistance. The kids who go to school get their best meals,  many of them, at the school lunch or school breakfast. They need to be  fed. Others who lose work, they need food help right away.   I believe our students are under strain. Many of their colleges are  gone. Those who have just gotten out of school have difficult  employment possibilities. We should cancel student loan payments during  the course of the crisis, both principal and interest.   I spoke to the President about this yesterday. He said he was  sympathetic. He said at the podium yesterday that interest payments he  would cancel, but I think we need to do more.   We also must rescue small and medium-sized businesses with a generous  loan program, so long as they protect their workers. They have other  expenses. We will take care of their workers under the expanded  unemployment program and on the small business program, but they have  other expenses. We don't want them going under when these are good,  ongoing businesses that did nothing wrong. They have to come back. So  small business really needs help.   And, if we are going to bail out any industry, particularly the big  companies, we have to include strict conditions that put workers first:  no layoffs, no salary cuts for workers or salary increases for  corporate executives, guarantees that workers be rehired at their  previous wages once the crisis abates, and no stock buybacks.   I have heard the President mention that he is against stock buybacks  in the past. So when I called him yesterday, I said: Make it clear. It  is not in the bill that has been put before us, but Democrats will  insist that it be in any proposal once we come together in a bipartisan  way, as we are doing now.   Democrats have several other priorities, as well, and we are working  through each of them with our Republican colleagues even as we speak.  As I said, I had a wonderful--well, I had a very good--conversation. I  will not go too far, but I had a very good conversation with Secretary  Mnuchin, and we are making good progress on many of the issues that we  Democrats feel are important.   One other need, by the way--because we do have other needs--is that I  want to emphasize that one of the issues that is quickly emerging is  that State and local governments are running out of cash and may soon  be broke. Governors, mayors, county executives, county officials, town  officials--Democratic and Republican alike--are clamoring for help. We  must provide it. They are on the frontlines.   So, in conclusion, I have no illusions about the difficulty of  putting together legislation this momentous in this short a period of  time, but all parties are working in good faith and as fast as possible  to see that we accomplish the task at hand.   Of course, far greater than our challenges here in Congress are the  challenges that now confront the American people. Working families are  at home without a paycheck, with no knowledge of when the next one  might arrive. Small businesses are watching the labor of their lives  teeter on the brink of collapse.    I spoke to a small business owner. He had spent 8 years getting his  business to be successful. It just had begun to be that way, and now  his doors are closed and his employees are furloughed. We have to help  people like that.  [[Page S1881]]    Our healthcare workers, men and women who perform extraordinarily  difficult jobs even in ordinary times, are now asked to bear additional  burdens. But know this, healthcare workers: You are our heroes. America  stands with you, and Democrats are fighting to help every one of the  emergency workers during this crisis.   So, to our healthcare workers and to every American out there finding  their way through these challenging times: Stay strong. We are working  to provide you the relief to see you through the crisis. We will get it  done--Democrats, Republicans--together. Once the scourge of this virus  has passed, we will come back stronger and even more resilient.   President Franklin D. Roosevelt told a generation facing its own  national crisis:         This great Nation will endure as it [always] has endured.       It will revive and it will prosper . . . [because there] is       no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously.    With wisdom and with courage, we will endeavor to finish the job here  in Congress--whatever it takes.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
