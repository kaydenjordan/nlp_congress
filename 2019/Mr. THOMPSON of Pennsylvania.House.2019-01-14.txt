 Madam Speaker, one week from today, our  Nation celebrates the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Tomorrow is  Dr. King's birthday. He would be turning 90 if his life wasn't  violently cut short in 1968.   Madam Speaker, it was November 3, 1983, when President Ronald Reagan  signed a bill to mark the third Monday of every January as Martin  Luther King Jr. Day. The holiday officially began 3 years later.   Born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. King was the son  of a Baptist minister. He went on to receive his own doctoral degree in  theology.   Dr. King was a powerful orator, and his talents were on full display  when he delivered his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech in 1963. 250,000  people gathered outside the Lincoln Memorial to hear his speech, which  peacefully called for the end of racism. It is still regarded as one of  the most influential moments in American history.   Madam Speaker, I am thankful for all that Dr. King did to advance the  civil rights of all Americans, and I am honored to commemorate his life  and legacy.                            ____________________
