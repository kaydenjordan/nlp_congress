 Mr. President, before Chairman Roberts leaves, I just  wanted to come down and lend my voice to him and Senators Boozman,  Thune, and Hoeven, and to Chairman Roberts and his staff for his work,  and the Presiding Officer. Thank you for spelling me in the Chair  momentarily. Senator Hoeven and his team have done great work as well.   As Chairman Roberts just said, there was no reason to have gone down  this path and injected all of this partisan uncertainty, holding  farmers and ranchers and their communities and their lenders and their  welders and their truckers hostage over the last 48 hours. It served no  policy purpose, and it continues to diminish public trust in this  institution and our ability to serve our people.   So I just want to commend you and Senator Hoeven and your teams for  the work that you have done.
