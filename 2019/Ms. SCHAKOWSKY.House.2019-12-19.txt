 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the U.S.-Mexico- Canada trade agreement, the first trade agreement I have ever voted for  in my more than 20 years in Congress.   I am proud to be on the working group that helped negotiate this  agreement, and I thank the chairman of that group, Richie Neal.   It is far better than the original NAFTA, and it is far better than  the deeply flawed trade agreement that President Trump handed to us.   For example, he tried to tuck into it a huge gift to Big Pharma that  would have raised the cost of medicine throughout our hemisphere. But  from day one, I insisted that that provision be removed. Today, it is  gone.   Without the work of the working group, without the help of the  Speaker of the House, without Rich Trumka, the president of the AFL- CIO, we would not be voting on this today.   Is it a perfect thing? No, it is not. For example, there is a big  gift to Big Tech provided in this called section 230, which gives a  liability shield for all the companies and the platforms, for all the  content that they have on those platforms.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to Ambassador  Lighthizer.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, August 6, 2019.      Hon. Robert E. Lighthizer,      U.S. Trade Representative,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ambassador Lighthizer: We write to express our concern       regarding the inclusion of Article 19.17 in the United       States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).        In many respects, the language of Article 19.17 mirrors       that of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.       Section 230 shields online platforms from some of the       liability associated with third-party content posted on those       platforms.        As you may know, the effects of Section 230 and the       appropriate role of such a liability shield have become the       subject of much debate in recent years. While we take no view       on that debate in this letter, we find it inappropriate for       the United States to export language mirroring Section 230       while such serious policy discussions are ongoing. For that       reason, we do not believe any provision regarding       intermediary liability protections of the type created by       Article 19.17 are ripe for inclusion in any trade deal going       forward. Given that our Committee closely oversees Section       230 and all portions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,       we also hope in the future the Office of the United States       Trade Representative will consult our committee in advance of       negotiating on these issues.        Thank you for your attention to this important matter.            Sincerely,      Frank Pallone,        Chairman.      Greg Walden,        Ranking Member.     Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to vote for the trade  agreement.
