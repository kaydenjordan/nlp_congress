 Mr. President, a landmark report from the International  Energy Agency says countries need to move faster and more aggressively  to cut planet-warming pollution.   That is from the New York Times this morning. The International  Energy Agency, for the first time, is recommending specific steps to  accomplish the drastic cuts in carbon emissions that nearly every  developed country has pledged to achieve. One of the principal  recommendations is ``the rapid phase-out of gasoline-powered  vehicles.''    It just so happens that this report lands on the same day that  President Biden is in Michigan to celebrate the release of a new line  of electric pickup trucks. As one of the best-selling cars in America,  replacing gasoline pickups with electric pickups could save us huge  amounts of carbon.   But we shouldn't stop there. Transportation still accounts for  roughly one-third of America's carbon output. There is no way the  United States can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions without looking  out how Americans drive.   So I have put forward an ambitious, comprehensive proposal to  accelerate our country's transition to zero-emission vehicles. We call  it Clean Cars for America. The goal of that plan is that by 2040, all  vehicles on the road should be clean. The International Energy Agency,  by the way, recommends the world reach that target by 2050. So we beat  them by 10 years, if this proposal goes into effect.   My plan would help us get there 10 years ahead of time. It is one of  the many reasons that President Biden put Clean Cars for America at the  heart of his American Jobs Plan, something I hope and expect he will  discuss today in Michigan.   I want to thank the Biden administration. They have been open to many  new ideas: the American Competitive Innovation Act that we will be  debating today and Clean Cars for America, which they have more or less  adopted in whole and put into their Build Back Better plan.   The benefits would be far-reaching, far beyond the subject of climate  change. For a long time, critics have been saying you can't help the  environment without hurting the economy or costing jobs. Not so, it is  actually the reverse.   We negotiated the Clean Cars for America proposal with the unions,  with the environmental groups, and with the auto companies, and all  three are onboard. The good news is that Clean Cars for America would  create tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs in battery  manufacturing, construction, and auto making. Through targeted  investments, it would put Americans to work all across the country  building charging stations for a new fleet of electric cars. Right now,  China leads the world in the electric vehicle market, overtaking us in  2015. We need to take back the initiative and create thousands upon  thousands of good-paying jobs as we do.   I am very glad that the Biden administration has taken this proposal  and adopted it. We worked, as I said, long and hard, for the first time  on a major  [[Page S2554]]  environmental proposal to bring our friends in the union movement  onboard so that workers saw that their future--a bright future, a  prosperous future--was with clean energy, that we weren't excluding  them but including them.   That is why, unlike many proposals in the past, my Clean Cars for  America proposal unites the environmental community, the labor  movement, and major automakers. The Sierra Club, UAW, Ford, and GM are  all supportive. Isn't that amazing? Isn't that great?   When you want to get something done in Washington, you need to build  a broad and powerful coalition for support. That is what we did with  Clean Cars for America. The Senate and the country should prioritize it  this year.                            ____________________     Now, on the Endless Frontier Act, last night the Senate  voted to move forward with the Endless Frontier Act with a vote of 86  to 11. It is likely that today the Senate will take another step to  begin debate on the bill. It is my intention to have an open,  bipartisan amendment process.   The Endless Frontier Act already includes more than 20 bipartisan  amendments from the Commerce Committee, under the leadership of Senator  Cantwell and Ranking Member Wicker. I will expect we will consider  several more here on the floor of the Senate.   Later today, I will file a substitute amendment that pulls together  more bipartisan legislation from across Senate committees into our  comprehensive bill that we are now calling the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act.   In addition to Chairwoman Cantwell and Ranking Member Wicker, I want  to thank Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch of Foreign  Relations; Chairman Brown and Ranking Member Toomey of Banking;  Chairman Peters and Ranking Member Portman of HSGAC; Chairwoman Murray  and Ranking Member Burr of HELP; and Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member  Grassley, and Senator Klobuchar of Judiciary.   Finally, I want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators working on  the CHIPS and 5G proposals throughout the process--not only Senators  Cantwell and Wicker but Senators Warner, Kelly, Cornyn, Cotton, Leahy,  and Stabenow.   Restoring America's competitive edge should unite Senators from both  sides of the aisle. The foundation of the past century of American  prosperity has been our leadership in science, technology, and  innovation. If we are going to win the next century, the United States  needs to be the one discovering the next groundbreaking technology.   We had that opportunity, for instance, with tech, and we lead the  world because of early investments by NSF and DARPA. We have the  opportunity now to set our country on a path to outinnovate,  outproduce, and outcompete the world in emerging industries of the 21st  century, with profound consequences for our economic and national  security. If we don't lead in science and innovation, we will fall way  behind. If we don't lead in science and innovation, millions of good- paying jobs that will be available to this generation and the next one  will go poof--gone. We have no choice. We have no choice.   We have always led, and now we have fallen behind. Other countries  are investing more than we are. They are not as good at it as we are.  They are not as innovative as we are. But if they put in the dollars  and we don't, woe is us. Woe is us.   So when you ask Americans why they are upset and they say: We are not  sure about our future. We are not sure if our children will have better  jobs than we will. We are not sure that our jobs will grow. This is the  way to do it. This is the key. This unlocks our future to a bright,  sunny America, the way we have always had, but we may have lost in the  last few years, at least to some extent.   I am so glad that this legislation, which we worked so hard on, has  bipartisan support. It is a place where we can unite America and say we  will stay No. 1, and we are giving our country, our universities, our  businesses, our workers tools to do it                            ____________________     Next is the EEOC CRA. Today, the Senate will vote to  overturn yet another terrible regulation approved during the final days  of the Trump administration, a rule that actually makes it harder for  victims of employment discrimination to get justice.   For decades, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC,  has protected employees against workplace discrimination. If a worker  believes they were targeted by their employer because of their age,  their sex, their religion, their disability, or any other unlawful  basis--their race--the EEOC can conduct an investigation and begin a  conciliation process.   Rather than force employees to sue in court, where well-heeled  corporations can afford high-priced lawyers and the plaintiff almost  has no chance of winning, conciliation gives the EEOC the power to  fight on workers' behalf against discriminatory behavior and win some  speedy and effective results.   So, of course, the Trump administration, in another example of their  callousness, another example where they talk about working people but  don't care about them and do things to help them, sort of nastily-- almost viciously--changed the rules on conciliation at the EEOC to put  a large thumb down on the scale in favor of corporations and against  individuals who were discriminated against or at least who allege  discrimination, making it easier for corporations to slow down  investigations and even retaliate against workers.   Today's vote will use the Congressional Review Act process to  immediately repeal this rule change.   At every opportunity, the Trump administration seemingly relished in  making life harder for working Americans, while stacking the deck in  favor of unscrupulous corporations. Now that Donald Trump is President  no more--thank God, I say--we have a chance to undo this terrible rule  and give workers the confidence that the Federal Government is in their  corner.                            ____________________     Finally, on Asian hate crimes, I am delighted the House  will pass the Anti-Asian hate crimes bill today, which passed the  Senate last month with overwhelming bipartisan support. Once the  legislation is approved by the House, it will go directly to the  President's desk. I expect it will be signed into law later this week.   Discrimination against Asian Americans is, sadly, not a new  phenomenon in our Nation's history, but the pandemic brought old biases  and prejudices back to the foreground.   This legislation will strengthen law enforcement's ability to detect,  deter, and prosecute hate crimes of all varieties, especially hate  crimes involving Asian Americans. It sends a powerful message of  solidarity to all our friends in the Asian American community. It is so  important, so vital, so strong, and an important piece of the puzzle of  how we build a better future in America.   I thank my colleagues from both Chambers, from Senators Hirono and  Duckworth in the Senate to Representative Meng in the House and all  those who improved the legislation through the amendment process here  in the Senate.   Today, we are another step closer to making progress in the fight  against racial discrimination and violence aimed at Asian Americans in  recent months. The Senate can be proud it took the lead.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Good afternoon.    I am adding a little stability and friendship to these  august proceedings, I hope you realize.                                Vote on Motion    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the motion.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  committee-reported substitute amendment.    Mr. President, I call up amendment 1502.    Mr. President, I am going to speak on this amendment for  a minute, then we will move to the motion to discharge Kristen Clarke.   Mr. President, I have just filed a substitute amendment to the  Endless Frontier Act that will pull together bipartisan legislation  from across the Senate committees into a single comprehensive bill to  restore America's competitive edge.   This new bill will be called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act,  and it will include bipartisan legislation from the Foreign Relations  Committee to strengthen our alliances and hold China accountable for  predatory trade practices; bipartisan legislation from the Homeland  Security committee to invest in AI, cyber security, and policies to  make sure American taxpayer money is used to buy American products;  bipartisan legislation from the HELP Committee to protect our research  and invest in STEM; bipartisan legislation from the Judiciary Committee  to bolster antitrust enforcement; bipartisan legislation from Banking  to sanction predatory behavior from the Chinese Communist Party. And,  very importantly, the substitute amendment will now include a historic  $52 billion investment to make sure the United States stays on the  cutting edge of chip production--semiconductor chip production--which  is essential for this country's economy, including our auto industry,  our tech industry, and our military.   Again, this legislation will now include a historic and immediate  infusion of Federal money in the semiconductor industry to boost  domestic production and shore up critical supply chains.   This is a very big deal. It fits in with the concept of the Endless  Frontier Act, and I am very pleased it will be in the bill.   American manufacturing has suffered rather dramatically from a chip  shortage. We have all heard about auto plants in our States that are  closed or operating in reduced capacity because they can't get the  chips. The shortage in our tech industry shows how vulnerable our  supply chains are.   We simply cannot rely on foreign processors for chips. This amendment  will make sure we don't have to.   America invented the semiconductor chip. We are still at the cutting  edge of research, but fewer than 12 percent of them are made in  America. And if this bill doesn't pass, it will go down to 6. Other  countries--notably, China--will become the leaders, not just in chip  manufacturing and chip production but in the many industries that  depend on chips. We cannot let that happen.   The best way to do that is to add this amendment to the bill, which I  have just done, and make sure it passes.   The substitute amendment is dramatic not only in terms of chips but  in terms of American investment in research, in science, and  innovation. When we invest in research and science and innovation,  millions of good-paying jobs follow, and the American economy leads the  world. Our failure to invest will displace us from that position and  all too soon.  [[Page S2569]]    All told, the substitute amendment will mean that the legislation we  are about to debate is the product of a half a dozen Senate committees,  with input from just about every Member of the Senate. This  legislation, I am proud to say, is thoroughly bipartisan, and it shows.  When our colleagues will work with us, we want to work together  whenever we can.   Now, these policies may sound complicated, but they are propelled by  a simple motivation--making sure the United States stays the global  economic leader. In the 20th century, American prosperity was anchored  in our unmatched capacity for innovation and invention. Researchers at  American universities and laboratories fashioned marvels that changed  the way we work, the way we communicate, and the way we live. American  workers and businesses brought those innovations to a global market,  producing the largest middle class in the world and an almost innate  optimism about the future.   Here, unfortunately, in the 21st century, America is falling behind.  Other countries are investing more in their economies and training  their focus on beating the United States to the key technologies of the  future. If we don't step up now--now, not 2 years from now--and if we  don't step up in a big and bold way, we risk missing out on a  generation of good-paying jobs, millions and millions of them. We risk  ceding the mantle of global economic leadership to our adversaries. We  risk losing the sunny optimism that has defined the American character  for generations.   This is an issue where we can unite our country behind the goal of  keeping America No. 1 in science and in technology, and this bill puts  us a giant step closer to keeping America one step ahead for decades to  come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session.
