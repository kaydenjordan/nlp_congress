 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of former Congressman  Jack Edwards, who will celebrate his 90th birthday next Thursday.   Congressman Edwards' service to his beloved country started long  before his 20 honorable years as a Representative for Alabama's First  District.   As just a teenager, Jack left home and pursued something larger than  himself and enlisted in the Marine Corps, where he later earned the  rank of sergeant.   Years later, Jack brought his military background to the Halls of  Congress with the first wave of Alabama Republicans.   Jack worked alongside five U.S. Presidents during his time in office  to ensure that our national defense was funded at the necessary levels,  which ultimately brought an end to the Cold War and led to the  dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1989.   But as a fiscal conservative, he never shied away from speaking his  mind about ineffective programs that simply needed to go.   Jack, you were a people's champion in these Halls, a wonderful mentor  for me, and I can only hope to be remembered as you are. But more  importantly, I am honored by your friendship and your continued  support. I look forward to celebrating your 90th birthday with you next  week.                            ____________________
