 Mr. Speaker, I am Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi  from the Eighth District of Illinois. I have the honor to represent the  hardworking families of Chicago's west and northwest suburbs. My  constituents, like so many other Americans, are finding it harder and  harder to get ahead.   Creating good-paying jobs is my number one job, and growing and  strengthening the middle class is my primary mission. I believe working  and middle class families must be able to earn a living wage, have  quality health care, and educate their children well.   These challenges are not insurmountable, but we must address them  immediately. We need to make sure that working and middle class  families can achieve economic security. I believe that, if you work  hard and play by the rules, you and your children can and should  succeed in America. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues  in this Chamber to make that a reality.                            ____________________
