 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the  House, the Senate, and the administration to adopt a disaster relief  bill before December 7.   In recent months, we have witnessed catastrophes that have struck our  Nation coast to coast, from wildfires across California, flooding in  the Carolinas, and the incredible loss of agriculture in my home State  of Georgia from Hurricane Michael.   Agriculture is the largest and oldest economic driver in the State of  Georgia. The past few years, farmers have faced low commodity prices,  unfair trade practices from foreign countries, labor shortages, and low  crop yields that have created a strain on their businesses. They have  also hurt the surrounding rural economies. Hurricane Michael made all  of these past losses pale in comparison.   Following the storm, the likes of which Georgia has not seen in over  a century, President Trump and Vice President Pence visited my district  and heard firsthand from farmers about how they went from having the  best crops to no crops in a matter of hours. This disaster has been  heartbreaking, and without additional Federal assistance, it will break  the back of Georgia's rural economy.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan issue; this is an American issue.  I call on this Chamber to act now to help these farmers and others  across our great Nation who are struggling with the aftermath of these  disasters.                            ____________________
