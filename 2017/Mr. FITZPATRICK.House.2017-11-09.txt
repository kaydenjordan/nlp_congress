 Mr. Speaker, on Veterans Day, we salute all those  who have defended our great Nation and served in uniform. We say a  profound thank you for so bravely offering yourself and your services  for the betterment of our Nation.   Whether part of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard,  you have served and sacrificed greatly to secure the freedom we enjoy  here at home. Your commitment to duty and to serve a cause bigger than  yourself commands our respect. You continue the greatest traditions of  responsible citizens in this Republic, and you are a role model for  younger generations of Americans.   To the families who have sacrificed alongside our veterans, we say  thank you. You provide the love and care necessary for our servicewomen  and -men to continue their honorable work.   I am honored to serve the veterans in my hometown community, in Bucks  and Montgomery Counties, and across the Nation. Our gratitude is  enduring, our support for you steadfast. We have your back.                            ____________________
