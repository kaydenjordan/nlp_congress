 Madam Speaker, we have a crisis of youth vaping, and we  have seen a disturbing number of lung injuries and deaths tied to the  oil used in marijuana vaping, but this bill does nothing to impact  either. In fact, Republicans offered an amendment in committee to ban  flavored marijuana vaping, the root cause of lung injuries and deaths,  and every single Democrat voted ``no.''    The fact is, working with President Trump, this Congress has already  taken major bipartisan actions to combat the youth vaping epidemic. We  have already raised the age to purchase tobacco products to 21; the  President banned flavors in e-cigarettes; and the House passed  legislation to require an ID check at every tobacco point of sale.   Clearly, there is bipartisan support on this issue. Unfortunately,  this is not what we are voting on today.   The bill before us today is a partisan publicity stunt. This bill is  not about youth vaping. This bill is the worst example of Big Brother,  liberal elites telling the rest of us how to live our lives.   They say tobacco vaping, a safer alternative to smoking, is bad, but  marijuana vaping, the root cause of injury and death, is okay.   The $100 cigars that their liberal elite campaign donors smoke, those  are okay, but cheaper cigars and menthol cigarettes smoked by working  men and women in this country, those would be banned.   You can vape flavored marijuana in San Francisco, but they are going  to take away your flavored dip in Scranton.   Let's set aside this partisan overreach and continue to work together  to solve this crisis, to deal with the real root causes.   This is not a public health response to an epidemic. It is Big  Government, liberal elites telling adults what they can and cannot do.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
