 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  approximately 15 minutes as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                                Climate Change     Mr. President, now, for the 193rd time, I will give  my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, and as I do so, we are coming up on  President Trump's anniversary in office. Unfortunately, this occasion  does not offer the American people much to celebrate. Behind the  persistent tweets and the dog whistles, the Trump Presidency has been a  spectacle of special interests and self-dealing. Billionaire donors  have endless access installing their operatives and pursuing their  special interest goals throughout the executive branch. They are  literally writing the rules in an unambiguous effort to enrich  themselves evermore at the expense of everyone else.   Fossil fuel barons are the new American dark money emperors. Carl  Icahn, early on, got himself installed as a special adviser to the  President on regulatory reform and began pushing for a change to the  renewable fuel standard that would net one of his companies, CVR  Energy, hundreds of millions of dollars. Icahn's insider campaign came  to an end in August of last year right around the time a New Yorker  article outlined the potential legal claims that could arise from his  murky status and self-dealing. Federal investigators have since opened  a probe into Icahn's time at the White House.   Then came Murray Energy Corporation CEO and big Trump donor Bob  Murray with his policy wish list for Trump officials. He called it his  action plan. Murray had donated $300,000 to the President's  inauguration, and he donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to  political action committees affiliated with the EPA Administrator and  fossil fuel operative, Scott Pruitt. In a ``Frontline'' documentary,  Bob Murray bragged about giving the administration this action plan and  that the first page was already done.   Well, I was curious to see the Bob Murray action plan for the Trump  administration, so I joined Senator Carper, our ranking member on the  Environment and Public Works Committee, and asked the White House for a  copy of the Bob Murray action plan. The White House ignored our request  and to this date has never responded.   I guess the White House was busy organizing Trump's nominee for  second in command at the EPA: a lobbyist for, guess who--Bob Murray and  Murray Energy. During the Murray Energy lobbyist's EPA confirmation  hearing, he claimed he did not have the Bob Murray action plan. He  admitted he had seen the Bob Murray action plan at a meeting between  Bob Murray and Energy Secretary Rick Perry last March, but he could not  recall details of what was in the action plan or what was discussed in  the meeting. Lobbyists for energy companies who get one-on-one meetings  with the Secretary of Energy often little note nor long remember what  went on at the meeting.   Anyway, I asked the Department of Energy whether they had a copy of  the elusive Bob Murray action plan. Shortly after my request, and  before we heard anything from the Department of Energy, the magazine In  These Times released photos of that March meeting that the Murray  lobbyist had mentioned between Secretary Perry and Bob Murray.   This photo shows Bob Murray and Secretary Perry. It looks like Bob  Murray received a pretty cozy reception from the Energy Secretary. This  gentleman, I believe, is another lobbyist for Bob Murray and Murray  Energy. After they got through the hugging, they got down to business.  There is the Secretary, there is the CEO Bob Murray, there is his other  lobbyist, and this is the Bob Murray lobbyist who is now teed up to be  the No. 2 at EPA. Right there in the picture is the Bob Murray action  plan. This is a closeup of it, and the Presiding Officer can't see from  there and nobody on the camera can see, but if you look right here, it  talks about power grid reliability in the cover letter signed by Bob  Murray, which may have cooked up, since this was a meeting with  Secretary Perry, Secretary Perry's power grid reliability proposal to  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which included huge subsidies  to coal plants.   So we have a coal company CEO bringing his action plan in to  Secretary Perry on whose cover letter it talks about power grid  reliability, and before you know it, Secretary Perry is proposing a  power grid reliability project to the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission that just happens to give the coal industry enormous  subsidies. What could possibly be wrong with that?   Well, with this photographic evidence in hand, I renewed my request  that the Energy Department produce this Bob Murray action plan. They  were no longer able to pretend they didn't have it because they had a  picture of it, with the Secretary, on his desk. They nevertheless  continued to stonewall me, saying they would provide me the document  after responding to FOIA requests from the public.   So, memo to my Senate colleagues, when in the exercise of your  oversight authority and the oversight authority of Congress and the  Senate you request documents from the Trump administration, you might  want to consider putting in a parallel FOIA request as that may be the  only way you get a response.   Despite the administration's best efforts to stonewall the Bob Murray  action plan, however, my office was able to obtain a copy from an  independent source. This version is addressed to Vice President Pence.   The New York Times has now published the Bob Murray action plan.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the article they wrote, ``How a Coal Baron's Wish List Became President  Trump's To-Do List,'' and the Bob Murray action plan that was the  subject of that story at the conclusion of my remarks.   The article details demands made by Murray that have already been  checked off by the President and the administration, including the  repeal of the Clean Power Plan, withdrawal from the Paris climate  agreement, the installation of mining industry operatives at the Mine  Safety and Health Administration, and even, believe it or not, the  appointment of a fossil fuel-friendly U.S. Supreme Court Justice.   Several more of Bob Murray's action plan requests are underway. At  the  [[Page S243]]  Mine Safety and Health Administration, now led by a former coal mine  executive, Murray Energy and trade associations are working to undo  Obama-era rules to protect miners. The 2010 coal mine dust rule is also  on the chopping block. Over at EPA, Bob Murray's political money  beneficiary, Scott Pruitt, has begun a review of the Agency's 2015  ozone standards.   Let me just drop in, as a Senator from Rhode Island, we have had days  when you drive into work and the skies are clear and the weather is  nice and the radio says: Little children, infants and elderly folks and  people who have a breathing difficulty should stay indoors in the air- conditioning. They should not go outdoors and enjoy the beautiful day.  Why? Because of ozone which is being bombarded in on Rhode Island  from--guess what--coal plants in the Midwest. We are in the downstream  receiving end of ozone, which is the product of those coal plant  emissions. So, obviously, loosening the ozone standards is good for  coal companies.   On a new topic, EPA continues to cut and to drive away its staff--all  items on Bob Murray's action plan.   Since it appears that Bob Murray has tailored his action plan for  individual agencies, I have sent additional requests last week to the  Department of Labor, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, all  of which are named in the Bob Murray action plan to see what specific  action plans they have from Bob Murray.   The fossil fuel industry may be able to boss Cabinet Secretaries  around and may be able to bring the majority party in Congress smartly  to heel, but, fortunately, there are still some venues where their  demands run smack up against the rule of law. In our courts and in  administrative proceedings, decisions must have substantial support in  the evidence, and lying and misleading can be exposed and even  punished--unlike in Congress, where lying and misleading have been  sickeningly successful fossil fuel tactics for decades.   Last week, the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--even  one stuffed with Trump appointees--rejected Secretary Perry's proposed  power grid reliability rule to subsidize coal and nuclear plants. The  FERC Commissioners found that the proposal failed to meet ``clear and  fundamental'' legal requirements, like that the result will be ``just  and reasonable'' under the Federal Power Act.   As an aside here, the theory of the coal industry was that their  units provide more reliability than renewables. Well, tell that to  Iowa's electric grid operators, which have baked Iowa's abundant wind  energy not just into their flow but into their reliability modeling.  Tell that to New England's ISO, which has allowed renewables into its  capacity auctions to be paid, for meeting baseload capacity  requirements. And, of course, tell that to anyone who has had to deal  with scheduled and unscheduled outages at coal plants.   When I went on one of my climate visits to, in this case, Tennessee,  I heard about a coal plant that had to be shut down because climate  change had warmed the river and shrunk the flow so that the river used  to cool the plant was no longer adequate to cool the plant, and they  had to go into an unscheduled outage. Wind and solar are very reliable,  and the ISOs have baked the algorithms that quantify their reliability  into their grid reliability planning.   The ``coal is reliable and renewables aren't'' argument may pass  muster on talk shows, but in the real world of grid operators, it is  nonsense. FERC, as a rule-of-law agency, is required to face that fact.   America's courts also stand in the way of the Bob Murray action plan  agenda. Murray, for instance, has demanded that the EPA overturn its  2009 endangerment finding--the administrative finding that greenhouse  gas emissions, like carbon dioxide and methane and so forth, threaten  the public health and welfare of current and future generations. That  is their finding, that those greenhouse gas emissions threaten the  health and welfare of current and future generations. That is why it is  called an endangerment finding, because of the danger to the public.  Well, good luck challenging that determination in a court of law. In  fact, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit has already upheld  the endangerment finding back in 2012.   Even the fossil fuel flunky running the EPA now knows better than to  challenge that endangerment finding. If he thought he could, he would  in a heartbeat, but he is clever enough to know that an avalanche of  climate evidence would fall in on his head if he tried. Witnesses from  virtually every leading State university in the industry, from Alaska  to Oklahoma to Georgia to Maine; expert scientists from our National  Laboratories, from Idaho to Tennessee; our national security agencies  and our military; America's government watchdog agencies, like the GAO  and the GSA; and even the Trump administration's own recent climate  report, all, would pile on the conclusive evidence of climate change.  And on the other side would be what? Pathetic Kathleen Hartnett White,  who gave one of the worst performances in Senate history at her  confirmation hearings? The secretly fossil-fuel-funded Willie Soon?  Some coal company lobbyist? Or perhaps the Heartland Institute, with  its proud history of comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber?   It would be a rout. It would be a rout, and even Pruitt knows it. The  reason it would be a rout is because of the rule of law--the rule of  law requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, the rule of law  specter of judicial review, and the rule of law sanctions that courts  impose for false evidence.   Certainly, Bob Murray and his surrounding crowd of bad-acting fossil  fuel billionaires know how to throw their political weight around. We  see everywhere the phony science denial apparatus they have created. We  see their false and toxic messages even in outlets like the Wall Street  Journal editorial page. We see their lobbying front groups like the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, continuing adamantly to oppose any serious  climate legislation despite the contrary position of companies on their  board of directors. American elections stink with their dark money and  promises and threats. Their flunkies have now been moved into positions  of authority in government, and the Trump's administration eagerness to  carry out industry marching orders is humiliatingly servile.   Ultimately, the polluters' drive to put profit first above the health  and safety of Americans will face strict scrutiny in the truth-based  arena of Federal courts. Ultimately, it will also face the harsh test  of time, as the fact that they knew and the fact that they lied becomes  ever more obvious and ever more odious. Ultimately, the American voter  will have her say about whether this great Republic should be under the  dominion and control of the fossil fuel industry or free to address the  problem of climate change as a rational world leader must.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From The New York Times, Jan. 9, 2018]      How a Coal Baron's Wish List Became President Trump's To-Do List                             (By Lisa Friedman)         Washington.--President Trump's first year in office has       been a boon for the coal industry, with the Trump       administration rolling back regulations on coal-fired power       plants and withdrawing the United States from the Paris       climate change agreement.        Environmentalists have expressed alarm at the new       direction, and have complained that Mr. Trump was following a       blueprint from the coal industry. A confidential memo written       by the head of the country's largest coal mining company       suggests they might not be wrong.        The memo was written by Robert E. Murray, a longtime Trump       supporter who donated $300,000 to the president's       inauguration. In it, Mr. Murray, the head of Murray Energy,       presented Mr. Trump with a wish list of environmental       rollbacks just weeks after the inauguration.        Nearly a year later, the White House and federal agencies       have completed or are on track to fulfill most of the 16       detailed requests, even with Monday's decision by federal       regulators to reject a proposal by Energy Secretary Rick       Perry to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants.        The March 1 memo, which was obtained by Senator Sheldon       Whitehouse of Rhode Island and shared with The New York       Times, is addressed to Vice President Mike Pence. The       sweeping wish list of regulatory overhauls includes ending       regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and ozone and mine       safety, as well as cutting the staff of the Environmental       Protection Agency ``at least in half''  [[Page S244]]       and overhauling the Labor Department's office of mine safety.        ``I give President Trump and his administration credit for       being bold, being passionate and being correct in addressing       a lot of these issues that were on my list here,'' Mr. Murray       said in an interview Tuesday.        Photographs of portions of a different memo, dated March 23       and addressed to Rick Perry, the secretary of the Department       of Energy, were obtained by the magazine In These Times last       year. They were taken during a meeting Mr. Murray held on       March 29 with Mr. Perry and others at the Energy Department,       according to the magazine.        Mr. Murray on Tuesday described the memos as very similar.        The March 1 ``Action Plan for the Administration of       President Donald J. Trump'' is aimed, Mr. Murray wrote in the       memo, at ``getting America's coal miners back to work.'' He       also asks the federal government to cut funding for carbon       capture and sequestration technology--which Mr. Murray called       ``a pseudonym for `no coal' ''--and eliminate a 2009 E.P.A.       ruling known as the endangerment finding that was the legal       justification for much of the Obama administration's climate       change policy.        ``This list was to remain private, a list of things that       needed to be done for reliable, low-cost electricity in       America. That was my number one goal here, was to give       guidance to the administration in an area that I have       observed over 60 years,'' Mr. Murray said.        Critics say Mr. Murray's list and the apparent ease with       which he was able to get it in front of cabinet officials and       others illustrates the open-door access the Trump       administration has offered energy and other industries as it       moves to redirect and weaken federal regulations.        ``The astonishing presumption of this list,'' Mr.       Whitehouse, a Democrat, said. ``It's an extraordinary       arrogance of the fossil fuel industry based on the power they       wield in Washington, D.C.'' He said even though Mr. Murray       had bragged about the action plan on a Frontline documentary       last year, the Energy Department had declined his requests to       immediately release the memo.        ``The power of the fossil fuel industry around here is so       great I think the industry feels they can count on simply not       complying with requests,'' Mr. Whitehouse said.        The Energy Department did not respond to a request to       discuss the memos from Mr. Murray.        The Trump administration has had an unusually close       relationship with Mr. Murray. He and 10 of his miners were       invited to watch the president sign an executive order to       rollback President Obama's climate change regulations. He has       met with Mr. Perry to discuss the needs of coal producers.       His longtime attorney, Andrew Wheeler, is awaiting Senate       confirmation to the No. 2 slot at the E.P.A., and David       Zatezalo, the nation's new top mine safety and health       regulator and previously the president of a coal mining       company, told his hometown paper that Mr. Murray had       encouraged him to put his hat in the ring for the job.        Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell and a       deputy administrator of the E.P.A. in the George W. Bush       administration, called Mr. Murray's action plan ``an       ambitious list.'' While interest groups always try to       influence policy in a new administration, Mr. Holmstead said       Mr. Murray's status with the administration set him apart.        ``I really don't think it's at all unusual that Murray       would have this wish list or a set of recommendations. What       makes it different is that it's pretty clear that he has a       personal relationship with the president,'' Mr. Holmstead       said. ``It seems like given Mr. Murray's relationship with       the president that he had more of an expectation that these       things were going to be accepted or implemented.''        One item not on the list yet important to Mr. Murray was an       order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected       Monday to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear power plants.       Mr. Murray railed against that decision saying it would lead       to the decommissioning of coal and nuclear power plants.        Environmental groups have accused Mr. Murray of directly       asking Mr. Perry for a proposed rule to reward coal and       nuclear power plants for providing ``grid resiliency.'' The       March 1 memo does not mention the grid, though photographs of       the cover page of the March 23 document to Mr. Perry obtained       by In These Times shows its focus is ``a plan for achieving       reliable and low cost electricity.''        Soon after Mr. Murray's meeting at D.O.E., Mr. Perry       ordered the agency to prepare a study on the country's       electric grid reliability, a precursor to ordering the       federal government to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear       plants.        Mr. Murray and a spokesman, Gary Broadbent, said the       difference between the two memos was that the one provided to       Mr. Perry asked the Energy Department to study the security       of the nation's power grid.        ``I suggested that the study be made,'' Mr. Murray said.       ``What they did from there, the administration did. I did not       have involvement in it.''        One of the items on the 16-point list was an overhaul of       FERC regulators, and the Trump administration accomplished       that. But those Trump-appointed commissioners voted against       the plan to bail out coal and nuclear.        ``Obviously they forgot who appointed them right out of the       box,'' Mr. Murray said.      Correction: January 16, 2018        An earlier version of this article misstated the number of       suggested actions in a memo that Robert E. Murray submitted       to the Trump administration. It had 16 suggestions, not 14.                                   ____                                        Murray Energy Corporation,                                 St. Clairsville, OH, March 1, 2017.      Hon. Michael R. Pence,      Vice President of the United States of America,      The White House, Washington, DC.        Dear Vice President Pence: Enclosed is an Action Plan for       the Administration of President Donald J. Trump, which will       help in getting America's coal miners back to work. We have       listed our suggested actions in order of priority.        We are available to assist you and your Administration in       any way that you request.            Sincerely,                                                  Robert E. Murray,      Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____       Action Plan for the Administration of President Donald J. Trump                               CLEAN POWER PLAN         The so-called Clean Power Plan must be eliminated. Murray       Energy Corporation obtained a stay of this rule before the       Supreme Court of the United States on February 3, 2016. This       illegal rule will close au additional fifty-six (56) coal-      fired electric generating plants, totaling 53,000 megawatts,       on top of the 101,000 megawatts (411 coal-fired plants) that       President Barack Obama and his Democrat supporters have       already closed.                ``ENDANGERMENT FINDING'' FOR GREENHOUSE GASES         With the overturning of the Clean Power Plan, there must be       a withdrawal and suspension of the implementation of the so-      called ``endangerment finding'' for greenhouse gases.        EPA's ``endangerment finding'' under the Clean Air Act       serves as the foundation for the agency's far reaching       regulation of the economy in the form of emission limitations       for greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. The high       degree of uncertainty in the range of data relied upon by EPA       combined with the enormous regulatory costs without       concomitant benefits merit revisiting the ``endangerment       finding''.        According to EPA's finding, the ``root cause'' of recently       observed climate change is ``likely'' the increase in       anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. EPA relied upon       computer-based-climate-model simulations and a ``synthesis''       of major findings from scientific assessment reports with a       significant range of uncertainty related to temperatures over       25 years. The climate model failures are well documented in       their inability to emulate real-world climate behavior.       Models that are unable to simulate known climate behavior       cannot provide reliable projections of future climate       behavior. As for the scientific assessments underlying the       ``synthesis'' of findings used by EPA, many were not peer       reviewed, and there are multiple instances where portions of       peer reviewed literature germane to the ``endangerment       finding'' were omitted, ignored or unfairly dismissed.   ELIMINATE THE THIRTY (30) PER CENT PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT FOR WINDMILLS                 AND SOLAR PANELS IN ELECTRICITY GENERATION         Electricity generated by windmills and solar panels costs       twenty-six (26) cents per kilowatt hour with a four (4) cent       per kilowatt hour subsidy from the American taxpayers. These       energy sources are unreliable and only available if the wind       blows or the sun shines. Coal-fired electricity costs only       four (4) cents per kilowatt hour. Low cost electricity is a       staple of life, and we must have a level playing field in       electric power generation without the government picking       winners and losers by subsidizing wind and solar power.     WITHDRAW FROM THE ILLEGAL UNITED NATIONS COP 21 PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD         The United Nation's COP 21 Paris Climate Accord, to which       Barack Obama has already committed one (1) billion dollars of       America's money, is an attempt by the rest of the world to       obtain funding from our Country. It is an illegal treaty       never approved by Congress, and it will have no effect on the       environment.      END THE ELECTRIC UTILITY MAXIMUM ACHIEVABLE TECHNOLOGY AND OZONE                                REGULATIONS         We have won these issues in the United States Supreme       Court, and these rules must be completely overturned.           FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGIES         The Federal government, must support the development of       some Clean Coal Technologies, including: ultra super critical       combustion; high efficiency, low emission coal firing;       combined cycle coal combustion; and others. It should not       fund so-called carbon capture and sequestration (``CCS''), as       it does not work, practically or economically. Democrats and       some Republicans use COS as a political cover to insincerely       show that they are proposing something for coal. But, carbon       capture and sequestration is a pseudonym for ``no coal''.        OVERHAUL THE BLOATED AND POLITICALIZED MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH              ADMINISTRATION OF THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR         This Federal agency, over the past eight (8) years, has not       been focused on the coal  [[Page S245]]       miner safety, but on politics, bureaucracy, waste, and       violation quotas. While coal mine employment has been cut in       half, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration has       continued to hire inspectors every year. But, the government       has nowhere to put them. Murray Energy Corporation received       an average of 532 Federal inspectors per month in 2016. We       must send a Company manager with every one of these       inspectors, taking us away from our employee safety       inspections and safety training.    CUT THE STAFF OF THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IN AT LEAST                                    HALF         Tens of thousands of government bureaucrats have issued       over 82,000 pages of regulations under Obama, many of them       regarding coal mining and utilization. The Obama EPA, alone,       wrote over 25,000 pages of rules, thirty-eight (38) times the       words in our Holy Bible.         OVERTURN THE RECENTLY ENACTED CROSS-STATE AIR POLLUTION RULE         This regulation particularly punishes states in which coal       mining takes place to the benefit of other wealthier east       coast states.    REVISE THE ARBITRARY COAL MINE DUST REGULATION OF THE MINE SAFETY AND              HEALTH ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR         This regulation provides no health benefit to our coal       miners, and threatens the destruction of thousands of coal       mining jobs.    OBTAIN LEGISLATION TO FUND BOTH THE RETIREE MEDICAL CARE AND PENSIONS        FOR ALL OF AMERICA'S UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA (UMWA)--                     REPRESENTED, RETIRED COAL MINERS         For four (4) years, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell       has refused to address this issue. Some say that this is       because the UMWA wrongly opposed him in his recent election.       This must be taken care of. And the legislation enacted must       address not just those recently orphaned through company       bankruptcies and mine closures, but the medical benefits and       pensions that were promised to all retired miners by the       Federal government itself.      OVERTURN THE NINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF                     LABOR, PATTERN OF VIOLATIONS RULE         This rule is a punitive action of the Mine Safety and       Health Administration under its Director for the past eight       (8) years, the former Safety Director of a labor union.     APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO WILL             FOLLOW OUR UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND OUR LAWS         We must offset the liberal appointees who want to redefine       our Constitution and our laws.     MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION MUST BE REPLACED         The current Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has a       record of favoring actions of the Obama Administration that       have destroyed the reliability of America's electric power       grid and which have led to skyrocketing electric power costs,       as Mr. Obama, who appointed them, stated would occur in 2008.    MEMBERS OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS MUST BE                                  REPLACED         The Board of Directors of this government agency has       followed the mandates of the Obama Administration, rather       than assure reliable, low cost electricity for the Tennessee       Valley Authority's rate payers, whom they are mandated to       serve in this manner.     REPLACE THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD (``NLRB'')         Eliminate the antiemployer bias of the NLRB by appointing       members and staff, particularly in the General Counsel's       office, who will fairly consider the employer's position and       needs and not automatically accede to the unions or unionized       employees in every matter considered.     With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.                       Confronting Issues the Right Way
