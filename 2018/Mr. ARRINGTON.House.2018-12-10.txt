 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this  Special Order, my friend Roger Williams, a fellow Texan, to honor the  life and legacy of President George Herbert Walker Bush.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great American and a  proud Texan, President George Herbert Walker Bush. This past week, we  as a nation said good-bye to a true statesman. We reflected on a life  of duty, honor, and, above all, service to others.   From one of the youngest Navy pilots in our Nation's history to the  leader of the highest office in the land, our 41st President's life was  defined by service to others, and his dedication to our country was  matched only by his love for and devotion to his family.   Throughout his life, President Bush taught us that public service is  a noble calling and that being a politician and a gentleman aren't  necessarily mutually exclusive. His example inspired countless other  Americans to get involved in public service, which made a tremendous  impact on many lives, such as mine, and, no doubt, has had an impact on  this country. It has made it a better and brighter place to live.   Mr. Speaker, President Bush once said that he saw life in terms of  missions--missions defined and missions completed. Today, George  Herbert Walker Bush's mission on Earth is complete, and I join my  friend, President George W. Bush, the entire Bush family, and all  Americans in celebrating a life well-lived and rejoice with them in the  promise of life everlasting.   God, no doubt, has blessed this great country in many ways, not the  least of which is with men like George Herbert Walker Bush.   God bless the Bush family, and God continue to bless America.
