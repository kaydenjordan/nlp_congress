 Mr. Speaker, today, as you know, marks the 82nd  anniversary of the dirty attack on Pearl Harbor, where the U.S. was  thrown into war by the Imperial Japanese military.   Indeed, we should never ever forget, and we should always have  vigilance and readiness.   At the time right now when our world is in great peril, I worry about  the readiness we have in order to do what we need to do to protect  ourselves and those allies we care about.   Some of my best memories are with some of the people I knew who were  involved in Pearl Harbor, such as my dear friend, Mel Fisher, and his  wife, Cathy, on the 69th, when I was able to attend Pearl Harbor  ceremonies with them on the USS Arizona. That was a great moment for me  to be involved. I also think of a great patriot, over 100 years old and  still living in Grass Valley, California, my good friend, Lou Conter,  the last surviving member of the USS Arizona.   I think of people like that, and I think of these brave folks who  stand in the gap for us and for our country on this day. We should  honor them as we honor them every day, by being good citizens for  freedom in this country.                            ____________________
