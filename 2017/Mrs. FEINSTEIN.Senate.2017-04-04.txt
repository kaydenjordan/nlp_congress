 Mr. President, how much time do I have?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have approximately 36 minutes  remaining.    Mr. President, I rise today as the ranking member of  the Judiciary Committee to speak about the nomination of Judge Neil  Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States.   In committee, at the outset of the hearings, I remarked that our job  was not to evaluate legal doctrines and theories or to review Judge  Gorsuch's record in a vacuum. Our job is to assess how this nominee's  decisions will affect the American people and whether he will protect  the legal and constitutional rights of all Americans.   I have had this in mind throughout the entire process. Let me begin  with an aside. I represent a large State, and I do pay close attention  to constituent letters, calls, and emails. A weekly report lets me know  on what issues people are focused and what they think. I take this  feedback very seriously.   In general, my barometer has been that when I receive over 30,000  calls, emails, or letters, that is when I know an issue is reasonably  meaningful to many people in the State. To be clear, I don't base my  final judgment on any issue or nominee solely on the numbers of calls  and letters I receive. However, this is a representative democracy. I  find this to be an important measure of what California constituents  are thinking.   When it comes to this nomination so far, my office has received a  total of 112,309 calls, emails, and letters from California  constituents; and 92,799, or 83, percent, oppose this nominee and  19,510, or 17 percent, support this nominee.   Let me read a few of the emails. One constituent from Silverado, CA,  wrote:         ``In 1971, when abortion was illegal, I was forced to have       a child at age 16. That was 46 years ago. With Gorsuch, we       would step back into that world where women and girls have NO       choice but an illegal and unsafe abortion OR become a mother.       It is wrong. The choice is untenable and dangerous.       Filibuster Gorsuch and do whatever it takes.''    I was a college student in the 1950s, and I remember very much what  life was like before a woman had the right to privacy, to control her  reproductive system according to Roe v. Wade.   Another constituent from San Diego emailed:         ``As a beneficiary of the right to marry 3\1/2\ years ago,       I personally understand how important Supreme Court decisions       are. I also attended a segregated elementary school when I       was a little boy. I do not trust that Neil Gorsuch would       advocate for the best interests of women & minorities. Please       do not confirm him.''    A woman from Richmond, CA, wrote:         ``I believe that we, the people, will have a difficult time       getting fair and equal treatment with Gorsuch being on the       Supreme Court. He will help the rich corporations, and the       poor and middle-class will suffer irreparably.''    I don't comment on any of these because none of these are sacrosanct,  but they are opinions.   Brandon Gregg from Burlingame wrote:   [[Page S2324]]              ``The republicans did not give Merrick Garland a hearing,       instead waiting until Trump could propose a young right-      leaning judge who will take our country backwards. Gorsuch       will not advance the agenda of human rights within our       Constitution, but will plunge us back into the past where       minorities had little protection, women did not have equal       rights, people of color were denied the right to vote, and       protections for all people that we take for granted, did not       exist. This is not the world I want for myself, my children,       or my grandchildren. Filibuster Gorsuch's confirmation.       Please.''    The bottom line is that Californians are letting me know loud and  clear that who sits on the Supreme Court matters. Unfortunately, up to  now, much of the press coverage on this nomination has been about  politics and process.   In contrast, little has been said about how the Supreme Court affects  the lives of Americans, their families, and their communities. So, let  me say, in the past 24 years that I have been a member of the Judiciary  Committee, I have seen that the Supreme Court is, in fact, the last  word in so many areas: the personal rights of all Americans, including  whom they can marry, and whether women have the right to privacy that  allows them to control their own bodies.   The Supreme Court determines whether decisions about healthcare will  be determined by families or businesses. The Supreme Court has the  final say on whether States and localities will be able to pass laws  that make it harder for low-income people, people of color, seniors and  students to vote. The Supreme Court will decide whether corporations  are able to pollute our air and water with impunity.   It is the Supreme Court that will be the final world on Executive  authority, whether it is used to waterboard, detain individuals  indefinitely, or overreach in other ways.   Each year, more than 350,000 civil and criminal cases are filed in  Federal courts. The Supreme Court hears arguments for only about 80  cases a session and makes decisions on approximately 50 more cases  without hearing arguments.   Now, this means the Supreme Court only hears a very small percentage  of cases--less than 0.02 percent.   Before the current vacancy, the most significant questions were  closely decided by 5-to-4 decisions, with five votes coming from  Republican-appointed Justices.   These include important decisions that affect our elections, like  Shelby County and Citizens United, decisions that weakened the power of  average voters by expanding the role of dark money and gutting a key  provision of the Voting Rights Act. We also saw a 5-to-4 decision in  Heller that overturned 70 years of precedent on the Second Amendment  and blocked the District of Columbia's commonsense gun regulations.   As my colleague Senator Whitehouse outlined in the Judiciary  Committee, in the last several years, this Supreme Court has issued an  additional 11 5-to-4 decisions that promote the rights of corporations  over the rights of everyday people, on topics as wide-ranging as age  discrimination and harassment to limiting access to courts and juries.   So who sits on the Supreme Court matters. Just look at some of the  key cases that have come down since this vacancy arose last year. For  example, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-to-4 on a case to determine  whether unions are able to fight for fair pay and benefits for all  workers by requiring them to contribute to a union's action on their  behalf.   We know this issue will go back to the Supreme Court. If, next time  the Court rules against unions like the California Teachers  Association, it will be overturning a 40-year precedent known as  ``agency shop,'' and it will permit an assault on worker's rights.   Also last year, the Supreme Court considered the case on North  Carolina's law that reduced early voting days, eliminated same-day  registration, and established new restrictive photo ID requirements to  vote. The Fourth Circuit struck down North Carolina's law concluding it  had ``targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' Yet,  when the Supreme Court considered it, they deadlocked 4 to 4. Who sits  on that court matters.   After 4 days of hearings and reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, we  have learned that he, indeed, has strong views of what the law should  be and how it should be interpreted. While Judge Gorsuch was not  responsive to many questions, he did tell us that he is happy to be  called an originalist, and that he embraced the term. He also stated  that he believes judges should look to the original public meaning of  the Constitution when they decide what one of its provision mean.   According to him, ``the Constitution isn't some ink blot on which  litigants may project their hopes and dreams. . . . but a carefully  crafted text judges are charged with applying according to its original  public meaning.''   Original public meaning--that takes us back to 13 colonies, 4 million  Americans, and 1789. I find this originalist judicial philosophy to be  deeply troubling. It essentially means that judges and courts should  evaluate all of our constitutional rights and privileges as they were  understood in 1789. To freeze our understanding of the Constitution in  1789, I think, ignores the Framer's intent. But more importantly, it  would ignore the vibrancy and growth of our Nation.   We are no longer a society that condones slavery. We no longer permit  segregation. We do not allow child labor. We recognize that women not  only deserve an education but can be leaders in business, government,  and their homes.   We cannot turn the clock back 230 years.   As Justice Brennan said, asking judges to resolve legal questions by  looking only to what people believed when our country was founded was  ``little more than arrogance cloaked as humility'' that ``while  proponents of this facile historicism justify it as the  depoliticization of the judiciary, the political underpinnings of such  a choice should not escape notice.'' After all, ``[t]hose who would  restrict [legal claims] to the values of 1789 specifically articulated  in the Constitution turn a blind eye to social pro- gress. . . .''   This is Justice Brennan's speech in 1985 at Georgetown University.  This is an important point that I think bears repeating. A judge's  decision to adopt an originalist philosophy is inherently political  because it discounts the expansion of constitutional protections beyond  White men who owned property. Yes, that is the way it was back then.   The U.S. Constitution, I deeply believe, is a living document  intended to evolve as our country evolves. We are not supposed to  ignore social progress, and I don't believe the Founders of our country  ever intended us to do so.   Another concern with Judge Gorsuch's record is his extreme,  conservative view of the Federal Government. For example, he has  indicated he believes the longstanding legal doctrine that allows  agencies to write rules to effectively implement laws should be  overturned. That doctrine, as the Presiding Officer well knows, is the  Chevron doctrine. It was discussed in committee.    Chevron was itself a unanimous opinion authored by the liberal  Justice Stevens and joined by conservatives, including Chief Justice  Burger. This legal doctrine has been in place for decades and has been  cited more than 15,000 times. If Chevron is overturned, as Judge  Gorsuch has advocated, many important laws that Congress has passed  would become ineffective.   I want to give a personal example.   In 2007, Senator Olympia Snowe and I finally passed legislation,  thanks to Senator Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye, to increase the mileage  efficiency of cars. This was critical to address because pollution was  clouding up our cities, and it was important to improve the functioning  of our automobiles.   Our legislation required the Department of Transportation to set  standards so that fuel economy would increase at least 10 miles per  gallon over 10 years--that is the time we could foresee--and continue  to rise after that. We instructed the agency to achieve the ``maximum  feasible average fuel economy'' and directed the Secretary of  Transportation to consider ``technological feasibility, economic  practicality, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the  government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to  conserve energy.'' That is directly from the bill.   Here is the result. It has just been announced that this program will  raise fuel economy to more than 50-miles per  [[Page S2325]]  gallon by 2025. I think the specifics were 54 miles to the gallon.   This would have been impossible in 2007 when we were trying to pass  the bill. We could not possibly understand, 10 years hence, technical  details of specific automobile efficiency technologies and how they  would develop in the decades to come.   Federal agencies simply must play a role. We need their technical  expertise and ongoing involvement to ensure the legislation we pass is  implemented effectively--as intended by Congress.   In committee, I discussed Judge Gorsuch's textualist view. This means  that he believes statutes should be interpreted only by ``the plain  meaning of the language.''   Combined, this judicial philosophy includes: One, limiting laws and  statues to a dictionary definition that he selected. Two, reversing  precedent to say that agencies can't interpret ambiguous laws. Three,  reinstating a legal doctrine to further limit agency experts. Taken  together, these three points would require Congress to pass bills so  that they are either so specific that they would be very limited in  effect or so broad they would actually be meaningless.   For example, Senator Collins and I have been working on legislation  that would require the FDA to ensure the safety of personal care  products such as we all use--shampoo, deodorant, cosmetics, shaving  creams, lotions. The FDA does not do it in this country, but they do it  in Europe. Our bill asks the FDA to evaluate the safety of the  chemicals that are put in these products.   In committee, we had testimony about a shampoo that once used, hair  fell out of the individual's head and many thousands of complaints had  been registered.   Congress does not have the expertise to do the chemical evaluations,  and without deference to the FDA, the bill would have to be thousands  of pages long to cover every contingency for every product made by  hundreds of companies, and that simply is not workable.   If Congress can no longer rely on Federal agencies, and if all laws  can only be interpreted by limited dictionary definitions, then  government would have no ability to regulate markets, defend against a  financial crisis, protect workers, build safe roads, or safeguard our  environment.   We depend on the scientists, the biologists, the economists, the  engineers, and other experts to help ensure that our laws are  effectively implemented. So this is really a dastardly controlling  mechanism.   Under the arguments proposed by Judge Gorsuch, this would no longer  occur.   Instead, only congressional action would be able to address these  important issues. These rules that agencies would bring would have to  be written by Congress. And even that would be severely limited. Such a  radical change in law would hurt ordinary Americans, certainly their  safety, and certainly our communities.    Let me say once again that who sits on the Supreme Court matters.   The issues facing our country are consequential, and they have a  real-world impact on all of us. Justices on the Supreme Court must  understand that the Court's decisions have real-world consequences for  men, women, and children across our Nation.   Unfortunately, based on Judge Gorsuch's record at the Department of  Justice, his tenure on the bench, his appearance before the Senate, and  his written questions for the record, I cannot support this nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.                            Miners Protection Act
