 Mr. Speaker, this September marks Kenneth Palmer's 60th  anniversary as a member of the Mohawk Fire Department.   A courageous fighter, a teacher, and a survivor of quadruple bypass  surgery, Ken has inspired our community through his deep passion for  service. Ken has left his mark on firefighters and first responders in  Herkimer County through his leadership as the Mohawk Fire Chief,  Department Training Officer, president and vice president of the  Herkimer County Fire Chiefs Association, Chaplain for the Mohawk and  Newport Fire Departments, and Chief Fire Chaplain for New York State.   Now, even at the age of 80, Ken remains ready for the fire alarm to  sound. But his journey hasn't always been easy.   On February 25, 2000, Ken underwent successful quadruple bypass  surgery. Despite the hardships he endured during this stressful time,  Ken had a strong support system. He often credits his beautiful wife,  Sharon, and so many family members and friends praying for him from New  York to California during his enduring struggle.   Now, as a Red Cap Ambassador for the American Heart Association, Ken  provides compassionate support to others suffering from heart disease  and heart-related illnesses.   Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize a dear friend,  Kenneth Palmer, such a strong force for good, who has risked so much to  protect our families. I ask all my colleagues here today to join our  community in extending our gratitude to Kenneth Palmer for his  incredible 60 years of service.                            ____________________
