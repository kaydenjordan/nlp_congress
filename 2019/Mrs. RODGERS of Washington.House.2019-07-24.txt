 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.   We all agree that robocalls are annoying, and they are a nuisance.  What is worse is that these calls are often scams, scams that are  becoming more and more sophisticated each day. When our phone rings, we  are just one answer away from being a victim of identity theft. That  needs to change.   This legislation will restore trust that Americans can again answer  their phones.   Madam Speaker, I have a constituent who calls my office nearly every  time he receives a robocall. He has begged us to do something. After  today, I look forward to sharing with him that we listened and took  action to solve this problem.   Madam Speaker, on his behalf and on behalf of all those whom I have  the privilege of representing in eastern Washington, I urge support of  the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.     Mr. Speaker, I want to first just say how  much I admire and appreciate the leadership of Mr.   James Langevin  from Rhode Island on this important legislation. I am proud to have  joined with him partnering to lead the legislation this year, the  Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2019.   This is important legislation. I think he laid it out really well. It  is supported with bipartisan support. It would authorize $200 million  in funding over the next 5 years for improved respite care services for  families caring for loved ones battling chronic, debilitating  conditions.   Today more than 43 million people are providing long-term care for  family members in America. The role these caregivers play cannot be  understated. They ensure that their loved ones receive the care that  they desperately need in their homes and often at a lower cost.   Respite care providers relieve their family caregivers, and it is an  essential part of our comprehensive healthcare approach. This  legislation will support respite care agencies so that they can support  family caregivers in communities across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it. It expands services  and access to care, and it will improve healthcare outcomes.                                time  1545
