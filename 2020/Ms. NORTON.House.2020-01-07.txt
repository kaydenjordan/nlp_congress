 Mr. Speaker, the House cannot sit still and allow Trump  to become an imperial President, answerable to no one.   Without consultation with House leadership or even leaders in the  Republican Senate, Trump ordered the killing of a major military  leader, Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.   Like countless officials worldwide, Soleimani was a bad actor whose  forces were responsible for the deaths of Americans. However, Soleimani  was not killed on the battlefield but was targeted by President Trump  in Baghdad. Trump may have been seeking revenge for the storming and  damaging of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the largest, most fortified  embassy in the world.   Tit-for-tat is not a policy. It is a childish and dangerous response  that could lead to all-out hostilities.   The U.S. lacks credibility to start diplomatic efforts. I hope that  our allies will intervene as emissaries before it is too late.                            ____________________
