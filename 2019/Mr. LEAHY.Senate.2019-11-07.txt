 Mr. President, it is great sadness that Marcelle and I  learned of the passing of Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina on  October 28. I have served in the U.S. Senate with nearly 400 Senators.  Like many of them, Senator Hagan fought day and day out for her  constituents in North Carolina and for the ideals and morals on which  our country was founded.   Senator Hagan followed a line of public service in the Hagan family.  Her father and brother served in the Navy, and her uncle, Lawton  Chiles, represented Florida here in the U.S. Senate. Recognizing the  sacrifice and importance of our Nation's service members, Senator Hagan  was a tireless advocate for our military members and their families.  During her time in the Senate, she was an active partner in our efforts  to strengthen the National Guard, and she authored such important  legislative initiatives as the Hire a Hero Act. She was also a tireless  advocate for women and children, for efforts to support victims of  crime, and for the advancement of civil rights. Her tenure in the  Senate, in my view, was too short.   After Senator Hagan's work in the Senate, she went on to become a  senior policy consultant for Akin Gump, where she held a particular  focus on the health and financial services sectors. Additionally, in  2015, Senator Hagan became a resident fellow at the Institute of  Politics at Harvard University, where she studied the influence money  has in our politics. She said, ``I worry how we are going to get good  people to run for office if you have to spend so much time raising  money.'' I agree. Our public servants at every level of our govemment  should be more focused on advocating for their constituents, rather  than raising a war chest to fight against wealthy corporate interests,  pressure groups, or dark money influencers.   Her tragic affliction with Powassan virus, which ultimately led to  her passing last month, robbed us of Senator Hagan's dedication to  public service far too soon. It was also a stark reminder of how  precious our time really is.   I know Marcelle and I join with North Carolinians and our Senate  family in mourning the passing of Senator Hagan. Our hearts go out to  Chip, their  [[Page S6470]]  children, Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie, and the entire Hagan family.  Our prayers are with Kay, as we mourn this dedicated public servant.                            ____________________
