 Mr. President, I would like to offer my  congratulations the Honorable Sheila R. Tillerson Adams on her recent  retirement as chief and administrative judge of the Circuit Court for  Prince George's County and Seventh Judicial Circuit of Maryland and to  thank her for her long career of distinguished public service. Judge  Adams served as the administrative judge for 12 years.   Judge Adams has been a trailblazer, the first Black woman to serve as  a judge in Prince George's County. She graduated from Morgan State  University in May 1979 with a bachelor of science degree in psychology,  cum laude. She received her juris doctor degree from Howard University  School of Law in May 1982 and a master of laws in taxation from  Georgetown University Law Center in May 1987. She gained admission to  the Maryland Bar in June 1983, the Federal Bar in July 1983, and the  Supreme Court in May 1992.   Judge Adams began her legal career in 1982 and, in 1984, became only  the second Black female State's attorney in Prince George's County,  after being hired by the State's attorney at the time, Arthur M.  ``Bud'' Marshall. She was appointed by then-Governor William Donald  Schaefer to the District Court of Maryland in Prince George's County in  June 1993. She served with distinction in that capacity for 3 years  before she was elevated to the Circuit Court for Prince George's County  by Governor Schaefer's successor, Parris Glendening, in 1996. On  September 4, 2010, following the Retirement of Judge William D.  Missouri, then-Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Robert M. Bell  appointed her as administrative judge of the Circuit Court for Prince  George's County and the Seventh Judicial Circuit of Maryland.   Judge Adams led the court through floods and fire that damaged court  facilities and the COVID-19 pandemic. She persevered. While she served  as chief and administrative judge, Judge Adams articulated a vision  statement to exemplify the court's goals when providing judicial  services: ``The Circuit Court Welcomes All--A Forum for Justice.'' This  statement has served as the foundation for every initiative, program,  and goal at the court. Judge Adams expanded the Problem-Solving Courts  to provide greater assistance to youth and adults facing a myriad of  challenges. She established the Veterans, Re-Entry, Truancy Reduction,  Juvenile Diversion, and Back on Track Courts to help people who have  served in the military, people who struggle with substance issues,  students with truancy problems, and the formerly incarcerated succeed  in life. Through counseling, rehabilitation services, and intense  monitoring, these programs are changing lives for the better every day.  Judge Adams also focused on providing resources and assistance to  survivors of elder abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence, and sex  trafficking with the creation of the Prince George's County Family  Justice Center--PGCFJC--an initiative of the circuit court. With more  than 21 on-site partners, the PGCFJC provides a full array of colocated  services through a coordinated, collaborative, and hope-centered  advocacy model. Local government and private community-based  organizations work together and efficiently meet survivors' needs.  [[Page S1086]]    As the COVID-19 pandemic rampaged for nearly 3 years, Judge Adams  enhanced the court's technological advancements and accessibility to  the public, holding hearings and trials virtually, and providing  litigants Zoom links via a website that provided all the information  they needed to attend judicial proceedings. She maintained health and  safety protocols in the courthouse to keep everyone safe. She also  focused on security and led the way for the design and construction of  a security checkpoint near the courthouse. Delivery vehicles now must  go through a checkpoint where the Prince George's County Sheriff's  Office K-9 Team looks for any hazardous or explosive materials inside  them. Another security measure that Judge Adams established was a  security command center complete with IT workers who monitor hundreds  of security cameras throughout the courthouse complex. Designated  officials at the center can monitor the courthouse complex 24/7. This  state-of-the-art center was one of Judge Adam's primary security- related goals.   Once the pandemic restrictions were lifted, Judge Adams implemented a  new case management system called Maryland Electronic Courts, MDEC. Her  goal was to transition court operations to an electronic system that is  nearly paperless. With MDEC, attorneys are required to utilize  electronic filing when representing clients in civil and criminal  cases. Electronic filing is optional for litigants representing  themselves. Employees also can access files virtually via the online  system instead of having to hunt down paper files. Judge Adams  modernized the court to make it a dignified space to resolve disputes  and collaborated with many justice partners throughout the county to  provide enhanced judicial services. A fearless and bold leader, Judge  Adams' tenure and leadership will continue to impact Prince George's  County and the legal system for years to come.   Judge Adams cochairs the Law Links Committee of the Prince George's  County Bar Association and has done so since 1993. Law Links is a paid  summer internship program with local law firms and legal departments in  the county that is committed to broadening the aspirations and  possibilities of young people. It combines work experience with a law  and leadership institute. All participants in the program are Prince  George's County high school students.   Throughout Judge Adams' exemplary career, she has received many  awards and honors. Most recently, the J. Franklyn Bourne Bar  Association presented Judge Adams with the Wayne K. Curry Spirit of  Excellence Award for her trailblazing leadership. In May 2022, she was  awarded the 2022 Gladys Noon Spellman Public Service Award at the 37th  Annual Prince George's County Women's History Month Celebration. Last  April, the Prince George's County Commission for Women presented Judge  Adams with the 2022 Trailblazing Woman Award for her extraordinary  legal career and achievements.   Judge Adams is not the only public servant in her family. She is  married to Timothy ``Tim'' J. Adams, the first Black mayor of Bowie in  the 138-year history of the city. I thank both of them for their public  service and wish Judge Adams a happy, well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
