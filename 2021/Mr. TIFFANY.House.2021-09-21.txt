 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, extending visa waiver privileges in the U.S. Virgin  Islands for Caribbean countries will present yet another challenge for  immigration enforcement and drug interdiction efforts.   The Department of Homeland Security has historically noted that a  special visa waiver program for the U.S. Virgin Islands would result in  a significant increase in overstays and make it easier for previously  removed aliens to re-enter U.S. territory. This amendment would also  hamper our efforts to stop the import of illegal drugs.   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, cocaine is the  principal drug threat in the Caribbean with the U.S. Virgin Islands  already serving as a major transshipment point between cocaine- producing countries in South America and the continental United States.                                time  2230    A special visa waiver program for the U.S. Virgin Islands would also  open the door to birth tourism, something we have already seen in the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory in the  Pacific.   In 2017, The Wall Street Journal noted that ``Saipan has become known  as the latest hot spot for birth tourism, a place where women can give  birth to babies who will automatically acquire U.S. citizenship.'' The  problem has become so widespread that, in recent years, more children  have been born to Chinese tourists on the islands than Americans.   Chinese syndicates have also taken advantage of the CNMI program to  engage in human trafficking and forced labor. By any measure, the CNMI  Visa Waiver Program has been an unmitigated disaster. We should be  getting rid of these programs, not expanding them.   Madam Speaker, America's immigration laws and visa restrictions  should apply uniformly across the country. We should not be creating  special loopholes or allowing States and territories to operate their  own independent immigration systems. At a time when the United States  is seeing record illegal immigration and record asylum claims, creating  this visa program is a bad idea at the worst possible time.   I have to say, I am stunned that the majority would bring this forth  at this time when we have a deluge that is happening at the southern  border. Now to create another loophole just like in the Pacific, only  this time in the Atlantic, it is not appropriate to be doing this at  this time.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just respond this way: America  offers great support to all of our friends in the Caribbean. It is not  accurate that we don't offer support. We do.   The second point is that the Secretary of--I am assuming she was  referring to Homeland Security--could exclude or change the program.  How likely is that when we see what is happening currently? When we  were told by this government a month ago that people coming from  Afghanistan would have an SIV, we have found very few of them have  that. They have just been waived in on parole.   That is part of the reason why Congress needs to maintain its  authority, because we cannot count on the executive branch enforcing  the laws of this country. All we have to do is look at the news of the  day to understand that we have open borders, and it is because the  executive branch refuses to control our borders.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, arbitration clauses in contracts let private parties  agree in advance on a way to resolve further disputes and have  significant benefits. But for years, Democrats have worked relentlessly  to undermine arbitration and the efficiencies arbitration agreements  often have for private parties.   These agreements generally work well and the process itself is a fair  and effective way to solve disagreements. Arbitration is also usually  faster and cheaper than hiring an attorney and suiting up for drawn-out  litigation.   Making arbitration harder for certain claims will mean Americans  spend more time in court with no guarantee of getting better outcomes.  The Democrat-driven campaign to up-end the use of arbitration will  certainly benefit the plaintiff's bar. But it will make life worse for  the American people.   With that context in mind, we can consider this amendment in light of  the larger policy debate it is connected to. This amendment rests on  the idea that pre-dispute arbitration agreements are fundamentally  problematic and unfair or work poorly. But that is not true.   And this amendment cannot be considered in isolation. Instead, it is  a policy gateway to the Democrats' longstanding priority to eliminate  arbitration agreements entirely. This amendment should be rejected.  Separately, it is true that we can have a debate over the merits of  arbitration agreements now in the context of the NDAA, but we should  not be having that debate here and now.    If the policy in this amendment is sound, Congress should consider  that policy as an independent bill, in the light of day, and after  appropriate congressional oversight.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment because it is bad policy and  because of this flawed process, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as I stated earlier, this is a policy  gateway that the Democrats seek to eliminate arbitration. It has been a  longstanding goal of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  achieve that goal, and this opens up the door to it.   And I think about the debates that we have in the Judiciary  Committee, where courts are being clogged up, talking about needing  more judges, changing the circuits, things like that. This will add to  the clogging of our courts, and that is why we should oppose this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
