 Madam Speaker, residents in forested areas shouldn't  have to be worried about catastrophic wildfires every single year.   Wildfires are part of California's landscape and have been for  centuries, but they occur less frequently and are better mitigated with  healthy forests. They are less bad.   Denouncing wildfires as solely a consequence of climate change is  flat-out false. We are seeing more and more of these giant wildfires  due to decades of policy failures that have allowed our forests to  become built up with overgrown brush and dried-out, decaying wood, aka  fire fuel.   On top of that, environmental regulations make it near impossible to  clear that overgrowth, thin trees, or create bulldozer lines for fire  breaks near towns or create large buffers around power lines and roads  as needed.   So, instead, what do we get? The Los Angeles Times comes up to my  district and basically says we shouldn't be there. People should not  live in these rural forests because of climate change.   Well, I want to know who is going to do the work to bring you your  wood products, your paper products; if nobody lives up there to do the  work to thin the forest, to put the fire out, to make it where you can  do tourism there?   Who is going to do that if you kick us out of rural areas and make us  live in places like L.A. with all the trash and other things like that?  Yeah, I wonder.                            ____________________
