 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of my bill, the State  Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act of 2018.   There is a healthcare crisis right now going on in rural America.  Rural hospitals are closing their doors at an alarming rate. Eighty- five rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 673 are vulnerable to  close at any time. More closures are coming, and Congress needs to  start making changes to ensure that rural Americans have the healthcare  they need.   My bill, the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act, will  help Oklahoma's rural hospitals keep their doors open by reauthorizing  the Oklahoma Office of Rural Health. This office provides a valuable  resource to the hospitals of Oklahoma by helping hospitals explore  innovative and collaborative ideas that can lead to improvements and  savings.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss not to mention that awesome sweater- vest that you are wearing. So in the spirit of Christmas, I believe you  just pull that off.
