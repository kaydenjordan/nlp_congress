 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R.  3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018.   At the decommissioned San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station just  south of my district, 1,800 tons of spent nuclear fuel sits along the  Pacific coastline. This spent nuclear fuel must be moved for safety and  environmental reasons, but also out of fairness to American taxpayers.   To date, California ratepayers have contributed more than $2 billion  to the Nuclear Waste Fund, with the promise those funds would help  establish a permanent storage facility. H.R. 3053 authorizes interim  storage, a necessary step to move spent nuclear fuel out of our  communities and into interim storage facilities, until a permanent  storage solution is established.   Mr. Chair, I speak on behalf of my constituents, who say the time to  fix this problem is now. The Federal Government owes it to the American  people to fulfill its obligation and take ownership of spent fuel.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) for his  leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  3053.
