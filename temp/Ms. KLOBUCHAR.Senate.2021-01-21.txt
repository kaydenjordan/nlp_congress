 Vice President Pence, Mr. President-elect,       Madam Vice President-elect, Members of Congress and the       judicial branch, former Presidents and First Ladies, Vice       Presidents, leaders from abroad, and a whole bunch of Bidens,       America, welcome to the 59th Presidential Inauguration, where       in just a few moments Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will take       their solemn oaths.        This ceremony is the culmination of 244 years of a       democracy. It is a moment when leaders, brought to this stage       by the will of the people, promise to be faithful to our       Constitution, to cherish it, and defend it. It is a moment       when they become, as we all should be, guardians of our       country.        Have we become too jaded, too accustomed to the ritual of       the passing of the torch of democracy to truly appreciate       what a blessing and a privilege it is to witness this moment?       I think not.        Two weeks ago, when an angry, violent mob staged an       insurrection and desecrated this temple of our democracy, it       awakened us to our responsibilities as Americans. This is the       day when our democracy picks itself up, brushes off the dust,       and does what America always does: It goes forward as a       nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for       all.        (Applause.)        This conveyance of a sacred trust between our leaders and       our people takes place in front of this shining Capitol dome       for a reason. When Abraham Lincoln gave his first inaugural       address in front of this Capitol, the dome was only partially       constructed, braced by ropes of steel. He promised he would       finish it. He was criticized for spending funds on it during       the Civil War. To those critics, he replied, ``If the people       see the Capitol going on, it is a sign we intend the Union       shall go on.'' And it did, and it will.        Generations of Americans gave their lives to preserve our       Republic in this place. Great legislation to protect civil       rights and economic security and lead the world was debated       and crafted under this dome. Now, it falls on all of us--not       just the two leaders we are inaugurating today--to take up       the torch of our democracy, not as a weapon of political       arson but as an instrument for good.        We pledge today never to take our democracy for granted as       we celebrate its remarkable strength. We celebrate its       resilience, its grit. We celebrate the ordinary people doing       extraordinary things for our Nation, the doctors and nurses       on the frontline of this pandemic, the officers in the       Capitol, a new generation never giving up hope for justice.        We celebrate a new President, Joe Biden, who vows to       restore the soul of America and cross the river of our       divides to a higher plane.        We celebrate our first African-American, first Asian-      American, and first woman Vice President, Kamala Harris, who       stands on the shoulders of so many on this platform who have       forged the way to this day. When she takes the oath of       office, little girls and boys across the world will know that       anything and everything is possible.        In the end, that is America: our democracy, a country of so       much good. Today, on these Capitol steps and before this       glorious field of flags, we rededicate ourselves to its       cause.        Thank you.        (Applause.)        It is now my honor to introduce to you the Senator who has       worked with me and so many others to make this ceremony       possible, my friend and the chair of the Inaugural Committee,       Missouri Senator Roy Blunt.        (Applause.)         What you are all about to be part of,       America, is a historic moment of firsts.        To administer the oath to our first African-American, our       first Asian-American, and our first woman Vice President,       Kamala Harris, it is my great privilege to welcome to the       inaugural stage the first Latina to ever serve on the Supreme       Court of the United States of America: Justice Sonia       Sotomayor.        The Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, SONIA       SOTOMAYOR, administered to the Vice President-elect the oath       of office prescribed by the Constitution, which she repeated       as follows:        I, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS, do solemnly swear that I will       support and defend the Constitution of the United States       against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear       true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this       obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose       of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the       duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me       God.        (Applause.)        (Jennifer Lopez performed ``This Land Is Your Land'' and       ``America the Beautiful'' accompanied by the U.S. Marine       Band.)        (Applause.)         Well, that was great.        The Sun is shining and, Mr. President-elect, this is the       first inauguration in the history of America where J-Lo was       the warmup act for Chief Justice Roberts.        With that, it is now my distinct honor to introduce the       Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, John       Roberts, to administer the Presidential oath to the next       President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden.        (Applause.)        The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, JOHN G. ROBERTS,       JR., administered to the President-elect the oath of office       prescribed by the Constitution, which he repeated, as       follows:        I, JOSEPH ROBINETTE BIDEN, JR., do solemnly swear that I       will faithfully execute the office of President of the United       States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve,       protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. So       help me God.        The CHIEF JUSTICE. Congratulations, Mr. President.        (Applause.)         My fellow Americans--a moment we have all       been waiting for--it is now my great privilege and high honor       to be the first person to officially introduce the 46th       President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden, Jr.        (Applause.)        The PRESIDENT. Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President       Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell,       Vice President Pence, and my distinguished guests, my fellow       Americans, this is America's day. This is democracy's day--a       day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve.        Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested       anew, and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we       celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause, the       cause of democracy. The people--the will of the people--has       been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded.        We have learned again that democracy is precious, democracy       is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has       prevailed.        (Applause.)        Now, on this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago       violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we       come together as one Nation under God, indivisible, to carry       out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than       two centuries.        As we look ahead in our uniquely American way--restless,       bold, optimistic--and set our sights on a nation we know we       can and we must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties       for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom       of my heart.        (Applause.)        I know the resilience of our Constitution and the       strength--the strength of our Nation--as does President       Carter, who I spoke with last night, who cannot be with us       today, but whom we salute for his lifetime in service.        I have just taken the sacred oath each of those patriots       have taken, the oath first sworn by George Washington. But       the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some       of us, but on all of us--on we, the people, who seek a more       perfect union. This is a great nation. We are good people.       Over the centuries, through storm and strife, in peace and at       war, we have come so far, but we still have far to go.        We will press forward with speed and urgency for we have       much to do in this winter of peril and significant       possibilities--much to repair, much to restore, much to heal,       much to build, and much to gain. Few people in our Nation's       history have been more challenged or found a time more       challenging or difficult than the time we are in now. A once-      in-a-century virus that silently stalks the country has taken       as many lives in 1 year as America lost in all of World War       II.        Millions of jobs have been lost, and hundreds of thousands       of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice, some 400       years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all       will be deferred no longer.        (Applause.)        A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that       can't be any more desperate or any more clear now--the rise       of political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism       that we must confront and we will defeat.        (Applause.)        To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and       secure the future of America requires so much more than       words; it requires the most elusive of all things in a       democracy: unity. Unity.        In another January on New Year's Day in 1863, Abraham       Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen       to paper, the President said:        If my name ever goes down in history, it will be for this       act, and my whole soul is in it.        My whole soul is in it today, on this January day. My whole       soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our       people, uniting our Nation. I ask every American to join me       in this cause.        (Applause.)        Uniting to fight the foes we face--anger, resentment and       hatred, extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease,       joblessness, and hopelessness--with unity, we can do great       things, important things. We can right wrongs. We can put       people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in       safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward       work and rebuild the middle class and make healthcare secure       for all. We can deliver racial justice, and we can make       America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.        I know, speaking of unity, it can sound to some like a       foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us       are deep and they are real, but I also know they are not new.       Our history has been a constant struggle between the American       ideal, that we all are created equal, and the harsh ugly       reality  [[Page S78]]       that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn       us apart. The battle is perennial, and victory is never       assured.        Through Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11,       and through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our better       angels have always prevailed. In each of these moments,       enough of us--enough of us--have come together to carry all       of us forward, and we can do that now.        History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.       We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors.       We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join       forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For       without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury;       no progress, only exhausting outrage; and no nation, only a       state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and       challenge, and unity is the path forward, and we must meet       this moment as the United States of America.        If we do that, I guarantee you we will not fail. We have       never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted       together. So, today, at this time, in this place, let's start       afresh--all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another       again, hear one another, see one another, and show respect to       one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire       destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't       have to be a cause for total war, and we must reject the       culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even       manufactured.        (Applause.)        My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.       America has to be better than this, and I believe America is       so much better than this. Just look around. Here we stand in       the shadow of the Capitol dome, as was mentioned earlier,       completed amid the Civil War when the Union itself was       literally hanging in the balance; yet we endured. We       prevailed.        Here we stand, looking out on the great Mall where Dr. King       spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at       another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block       brave women marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark       the swearing in of the first woman in American history       elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris.       Don't tell me things can't change.        (Applause.)        Here we stand, across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery,       where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest       in eternal peace. Here we stand, just days after a riotous       mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of       the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive       us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never       happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever--not ever.        (Applause.)        To all those who supported our campaign, I am humbled by       the faith you placed in us. To all those who did not support       us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a       measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it.       That is democracy. That is America. The right to dissent       peaceably within the guardrails of our Republic is perhaps       this Nation's greatest strength; yet hear me clearly.       Disagreement must not lead to disunion, and I pledge this to       you: I will be a President for all Americans--all Americans.        (Applause.)        I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not       support me as for those who did.        (Applause.)        Many centuries ago, St. Augustine, a saint in my church,       wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common       action of their love, defined by the common objects of their       love. What are the common objects we, as Americans, love that       define us as Americans? I think we know: opportunity,       security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and, yes, the       truth.        Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.       There is truth, and there are lies, lies told for power and       for profit. Each of us has a duty and a responsibility as       citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders--leaders       who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our       Nation--to defend the truth and defeat the lies.        (Applause.)        Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view       the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry       about their jobs. I understand, like my dad, they lay in bed       at night staring at the ceiling, wondering: Can I keep my       healthcare? Can I pay my mortgage? Thinking about their       families and about what comes next. I promise you, I get it.        But the answer is not to turn inward and to retreat into       competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like you       or worship the way you do or don't get their news from the       same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits       red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus       liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of       hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and       humility, and if we are willing to stand in the other       person's shoes, as my mom would say. Just for a moment, stand       in their shoes.        Because here is the thing about life: There is no       accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days, you need a       hand. There are other days when we are called to lend a hand.       That is how it has to be. That is what we do for one       another. If we are this way, our country will be stronger,       more prosperous, more ready for the future, and we can       still disagree.        My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we are going       to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere       through this dark winter. We are entering what may be the       toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside       politics and finally face this pandemic as one Nation--one       Nation.        (Applause.)        And I promise you this, as the Bible says: ``Weeping may       endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.'' We will       get through this together--together.        (Applause.)        Look, folks, all my colleagues I serve with in the House       and the Senate up here, we all understand the world is       watching, watching all of us today. So here is my message to       those beyond our borders: America has been tested, and we       have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances       and engage with the world once again--not to meet yesterday's       challenges but today's and tomorrow's challenges--and we will       lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power       of our example.        (Applause.)        We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace,       progress, and security.        Look, you all know we have been through so much in this       Nation. In my first act as President, I would like to ask you       to join me in a moment of silent prayer. Remember all those       who we lost in this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000       fellow Americans--moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons,       daughters, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. We will honor       them by becoming the people and the Nation we know we can and       should be. I ask you, let's say a silent prayer for those who       have lost their lives and those left behind and for our       country.        (Moment of silence.)        Amen.        Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our       democracy and on truth, a raging virus, growing inequity, the       sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis, and America's       role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to       challenge us in profound ways, but the fact is we face them       all at once, presenting this Nation with one of the gravest       responsibilities we have had.        Now, we are going to be tested. Are we going to step up,       all of us? It is time for boldness, for there is so much to       do. And this is certain: I promise you, we will be judged,       you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our       era. Will we rise to the occasion is the question. Will we       master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our       obligations and pass along a new and better world to our       children?        I believe we must. I am sure you do as well. I believe we       will. When we do, we will write the next great chapter in the       history of the United States of America--the American story--      a story that might sound something like a song that means a       lot to me. It is called ``American Anthem.'' There is one       verse that stands out, at least for me, and it goes like       this:        The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this       day, which shall be our legacy, what will our children say?       Let me know in my heart when my days are through, America,       America, I gave my best to you.        Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story       of our great Nation. If we do this, then when our days are       through, our children and our children's children will say of       us: They gave their best, they did their duty, they healed       a broken land.        My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a       sacred oath. Before God and all of you, I give you my word. I       will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I       will defend our democracy. I will defend America, and I will       give all--all of you--keep everything I do in your service,       thinking not of power but of possibilities, not of personal       interest but of public good. And together, we shall write an       American story of hope, not fear; of unity, not division; of       light, not darkness; a story of decency and dignity, love and       healing, greatness and goodness--may this be the story that       guides us, the story that inspires us, and the story that       tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history.       We met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice, did       not die on our watch but thrived, that America secured       liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the       world. That is what we owe our forbearers, one another, and       generations to follow.        So, with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our       time sustained by faith, driven by conviction, and devoted to       one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May       God bless America, and may God protect our troops.        Thank you, America.        (Applause.)        (Garth Brooks performed ``Amazing Grace.'')
