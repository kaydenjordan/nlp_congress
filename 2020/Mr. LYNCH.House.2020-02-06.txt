 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott) for yielding me this time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2474, the Protecting  the Right to Organize Act. As a former--well, I am still an ironworker.  I still pay my dues every single month.   I strapped on a pair of work boots for about 20 years as an  ironworker and eventually worked my way up to become president of  Ironworkers Local 7 in Boston. So I guess that makes me a union boss,  as I have been referred to previously. I am organized labor, I guess.   I have seen firsthand how employers have used intimidation and  threats to punish and deter workers from the right to join a union, to  seek safe conditions at work and fair wages, and to have a voice in the  workplace.   This bill before us takes direct aim at the abusive employer  practices by closing loopholes in existing law, establishing civil  penalties for retaliation, and ensuring new unions get their first  contract.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote in favor of this act.
