 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, clean water is critical for the health and safety of our  communities and our families. Our local businesses, farmers, and our  economy depend on clean water for their success and their prosperity.   House Democrats have a proud and successful history of supporting  clean water. House Democrats have championed investments in our  Nation's water and wastewater infrastructure systems, ensuring that all  communities can trust in the safety of the water they drink and the  treatment of the wastewater they produce.   Last Congress, House Democrats provided historic, bipartisan  investment in our Nation's infrastructure through the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law. Specifically for clean water, the BIL invests  almost $13 billion in clean water infrastructure and is creating jobs  in communities across the country.   The BIL showed what Congress can do when we focus on the needs of  American families. Today, I would put to you that we are doing the  opposite and putting polluters over people with this doomed veto  override attempt.   In my own State of Washington, we are defined by clean water,  including the health of the iconic Puget Sound and the hundreds of  crystal clear lakes and thousands of miles of rivers and streams that  run through our State.   My constituents know that rivers, streams, and wetlands are  intrinsically connected. Pollution that starts in one body of water  does not stay put.   House Democrats know we can protect clean water while providing  certainty to businesses, farmers, and for everyone who depends upon  clean water for their lives and livelihoods.   This is especially true for the 117 million Americans who depend on  smaller streams as a source of drinking water at a time when many  States continue to face historic droughts.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they want clean  water rules that are simple, clear, and easy to follow. So do we. We  agree on that.   The Biden administration's Clean Water Restoration Rule does just  that, following the law and the science of protecting clean water while  providing regulatory certainty and stability for everyone.   Unfortunately, this resolution will do the opposite.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the administration's call for vetoing H.J.  Res. 27.   The argument is that they want bright lines in the regulation of  clean water, yet the only proposal that my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle seem to support is the Navigable  [[Page H1783]]  Waters Protection Rule of the previous administration, a proposal that  removed Federal protections on roughly half of the Nation's wetlands  and 70 percent of its rivers and streams.   That rule was rightly rejected by a Federal court, not by this  administration, but by a Federal court in 2021, as fundamentally flawed  and likely to cause serious environmental harm every day that it  remained in effect.   Yet, despite their call for certainty, my colleagues have failed to  recognize that passage of this resolution that is before us today would  leave Americans without a clear definition of waters of the United  States.   By taking away this clarity, this resolution brings back the very  same uncertainty and ambiguity that supporters claim to be concerned  about. I know they are concerned about that uncertainty.   This resolution will adversely impact farmers, ranchers, and  developers by creating regulatory chaos and eliminating important  exclusions that have been codified in this administration's rule to  help water-dependent businesses and farmers understand and comply with  the law.   For example, because it prohibits the EPA from issuing substantially  the same rule, this resolution means the elimination of two  longstanding exclusions for wastewater treatment systems and prior  converted crop land--exclusions that have been relied upon by  communities, developers, industry, and farmers for decades.   This resolution would also eliminate six new regulatory exclusions  for features considered generally non-jurisdictional, including certain  ditches, artificially irrigated areas, and artificial lakes or ponds.   Ironically, this resolution will result in more uncertainty and more  bodies of water being regulated than under the administration's  proposal. You don't have to take my word for it. Just read the  Congressional Budget Office report accompanying this resolution. It is  right in there.   As I mentioned previously on this floor and in another debate on this  issue, the Biden proposal will not adversely impact family farmers in  this country, period. Why?   Because farmers are, by statute, largely exempt from the Clean Water  Act regulation where less than 1 percent of all wetlands permits relate  to ag activities nationwide.   Therefore, if a farm is engaged in normal farming, forestry, and  ranching activity, that farm is exempt from regulation, and the current  proposal does not change that exemption.   In short, this resolution still makes no sense. It invalidates the  Biden rule and all the clarifications and all of the exceptions for  business it contains in favor of a similarly structured but much less  clear regulatory framework.   It increases uncertainty and the likelihood of continued legal  battles and gridlock; the opposite of what businesses and farmers are  looking for.   Mr. Speaker, I support this administration's efforts on clean water,  both through implementation of the critical bipartisan infrastructure  law investments in water infrastructure and its veto of this  shortsighted resolution.   This resolution represents a step backward for clean water, increases  uncertainty for businesses, and doubles down on fighting and on chaos.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to oppose this  resolution and work toward real predictability for businesses that need  it, and clean water for communities that cannot survive without it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the  following letter from 111 organizations opposed to overriding the veto  of this Congressional Review Act resolution.                                                    April 17, 2023.      Re: Vote NO on the veto override of H.J. Res. 27, the           Congressional Review Act joint resolution of disapproval           of the Revised Definition of the ``Waters of the United           States''.         Dear Representative: On behalf of our members and       supporters, the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose       the attempt to override President Biden's veto of H.J. Res.       27, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of       disapproval targeting the Revised Definition of the ``Waters       of the United States'' rule (Clean Water Restoration Rule).       This dangerous legislation would invalidate the Biden       administration's recently finalized regulation, which ensures       protections for many of the waters that our families and       communities value and depend on.        This Clean Water Restoration Rule ensures that critical       waters--from small streams to rivers to wetlands--are       protected from unregulated pollution and destruction when       they have important downstream effects on water quality. The       rule is a return to a familiar approach that the       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps       of Engineers (USACE) have used to identify waters that       qualify as ``waters of the United States'' since President       George W. Bush's administration. It also resoundingly rejects       the Trump-era approach, which unlawfully and unscientifically       rolled back the Clean Water Act's long standing protections       and reinstates basic safeguards to ensure big polluters can       be stopped from recklessly and indiscriminately bulldozing       our wetlands and dumping waste into our streams. The Clean       Water Restoration Rule is grounded in science, which       demonstrates that the condition of waters often depends on       water bodies upstream, and those upstream waters must be       protected to safeguard the health of downstream communities       and the environment. The rule will more effectively fulfill       the purpose of the Clean Water Act: ``to restore and maintain       the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the       Nation's waters.''        By using the Congressional Review Act to attack the Clean       Water Restoration Rule, H.J. Res. 27 is employing an       incredibly blunt tool in a dangerous attempt to undermine the       Clean Water Act itself. When a rule is undone using the CRA       process, future administrations are prevented from issuing       rules that are ``substantially the same,'' which could       undermine future agency action to the benefit of polluters.       Despite rhetoric that this bill is being promoted to provide       certainty for businesses and other stakeholders, it would       actually do the opposite. For instance, should H.J. Res. 27       become law, both protections and exemptions codified in the       Clean Water Restoration Rule, including ones for the       agriculture industry, could be called into question in future       efforts designed to define ``waters of the United States.''       The only stakeholders who benefit from this attack on our       clean water protections are big polluters who dump waste into       our waterways and burden our families and communities with       the health and environmental costs.        Again, we ask you to oppose the veto override of H.J. Res.       27, the CRA joint resolution disapproving of the Biden-Harris       administration's Revised Definition of the ``Waters of the       United States.'' This harmful bill is simply a polluter-      driven effort to undermine the Clean Water Act and the       critical safeguards that it provides for our waters. Congress       should be doing more, not less, to protect our waterways and       to ensure that everyone, no matter their race, zip code, or       income, has access to clean, safe water.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, before I reserve my time, I  want to state, again, for the record, that the Federal courts blocked  the implementation of the previous administration's navigable waters  protection rule. It wasn't this administration.   In response to that, the administration developed a new rule, this  particular one that we are debating today. So it needs to be said for  the record that the Federal courts made a decision about the previous  administration's rule, not this particular administration.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute just  to clarify that if this passes and we override the veto message, the  end result will be reverting to a rule that was created around 2007,  2008, not the last administration's rule but another rule that I don't  think either side likes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have a long, proud, and successful  history of supporting clean water. Last year, House Democrats  successfully made historic investments in our Nation's infrastructure  through the bipartisan infrastructure law, providing communities with  almost $13 billion in clean water infrastructure upgrades and creating  jobs.   These clean water investments are helping everyday Americans with  safe, reliable, and sustainable water and wastewater services while  providing good-paying jobs that cannot be sent overseas and  reinvigorating our State and local economies.   Every day, more and more Americans are realizing the public health,  economic, and environmental benefits of this transformative law,  benefits that will continue as additional resources are implemented  across the country.   The bipartisan infrastructure law was what Congress can do at its  best. This resolution is the opposite. Again, I support President Biden  for his decision to veto this resolution.   My colleagues say they want certainty, and we agree, but that  certainty that we support also ensures the health and safety of our  environment for current and future generations. This resolution,  though, provides no certainty.   I argue that it is a playbook for how to create confusion, more  litigation, and continued gridlock.   This resolution provides no benefits to public health. It seeks to  eliminate protections for rivers, streams, and wetlands, many of which  provide drinking water for millions of Americans.   This resolution provides no benefits for our economy. It not only  casts aside a time-tested, scientifically based tool to implement the  Clean Water Act, but it also blocks any provision of additional clarity  for businesses, farmers, and homebuilders going forward.   In short, this resolution is a step backward for clean water, and it  is a step backward for certainty.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sustain the President's veto by  voting ``no'' and to reject this attack on our clean water future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
