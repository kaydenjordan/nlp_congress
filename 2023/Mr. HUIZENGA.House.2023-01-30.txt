 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McHenry for yielding me  time this afternoon.   I rise today in support of the Credit Union Board Modernization Act  and ask for its immediate passage.   Credit unions can play an important role in many of our local  communities, often working with families and small business owners to  gain access to credit.   H.R. 582 will go a long way to providing reasonable regulatory relief  for credit unions, especially in Michigan's Fourth Congressional  District and across the Nation.                                time  1715    Mr. Speaker, if signed into law, these commonsense, reasonable  reforms will allow federally chartered credit unions in good standing  in Michigan and across the country the same reasonable governance  practices afforded to those at the State level.   Currently, all federally chartered credit union boards must meet at  least once month. This one-size-fits-all requirement often negatively  impacts smaller rural credit unions, which ultimately impacts, frankly,  which members are willing to even serve on those boards and therefore  the services that they can and will be able to provide to their local  community.   The Credit Union Board Modernization Act rightly modernizes how often  federally chartered credit union boards must meet, which the National  Credit Union Administration currently mandates to be monthly. Nothing  in this legislation prevents a credit union from meeting more than six  times a year. It just gives them the flexibility and they are able to  then decide. That is the idea of a credit union; member-driven, they  will decide.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this bill, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Vargas) for working with Republicans, and specifically  me, this last Congress to implement these reasonable safeguards.   I do want to note, specifically, this legislation does not apply to  new credit unions or those credit unions with low exam ratings, as the  chair had indicated. Highly rated credit unions with high management  ratings must hold at least six meetings annually, with at least one  meeting held during each fiscal quarter.   Alternatively, these lower-rated credit unions must continue to meet  once a month, and there will be direction on that, as the chair has  outlined.   I want to be clear. This bill does not give credit unions an  advantage over their community bank counterparts but brings parity to  an outdated process.   Again, I thank Congressman Vargas for his commitment to make this a  bipartisan effort. I look forward to seeing these reforms, which will  strengthen local economies across the Nation, enacted into law.
