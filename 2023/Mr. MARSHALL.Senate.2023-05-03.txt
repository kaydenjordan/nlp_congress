 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use a prop  during my remarks.    Madam President, today, I rise in support of S.J. Res.  9, providing for congressional disapproval of the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service's rule regarding the lesser prairie-chicken under the  Congressional Review Act.   Since I was 10 years old, my family has enjoyed hunting prairie  chickens. As a matter of fact, the first bird I ever shot, the first  time I ever went hunting, 10 years of age with a 20-gauge single  shotgun, I was able to down one of these beautiful birds.   But last November, the Fish and Wildlife Service ignored decades of  voluntary conservation efforts and published a rule lifting the lesser  prairie-chicken species as endangered and threatened under the  Endangered Species Act.   Enacted in 1973, the Endangered Species Act, the ESA, was created to  protect species believed to be on the brink of extinction. Today, the  consequences of this law reach far beyond its original intent. If  saving species were the only  [[Page S1499]]  consideration, then this administration wouldn't be listing the lesser  prairie-chicken whose population is considered stable in my home State  of Kansas.   I ask you, was the ESA made for the good of human kind or was human  kind made for the good of the ESA?   Make no mistake about it, the listing of any species adds more rules,  more hoops to jump through, more time and costs from everyone, from our  farmers and ranchers, our oilfield workers, and our utility linemen who  are building out new power poles and electric lines to get wind- generated electricity out to more populated States.   The ESA is just another weaponized tool that this President uses to  attack rural America. This move is not surprising, considering the  President recently vetoed the bipartisan resolution to strike down the  WOTUS rule. This White House continues to push policies and resurrect  taxes that disproportionately hurt rural America.   For over 20 years now, Federal, State, and private landowners have  voluntarily collaborated with Fish and Wildlife Services to conserve  the lesser prairie-chicken and its habitat.   These partnerships have already resulted in conservation agreements  covering roughly 15 million acres of potential habitat for species. To  list the bird now, after all the conservation effort, sends a message  to stakeholders that no matter how much good work you do, the hammer  will still fall, the heavy-handed government will still step in and  list species under the ESA and attempt to regulate your industry out of  existence, all in the name of climate.   The Federal Government thinks it knows best when it comes to  conservation, but this law continues to fail its most basic mission:  recovering and delisting species. Despite billions of dollars spent in  the name of the ESA, less than 2 percent of all listed species have  been removed from its ESA protection since 1973--just 2 percent.   Through a combination of public and private efforts, the lesser  prairie-chicken is better protected now more than ever. Listing them as  threatened or endangered will not provide any additional conservation  benefits above what already exists.   As this chart shows, while the prairie chicken numbers tend to follow  rainfall, they have been growing since the Obama administration first  attempted to list the bird in 2014.   No one in this body wants to see this beautiful bird go extinct. As a  matter of fact, we are fighting to preserve it. My hope is that one  day, once again, my grandchildren can hunt lesser prairie-chickens like  their great-great-grandfathers did.   No oil producer, no rancher, no farmer, no wind energy producer wants  the demise of the lesser prairie-chicken. That is why voluntary  partnerships have worked and are working. Just like all my fellow  Kansans, I am committed to saving our environment for future  generations.   To share some wise words from one of my friends:         We are passengers on this planet, not captains.    We need to continue to work with Mother Nature, not punish hard- working Americans. A listing of this species now will only slow down  and drive up the cost of our wind energy exports from Kansas, which  shares many of the same range. The listing will also push oil and gas  development to countries that have long track records of violating  human rights or the extraction of these important and necessary energy  sources in a manner much more harmful to the environment than those  utilized by American producers.   Whether it is gas or diesel or wind energy, this decision to list the  chicken would increase the cost of energy. It would federalize millions  of acres of ranch lands and expand the regulatory burden on our farmers  and ranchers, ultimately, increasing the cost of food. But for what? An  attempt to protect the species by an Agency that has only successfully  recovered 2 percent of the species that it has listed.   No, thanks. The local communities have and will continue to do what  is best for the bird and, more importantly, for the environment through  ongoing, proven conservation efforts--conservation efforts passed on  from one generation of farmers and ranchers to the next.   This administration ignores the impact that overregulation has on  American industries. And I hear this from everyone who visits my  office. The costs of this administration's rules and regulations  already outpace the last two administrations combined, with $363  billion in rules so far. Since January 1 of this year alone, that  number is $148 billion.   Under this administration, the annual paperwork burden on businesses  has increased to over 220 million hours. Since January 1, that number  is approaching 50 million hours--indeed, a redtape of nightmare for  businesses.   This resolution is one of many vital steps the Senate GOP is taking  to unleash the economy from the bureaucratic harassment that the White  House has deployed. I am asking you to join me in applauding, rather  than punishing, voluntary conservation efforts and support the joint  resolution for congressional disapproval of the lesser prairie-chicken  listing.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to honor and  celebrate the life and legacy of Mr. Ernie Barrett, synonymously known  as Mr. K-State.   Ernie was born in Pratt, KS, on August 27, 1929. He is a proud  graduate of Wellington High School, where he led his basketball team to  their first State championship in 1947. He was recruited by the likes  of the University of Kansas and Oklahoma State, but chose to attend  Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS, beginning a lifelong  affiliation with the school and town.   During his 3-year collegiate career, K-State won two Big Seven  Conference titles in 1950 and 1951. As a First Team All-American for  the 1951 season, Ernie led the team to the school's first and only NCAA  National Championship game appearance. Ernie earned two degrees from K- State, a bachelor's in physical education and a master's degree in  journalism.   He would go on to be selected by the Boston Celtics with the seventh  overall pick in the 1951 NBA draft. However, he would not join the  Celtics for another 2 years, as he proudly served his Nation in the  U.S. Air Force from 1951-53. Despite a yearlong hiatus from  professional basketball, Ernie played under legendary head coach Red  Auerbach for the 1953-54 and 1955-56 seasons. He was a key contributor  to two Celtics teams that reached the Eastern Division finals in both  of his professional seasons.   Following his professional basketball career, Ernie came back to K- State as an assistant basketball coach where he helped lead the school  to five Big Eight regular season titles in his 6 years as a coach. His  service to K-State was not limited to the basketball court, as he would  go on to serve as assistant athletics director, director of athletics,  university consultant, and director of development throughout his  career as a university administrator. A legendary fundraiser and  promoter for K-State, his efforts contributed to the development of  Bill Snyder Family Stadium, R.V. Christian Track and Field Complex,  Bramlage Coliseum, Tointon Family Stadium, Colbert Hills Golf Course,  as well as many other projects that have greatly impacted the students  of K-State and the residents of Manhattan, KS.   After 75 years of service to K-State, Ernie passed away on April 21,  2023. His list of accomplishments are endless, and his impact on K- State, and Manhattan, KS, is timeless. There will certainly never be  another Mr. K-State.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and legacy of  Mr. Ernie Barrett, as well as celebrate his tremendous impact on Kansas  State University.                            ____________________
