 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I want to begin by welcoming the  Tennessee National Guard's 268th Military Police Company home after a  305-day deployment to Africa.   We are so incredibly grateful for their service and for the service  and sacrifice that their families make during these times of  deployment, and I know I speak for every Tennessean when I say to them:  Welcome home. Job well done.    Mr. President, over the years, country music  has evolved from its humble roots into a celebration of extremes. Most  modern artists like to draw their listeners into one of two states:  perfect happiness or pure agony. But country music's legacy lies  somewhere in the middle, where life tests our mettle and deals both joy  and sorrow, all too often in unequal measure. It is the realm of the  courageously unlucky and the quietly brokenhearted and the source of  the world's most complex and affecting storytelling. It is that world  that Loretta Lynn invited us to experience from the time she was a  young woman until the day she died.   Her resume is one of the most impressive in all entertainment: 46  solo studio albums, more than 50 Top Ten hits, member of the Grand Ole  Opry, Country Music Hall of Famer, and the Country Music Association's  first female Entertainer of the Year. But Loretta was much more than  the sum of her accolades.   She grew up poor and uneducated in the coal-mining hills of Kentucky.  She was a wife at 15, a mother at 16, and moved thousands of miles away  from home at an age when most teenagers today would just start dreaming  about escaping from their parents. When she wasn't busy raising her  children, she sang and played songs on a $17 Sears guitar.   If Nashville is a 10-year town, then I suppose Loretta Lynn must have  considered herself lucky at last, she only had to wait 7 months from  the time of her first record pressing to the moment she first stepped  onstage at the Grand Ole Opry. Still, at 28, she had seen more than  enough to know that there was no hiding in a spotlight, so she sang  about her life and found a voice that was once assertive and  disruptive. She blazed trails in music and television by being herself,  using humor to blunt the edge that hard living and having little agency  well into womanhood had given her writing.   On October 4 of this year, we lost our coal miner's daughter to a far  better place. I will be forever grateful to her for her absolute belief  in the power of storytelling. I hope her memory will inspire future  generations of young women in music to do the bravest thing an artist  can do and share their joy, pain, confusion, and hope in its most  authentic form.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr.  Hagerty, I ask unanimous consent that the following remarks be printed  in the Congressional Record to honor Ms. Ruth Skidmore of Oak Ridge,  TN.   By the end of the Second World War, there were almost 30,000 Army  nurses on Active Duty. These brave healers served on the home front and  across oceans, caring for the wounded, and bringing hope to thousands  of American and Allied servicemembers.   On November 2, 1943, a young lady named Ruth Skidmore joined their  ranks and helped guide her compatriots on the frontlines through one of  the darkest and most violent periods in American history. On October  13, 2022, Ruth celebrated her 100th birthday, and it felt appropriate  that we should in turn celebrate not only her service to this country  but her enduring legacy of service to her community.   Ruth Skidmore was born 100 years ago in Fort Wayne, IN, the sixth of  seven children. She held an afterschool job at the one-room schoolhouse  across the street from her home, cleaning chalkboards and erasers for  10 cents a day. Following her father's advice, Ruth deposited her  earnings in a savings account--a responsible decision indeed.  Unfortunately, she lost all $13 of her savings in the crash of `29.   To this day, Ruth is still mad at Herbert Hoover.   She is a graduate of Hanover College, where she was crowned May Queen  in her senior year. After college, Ruth contracted an eye infection and  moved in with her uncle, who was an Army doctor. He suggested that she  move to Arizona, believing that the dry air would aid in her healing.  As it turns out, this piece of advice would change the course of Ruth's  life. She moved to Tucson and signed up for Army Cadet School. The war  was on, and everyone had a role to play. After the war Ruth moved to  Oak Ridge, TN; after a short stint in Fort Lauderdale, FL, she returned  to the Volunteer State to work as an industrial nurse at the Y-12  National Security Complex.   Over the years Ruth took on the duties of a wife and a mother, but  she never stopped serving her community. While raising her family, Ruth  worked part-time as a nurse and especially enjoyed her 2 years working  in Appalachia.   Today, Ruth lives in Oak Ridge, where she indulges her green thumb  and a love of music. She has always had a large garden and, as she puts  it, was growing organic vegetables before it was cool. At the age of  60, Ruth threw herself into music lessons and developed no small talent  on both the guitar and the piano. She regularly dazzles her friends and  neighbors as part of a veterans' band.   Ruth, what a life you have lived. On behalf of all Tennesseans and  our colleagues in the U.S. Senate, we wish you a very happy birthday  and as much joy and love as one person could hope for in the coming  year.
