 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a  colloquy with my colleagues from the Colorado River Basin and with  Senator Manchin, the ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, regarding the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan  Authorization Act.   I am pleased that we are considering this bill so quickly on the  Senate floor. We need to act now as the historic drought conditions in  the basin are a real threat to the water supply of 40 million people  and 5.5 million acres of farmland.   As the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I  think it is important that we spend some time clarifying the intent  behind this bill. We started last month with an oversight hearing in  the Water and Power Subcommittee to examine the Colorado River Drought  Contingency Plan, which was chaired by my colleague, the Senator from  Arizona, Ms. McSally.   We also need to understand what the legislation that we are passing  today does and does not do. As I read it, the measure directs the  Secretary of the Interior to implement the Drought Contingency Plan  agreements upon their execution by the seven basin States. The 2007  final environmental impact statement on Colorado River Interim  Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and Coordinated Operations for  Lake Powell and Lake Mead enables the Secretary to do so immediately as  this document covers all of the Federal actions contemplated in the  agreements.   I ask Senator McSally, is that the correct reading of the bill?    I thank all of the Senators for providing their views  on the language and for sponsoring this important legislation.   I ask Senator Manchin, has he heard the discussion among the sponsors  of this bill? Is what he has heard from them about the intent of the  legislation in line with his understanding?    I thank my colleagues for this clarification and  explanation of the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan  Authorization Act. As we have just explained, the bill sponsors, along  with the chair and ranking member of committee of jurisdiction are  unified in the expectation that enactment of this bill will lead to  immediate action by the Secretary of the Interior, and the DCP will be  signed and implemented upon execution by the States.                            ____________________
