 Mr. Speaker, the funding  authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is  currently set to expire on Saturday, September 30. The FAA depends  heavily on reliable and long-term funding provided through the Airport  and Airway Trust Fund and the spending levels set in a corresponding  authorization bill. This consistent and reliable funding is the  mainstay of the FAA's success in managing the safest and most complex  airspace in the world. Absent access to this funding through a long- term authorization for FAA programs, we are threatening the safety,  reliability, and effectiveness of our airspace.   Sadly, Congress is yet again backed into a corner of taking up a  short-term, six-month measure that would extend this funding  authorization through March 31, 2018. This is simply unacceptable.  Congress needs to pass a long-term authorization bill so that the FAA  can focus on the important tasks of maintaining public safety, staffing  air traffic controllers, and bolstering our airport infrastructure  through the timely distribution of Airport Improvement Program (AIP)  dollars. A six-month extension poses new challenges for each of these  important aspects of managing our airspace.   The extension being debated today also adds several extraneous  provisions that run counter to regular order in the House and threatens  the success of passing an ever-important reauthorization. The bill  selectively extends the authorization for certain public health  programs, while leaving out other critical programs such as the State  Children's  [[Page H7469]]  Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The bill also includes language that  would encourage the creation of private flood insurance markets, while  stripping important consumer protections such as the 45 day of  cancellation provision that prevents private insurers from cancelling  cover Just moments before a devastating storm.   Mr. Speaker, allow me to be clear: I suppose a clean, long-term  reauthorization of the FAA's funding authority. However, the underlying  bill not only includes a host of extraneous provisions that I could not  support, but it was done so without the input of me or any of my  Democratic colleagues. If Republicans are serious about maintaining the  safest and most complex airspace in the world, they will pass a clean  reauthorization that authorizes FAA programs for several years, not  several months. We cannot politicize this issue with provisions related  to healthcare, or flood insurance, or privatizing our air traffic  control services. It is far too important and time is quickly running  out.    Mr. Speaker, back in March, the  Congressional Black Caucus met with President Trump to deliver a 130- page policy document which highlighted a host of issues facing the  black community in America. From voting rights to criminal justice  reform, and economic justice to education and the workforce, there are  many areas of society that still experience elements of  institutionalized racism and discrimination against people of color and  other vulnerable segments of the population.   The undermining of the Voting Rights Act in the wake of the Shelby  County Supreme Court decision paved the way for countless states,  including Texas, to adopt discriminatory voting laws that were aimed at  disenfranchising entire segments of the population. Participation in  our elections and the inalienable right to vote are fundamental pillars  of our democracy. Our democracy does not function properly without the  successful and unimpeded participation of the voting public. Yet, these  discriminatory voting laws have been found to do exactly that, while  disproportionately affecting minority populations, the elderly, and the  poor.   The criminal justice system is another area that is ripe for reform  as we consider the fact that African Americans make up only 13 percent  of the U.S. population, yet account for 37 percent of prison inmates.  In some instances, harsh mandatory minimum sentences condemn relatively  minor criminals to a life behind bars. In other examples, we see non- violent drug offenders facing decades in prison over a crime that is  better addressed by health professionals, not the criminal justice  system. The use of private prisons in states such as Texas has also  created a dangerous profit motive behind keeping individuals  incarcerated. These toxic conditions are a recipe for disaster that has  propelled the United States as the world leader for its prison  population rate.   Mr. Speaker, there is much that we can do as a nation to root out any  last remnants of racism in our country and address many of these  issues. However, it requires the participation and cooperation of a  wide range of stakeholder, regardless of party affiliation or  background. Restoring Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act through  legislation would help address many of the discriminatory voting laws  that we have seen emerge, thereby restoring full access to voting for  every American. Eliminating mandatory minimum sentencing and treating  non-violent drug offenses as a health issue instead of a criminal  matter would help reduce the prison population while giving law-abiding  citizens a well-deserved second chance. These are tangible steps that  we can take today to lessen the racial disparities that exist in our  society. I encourage each of my colleagues to work cooperatively to  achieve this end. The American people demand it, and we will be a  better nation for it.                            ____________________
