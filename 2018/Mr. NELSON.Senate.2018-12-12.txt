 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this is my farewell speech, and I  thought it would do me well to think back to the very first speech I  gave on the floor--my maiden speech.   My maiden speech was about a couple of months after my first time  being sworn in. I had waited back then--this is 18 years ago. It was  appropriate for freshmen Senators to wait a while, don't speak up right  away. So I waited 2 or 3 months until it felt like it was the  appropriate time, and I remember there was nobody out here. It was an  empty Chamber. I picked a topic of the day. I think we were trying to  balance the budget at the time--something that 18 years later we are  still trying to do.   Then, in the course of the speech, I mentioned that it was my maiden  speech. Nobody was out here except the Presiding Officer. All of a  sudden, those doors swung open, and right then and there, in strides  Senator Robert Byrd. I was standing at a desk over there on the other  side, and Senator Byrd's seat was either here or here. So I finished my  speech and he said: Will the Senator from Florida yield?   I said: Of course, I will yield.   Senator Byrd, for 30 minutes, gave an oration on the history of  maiden speeches in the Senate. So you can imagine, nothing I said was  memorable, but it was certainly memorable to this Senator that all of a  sudden I would be treated to the corporate knowledge from one of the  lions of the Senate in looking back on the history of this body.   I wanted you to know I am a Florida boy. My family came to Florida  from Denmark in 1829. So many people come to Florida from the  Northeast. Well, my great-great-grandfather was a sailor--a teenager on  a sailing ship--and he ended up in New York in a barroom brawl. He was  frightened that he was going to be arrested, so he ran to hide. He ran  down to the wharf. He hid in a ship, and the ship cast off for Port St.  Joe, FL, in 1829. So you see, my family came to Florida from New York  also.   Five generations--on the other side of the family, I have a deed  signed by Woodrow Wilson in 1917 to my grandparents after they had  worked the land for the required 4 years. Under the Homestead Act, the  government would deed you 160 acres of land. It is the act that pushed  the frontier so much farther into the hinterlands, and we especially  think of it westward, but that was also southward.   That 160 acres of land is, today, in the north end of the space  shuttle runway at the Kennedy Space Center. I cannot imagine, in that  4-year period, my grandparents swatting mosquitos and fending off  alligators and rattlesnakes, scratching out a living they could survive  on out of the hard earth of the land. Yet that is the hardy stock from  which this Senator comes.   Grace and I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. I  stand before you today, and I don't think anyone could have been more  blessed. It is not easy when you take your leave from the people you  love and the work you love, and it causes a time of intense reflection.   So I reflected back to the time in late 1985 and a series of events  over the course of the next few weeks. It was a tense time in the first  launch attempt of the 24th flight of the space shuttle. We went down to  T-minus 8 seconds. I had braced my body for the ignition of the main  engines at T-minus 6.6, and all of a sudden I heard them calling over  the intercom: We stopped the count. We are recycling.   That launch was scrubbed that day. There was an indication by a  sensor that a gimbaling motor on the thrusters of the solid rocket  boosters was malfunctioning. Had that been the case, 9 seconds later,  we would not be going straight up. We would have been cartwheeled.   So we were let off for Christmas, came back into quarantine in the  latter part of December, and tried the next launch attempt, only to go  down to 31 seconds, and the count stopped. An alert supervisor on the  consoles of the launch center had noticed the locks line was getting  too cold. They checked, and a mistaken override of the computer had  occurred and 18,000 pounds of liquid oxygen had been drained. Had we  launched 31 seconds later, we would not have had enough fuel to get to  orbit, and it would have taken the greatest ability of our commander,  Navy Captain--now retired--Robert Gibson, to land a fully loaded  spacecraft on a short runway at Dakar, Senegal, or Moron, Spain.   So we tried the third time. This time, the count was called off for  some external reason. Each of these times, we were in the spacecraft  strapped in, ready to go. At this point, I think the weather was not  cooperating over in Africa and Spain. You have to have clear skies  there in case you get into that transatlantic abort. So it was called  off.   Well, that night, when they drained the tanks, they found that a  temperature probe on the ground support equipment had flowed through  the oxygen line and flowed into the vehicle and was stuck in a prevalve  right next to one of the three main engines. Had we launched that  morning--in this case, the third try--we would have gotten to orbit, it  would have been time for the main engine cut off, and one of the three  engines would not have cut off. It would have blown the rear end of the  orbiter apart.   A few days later--it was a Friday--we tried for the fourth time. This  time we are in the middle of a driving Florida rainstorm. We ran from  the crew van to the launch tower to get into the elevator and out of  the pouring rain. We were strapped in, ready to go, waiting for a hole  to punch through. Now, the rainstorm had turned into a driving Florida  lightning storm, and we were sitting on top of all that liquid  hydrogen. They finally called off the launch the fourth try.   The fifth try was a Sunday morning. It was a beautiful day. We  launched into an almost flawless 6-day mission,  [[Page S7478]]  only to return to Earth, and 10 days later, the Challenger launched and  blew up high in the Florida sky, under circumstances of cold weather  that almost exactly duplicated the first launch attempt back on  December 19.   Intense reflection. Why was I spared? Now, upon intense reflection, I  think I am beginning to see because it has been the great honor of my  life to serve our country and the people of Florida--first in the Army,  then in the State legislature, then in the Congress, then a State  treasurer, and now, 18 years as Senator.   I have tried to serve our country admirably and with integrity  because I believe a public office is a public trust. Through this  journey, I have been so fortunate to have experienced so many neat  corners of this country that all of us here love.   I have seen the Sun shine through the pine trees, the oaks, and the  orange groves of Florida. I have hunted alligators and pythons in the  Everglades. I have jogged the sands of just about every Florida beach  from Pensacola to the Keys.   Of course, I strapped into a rocket, weighing 4\1/2\ million pounds,  to launch to the heavens and see our planet from a way that very few  others have. You have heard me talk about that as I describe our  environment and how beautiful this planet is from the window of a  spacecraft.   Of course, these experiences in this country--the American people,  every one of us and our fellow citizens, the teachers, the soldiers,  the factory workers, the moms, the dads, the students, the farmers,  those are the ones who have inspired me to dedicate a life to public  service. Those folks have been my strength as they are often your  strength. It is the American people who have kept me going for the past  46 years of public service.    While I have experienced the highs and lows of serving in the Senate,  it is often the small, unnoticed steps toward progress that have made  this journey worthwhile. I am most happy with some of the work that has  been done to help individuals. I want to mention just a few.   To Christine Levinson and her family, we have worked tirelessly to  bring Bob Levinson home. I have come to this floor for 11 years and  said that if Iran does not have Bob, they know where to find him. It is  our responsibility to see that Bob--a man who served this country in  the FBI for 30 years--is finally reunited with his wife and seven  children and grandchildren.   In another example, it has been a pleasure to work with Rochelle  Hamm, of Jacksonville, and with the families of the 33 crew members of  the El Faro who perished at sea when their cargo ship sank while they  sailed into the path of a hurricane in 2015. As a result of that  terrible tragedy, we were able to enact into law key maritime safety  reforms, including requiring oceangoing vessels to be outfitted with  distress beacons and equipment to locate lost seafarers.   There are many ways to get things done around here. Sometimes it  requires taking the bully pulpit and confronting people to correct an  injustice. You will notice, as I said, that these are often little  things that people don't notice.   Take the case of Bob ``Peach Head'' Mitchell, of Tampa, who was a  part of the Negro leagues of baseball. For years, he fought to get  Major League Baseball to provide compensation to former Negro leagues  ballplayers, who were excluded from the majors because of their race.  Yet they were some of the best players.   When Jackie Robinson integrated the majors in 1947, the rest of the  majors were not integrated until 1959. All of those Negro leagues  players had still been playing and had never gotten the compensation.  It took 3 years of cajoling and haranguing to get the Major League  Baseball Commissioner to do the right thing and give the elderly former  ballplayers their due.   Sam Snow also comes to mind, who, for most of his life, had paid a  terrible price for the injustice done when the Army had wrongfully  convicted him and 27 other Black soldiers who had participated in a  1944 riot in Seattle that had resulted in the lynching of an Italian  prisoner of war. Some decades later, when the Army had finally admitted  its mistake, it had refused to give those soldiers compensation for  their lost pay and for the time they had spent in prison. Once I heard  about it, I kept on the Army until it paid the veterans their back pay  plus interest.   We all deal in legislation. As for the business of legislation, think  about some of the things that we wrote.   We in Florida wrote legislation to protect Florida's beaches, our  tourism-driven economy, and our wildlife from the dangers of offshore  oil drilling. We, the Democratic caucus, passed groundbreaking  legislation that medically insured 22 million Americans in this  country. In my State, it was over 1.7 million people. We ensured that  they had healthcare and health insurance. Interestingly, because of our  protecting preexisting conditions coverage, just in the State of  Florida alone, 8 million people who have preexisting conditions are  protected because of the law. It also eliminated the lifetime caps on  coverage.   You know the fights that we have had ever since we started that day  on the Finance Committee. It was after the dog days of August, when you  couldn't have a townhall meeting in 2009 because of the disruptions. In  September, we on the Finance Committee wrote that bill. It took every  member of the Democratic caucus--60 strong then--to be able to pass it.  Now millions and millions of people have health insurance who have  never had it before, and untold millions more who have preexisting  conditions are protected.   We wrote the blueprint that has reinvigorated our space program and  brought new space companies and high-paying jobs to our country and to  Florida. In our lifetime, we are going to see humankind set foot on  other celestial bodies besides the Moon--legislation that could not  have been passed without there having been a bipartisan effort.   We fought to help folks get the resources they needed to recover in  the aftermath of the major hurricanes that savaged people's lives and  property. We worked to make higher education more affordable by capping  interest rates on student loans. We also secured billions of dollars in  funding for projects all over America to preserve the environment and  to help restore--and it is restoring--Florida's environmental treasure,  the Everglades. The list goes on and on.   The setbacks temper the successes in that we have seen constant  attempts to disenfranchise voters and to make it more difficult for all  Americans to have their voices heard at the ballot box. Then, of  course, the Court's 2010 decision opened the floodgates and allowed the  wealthiest Americans to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence  our elections and corrupt our democracy.   Also, what in the world has happened to civility and to humility in  our Nation's public discourse? Where are our servant leaders who seek  to serve instead of to be served?   So we still have much work to do. We need now, more than ever, to  focus on building the kind of relationships here in Washington that can  solve the great problems that our Nation faces. I caution our  colleagues and caution those who will join this body to resist the  pulls of partisan acrimony and the forces that seek to divide us.  Tribalism is our problem, and if not corrected, it is going to take our  country down.   I know I am just another Senator who is saying what a lot of Senators  who are departing are saying. We all here remember--right over at that  desk there--John McCain, in one of his last Senate addresses during  which he could stand, saying the same thing.   Some of my fondest memories in the Senate have been with those who  have sat on the other side of that center aisle. Because of this, I  know that while Republicans and Democrats may disagree on policy, we  have a lot to unify us in our values and principles that we share. My  parting words are that there is no greater challenge for this Senate  than to have the moral courage to choose country over party or over  power, to choose justice for all instead of justice for the few, and to  give others respect instead of condemnation.   Those of us who are fortunate enough to serve in this Senate are also  confronted daily by a set of obligations that we have when we take on  this title of U.S. Senator.   We have an obligation to the people of this Nation to do everything  in our  [[Page S7479]]  power to uphold the country's democratic institutions and to insist  that the truth guide our public discussions even if doing so comes at  the cost of short-term political loss. As Senators, we have been  uniquely given the responsibility to provide advice and consent to the  executive branch, and we must take this charge seriously and with  independence from another branch. We must uphold the rule of law. In  doing so, we must affirm that no one person is above the law.   There are a great many challenges that our country faces. I call upon  all of you who serve in this Senate to act with moral courage when  these obligations come calling in the future.   As I depart, I am putting my trust in you. I trust you to work on  behalf of the countless numbers who do not have a voice in this  Chamber. I count on you to give a voice to our brothers and sisters in  Puerto Rico, who are long overdue for representation. I trust you will  fight to make healthcare more accessible and more cost-effective, keep  rigs off of our coasts, and make higher education more affordable for  everyone. I trust you will work to protect our environment from  pollution and will continue the restoration of our Everglades. Above  all, I trust you will act with integrity in uniting Americans for the  common wheel.   For the people of America, you in this Senate must be a beacon of  light at a time when it seems that darkness is increasingly gathering  in our politics. You must remember that your voices and your actions  will help to shape the future. You have the power to make our discourse  more civil and to create change.   To our staff, both in the office and the Commerce Committee, you all  are like family. You are like family to Grace and me, and I am grateful  for the work you do day in and day out for the people of Florida. You  are all hard-working. You are dedicated. You are loyal public servants.  None of what we do around here would be possible were it not for each  of you.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of all staffers  who have been a part of our Senate family over these 18 years be  printed in the Record.

To my wife Grace and my children Bill and Nan Ellen, I am  so grateful for the support you have provided throughout the years. The  journey has been a joy.   I leave this Senate today filled with hope for the future and the  fondest memories of my fellowship with great friends here, but I admit,  it is hard to leave the friends and the work I love. I intend to keep  fighting for all I have talked about in this short, final speech, and I  intend to keep fighting for Florida.   When it comes down to it, I am just a country boy who has loved  serving my State and our country for all of my life. It has been an  incredible honor.   I yield the floor.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
