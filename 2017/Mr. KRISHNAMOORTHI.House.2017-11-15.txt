 Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and the underlying  bill.   This is a tax increase on the middle class, and it drops a ticking  tax bomb on the American people. While it falsely claims to provide tax  relief for working families and the middle class, in reality, it will  raise taxes on 38 million Americans, and it will explode the deficit by  over $1.5 trillion.                                time  1345    A typical family in my district in Illinois would see their taxes  increase by over $1,100.   According to the CBO, H.R. 1 is so irresponsible, that it will result  in an immediate $25 billion cut to Medicare.   Americans recognize that incomes are not keeping pace with the cost  of living, and parents question whether their children will have the  same opportunities they had.   Our constituents need responsible tax reform that strengthens the  middle class and raises wages for working families. They do not need a  tax increase, and this bill does just that. It increases taxes on the  middle class.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this ticking tax bomb.
