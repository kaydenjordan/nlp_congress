 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 724) to revise section 48 of title 18, United States Code,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The budgetary effects of this Act, and the amendments made       by this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory       Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference       to the latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO       Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing in the       Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget       Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted       prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 724, the Preventing  Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, or the PACT Act.   I give special thanks to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Buchanan),  my colleague. He is a longstanding friend of animals in Congress, and I  am thrilled that he agreed to introduce this bill with me to create a  Federal law punishing those who abuse animals.   I also would like to acknowledge Congressman Holding and the hard  work by groups like the Humane Society and Humane Rescue Alliance, who  have helped collect 290 bipartisan cosponsors for this bill. There are  so many groups and people from across the country who have supported  this  [[Page H8356]]  bill--people like Lisa Vanderpump, who added her passion and commitment  to animals to our effort, and groups who rescue animals, literally, in  every corner of our country every single day.   I would also acknowledge and thank one person in particular, Mr.  Speaker--a high school student, one who is so committed to helping  animals, caring for animals, that when she learned about the PACT Act,  she started an online petition hoping to collect a few thousand  signatures. That petition urging Congress to pass this bill gathered  over 729,000 signers. And I am thrilled that that young activist,  Sydney Helfand, is with us in the gallery today.   Now, of all the divisive issues here in Washington, the PACT Act is  one on which we can all agree, we must make animal abuse a Federal  crime. This bill has received so much bipartisan support, because  Americans care about animal welfare. We form deep relationships with  our companion animals and are rightfully outraged by cases of animal  abuse. Animal rights activities stand up for living things that do not  have a voice. That is what the PACT Act does.   Americans expect their law enforcement agencies to crack down on this  horrific violence against animals, and law enforcement officers agree,  which is why the PACT Act has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of  Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Association of  Prosecuting Attorneys, and local law enforcement agencies across the  country. They have asked for this Federal law to bolster their efforts  to target animal abusers, because they understand the direct link  between animal abuse and violent crimes. This link is why the FBI now  collects data on acts of cruelty against animals for their criminal  database, right alongside felony crimes like assault and homicide.   When I first came to Congress, one of the first bills I voted on was  the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, a bill that passed nearly  unanimously and that it made it a crime to create or distribute animal  crush videos, which depict horrific acts against animals.   This bill today takes the next logical step and criminalizes those  acts underlying that crime as well.   The Senate passed the PACT Act by unanimous consent in the last two  Congresses, and I am proud the House is finally doing its part to pass  this important legislation. Today, anyone who inflicts serious bodily  injury on animals will be committing an act for which they should be  condemned. When the PACT Act passes, they will also be violating  Federal law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the PACT Act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Axne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), the chairman of the Congressional Animal  Protection Caucus, an original cosponsor of the PACT Act, and a great  voice for animals and animal rights.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, we should do everything we can to prevent  the torture of animals and take steps to hold accountable those who  would engage in such horrific acts.   The PACT Act is a significant Federal measure to help put an end to  the abuse of animals.   I am thankful to be on the House floor at this incredibly gratifying  bipartisan moment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bipartisan bill.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge every companion  animal that has brought love to my staff members since the PACT Act was  first introduced. Those would be Thomas Jefferson, Desi, Stella, Dock,  Bubba, Maple, Hazel, Cheech, Ollie, Frodo, Theo, Johnson Tiki,  Tankford, Littleman, Natale, Enzo, Dino, Virgil, Rooney, Maybeline,  Prudence, Peppermint, Nazca, Poseidon, Gus, Sansa, Tony, Dwyane Wade,  and my dearly departed Jessie.   For all of them and for every animal who brings joy to everyone in  this Chamber, let's do our part to prevent animal cruelty and torture,  and let's pass the PACT Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
