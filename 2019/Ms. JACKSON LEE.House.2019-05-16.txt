 Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of serving in  this august body, and serving the American people and the people of the  18th Congressional District.   Just a few minutes ago, I was at Arlington Cemetery participating in  the wreath-laying ceremony for the women of the United States military,  those who have fallen in battle, and recognizing young and new women  members of the United States military.   In fact, Sergeant Kelly, whom I honored, is in combat, having been  given permission to be engaged in combat since 2015 by the Pentagon and  the United States Defense Department. That means that I have the  greatest respect for all of these men and women and take very seriously  the issues of war and peace.   I was here in the United States Congress during the heinous and  devastating attack on this Nation on 9/11. I was here for Afghanistan  and Iraq, the Kosovo war, the Bosnian war. Every one of those war zones  I visited. I saw the men and women sacrifice. I take very seriously  this issue of war.   I am very concerned with the efforts now in the waters in the  Mideast, with the intelligence that is alleged by the administration  that is coming and this saber-rattling that is occurring, because the  lives of our men and women will be put in harm's way.   Congress must be engaged, and I demand that, beyond the immediate  [[Page H3848]]  briefing today, the Members of the United States Congress, those who  care about national security, homeland security, be briefed as to why  our vessels are there, others are headed there, and the allegations or  suggestion that 120,000 troops will be moving in that direction.   America is strong. We have no fear, but we have always been a  defender, not an offender. Iran is not just any old country in the  Mideast. Shamefully, we disengaged from the Iran nuclear deal--wrong  decision, evidenced by what is happening today.   You cannot backdoor conversations. You have to show yourself willing  to negotiate with leaders from the position of facts and knowledge.   I can't stomach the frivolous engagements and noninformation that is  translating into our men and women put in harm's way. We must be  involved and engaged.   So I ask the administration to do so posthaste. I ask that we move  forward with knowledge of what is going on, and each and every Member  of this body and the other body should be knowledgeable about this  point.   I return to a local issue that has bothered me, and as a member of  the Judiciary Committee, I want the family of Pamela Turner, who is now  deceased, to know that I stand with them.   I do not give a blanket assessment of the great law enforcement we  have in this Nation, but I am appalled at the shooting death of an  African American woman, Black woman, shot down in cold blood in the  streets.   Yes, this lady was walking her dogs in her apartment complex. There  are suggestions that this individual was well-known to police and that  there were some mental health issues, something that we have to fight  against and give resources. Unfortunately, she was with warrants.   I have no quarrel with people doing their job; but you are in your  home, your apartment, walking your dogs, any other means could have  been utilized to pick you up on warrants. You are not going anywhere.  We know your address. Through an unfortunate interaction, altercation,  the gun was taken out by a law enforcement officer, and she was shot  five times--not once to wound, but five times.   So this requires, for the comity of relationships and respect, a full  Federal and State investigation--we cannot hide--just as I have  indicated that shooting on Harding Street, recently, by officers  requires a thorough and full investigation, which is going on right  now.   So I would simply say that because we are the land of the free and  the brave, we are adherents to the Constitution and democracy and  dignity and justice for all, this is an untenable and unacceptable act,  that I could be walking my dogs, unarmed, and I proceed into an  unfortunate circumstance which included a Taser, but then it results in  the absolute ending of my life, and I may be a person who needed mental  health assistance.   I am deeply troubled to learn of the death of the Pamela Shantay  Turner, who was shot and killed by a Baytown Police Officer. She was a  mother of three children, and she died the day after Mother's Day.   In the investigation following Ms. Turner's death, the officer  indicated that he was patrolling as part of his duty, and recognized  Ms. Turner from ``prior dealings'' and proceeded to commence an arrest  but she resisted. Nothing in the record suggests any wrongdoing by Ms.  Turner prior to this chance encounter with Baytown Police. Reports  suggest the officer attempted to arrest Ms. Turner. The officer alleges  Ms. Turner reached for his Taser and a lieutenant with the Baytown  police claims that Ms. Turner actually tased the officer. According to  the Baytown Police Department, the officer fired his duty weapon and  struck multiple rounds at Ms. Turner. The shooting was recorded by a  civilian and caught on cell phone video. After her death, it was  revealed that Ms. Turner suffers from serious mental ailment. Prior to  her death, Ms. Turner, 44, was heard stating that she was pregnant.  After her death, this was determined not to be the case.   I stand with the family of Pamela Turner. We must get to the truth;  the facts and we will not relent until justice is served. The  circumstances surrounding Ms. Turner's death are shocking and I demand  a state and federal inquiry into her death. First, what predicate did  the officer involved have in detaining Ms. Turner? Why were no efforts  made to deescalate the controversy so that it did not end in a loss of  life? And, if Ms. Turner was known to law enforcement in prior  dealings, did they not also know about her mental state? In recent  months, we have seen too many instances of these types of killings.  During National Police Week we honor our officers and I abhor attacks  on our brave law enforcement personnel. As a member of the House  Judiciary Committee, I look forward to working with law enforcement to  protect justly our citizens and them. This disturbing act should not  have happened and should never be repeated.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me, too, add my appreciation and  congratulations to Head Start, a very viable program, not only in my  district, as I watched little children become empowered with education,  but also around the Nation. I congratulate all of those who were  engaged in its beginning, and I thank them for their brilliance and  their leadership.   I rise today to say that we are troubled because the work of this  body is to legislate on behalf of the people of the United States. We  are, in fact, the people's House, and we have done our work. We have  passed disaster funding.   Those of us who are, if you will, the remnants of various hurricanes  in the 2017 season--in particular, those that impacted the East Coast,  Puerto Rico, Houston, and the State of Texas--are waiting for disaster  funding, which we have done.   We are waiting for the Violence Against Women Act to be passed. We  are waiting for the universal background checks to be passed. We are  waiting for protecting people against losing their preexisting  condition coverage and, of course, lowering prescription drugs to pass.  All that has been passed in this House.   We are waiting as we begin to debate the Equality Act that will have  a blind eye to anyone's difference and be able to celebrate them and  support them without discrimination.   Where is the other body? Why haven't they passed a bill in 3 months?  Why can't we do the work for the American people?   It is time to get the job done.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise and support,  enthusiastically, H.R. 987, the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering  Prescription Drug Costs Act.   This omnibus bill combines three key bills to lower drug costs by  promoting generic competition--long overdue--and four key bills to  strengthen healthcare, reverse the GOP sabotage, and rescind the Trump  administration's devastating junk plan rule.   I know full well what happens when individuals are impacted by junk  plans, and they don't have the courage they need. I encourage my good  friends on the other side of the aisle to drop politics and join with  us to pass this legislation.   This omnibus bill invests most of the savings of $13.8 billion  created by its cracking down on junk plans into strengthening  healthcare, which will fund about 500,000 additional enrollees into  non-group coverage and Medicaid.   Let me say to you, in 2017, due to the direct interference by the  Trump administration, the number of uninsured people increased by  700,000, the first increase since implementation of the Affordable Care  Act.   I know full well that Texas, which is the number one State in the  number of uninsured, is experiencing the devastation of not having the  expanded Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act at its fullest.   We had a roundtable discussion with people who experience diabetes.  Insulin is going through the roof. These people are suffering. The  average uninsured resident in my congressional district pays 23 times  more for a form of insulin than people living in Australia, 15 times  more than they would in the United Kingdom, and 13 times more than they  would in Canada.   Let's protect those with preexisting conditions, and let's pass this  bill to bring down these drugs and save the lives of our constituents.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 987, the Strengthening  Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Cost Act.   This is an omnibus bill that includes the:   H.R. 938, The BLOCKING (Bringing Low-Cost Options and Competition  While Keeping Incentives for New Generics) Act;   H.R. 1499, Protecting Consumer Access to Generic Drugs of 2019;   H.R. 965, The CREATES (Creating and Restoring Equal Access to  Equivalent Samples) Act; and   H.R. 1010, Rescinding Trump Administration's Final Rule Promoting  Junk Insurance Plans.   This omnibus bill invests most of the savings of $13.8 billion  created by its cracking down on junk plans into strengthening health  care, which will fund about 500,000 additional enrollees in nongroup  coverage and Medicaid.   Health care should be a fundamental right for all Americans.   This is why I introduced the Breath of Fresh Air Act, which  establishes a Department of Education grant program to be used by local  education agencies for the purchase of nebulizers for use in elementary  and secondary schools and secured passage of Amendments to the Commerce  Justice State spending bills that preserve and expand upon green spaces  needed to reduce the worse symptoms of respiratory illnesses.   Each Congress I have secured adoption of amendments to Department of  Defense Appropriations and Authorization Bills that increase funding  for triple negative breast cancer research and treatment.   I am an original sponsor of H.R. 366, the Insulin Access for All Act  of 2019, which addresses the extreme financial hardship most vulnerable  Americans face and too many may face untimely deaths due to insulin  rationing.   Last month, I held a forum in my Congressional district in Houston  Texas that engaged physicians, patients, public health officials in a  discussion about the high cost of insulin.   The Affordable Care Act (ACA) led to historic gains in health  insurance coverage by extending Medicaid coverage to many low-income  individuals and providing Marketplace subsidies for individuals below  400 percent, of poverty.   The number of uninsured nonelderly Americans decreased from over 44  million in 2013, the year before major provisions of the ACA went into  effect, to just below 27 million in 2016.   Unfortunately, the Trump Administration has been doing all that it  can to undermine the ACA and deny deserving Americans access to  affordable health insurance.   In 2017, due to direct interference by the Trump Administration the  number of uninsured people increased by nearly 700,000 people, the  first increase since implementation of the ACA.   One of the most difficult challenges are the hurdles to healthcare  created by lack of health insurance and the expense of prescription  medication.   In 2017, private health insurance coverage continued to be more  prevalent than government coverage, at 67.2 percent and 37.7 percent,  respectively.   Of the subtypes of health insurance coverage, employer-based  insurance was the most common, covering 56 percent of the population  for some or all of the calendar year, followed by Medicaid (19.3  percent), Medicare (17.2 percent), direct-purchase coverage (16.0  percent), and military coverage (4.8 percent).   Unfortunately, the state of Texas remains the state with the most  uninsured persons at 17 percent because it refuses to accept federal  Medicaid funding to cover the poorest residents of the state.   According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, one in four people taking  prescription drugs report difficulty affording their medication.   In 2017, diabetes contributed to the death of 277,000 Americans--and  was the primary cause of death for 85,000 of those individuals.   That same year diagnosed diabetes cost the United States an estimated  $327 billion--including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90  billion in productivity losses.   Diabetes drugs, including insulin and oral medications that regulate  blood sugar levels, play a critical role in helping people with  diabetes manage their condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related  health complications.   After the Democrats took control of the House in January we got to  work on a report on the high cost of insulin and we determined that the  Americans with diabetes are in crisis.   Insulin--used by approximately 7.5 million Americans to treat their  diabetes--was discovered nearly a century ago by Canadian researchers  Frederick Banting, Charles Best, J.B. Collip, and J.J.R. Macleod, who  assigned their patent to the University of Toronto with the goal of  making the medication widely available.   The researchers charged $3.00 to transfer ownership of insulin to the  University of Toronto.   Even though analog insulin has been on the market for nearly 30  years, it has no meaningful generic competition.   Over the past two decades, manufacturers have systematically and  dramatically raised the prices of their insulin products by more than  tenfold--often in lockstep.   These prices dwarf manufacturing costs.   One study found manufacturers could charge as little as $7 to $11 per  month for insulin and still make a profit.  [[Page H3867]]    In recent years, the high prices of diabetes drugs have placed a  tremendous strain on diabetes patients as well as the federal  government, which provides diabetes medications to more than 43 million  Medicare beneficiaries.   Reva Verma, is a type 1 diabetic who faces firsthand the struggles of  managing diabetes in an era of skyrocketing insulin prices.   Diabetes is a life-threatening disease that disproportionately  affects communities of color.   Diabetes is associated with serious health problems, including heart  disease and stroke, kidney failure, and blindness.   There are 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Eighteenth  Congressional District who have been diagnosed with diabetes.   These individuals are my constituents and I know that on average,  each of them pay 4.8 times the cost of similar medication in Australia,  3.6 times the cost in the United Kingdom, and 2.6 times the cost in  Canada.   Additionally, in the Eighteenth Congressional District, there are  191,000 uninsured residents in this district and, because they lack  insurance, they often pay significantly more than their insured  counterpart, or any patient overseas.   The average uninsured resident in my congressional district pays 23  more times for a form of insulin than people living in Australia, 15  more times than they would in the United Kingdom, and 13 more times  than they would in Canada.   The consequences of these staggering costs are not benign.   Many patients often speak of having to make heart-wrenching decisions  about what to buy with the commonly fixed incomes attendant to seniors.   Many medical professionals indicate that the high prices for  prescription drugs are a function of a lack of competition, and  authorizing Medicare to create a program to negotiate drug prices may  be an estimable way to lower the cost of prescription drugs.   All told this reflects a disturbing trend: in our country, the cost  of branded drugs tends to go up, whereas in other countries, the costs  tend to go down.   These high prices lead many people to ration or stop taking their  medications, which can result in serious health complications and even  death, as the Energy and Commerce Committee heard in direct testimony  earlier this year.   The prices of diabetes medications--and insulin in particular--are  far higher in the United States than they are overseas, in part because  certain federal programs lack the authority to negotiate directly with  drug manufacturers.   The Democratic majority came into office with a promise to the  American people, to make sure that they had affordable and dependable  healthcare.   Today, we are delivering on that promise, not just for persons with  diabetes but for all Americans who have pre-existing conditions that  require medication management.
