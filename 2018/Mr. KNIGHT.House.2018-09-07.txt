 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Childhood Cancer  Awareness Month, during which we pay a special tribute to the children  who are now fighting or who have fought the number one disease killer  and second leading cause of death of children in the United States.   We also affirm our support for the families, their doctors and their  nurses and the foundations that provide financial and emotional relief  to those struggling with the tremendous stress of cancer treatment and  rehabilitation.   One group that is particularly close to me and my family is Jack's  Angels. Jack's Angels fights for dedicated research for a particularly  deadly kind of pediatric cancer, DIPG, the deadliest pediatric brain  cancer.   DIPG tumors are inoperable and incurable, and its victims have a 5- year survival rate of less than 1 percent. The median survival time for  children diagnosed with DIPG is only 9 months.   In 2011, just after his third birthday, Jack Demeter was diagnosed  with DIPG. He was given steroid medication, then radiation therapy, and  was put on supplements and several tailored diets.   He was brought into clinical trials. He tried infusions. His parents  took him to dozens of doctors, each of whom provided their best advice  and counsel. But the science for an effective treatment for DIPG has  not yet been developed. Jack passed away only 9 months after diagnosis.   For me and for Jack's Angels, finding a cure for DIPG and all other  pediatric cancers will continue to be a priority.                            ____________________
