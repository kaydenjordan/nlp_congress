 Mr. Speaker, as Congress' physicist and computer chip  designer, I rise to make this simple point, that the massive levels of  UI fraud and identity fraud generally did not happen in countries that  have a secure and trusted digital ID system.   This is well known to residents of many States as the mobile ID, or  digital driver's license, that allows a REAL ID compliant driver's  license to be placed under your smartphone and to use the unique  hardware ID of your phone and its biometric login capabilities to prove  that you are who you say you are online or in person and to prevent  anyone from impersonating you.   Last session of Congress, we came within a whisker of getting it  included in the omnibus, that the Federal Government should start  recognizing this proven form of digital ID.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1163 is a bill that is designed to fail in the  Senate. If we start working with our Senate colleagues, I think we have  a chance of making real progress on this.
