 Madam Chair, and I rise tonight in opposition to H.R. 3,  the fewer cures and more government price control act.   While everyone recognizes that the overall cost of prescription drugs  is too high, and that there are some bad actors in the system, I wonder  why we are here tonight debating this legislation that essentially puts  in place an arbitrary government price setting system. We should be,  instead, finding ways to encourage more companies to engage in research  for cures and drive competition for lower costs.   During consideration of H.R. 3 in our Ways and Means Committee, I  authored a commonsense amendment to exempt any drug or biological  product used to treat or cure Alzheimer's from the definition of  ``negotiation eligible drug,'' essentially ensuring through this  amendment that Alzheimer's research remains intact, so that the  scientists and the researchers and the Ph.D.'s that are working hard  every day to find a cure can continue to do that uninterrupted.  Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated.   We already know from a CBO estimate that 38 cures will not come to  market because of the legislation over the next two decades. It  essentially cuts off at the knees innovation and deters the work that  goes on today. The impact of future treatments and cures for diseases  like Alzheimer's and dementia is unacceptable. An impact on even one  cure is one too many, let alone 38.   Instead, we have an alternative. The House should support H.R. 19,  the Lower Cost, More Cures Act, which consists of over 40 bipartisan  provisions that President Trump may actually sign to help lower the  cost of prescription drugs for all of our constituents.   It is disappointing that Democrats won't work across the aisle to  solve this problem, and instead, are pushing a bill that will stifle  innovative healthcare solutions and result in fewer life-saving cures  and the research that goes into Alzheimer's.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3.
