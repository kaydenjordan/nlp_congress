 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Smith for yielding and  compliments to him and Chairman Thornberry for the outstanding work,  again, that the two of them have collaborated on to keep this really  massive undertaking on schedule. It is really a very truncated schedule  this year, but they both did it. Again, it is kudos to both of them in  terms of their leadership skills.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the 2018 NDAA. Front and  center in our deliberations in the Seapower and Projection Forces  Subcommittee on which I serve with Chairman Wittman, who is in his  first term and did an outstanding job, was the build-up of our Navy  fleet which has been a multiyear process of strategic planning.                                time  2015    In December of last year, the prior Navy secretary, Ray Mabus, who  served in the prior administration, released an updated force structure  assessment that laid out the requirement for increasing the Navy's  fleet from 308 ships to 355.   Then, in January, Navy officials outlined a plan to get us on a  construction plan to get us on a path to a larger fleet. In early May,  the chief of naval operations emphasized that ``time is of the  essence'' in growing the Navy.   The stage was set to get started on the larger fleet. That was why so  many of us were surprised on May 23 and disappointed when the White  House sent over basically a 308-ship budget for a 355-ship fleet.   I am proud to say that, on a bipartisan basis, we have done much  better in this bill than the budget that came over. Among other things,  the bill explicitly makes it the policy of our Nation to achieve a 355- ship Navy. We add five additional ships in 2018, for a total of 12, to  get us moving to the larger fleet that the prior administration and the  new administration know that we need.   One area I am particularly proud of is the area of undersea forces.  Reflecting the urgent testimony of our combatant commanders, our panel  once again led the way in forging an aggressive but realistic plan to  grow our submarine fleet.   To achieve this, our bill authorizes multiyear procurement authority  for 13 Virginia class attack submarines for the next 5 years. Not only  would this keep us at the two-a-year level we have been on for the last  few years, but would go even further by reaching a three-submarine  build rate in the coming years.   The seapower portion of the bill does much more to support a range of  priorities on the seas and in the skies, far too many to itemize here  today.   I will just say that I am proud of the bipartisan contribution of all  of our subcommittee members into the product before the House today,  and, again, Mr. Wittman for his first year as subcommittee chairman.   In particular, I want to highlight the work of our subcommittee staff  in  [[Page H5541]]  helping us craft the bill. I am joined here today by one of my staff,  Stephen Clement, who has been working with us, but he is going to be  moving on to better things. I want to publicly thank him for his  outstanding work in terms of helping us get to the place we are here  today.   In closing, I would urge my colleagues to support the Defense  Authorization bill.
