 Mr. Speaker, as the Democratic chair of the Congressional  Travel and Tourism Caucus, I rise to celebrate the 35th annual National  Travel and Tourism Week, which provides us an opportunity to showcase  the importance of travel and tourism in creating economic growth and  opportunity and enhancing the quality of life in every district  throughout the United States.   Our second largest industry export and our seventh largest employer,  travel generates $2.4 trillion for the U.S. economy and supports some  15.6 million jobs. In southern Nevada alone, tourism generates nearly  $60 billion annually. Last year, 42 million visitors came to Las Vegas,  and we hosted almost 20,000 conventions, which brought in 6 million  people from around the world.   So, as we honor the valuable contributions of the hardworking people  in this vital industry, I want to remind my colleagues that we need to  support its growth and development by making real investments in the  country's infrastructure so we can increase the efficiency and  reliability of travel and encourage greater tourism to Las Vegas and  all the United States. It is about putting out a welcome mat and  setting a bigger table.                            ____________________
