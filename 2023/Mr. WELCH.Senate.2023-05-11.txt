 Mr. President, the most consequential question now before  Congress--the one that most impacts the most people we all represent-- is whether the United States of America will do what it has always  done: pay its bills in full and on time.   It was Alexander Hamilton who established the precedent that has  become an enduring principle: America pays its bills.   But in order to preserve that principle, Congress must raise the debt  limit. It is important to remind ourselves that raising the debt  ceiling does not allow any additional spending, nor does it include new  obligations for our taxpayers. It allows Congress to continue to pay  for the spending that has already been approved by this and prior  Congresses.   The debt ceiling is an anomaly in the United States. Other countries  recognize the obvious. When a legislative body approves spending-- whether it is for the defense of the nation, the healthcare of its  citizens, the support for its farmers--it is then that the legislative  body incurs the obligation. It is really no different than when a  family takes out a mortgage or a car loan. When that bill becomes due  each month, you pay the mortgage and you pay the car loan. Otherwise,  things end  [[Page S1617]]  very badly for that family, as they will for our country if we allow  the United States to default on its debt.   The debt limit debate in the past was accompanied by political  grandstanding from both parties. The party out of power used it to  criticize the economic record of the incumbent party. But grandstanding  was always set aside, and the President and the majority party in  Congress--Republican or Democratic--accepted the burden of raising the  debt ceiling to make sure the country did not default.   This time, the House's default threat is different. It is far more  dangerous and far more extreme, even than in 2011.   Let me explain.   A default looms as early as June 1, and congressional leaders met  this week with President Biden.   The President and all of the leaders pledged that default was not an  option--all except one leader. Speaker McCarthy continues to champion  the House bill that will lead us to default unless the Congress and the  President capitulate to House Republicans' very extreme budgetary  demands. Their budget would cut veteran benefits, furlough thousands of  Border Patrol agents even as title 42 expires, and it would repeal key  parts of the Inflation Reduction Act and the thousands of jobs--many of  which, by the way, are in Republican districts--that it has created.   The Speaker's demands that President Biden relinquish his primary  legislative achievement, the IRA, really would be comparable to the  Democrats demanding when Donald Trump was President that, as a  condition of not defaulting, he repeal what he regarded as his  signature legislative accomplishment: his tax cuts--which, by the way,  were vehemently opposed by Democrats.   Speaker McCarthy's posture reflects the posture of his conference and  the reality within his own caucus. He won't take default off the table  because he can't. The most extreme Members of his caucus have extracted  numerous concessions to lend their support, and it took 15 votes for  him to get elected to the speakership. What we are seeing now is the  result: They will default unless they get their way.   Former President Trump, who as President raised the debt ceiling  multiple times, is still a leading voice for many of the Republicans in  the caucus. Last night on CNN, at a townhall meeting, he encouraged  default, adding fuel to the fire and even more peril for our country.   I think we all know, in all candor, that the default threat would be  catastrophic, and we are being propelled over the brink.   All responsible people know that a default--No. 1, it would destroy  America's reputation and jeopardize the value of the dollar as the  world's reserve currency. No. 2, it would really delight our Russian  and Chinese adversaries, who would promote our default for what it is-- a sign of internal weakness, economic chaos, and disunity. A default in  all likelihood would plunge our fragile economy into a recession,  hurting Americans across the entire country regardless of what their  political persuasion was. In a very cruel irony, according to Moody's,  a default could increase our deficit by as much as $850 billion, not  reduce it as default advocates claim.   We can't allow default. We can't allow self-inflicted harm to befall  Americans with the Speaker's very reckless gambit.   I thank Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, Minority  Leader Jeffries, and President Biden for taking default off the table.   Speaker McCarthy, before it is too late, do the same.   I am willing, as I believe the vast majority of our colleagues are,  to engage in a serious budget discussion to bring down America's debt,  but what I am not willing to do--not now, not ever--is abandon  America's historic commitment to paying its bills. I am not willing to  inflict the damage to our economy and the pain on our people a  catastrophic default would impose, nor is President Biden.   While leadership talks continue, all of us must be mindful of the  real peril we face, and we must take the precautionary step of  reviewing the 14th Amendment and its requirement. Section 4 of the 14th  Amendment states:         The validity of the public debt of the United States,       authorized by law . . . shall not be questioned.    The Constitution is saying what we all know: A debt incurred is a  debt that must be paid.   Every obligation tied to our debt is a result of a law that this or a  previous Congress has passed. To renege on the obligation that law  required, whether to our veterans, our seniors, our farmers, or the  military, is for Congress to tell the President to break that law and  disobey the Constitution.   We cannot do this. We must not do this. We must, as America has  always done, pay our bills in full and on time.   I yield the floor.
