 Mr. Speaker, today is Valentine's Day. Children will pass  around cards and candy at school. Young men and women will gather the  courage to speak with their crush, and many couples will get engaged to  marry.   I sent my first Valentine, my mother, flowers. I will spend this  evening telling my wife, Monica, and my girls, Sky and Sage, the many  ways that I love and appreciate them over FaceTime.   But for many, today is not a joyous day. There are too many victims  of domestic abuse who live in homes of broken hearts and who search for  love but find violence instead. No form of mental, emotional, sexual,  or physical abuse is acceptable no matter who it is from or under any  circumstance, period.   I thank the many organizations, like Shelter From the Storm,  Coachella Valley Rescue Mission, and others in my district, for the  refuge and support that they provide.   To the victims: I want you to know that you are not broken and you  are not at fault. You are a survivor and you have the courage. Help is  only one phone call away. Happy Valentine's Day.                            ____________________
