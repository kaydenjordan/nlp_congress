 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight some new  legislation I am introducing this week, H.R. 1515, the High-Speed  Refund Act.   Simply put, California's proposed high-speed rail system has been a  total disaster. It will not meet the legal requirements of true high- speed rail from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The total projected cost  has now ballooned to $100 billion, tripling what the voters were told  back in 2008.   The Trump administration has already canceled a $929 million grant,  but I think they should take the entire $3.5 billion in Federal dollars  that California is wasting under the Stimulus Act of 2009, 10 years  ago. That is why my bill, the High-Speed Refund Act, would require  California to refund all Federal funding for high-speed rail and  repurpose it to highway and transportation projects that would actually  benefit people and be economically viable.   Madam Speaker, $5 billion has already been wasted. Let's not make it  $100 billion. Undertaking the project was a huge mistake. I think  Californians and the other 49 States deserve a refund and to have this  money channeled into something that would be more useful for all  Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Ms. Foxx and Mr.  Price, both from North Carolina, who have made this opportunity  fittingly available for all of us here tonight in order to honor our  friend, Walter Jones.   I would always encounter him as a low key but kind, gentle, sweet  soul that he is, around the building; and just in his own way, just  thumbs up, keep going, encouraging in what we do around here.   There were a lot of very kind remarks made about him here tonight  from people that got to serve with him a lot longer than I did, but  indeed, we hear about how he was a very independent voice. I think  marching to his own higher standard to what he felt his own integrity  required, not only as a representative, as a person in this political  business, but one who is answering to a higher power--the importance of  God in his life made abundantly clear.   Indeed, at his service in North Carolina, it really, really hit home  for me how much that was a part for him.   As we know, he was very, very unhappy with the Gulf war. And after  that started, he really--I believe, and the results show--he spent the  rest of his career trying to find and make and provide comfort for the  members of the military--and even more so--the Gold Star families, who  he knows--and we all realize--bear the loss the most when one of theirs  has fallen.   I heard that he would write to every single Gold Star family when he  would learn of one of their loved ones having fallen in conflict, that  were killed in action.   He would take his time in that position as a Member of the United  States House of Representatives, using his name, using that title and  whatever that carried, to provide comfort and show those families that  there are people in this place that really, really do recognize--we all  do--but he went that extra mile for people all over the country, not  just in his district, to take that care, to take that time. And I  thought that was pretty amazing.   Another way that he tried to help was supporting the various programs  that were out there, to provide those working dogs, a program I have  encountered, to soldiers that have come home that suffer with PTSD or  similar-type afflictions, that those comfort dogs could provide  something unique to them that maybe no human contact can reach for some  of them.   He spent a lot of time, a lot of effort in helping with that because  he did want to make as much of a positive mark on those soldiers as  possible.   Most importantly, though, his higher calling he felt, it wasn't here  to put treasures in this place or in his title. It was the treasures he  wanted to store in Heaven, as he wanted to do what he could to please  God and walk with his Savior Jesus Christ. And that is the most  important thing about Walter Jones and his life and his devotion.   God bless him and his family and the memory of him to this place.  [[Page H2347]]
