 Mr. President, Friday, September 16, 2022, marks the  National Prisoners of War and Missing in Action Recognition Day. On  this day, we join together to honor the brave men and women of our  Armed Forces who have been prisoners of war and for those who remain  missing in action, including the 477 Mainers still unaccounted for.  This solemn day is a painful, important reminder of the sacrifices  endured by servicemembers and the immense, incalculable loss and  uncertainty borne by their families and communities. Let us renew our  commitment to bring answers and closure to the loved ones of those  missing in action and to care for all those who have endured the  painful silence of these losses.   Today, I join people across Maine and our Nation in saying, ``You Are  Not Forgotten.'' The phrase is reminder of our duty to leave no  American servicemember or veteran behind, no matter where they may be.  I stand humbled and grateful to those who answered the call of their  Nation to protect our way of life. We also pay tribute to those who  have been POW/MIA and have returned to their loved ones. We have a  solemn obligation to take care of them and their families so that they  can enjoy the freedoms they sacrificed for.   To the families who have lost their sons and daughters and to the  comrades who have lost their friends and companions, know that today  and every day we stand with you through your hardships and in honoring  the selfless service of America's POW and MIA.                            ____________________
