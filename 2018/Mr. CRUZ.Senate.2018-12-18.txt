 Mr. President, I want to thank the bill's sponsors for  working with me on this amendment. I think this bill that the Senate is  getting ready to pass is a major bill that moves in the direction of  justice. It lowers mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders.   This amendment excludes a series of specific violent offenses,  including carjacking, destruction of aircraft and motor vehicles, and  drive-by shootings. Another component of it is an amendment that  Senator Lankford has introduced that protects religious liberty.   The sponsors on both sides, Democratic and Republican, have agreed to  this amendment. I want to thank them for their cooperation in that.   I yield my time to Senator Lankford.
