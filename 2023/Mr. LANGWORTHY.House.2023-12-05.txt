 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true patriot and  advocate for our State's veterans, Daniel Kell, the New York State VFW  commander.   Daniel's unwavering dedication to the welfare of our veterans has  left an enduring mark on our community and the lives of those that have  served.   Earlier this year, I had the privilege of touring Bath VA Medical  Center with him, witnessing firsthand his tireless commitment to  ensuring that our veterans receive the care and the support that they  deserve.   Daniel was raised in my birthplace of Jamestown, New York. Just days  after graduating from Jamestown High School in 1979, he answered the  call of duty, enlisting in the United States Marine Corps.   His 23 years of service, culminating as master sergeant, reflects a  commitment to excellence that has earned him numerous accolades,  including the Meritorious Service Medal and Navy commendation medals  for his distinguished service during Operation Desert Storm and Desert  Shield.   Since joining VFW Post 53 in Jamestown in 2001, he has become a life  member, serving in various leadership roles, including national surgeon  general.   As he concludes his term as the New York State VFW commander, I thank  Daniel Kell for his selfless dedication to our veterans and his  exemplary service to our great Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for  yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule which includes  consideration of an important step to protect Americans' access to  affordable and reliable internal-combustion engine vehicles, gas- powered cars.    Since his very first day in office, President Biden declared war on  domestic energy producers and made it his administration's goal to  weaponize the EPA and other agencies to impose the radical Green New  Deal agenda on the backs of the American people.   Earlier this year, unelected bureaucrats at the EPA issued a proposed  rule that would tighten emissions standards to make electric vehicles  virtually the only option available to drivers in the United States.   What does this mean for the average family? They will be forced to  pay thousands of dollars more for their next car, thousands more for  their at-home charging infrastructure and replacement batteries, and  hundreds more per year in car insurance.   Since Biden took office, my constituents have seen their energy bills  go through the roof. Forcing them to charge multiple cars at home is  not an option. It is not just the cost. There is ample evidence that  New York's energy grid is entirely unprepared to handle this.  [[Page H6123]]    Reports have already shown that the Federal Government's attempts to  subsidize the purchase of electric vehicles haven't worked. Despite  $7,500 in available tax credits, hardworking Americans still consider  purchasing these vehicles too costly for their family budgets.   Mr. Speaker, we need market-driven approaches that puts consumer  choice, affordability, and reliability first, and that means putting a  stop to this administration's efforts time and again to ban, prohibit,  and regulate out-of-existence perfectly safe and affordable products  and appliances.   Since 2021, we have seen the Biden administration impose new  regulations through the EPA and the Department of Energy that will  ultimately impact what appliances Americans can buy, whether Americans  can affordably heat their homes, and now what cars they believe  Americans should be driving.   I strongly support this legislation, H.R. 4468, to preserve America's  freedom of choice and to put a stop to this administration's efforts to  push this country into an energy future that is less affordable, less  reliable, and more dependent than ever on our foreign adversaries like  China.
