 Mr. President, in a few moments, I am going to make a  unanimous consent request in regard to Dilawar Syed to be the Deputy  Administrator of the Small Business Administration.   Let me give you a little bit of background on Mr. Syed's nomination  and why I am using this unusual process to advance the nomination to  the floor for floor consideration.   We all know the tremendous need at the Small Business Administration  as a result of COVID-19. We worked together, Democrats and Republicans,  and created many new programs to help small businesses. We created the  Paycheck Protection Program, both the first--and we modified it--and  then a second round. We created the Economic Injury Disaster Loan and  Loan Advance Program and the Targeted Grant Program.   We provided for the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program, we  established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and the list goes on  and on and on. All this created new programs and responsibilities for  the Small Business Administration. And we did this together, Democrats  and Republicans, in order to advance the needs for small businesses  during COVID-19.   Over $1 trillion of funds were administered by the Small Business  Administration as a result of our initiatives. And our constituents had  tremendous needs. Tens of millions of small businesses have benefited  from what we did to help them through COVID-19.   I know that every one of our offices has gotten numerous inquiries  from small businesses as to how these programs were stood up, whether  they could qualify, concerns about their applications being filed  promptly, the  [[Page S6752]]  lack of funds, the need to replenish funds--the list goes on and on and  on. That put tremendous demand on the Small Business Administration,  and we were pretty tough on the Small Business Administration to get  these programs up and running because we knew how desperate it was for  our small business community.   Now, the Deputy Administrator's job is to oversee the day-to-day  operations of the Agency. That is the position we are talking about for  Mr. Syed--the Deputy Administrator of the Small Business  Administration.   Over 5 months ago, the Small Business Committee, under my leadership  as chair, had a hearing on Mr. Syed's appointment, and we discovered  during that nomination process that he is extremely well qualified to  assume these responsibilities. He has spent decades building and  developing and scaling successful small businesses, as well as his  advocacy for underserved small businesses.   The hearing, I thought, went extremely well and that we would have no  difficulty advancing his nomination to the floor of the U.S. Senate.  But after his hearing, my Republican colleagues requested information  from the Small Business Administration about his loans that he took out  as a small business owner. It was a reasonable request. On June 8, I  helped arrange to supply that information to the members of the  committee, and they reviewed his small business loan applications, Mr.  Syed's small business applications.   There was one thing that was pretty unusual about that in that even  though he was qualified to receive forgivable 7(a) loans under the  Paycheck Protection Program, he decided to repay the loans because he  said he didn't need the government to pay on a forgivable loan. He took  exemplary action, and after the review, I believe all my colleagues  were satisfied that his arrangements with the SBA were exemplary.   Next, the Republicans decided to move to a different target. They  accused Mr. Syed of being anti-Israel biased, which was completely,  completely unfounded.   The American Jewish Committee wrote our committee to say:         The unsupported accusations that somehow Jewish businesses       or those with ties to Israel may not fare as well under       Syed's leadership in the Small Business Administration has no       factual grounding. Indeed, he has specifically disavowed       support for the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement,       which seeks the dissolution of Israel. . . . AJC rejects the       charge.    They go on to say it is un-American, the charges that have been made,  and I agree.   My colleagues had the right to ask questions for the record, and they  did. Mr. Syed responded to those questions for the record, again  repeating the fact that he has been against the Boycott, Divestment,  and Sanctions movement and that he has worked with companies in Israel  and, in fact, visited Israel in order to promote the relationships.   Again, we thought, now, at last, we will be able to move Mr. Syed's  nomination. But now the Republicans found a new reason to block his  nomination. Committee Republicans announced that they would withhold a  quorum on the vote because Planned Parenthood affiliates received loans  under the Paycheck Protection Program.   As one of the negotiators of the CARES Act--and this was Democrats  and Republicans again working together; negotiated this with Senator  Rubio, Senator Collins, and Senator Shaheen. Let me explain to my  colleagues how nonprofits are treated under the Paycheck Protection  Program.   When the SBA considers whether or not a business qualifies as a small  business, it considers affiliation. Generally, affiliations exist when  one business controls or has the power to control another or when a  third party controls or has the power to control both businesses.  Control may arise with ownership, management, or other relationships or  interactions between the parties.   The CARES Act requires that nonprofits eligible for PPP loans abide  by the same affiliation rules that are applicable to small businesses.   The fact is that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America does  not exercise control over its member organizations because it does not  have common management. Each member organization is its own  independent, not-for-profit, tax-exempt organization with its own  independent board of directors that is solely responsible for the  hiring and retention of its CEO. Planned Parenthood Federation does not  have the power to remove CEOs or directors of its individual member  organizations.   This type of federated structure is common in the nonprofit world and  is the reason why nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Clubs  also qualify for PPP loans.   The SBA must apply its affiliation rules in a uniform way, and it is  wrong to ask the SBA to do otherwise for political or ideological  reasons. There is no reason why Planned Parenthood should be singled  out for receiving PPP loans, which I must remind my colleagues were  created to help keep Americans in their jobs during the pandemic. That  is the reason for it. That is why we included nonprofits.   The partisan, unnecessary, and unconscionable inaction of our  Republican colleagues shows no concern for the millions of small  businesses still relying on SBA support to survive COVID-19 and rebuild  their future and that would benefit greatly by having a confirmed  Deputy Administrator to work on the day-to-day operations at the SBA.   One last point, if I might. The Small Business Committee reported out  Mr. Syed's nomination by a bipartisan vote, but due to a technicality,  another vote was required, and the Republican members at this time  decided to block the quorum.   As a matter of fairness, as a matter of the needs of the small  business community in our States, as a matter of the integrity of this  body to have a process that has some degree of respect for the nominees  who go through the nomination process, I am going to make a UC request  that the nomination be put on our calendar, like any other reported  nominee, subject to the action of this body.   Before I make that unanimous consent request, with Senator Paul's  indulgence, I know that Senator Padilla would like to make a comment.  If he would be willing to allow Senator Padilla to speak next, and then  I will make my unanimous consent request.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Small  Business and Entrepreneurship be discharged from further consideration  of PN231, the nomination of Dilawar Syed to be Deputy Administrator of  the Small Business Administration; that at a time to be determined by  the majority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, the  Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 1 hour for debate on  the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate vote without intervening action or  debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's actions.    Mr. President, let me just repeat a comment. I know  Senator Hirono is on the floor, and I want to give her an opportunity  to speak on this, but let me make this clear.   The affiliate rules that are used by the Small Business  Administration are exactly the same for a for-profit or a nonprofit,  and there are lots of small businesses that have a big name next to  them that are eligible for the programs under the Small Business  Administration before COVID-19 and after COVID-19. The affiliation  rules have been in the SBA for a long time, and I read them into the  Record earlier in my comments.   What they cannot do is pick and choose who they like and don't like.  That is not how you administer a program.   So, in the nonprofit world, I gave the example of the YMCAs--a pretty  big name but, the truth of the matter is, they are all independently  operated, and the national YMCA cannot discharge the CEO of a local  YMCA. So we judge the qualifications based upon the local activities.  The same is true for a lot of affiliates on for-profit companies: big  chains that are independently owned and not controlled. They can  qualify for these funds.   I can tell you a lot of organizations that are related in the faith  community to an umbrella, but they are not controlled, so, therefore,  the affiliate rules allow them to apply independently for these funds  as long as they can qualify.   We knew that developing this program. We didn't want to change the  affiliate rules because that would have been wrong.   So what my colleague is requesting is just--would be illegal for the  administration to say that we are not going to select a particular  group because we don't particularly agree with what they are doing or  how they operate. That is not how the rules work. That is not what you  are allowed to do.   So I regret that my colleague has raised these objections. I think it  diminishes our credibility to tell our administrators to administer  these programs fairly for all constituencies. And to deny Small  Businesses of America a confirmed Deputy Administrator during these  extremely challenging times for small businesses does not hurt Mr.  Syed; it hurts the small business community.   I thank Mr. Syed for his willingness to serve, and I hope we can find  a path forward because this debate has nothing to do with his  qualifications or why he should be confirmed.   With that, I will yield the floor.    Mr. President.    Let me thank Senator Hirono for her comments, and I also  thank Senator Padilla for his comments.   I have never gone through something like this before, where the  Republicans are breaking a quorum after they have already voted a  nominee for reasons unrelated to the nominee. It makes no sense, and  the reasons that they are using makes no sense at all, since they are  asking the SBA to violate the law.   We are going to continue. As chair of the committee, I am going to  continue to look at every conceivable way that we can get Mr. Syed  confirmed. I think he is an extraordinary person who will serve our  Nation with great distinction, and I know our small business community  needs a confirmed Deputy Administrator.   You know, what surprises me is that our Republican colleagues talk  about their support for small businesses, and I said we worked on COVID  together to create these programs. President Trump never filled the  position of Deputy Administrator so this position has been vacant for a  long time.   We need this position. The small business community needs this  position. So it is my hope that we will find a path forward as quickly  as possible to get this nomination confirmed. I am confident that we  will get a strong bipartisan vote for Mr. Syed's nomination and  confirmation. Republicans tell me they think he is well qualified.   So let's stop using these parliamentary procedures to obstruct. Let's  get on with the business of the Senate.   I would suggest the absence of a quorum.
