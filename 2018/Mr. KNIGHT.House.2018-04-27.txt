 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of our fallen  heroes, Major Stephen Del Bagno of the United States Air Force Air  Demonstration Squadron, more commonly known as the Thunderbirds, who  lost his life this past month.   Major Del Bagno came from my district, from Valencia, California, and  exemplified the skill and professionalism that we expect from our  airmen.   Major Del Bagno was the very first F-35 pilot to join the ranks of  the Thunderbird squadron.   Tragically, Stephen Del Bagno lost his life earlier this month during  a training exercise at the Nevada Test and Training Range. While he is  no longer with us, his legacy continues in the hearts and minds of  future aviators he inspired.   I sat with my wife at his funeral a few weeks back and I watched the  missing man formation of F-35s and F-16s, and I listened to his father  and his teammates talk about Major Del Bagno. They talked about what a  great pilot he was, but they also talked about what a great mentor he  was and what a good dude Major Del Bagno was, and that is what he  wanted to be recognized as and remembered as.   So America lost one of its finest pilots in his passing.   May God bless him and may he rest in peace.                            ____________________
