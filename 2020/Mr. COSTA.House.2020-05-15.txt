 Mr. Speaker, the HEROES Act legislation is vital to the  health of the San Joaquin Valley and throughout the country by  providing funding for much-needed medical education.   It provides funding to protect farmers and farmworkers and our food  supply chain that has been turned upside down. Ag markets have shrunk,  and for some, they have entirely disappeared. We need to provide  support to ensure a true safety net is in place for American  agriculture.   Our food supply is truly a national security issue. This has never  been more evident than during this healthcare crisis.   I stand ready to work with my colleagues in both the House and the  Senate to arrive at a bipartisan compromise.
