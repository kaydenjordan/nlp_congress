 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our Nation's  independence.   Some 244 years ago this Saturday, the Founding Fathers of this  country voted to declare our independence from Great Britain.   All Americans know the basics of this story, but not everyone knows  the story behind one of our Nation's founding documents.   Thomas Jefferson was just 33 years old when the Second Continental  Congress commissioned him to draft a declaration of independence. When  he sat down in a rented room in the heat of the Philadelphia summer to  write it, the American Revolution had already begun.   On one level, he was simply putting the reasons for independence into  words. The first shot had been fired over a year earlier, after decades  of increasingly tyrannical British abuses had culminated in open revolt  in Massachusetts.   Even so, it was not yet clear whether the delegates from all 13  colonies would put their names to a formal document declaring our  independence. They had to be persuaded.   After 17 days of writing and rewriting, struggling to find the right  words, Jefferson presented his work to Benjamin Franklin and John  Adams. He then submitted a draft to the Congress on July 1, which  officially adopted it three days later.   Each year on the Fourth of July, we celebrate this moment--the moment  that we declared our independence from the British Empire and began to  see ourselves as our own nation.   I love Independence Day celebrations in Nebraska. Like many people,  my family often spends the day enjoying the great outdoors before  hosting friends and neighbors for a barbecue.   But the Fourth of July is about more than food and fireworks or  parades and pancake feeds. It is an opportunity to reflect on the  nearly two and a half centuries of our nation's history and remember  what it means to be an American.   To me, America is a nation based on an idea. It is the idea, as  Jefferson wrote, that ``all men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among  these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.''   Belief in this creed is what unites us as Americans. And while we may  not always live up to this idea, we can never stop trying. We should  count ourselves fortunate to live in the greatest nation on earth,  where the notion  [[Page S4130]]  of equal justice for all first came into the world.   I was touched to see that on June 22, 36 people became American  citizens in the first naturalization ceremony held in Lincoln since  February. This diverse group of people renounced their loyalty to their  former countries and took an oath of allegiance to the United States.  Family and friends in attendance brought homemade banners, red, white,  and blue balloons, and other patriotic displays.   These 36 people, despite being citizens for only a few weeks, are  just as American as you or me. And these new citizens chose to be  Americans. They weren't born here, but they saw America for what it is:  a shining city upon a hill, where our institutions, though they  sometimes falter, strive to honor Jefferson's promise of God-given  rights and equal treatment before the law for all citizens.   We are not perfect, but neither can we forget our founding purpose.  The United States was the first nation in history to set this lofty  standard for ourselves, and we remain its best example.   This Independence Day, as our country wrestles with both a pandemic  and national unrest in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, I urge  you to remember that we remain, as President Abraham Lincoln said  during the Civil War, ``the last best hope of earth.''   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a  quorum.                            ____________________
