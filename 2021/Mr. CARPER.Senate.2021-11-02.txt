 Madam President, I rise today in support of the  confirmation of Jeffrey Prieto to serve as general counsel of the  Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Prieto was reported favorably from  our committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, on a  bipartisan vote of 12 to 8.   Yesterday, I received an interesting letter from a bipartisan group  of four former EPA general counsels representing the Trump  administration, the Obama administration, and the administrations of  George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. They were basically conveying the same  message: They support the confirmation of Jeffrey Prieto to serve as  general counsel of the Environmental Protection Agency. That doesn't  happen every day. We get letters of support from nominees, different  parties, different Agencies from time to time, but to have four former  EPA general counsels from two Republican administrations of late and  two Democratic administrations all in support of the nomination of  Jeffrey Prieto to serve in this important role--that got my attention,  and I hope it gets the attention of all of my colleagues.   Those who wrote to us, the four who wrote to us, very correctly point  out that Mr. Prieto is, and I quote--these are their words, not mine-- ``uniquely qualified for the position of General Counsel for the EPA.   They go on to say:         Mr. Prieto has been a longstanding champion of human health       and Environmental protection for all Americans.    The letter continues:         He is fair, just, and ethical. He will make decisions       strictly based on the facts, science, and the law. We expect       he will [be] ready to serve on day one.    Not surprisingly, I completely agree with their sentiments. Having  come to know Mr. Prieto following his nomination by President Biden, I  believe he will be an outstanding EPA general counsel. He comes from a  patriotic Latino family with a proud history of military service. He  has the intellect, temperament, and experience to serve in this  important role.   Six years ago, this body saw fit to confirm Jeffrey Prieto  unanimously for the same position, general counsel, at the Department  of Agriculture. We should confirm him again today for this post. He was  the right choice then; he is the right choice now. I encourage our  colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  scheduled vote occur immediately.
