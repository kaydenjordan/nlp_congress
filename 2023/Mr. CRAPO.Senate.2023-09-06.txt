 Mr. President, in honor of America's prisoners of war,  POWs, and missing in action, MIA, I join in acknowledging National POW/ MIA Recognition Day this September 15, 2023.   Each year before POW/MIA Recognition Day, the Defense POW/MIA  Accounting Agency, DPAA, the Agency primarily responsible for  recovering America's servicemembers, creates a poster commemorating the  lives of U.S. servicemembers still unaccounted for from past conflicts.  This year's poster features the words: ``Though not here, their  sacrifice is not forgotten.''   The sacrifice of America's unaccounted-for servicemembers is not  forgotten thanks in large part to the POW/MIA families and veterans who  have remained committed to keeping the pursuit of facts at the  forefront of our national conscience. The sacrifice is not forgotten  due to the hard work of those who work for and assist the DPAA and  related efforts to get needed answers and bring all American  servicemembers home. And the sacrifice is not forgotten due to the  commitment of the members of the POW*MIA Awareness Rally Corp. of  Pocatello, ID, and others across our country who keep a spotlight on  the need to keep pressing forward until every American servicemember is  brought home.   As I thank all involved in this effort, I urge the enactment of the  Bring Our Heroes Home Act, which I joined Senator Jeanne Shaheen, in  re-introducing this Congress, to help eliminate obstacles preventing  families and caseworkers from accessing the records needed for  recovering America's POWs and MIA. America's heroes and their families  deserve this reduction in bureaucratic redtape as we make a strong  effort to identify and recover those who have not yet made it back  home.   On National POW/MIA Day, we honor those Americans who have thankfully  returned home, the families and loved ones who stood by awaiting their  return, and we remain committed to finding answers for the families who  continue to await the return of their missing and unaccounted-for loved  ones. Thank you to America's servicemembers, veterans and their  families for their extraordinary commitment to our country and to all  those who work to ensure their return home.                            ____________________
