 Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a provision  that was included for the first time by myself and Senator Lindsey  Graham in the fiscal year 2018 Department of State and Foreign  Operations appropriations bill, which was reported unanimously by the  Senate Appropriations Committee on September 7.   Specifically, the committee-reported bill includes $15 million to  implement a U.S. interagency strategy, led by the Assistant Secretary  of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, to  [[Page S5854]]  support and protect civil society activists, including human rights and  environmental defenders and independent journalists, in countries where  such activists have been threatened or killed for peacefully exercising  their rights of free expression, association, and assembly.   Nearly 1,000 violations were reported against human rights defenders  in 2016, including killings, detentions, judicial prosecutions,  physical attacks, and other threats and harassments. Civil society  activists are targeted by both state and nonstate actors, including  private companies and investors, seeking to obstruct the rights of  voters, minorities, landowners, environmentalists, indigenous peoples,  and refugees, among other vulnerable groups. These attacks are not  limited to a particular region or a handful of countries--they are  common in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East--nor are  they limited to countries with authoritarian governments, such as  Cambodia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Egypt, and Russia. Democratically elected  governments are also culpable, such as Honduras, Philippines, Kenya,  Ecuador, and Turkey. Ultimately, democracy cannot survive if the rights  of civil society and the independent media are not protected.   Last year was the deadliest year on record for land and environmental  defenders. There were more deaths reported in more countries than ever  before. Competition for land and natural resources has intensified to  an alltime high, with companies around the globe putting greater  emphasis on profit margins than on environmental protection or land  ownership rights. As these pressures increase, the risk to civil  society activists will also increase.   Similarly, although the number of journalists killed on assignment  dropped slightly in 2016, the number of journalists in prison reached  its highest level yet. More than 250 journalists are imprisoned  worldwide because of their work. This is an egregious violation of the  universal right of free expression.   These statistics are almost certainly underestimates, given the  suppressions of free speech and lack of transparent and effective  judicial systems in many countries where civil society activists face  the most severe threats to their work and lives.   It is important for all of us to be aware of the growing threats to  civil society activists worldwide, as well as the relevant funding and  language included in the committee-reported Department of State and  Foreign Operations appropriations bill. This should be the first step  in developing an interagency strategy to focus attention and resources  on this critical problem.   I ask unanimous consent that the language in the committee report  describing this provision be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       SEC. 7032. DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS.         Protection of Civil Society Activists.--For purposes of       developing the strategy and allocating funds under subsection       (j), the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human       Rights, and Labor shall consult with the Committee and with       representatives of civil society and independent media       organizations whose members have been threatened or killed.       The uses of funds shall include strengthening the capacity of       such organizations, protecting their members who have been       threatened, supporting the enactment of laws to protect       freedoms of expression, association, and assembly, and       educating the public about the legitimate role of such       activists and journalists in society.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the funding  to combat HIV/AIDS in the fiscal year 2018 Department of State and  Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which was reported unanimously  by the Senate Appropriations Committee on September 7.   In May, the Congress received the President's fiscal year 2018 budget  request, which included a $1 billion cut to international HIV/AIDS  programs. The White House proposed to focus the President's Emergency  Plan for AIDS Relief--the PEPFAR program--in 12 priority countries,  while only maintaining current treatment levels in the other 24  countries in which PEPFAR works. This would mean no lifesaving drugs  for new patients in any of those 24 countries and the end of  initiatives PEPFAR has undertaken to accelerate progress in those  countries.   Fortunately, the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, chaired  by Senator Graham and of which I am ranking member, rejected the  President's proposed cut and restored HIV/AIDS funding to the current  level. The committee-reported bill includes a total of $6 billion for  HIV/AIDS programs, including $4.32 billion for PEPFAR, $1.35 billion  for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and malaria, and $330 million  for HIV/AIDS programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International  Development.   The committee report accompanying the bill also reaffirms the key  role PEPFAR plays in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment around  the  [[Page S5855]]  globe. In 2016, PEPFAR supported more than 11 million people with  lifesaving antiretroviral treatment and provided testing and counseling  for more than 74 million people.   During the committee markup of the Department of State and Foreign  Operations appropriations bill, I offered an amendment that would have  increased PEPFAR by $500 million. Funding for PEPFAR has been stagnant  for several years, and the additional funds in my amendment would have  enabled millions more people infected with the AIDS virus to receive  lifesaving treatment. Regrettably, my amendment failed on a party-line  vote.   Nonetheless, the bill still succeeds in rejecting the  administration's nonsensical and unacceptable reduction to HIV/AIDS  funding. I want to be sure that all Senators are aware of this critical  funding, which has received widespread, bipartisan support for many  years.                                  F_____                                                                CHOLERA IN HAITI     Mr. President, in 2004 the United States voted to  establish the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH,  to police the country following years of political turmoil.   While MINUSTAH was successful in bringing a semblance of order to the  country, its mission was severely impacted by the 2010 earthquake which  resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and left hundreds  of thousands more in need of assistance. Haiti has not fully recovered  since then.   Unfortunately, that was not the only tragedy that befell Haiti in  2010. In October of that year, a cholera outbreak spread throughout the  country, sickening hundreds of thousands and claiming the lives of more  than 9,000. Even more tragically and unlike the earthquake, the  outbreak could have been prevented, and the UN peacekeeping mission-- tasked with protecting the people--was at fault.   The cholera outbreak was caused by an act of extreme negligence, when  some UN peacekeepers disposed of human waste in a manner that  contaminated the local water system. Before it happened, cholera was  not a problem in Haiti. Today it is. In 2016, after years of refusing  to accept responsibility, the UN acknowledged its role in the cholera  outbreak and established a trust fund to address the problem, but so  far, very little has been contributed.   A provision I authored, which was adopted unanimously by the Senate  Appropriations Committee and included in the fiscal year 2018  Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, would  provide the Trump administration with the authority to enable the  United States to do its part to help.   With MINUSTAH winding down in Haiti, $40 million in unused  contributions are available to donor countries, and the UN has agreed  that those credits may be used to help address the cholera problem  caused by its own peacekeepers.   The United States share of those credits is $11.7 million, and the  provision I mentioned makes clear that the committee believes  contributing to the trust fund would be an appropriate use of those  funds. While this amount still falls far short of what is needed, if we  believe in accountability for the UN, we should join other nations in  providing our share of these funds to address this tragedy.   This is not a tragedy that only harmed a few families. Nearly 10,000  innocent people lost their lives through no fault of their own. They  need help, and this is a small way for us to contribute.   When the United States responds to natural or manmade disasters,  whether the tsunami in Indonesia, earthquakes in Nepal, drought in  Africa, or war in Syria, we don't debate whose responsibility it should  be to care for the victims. We respond because we are able to, and that  is what global leaders do when tragedy strikes. We did not cause the  cholera outbreak in Haiti any more than we have caused countless other  calamities around the world, but we can help. Even $11.7 million will  make a difference in Haiti, including by leveraging contributions from  other governments.   I hope other Senators will follow the lead of the Appropriations  Committee and lend their voices in support of this effort.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of  its founding, I would like to share a few remarks about the Nyumbani  Children's Home.   Marcelle and I have always enjoyed learning about and celebrating the  continued growth and successes of Nyumbani. Those successes are because  of the people who choose to dedicate their time, valuable skills, and  scarce resources to a noble cause--that of saving and improving the  lives of others.   We have been particularly touched and moved by the stories of the  children of Nyumbani. Despite confronting tremendous personal medical  and social challenges, these young people have been nurtured,  nourished, educated, and cared for in a safe and loving environment.   These children have also benefited from advances in medical and  therapeutic care that were unimaginable when this refuge was founded on  September 8, 1992. To know that many of the children raised there have  now grown into magnificent young people is a testament to the mission  of this center.   When the Nyumbani Children's home was founded, there was certainly no  assurance that these results would necessarily follow. The inspired  efforts of our friend, Father Angelo D'Agostino, or Father D'Ag, have  led to these successes. Father D'Ag was a man of faith who combined an  incredible work ethic with vision and an insatiable, indomitable will.  He was a man whose friendship I cherished.   Father D'Ag realized that the terror, stigma, and uncertainties  associated with the transmission of the AIDS virus was responsible for  a generation of orphans. Cruelly, AIDs also denied these children a  home because Kenyan orphanages would turn them away out of fear and an  inability to provide appropriate medical care, but Father D'Ag would  not walk away.   It began when Father D'Ag took on the care of three children who had  been abandoned and were destined to die alone. From that modest  beginning, the Nyumbani Children's Home became a forerunner in  providing care to those affected by the scourge of HIV.   In the decades since, Father D'Ag's vision has grown to encompass not  only the original Children's Home, but also an advanced diagnostic  laboratory, the unique Nyumbani Village, and an indispensable community  outreach program that provides medical care to residents of distressed  communities in Nairobi.   As a doctor and Jesuit priest, Father D'Ag innately understood the  principle that every life has value and dignity. His character and his  knowledge compelled him to act when others stood paralyzed by fear and  doubt.   Sharing his compassion and conviction from the outset was Sister Mary  Owens, Nyumbani's remarkable executive director since Father D'Ag's  passing in 2006. Each of us is enormously thankful for the work of  extraordinary people like Father D'Ag and Sister Mary. We are grateful  for the many lives that have been saved and all that has been  accomplished by Nyumbani over the past 25 years and look forward to  success stories in the next 25 years.   Nyumbani is a representation of what good can come when dedicated  people cast aside fear and doubt, bring forward the true human spirit,  and help those in need.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing a sense-of-senate  resolution commending Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos for his  extraordinary leadership in protecting Colombia's natural environment.  Anyone who has lived in, traveled to, or read about Colombia knows it  is a country of exceptional beauty and biological diversity. It is also  home to many indigenous groups who have played an indispensable role as  environmental stewards of their territories. During the years of his  Presidency, President Santos's efforts have not only established  Colombia as a global environmental leader, they will provide lasting  benefits to future generations and to the international community.   On September 21, President Santos will be honored by the National  Geographic Society for his efforts to protect Colombia's natural  environment, and I believe the U.S. Senate should also recognize his  achievements.                                S. Res. 263         Whereas Colombia is one of the world's ``megadiverse''       countries, hosting close to 10 percent of the planet's       biodiversity and producing an estimated 15 percent of the       world's oxygen;        Whereas Colombia occupies--        (1) first place worldwide in the number of birds and       orchids;        (2) second place in species of plants, amphibians,       butterflies and fresh water fish;        (3) third place in species of palm trees and reptiles;        (4) fourth place in biodiversity of mammals; and        (5) fifth place in marine and continental ecosystems;        Whereas Colombia's extraordinary mix of ecological,       climatic, and biological components are dispersed among its       311 ecosystems and 59 protected areas;        Whereas Colombia's biodiversity is at risk, mainly because       of habitat loss, urbanization, illicit drug cultivation and       production, mining and other extractive industries,       deforestation, and overfishing;        Whereas on the day of his inauguration in 2010, and       continuously since that date, President Santos has made       environmental management and resource conservation top       priorities of the Colombian Government;        Whereas since his inauguration, 14,800,000 hectares of       territory have been incorporated into the National System of       Protected Areas, including Chiribiquete National Park,       Corales de Profundidad National Park, Acandi, Playon and       Playona Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Bahia Portete -Kaurrele       National Natural Park;        Whereas Colombia now has 28,400,000 hectares incorporated       into the National System of Protected Areas;        Whereas the Colombian Government approved the establishment       and expansion of indigenous reserves to protect indigenous       cultures and curtail deforestation of critical ecosystems;        Whereas the Colombian Government adopted measures to reduce       carbon emissions resulting from deforestation in the       Colombian Amazon;        Whereas the Colombian Government developed a national       strategy to combat climate change;        Whereas, through the Vision Amazonia initiative, the       Colombian Government has set an ambitious goal of achieving       zero net deforestation in the Colombian Amazon by 2020;        Whereas for the first time in 2016, the Colombian       Government completed a greenhouse gas emissions inventory       that includes data from both department and municipal levels;       and        Whereas Colombia played a primary role in the Rio+20       Conference agenda for a green economy and continues to be an       active member in the international environmental dialogue:        Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--        (1) President Juan Manuel Santos has restructured and       significantly strengthened the environmental sector and       management capacity of the Colombian Government and has led       the country to become a global environmental leader;        (2) President Santos has enhanced public awareness of the       importance of protecting indigenous cultures and of the       indispensable role of indigenous people in protecting the       environment;        (3) President Santos' efforts to protect Colombia's       biodiversity will provide lasting benefits to future       generations of Colombians and to the international community;       and        (4) President Santos should be recognized and commended for       these efforts and achievements.                            ____________________
