 Mr. Speaker, I first thank Congresswoman Wilson, and, of  course, Congresswoman McBath.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to speak on the creation of a  Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys at the U.S. Civil  Rights Commission. Racial inequality in this country remains stark and  stubborn. Black men are 40 percent more likely to be unemployed today  than White men; twice as likely not to own the home they live in; 2\1/ 2\ times as likely to be killed by police officers; and 5 times as  likely to be locked behind bars.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot ignore these problems. We can't waive away  what is right before our eyes. Racial inequality in this country must  be confronted. The time has come to address this most painful of  issues. Indeed, the time has long past, but justice delayed is better  than no justice at all.   ``To those who have said, `Be patient and wait,' we have long said  that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually; but we  want to be free now. We are tired. We are tired of being beaten by  policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and  over again. And then you holler, `Be patient.' How long can we be  patient? We want our freedom, and we want it now.''   These are the words of John Robert Lewis at the March on Washington  in 1963, and we need to heed them today.
