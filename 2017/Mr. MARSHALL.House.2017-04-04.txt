 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of April as  the Month of the Military Child. I have the  [[Page H2641]]  utmost respect for the families of the military's men and women;  specifically, the children of our Nation's military, who are the  bedrock of military families. These children make sacrifices-- relocations, new schools, and the absence of a parent on deployment-- and they deserve our gratitude.   Due to the unique circumstances the children are put under, I stand  before you today to commend the children of those currently serving in  my district at Fort Riley in Kansas, and the children of those serving  around the Nation. I call on my colleagues to provide continued support  of our military children and families whose sacrifice is not always  recognized, but certainly is revered.                            ____________________
