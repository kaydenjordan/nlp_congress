 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Dent.   And if I may just say to the ranking member on our side, I greatly  appreciate Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz having helped us to bring  this to the floor to this extent, and I look forward to working with  her as well.   Mr. Chair, the need to help people who are willing to give it all for  us is something that we can never overlook, and I am grateful.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.
