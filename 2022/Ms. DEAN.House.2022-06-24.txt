 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Raymond  Jadczak, owner of PJ Auto Repair in Horsham, Pennsylvania, who is  retiring on July 9.   This year marks the 50th anniversary of PJ Auto Repair, a family- owned business led by Ray and his son, Samuel Jadczak.   Born and raised in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, and graduating from my  alma mater, too, Abington High School in 1968, Raymond grew up in a  mechanically-inclined household, often working on cars as a teenager  with his late father, John.   After high school, he turned his passion into a lifelong career. At  just 22, Ray opened an ARCO gas and repair service business. He was one  of the youngest ARCO franchises in the Philadelphia region.   In 1982, Ray was recognized by the National Institute for Automotive  Service Excellence as Mechanic of the Year.   For five decades, PJ Auto Repair has helped thousands, while creating  jobs in our district.   As he prepares to hand off his business to his son, Sam, I rise to  congratulate Raymond on a long and distinguished career of serving our  community.                            ____________________
