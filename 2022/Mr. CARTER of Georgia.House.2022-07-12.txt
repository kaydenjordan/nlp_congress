 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of Casper, a golden retriever in the service of Children's  Healthcare of Atlanta's Canines for Kids program.   To say that Children's Healthcare of Atlanta does an immense amount  for the community would be an understatement. Among these services is  the Canines for Kids program that provides the tender love of man's  best friend to sick children.   Casper, and his handler Lisa, were pioneers of this program. In 2009,  Casper reported for his first day of work, the inception of the program  itself.   He was driven by a deep love for children, like the other employees  at Children's Healthcare. His floppy-eared smile, paw touches, and  intentional eye contact brought comfort to hundreds of patients through  his many years of service.   Casper became the leader of his cohort of fellow dogs and helped to  pave the way for this instrumental program.   This is a tough loss for all who knew Casper, but his legacy remains  in the dozens of other dogs that continue his service nationwide every  day.   I thank Children's Healthcare of Atlanta for the work that they do  and for introducing all of us to Casper.                            ____________________
