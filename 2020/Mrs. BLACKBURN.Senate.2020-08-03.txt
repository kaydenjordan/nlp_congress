 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, journalists at ESPN  published the results of a bombshell investigation into human rights  violations at NBA training academies in China.   When you think about a basketball camp, you probably think of  shooting drills or running sprints, but these camps look much  different. The investigation focused on training camps located in  Xinjiang. This particular region in western China has achieved a  certain level of notoriety in recent months for the horrific political  violence its government officials inflict on the Uighur Muslim  minority. So it is no surprise that the stories told by trainers,  coaches, and other NBA employees who helped to run these camps employ  disturbing and familiar imagery.    According to the ESPN investigation, one former league employee  compared the atmosphere at the Xinjiang camp to ``World War II  Germany.''   An American coach, who worked at a similar facility, described it as  a ``sweat camp for athletes.''   Now, according to the investigation, almost immediately after the NBA  launched this program back in 2016, multiple coaches who were staffing  the camps reported to high-ranking organization officials that they had  witnessed Chinese coaches beating and berating student athletes. Bear  in mind that these reports were made in 2016. They also reported that  the Chinese Communist Party officials who were in charge of the camp  were denying students an education.   In coming to this elite camp, they were to receive both an education  and elevated sports training, but the reports, going back to 2016, said  the children were being abused, beaten, berated, and denied the  education. So why then did the NBA maintain these programs?   Money.   Communist China plays host to an estimated $4 billion NBA market.  They say that China is basketball-obsessed, and NBA execs have used  every avenue they can to take advantage of that, and they jealously  protect these relationships.   Last October, when Houston Rockets' General Manager Daryl Morey  tweeted in support of the Hong Kong Freedom Fighters, multiple league  all-stars, stakeholders, and well-connected employees lashed out in a  panic--terrified of retaliation from Beijing.   Team owner and Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai not only sided with the  Chinese Communist Party as it retaliated against the entire league, but  he characterized the Hong Kong protesters as leading a separatist  movement.   Their over-the-top reactions are proof enough of how fragile the  NBA's relationship with China actually is and who is really in control  of this relationship. The control is not with the NBA.   In June, I sent a letter to the NBA, expressing my concerns about the  training camps in Xinjiang and the league's entanglement with the  Chinese Communist Party. In their response, they announced that they  had closed their facilities in the region and that they had severed  their ties to any programs there.   The problem is that the ESPN report I referenced previously disputes  that assertion. I am reaching out for clarification on that matter, but  in their response, I hope NBA officials express clarity regarding all-- each and every one--of their business relationships with China because  the NBA and other organizations that maintain close ties to the Chinese  Communist Party believe that they are merely taking advantage of a  growing consumer market--or that is what they say. To them,  [[Page S4659]]  it is the smart, savvy play. That is what they believe. In reality,  what they are doing is giving the ball away. They are playing right  into Beijing's hands, and those hands are controlled by the Chinese  Communist Party.   Since 2013, the CCP has operated under a grand strategy to stretch  its influence across Europe, Africa, and Asia. This strategy is known  as--quite elegantly, they think--the Belt and Road Initiative. It  involves making interlinked investments over land and sea, which has  formed the beginnings of a modern day Silk Road.   The Chinese Communist Party uses energy and transportation  infrastructure development, as well as access to investment capital and  trade opportunities, to force its way into the good graces of  comparatively poor and still-developing nations.   I have seen this influence and its effects firsthand. Last year, I  traveled to the Horn of Africa and spent some time in Djibouti--a  country that welcomed China and the Belt and Road Initiative  investments with open arms.   China now holds somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 percent of that  country's national debt. This is 80 percent of its debt that is held by  Communist China. The government in Djibouti, in turn, agreed to  accommodate China's first overseas military outpost, grant access to a  crucial sea lane, and implement the Orwellian smart cities program.   Now, I will tell you, if I asked you to picture a modern day  surveillance state, the chances are the picture that would pop into  your head would come pretty close to being what is happening right now  in Djibouti City.   Yet the other thing I saw while in Djibouti was its vital strategic  importance to the United States. Our military relationship is one that  exists on the frontlines of great power competition, and it is  essential to continue American commitment to and investment in African  partners like Djibouti.   Wherever AFRICOM headquarters is located, we must not lose sight of  the importance of resourcing the African continent for great power  competition. This is the combatant command that consistently proves it  can ``do the most with the least,'' and it is a front where we can play  offense, not defense, against two of our major adversaries--China and  Russia.   The way China does business makes maintaining these relationships  incredibly important. The BRI functions behind a veil of secrecy to the  tune of somewhere between $1 trillion and $8 trillion in foreign  investment. Now, think about this. China invests its dollars in the  United States. Currently, China holds over $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt.  It does that because Congress has the power of the purse, but Congress  seems to think: Print more money. We can issue some debt. We can afford  it. All the while, China is making money off of our debt. Then, with  those profits, what is it doing? It is investing in countries around  the globe.   As I said, with what we know now about the Belt and Road Initiative-- the digital Silk Road, its push in the great power competition--it has  now spent somewhere between $1 trillion and $8 trillion around the  globe. Some of these countries, like Djibouti, are holding 80 percent  of the debt in exchange for locating a military post, for having a  naval base, for building out its spy network globally. This is what it  is up to.   The low-interest loans China offers leads these countries into  unsustainable debt burdens. Some countries' overall debts to China are  well above 20 percent of their GDPs, and many of these loan recipients  exist on the brink of a debt crisis. When you get in a debt crisis-- when your debt is more than your income--what happens? The person  holding your debt does what? We know. The person owns you   In short, China has set a series of ``debt traps'' for smaller,  struggling countries so they will just go tumbling over the cliff. For  China, everything is going according to plan because that dependency  translates to control over key strategic positions all over the globe.   Yet, pretty soon, if they are not careful, organizations like the  NBA, the National Basketball Association, will be the ``National  Beijing Association.'' What is it doing? It is ignoring this. Why is it  ignoring it? Because it is convenient. Why is it convenient? The  profits look good. It is making money. China is basketball-obsessed. Do  we really think that makes it OK? I have to say that it is not OK.   What the NBA is doing is ignoring horrific human rights abuses-- absolutely horrific. It is ignoring speech repression. It is ignoring  political violence. It is ignoring religious persecution. It is doing  it all in the name of finding its next basketball superstar, and it  remains willfully blind to the manipulation tactics China uses to hide  these abuses.   Whether we are talking about debt diplomacy or enthusiastic access to  a willing market, all of it is offered up by the Chinese Communist  Party as a distraction.   I have said repeatedly that the United States must take immediate  steps to unravel our relationships with China. The rapid and  unnecessary spread of COVID-19, caused by the Chinese Communist Party's  reckless attitude in the early days of the pandemic, is proof enough of  how dangerously vulnerable we are to the Chinese influence, but this  unraveling cannot occur if governments and organizations alike refuse  to acknowledge what the American people know to be true, which is that  we had a real chance to keep China in check, but we missed the  opportunity.   The only way that we can retake control of our interactions with  Beijing is to retake control of our economy and set our own parameters  for engagement with what has become one of the most dangerous and  powerful nations on the planet.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the previously referenced article from ESPN, dated July 29, 2020   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From ESPN.com, July 29, 2020]   ESPN Investigation Finds Coaches at NBA China Academies Complained of                      Player Abuse, Lack of Schooling                  (By Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada)         Long before an October tweet in support of Hong Kong       protesters spotlighted the NBA's complicated relationship       with China, the league faced complaints from its own       employees over human rights concerns inside an NBA youth-      development program in that country, an ESPN investigation       has found.        American coaches at three NBA training academies in China       told league officials their Chinese partners were physically       abusing young players and failing to provide schooling, even       though commissioner Adam Silver had said that education would       be central to the program, according to multiple sources with       direct knowledge of the complaints.        The NBA ran into myriad problems by opening one of the       academies in Xinjiang, a police state in western China where       more than a million Uighur Muslims are now held in barbed-      wire camps. American coaches were frequently harassed and       surveilled in Xinjiang, the sources said. One American coach       was detained three times without cause; he and others were       unable to obtain housing because of their status as       foreigners.        A former league employee compared the atmosphere when he       worked in Xinjiang to ``World War II Germany.''        In an interview with ESPN about its findings, NBA deputy       commissioner and chief operating officer Mark Tatum, who       oversees international operations, said the NBA is       ``reevaluating'' and ``considering other opportunities'' for       the academy program, which operates out of sports facilities       run by the Chinese government. Last week, the league       acknowledged for the first time it had closed the Xinjiang       academy, but, when pressed, Tatum declined to say whether       human rights were a factor.        ``We were somewhat humbled,'' Tatum said of the academy       project in China. ``One of the lessons that we've learned       here is that we do need to have more direct oversight and the       ability to make staffing changes when appropriate.''        In October, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's       tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters led the Chinese       government to pull the NBA from state television, costing the       league hundreds of millions of dollars. The controversy       continues to reverberate, as the NBA prepares to resume play       this week after a 4\1/2\-month hiatus because of the       coronavirus pandemic. China Central TV recently said it still       won't air NBA games, and U.S. lawmakers have raised questions       about the league's business ties to China.        The ESPN investigation, which began after Morey's tweet,       sheds new light on the lucrative NBA-China relationship and       the costs of doing business with a government that suppresses       free expression and is accused of cultural genocide. It       illustrates the challenges of operating in a society with       markedly different approaches to issues such as discipline,       education and security. The reporting is based on interviews       with several former NBA employees with direct knowledge of       the league's activities in China, particularly the player-      development program.  [[Page S4660]]         The program, launched in 2016, is part of the NBA's       strategy to develop local players in a basketball-obsessed       market that has made NBA China a $5 billion enterprise. Most       of the former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity       because they feared damaging their chances for future       employment. NBA officials asked current and former employees       not to speak with ESPN for this story. In an email to one       former coach, a public relations official added: ``Please       don't mention that you have been advised by the NBA not to       respond.''        One American coach who worked for the NBA in China       described the project as ``a sweat camp for athletes.''        At least two coaches left their positions in response to       what they believed was mistreatment of young players.        One requested and received a transfer after watching       Chinese coaches strike teenage players, three sources told       ESPN. Another American coach left before the end of his       contract because he found the lack of education in the       academies unconscionable: ``I couldn't continue to show up       every day, looking at these kids and knowing they would end       up being taxi drivers,'' he said.        Not long after the academies opened, multiple coaches       complained about the physical abuse and lack of schooling to       Greg Stolt, the league's vice president for international       operations for NBA China, and to other league officials in       China, the sources said. It was unclear whether the       information was passed on to NBA officials in New York, they       said. The NBA declined to make Stolt available for comment.        Two of the former NBA employees separately told ESPN that       coaches at the academies regularly speculated about whether       Silver had been informed about the problems. ``I said, `If       [Silver] shows up, we're all fired immediately,' '' one of       the coaches said.        Tatum said the NBA received ``a handful'' of complaints       that Chinese coaches had mistreated young players and       immediately informed local authorities that the league had       ``zero tolerance'' for behavior that was ``antithetical to       our values.'' Tatum said the incidents were not reported at       the time to league officials in New York, including himself       or Silver.        ``I will tell you that the health and wellness of academy       athletes and everyone who participates in our program is of       the utmost priority,'' Tatum said.        Tatum identified four separate incidents, though he said       only one was formally reported in writing by an NBA employee.       On three of the occasions, the coaches reported witnessing or       hearing about physical abuse. The fourth incident involved a       player who suffered from heat exhaustion.        ``We did everything that we could, given the limited       oversight we had,'' Tatum said.        Three sources who worked for the NBA in China told ESPN the       physical abuse by Chinese coaches was much more prevalent       than the incidents Tatum identified.        The NBA brought in elite coaches and athletic trainers with       experience in the G League and Division I basketball to work       at the academies. One former coach described watching a       Chinese coach fire a ball into a young player's face at       point-blank range and then ``kick him in the gut.''        ``Imagine you have a kid who's 13, 14 years old, and you've       got a grown coach who is 40 years old hitting your kid,'' the       coach said. ``We're part of that. The NBA is part of that.''        It is common for Chinese coaches to discipline players       physically, according to several people with experience in       player development in China. ``For most of the older       generation, even my grandparents, they take corporal       punishment for granted and even see it as an expression of       love and care, but I know it might be criticized by people       living outside of China,'' said Jinming Zheng, an assistant       professor of sports management at Northumbria University in       England, who grew up in mainland China and has written       extensively about the Chinese sports system. ``The older       generation still sees it as an integral part of training.''        In 2012, the NBA hired Bruce Palmer to work as technical       director at a private basketball school in Dongguan in       southern China, a program that predated the academies. The       school has a sponsorship agreement that pays the NBA nearly       $200,000 a year and allows the school to bill itself as an       ``NBA Training Center.''        Palmer spent five years in Dongguan and said he repeatedly       warned Chinese coaches not to hit, kick or throw balls at       children. After one incident, he said he told a coach: ``You       can't do that to your kid, this is an NBA training center. If       you really feel like hitting a 14-year-old boy, and you think       it's going to help him or make you feel better, take him off       campus, but not here, because the NBA does not allow this.''        Palmer said the school's headmaster told him that hitting       kids has ``been proven to be effective as a teaching tool.''        The issue was so prevalent in the NBA academies that       coaches repeatedly asked NBA China officials, including       Stolt, for direction on how to handle what they saw as       physical abuse, according to three sources. The coaches were       told to file written reports to the NBA office in Shanghai.       One coach said he encountered no more issues after filing a       report, but the others said the abuse continued.        ``We weren't responsible for the local coaches, we didn't       have the authority,'' Tatum said. ``We don't have oversight       of the local coaches, of the academic programs or the living       conditions. It's fair to say we were less involved than we       wanted to be.''        With a population four times the size of the U.S., China is       an exploding market for the NBA. The league's soaring       revenues were propelled in part by the success of former       Rockets center Yao Ming, who retired in 2011.        Tatum said the league sought advice from Yao and other       experts in China on the development of its academy program.       He also said NBA China's board of directors was briefed on       the planning and placement of the three academies, including       Xinjiang, adding that ESPN holds a seat on the board. An ESPN       spokesperson said the network ``is a non-voting board       observer and owns a small stake'' in NBA China, declining any       further comment. (Games are streamed in China by internet       giant Tencent, which also has a partnership with ESPN.)        Launching the academies had a primary goal for NBA bosses:       ``Find another Yao,'' according to two of the former       employees who spoke with ESPN.        When Silver announced the plan to open three league-run       academies in China in 2016, he said the goal was to train       elite athletes ``holistically.''        ``Top international prospects will benefit from a complete       approach to player development that combines NBA quality       coaching, training and competition with academics and       personal development,'' Silver said.        The league's news release announcing the academies said,       ``The initiative will employ a holistic, 360-degree approach       to player development with focuses on education, leadership,       character development and life skills.''        The NBA employees who spoke with ESPN said many of the       league's problems stemmed from the decision to embed the       academies in government-run sports facilities. The facilities       gave the NBA access to existing infrastructure and elite       players, Tatum said. But the arrangement put NBA activities       under the direction of Chinese officials who selected the       players and helped define the training.        ``We were basically working for the Chinese government,''       one former coach said.        After his work in the NBA-sponsored facility in Dongguan,       the league hired Palmer to evaluate the academies. He       concluded the program was ``fundamentally flawed.'' Palmer       said it not only put NBA employees under Chinese authority       but also prevented the league from working with China's most       elite players.        In hindsight, Tatum said, the NBA might have been ``a       little bit naive'' to believe the structure gave the league       sufficient oversight.        In Xinjiang, players lived in cramped dormitories; the       rooms were meant for two people, but a former coach said bunk       beds were used to put as many as eight to 10 athletes in a       room. Players trained two or three times a day and had few       extracurricular activities. NBA coaches and officials became       concerned that although education had been announced as a       pillar of the academy program, the sports bureaus did not       provide formal schooling. When the players--some as young       as 13--weren't training, eating or sleeping, they were       often left unsupervised.        One coach said league officials who visited China seemed to       be caught off-guard when they learned that players in the NBA       academies did not attend school.        The NBA was able to work out an arrangement by which       players at the academy in Zhejiang would be educated at a       local international school. But similar efforts in Xinjiang       and Shandong were unsuccessful.        Tatum said Chinese officials told the NBA that players at       the academies would take classes six days a week in subjects       such as English, math and sports psychology. He said when NBA       employees later raised questions about whether the kids were       in school, the Chinese officials reassured them they were.        But two former league employees said they complained       directly to Stolt, who's based in Shanghai, that the players       under their supervision were not in school.        Within the past month, as the NBA prepared to resume play       in Florida, it began to face new questions about its       relationship with China. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and       Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent separate letters to Silver       questioning why the NBA is promoting social justice at home       while ignoring China's abuses. The letters came shortly after       China announced a new national security law in Hong Kong that       gives authorities sweeping powers to crack down on pro-      Democracy protesters. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also recently       sparred on Twitter with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban over       China.        Hawley's letter challenged the NBA for excluding messages       supporting human rights in China among statements that       players can wear on their jerseys. The approved messages are       limited to social justice and the Black Lives Matter       movement.        ``Given the NBA's troubled history of excusing and       apologizing for the brutal repression of the Chinese       Communist regime, these omissions are striking,'' Hawley       wrote in the letter, which was sent to media members.        One recipient, ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, replied       with a profanity, which Hawley then tweeted out to his       235,000 followers. ESPN and Wojnarowski issued separate       apologies, and the reporter was suspended for two weeks       without pay.        In Xinjiang, the NBA opened an academy in a region       notorious for human rights abuses.  [[Page S4661]]         In recent years, the Chinese government has escalated its       use of high-tech surveillance, restricted freedom of movement       and erected mass internment facilities, which the government       describes as vocational training centers and critics describe       as concentration camps holding ethnic minorities,       particularly Uighur Muslims. The government says the policy       is necessary to combat terrorism. In September, the United       States joined more than 30 countries in condemning ``China's       horrific campaign of repression'' against the Uighurs.       Reports of separatist violence and Chinese government       repression in Xinjiang go back decades.        Tatum said the NBA wasn't aware of political tensions or       human rights issues in Xinjiang when it announced it was       launching the training academy there in 2016.        In the spring of 2018, the U.S. began considering sanctions       against China over human rights concerns there, and the issue       became the subject of increasing media coverage within the       United States. In August 2018, Slate published an article       under the headline: ``Why is the NBA in Xinjiang? The league       is running a training center in the middle of one of the       world's worst humanitarian atrocities.''        Later, the NBA would receive criticism from congressional       leaders, but it never addressed the concerns or said anything       about the status of the facility until last week.        Sometime shortly after Morey's October tweet, the academy       webpage was taken down.        Pressed by ESPN, Tatum repeatedly avoided questions on       whether the widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang played       a role in closing the academy, instead citing ``many       factors.''        ``My job, our job is not to take a position on every single       human rights violation, and I'm not an expert in every human       rights situation or violation,'' Tatum said. ``I'll tell you       what the NBA stands for: The values of the NBA are about       respect, are about inclusion, are about diversity. That is       what we stand for.''        Nury Turkel, a Uighur American activist who has been       heavily involved in lobbying the U.S. government on Uighur       rights, told ESPN before the NBA said it had left Xinjiang       that he believed the league had been indirectly legitimizing       ``crimes against humanity.''        One former league employee who worked in China wondered how       the NBA, which has been so progressive on issues around Black       Lives Matter and moved the 2017 All-Star Game out of       Charlotte, North Carolina, over a law requiring transgender       people to use bathrooms corresponding to the sex listed on       their birth certificates, could operate a training camp amid       a Chinese government crackdown that also targeted NBA       employees.        ``You can't have it both ways,'' the former employee said.       ``. . .You can't be over here in February promoting Black       History Month and be over in China, where they're in       reeducation camps and all the people that you're partnering       with are hitting kids.''        Tatum said the NBA ``has a long history and our values are       about inclusion and respect and bridging cultural divides.       That is what we stand for and that is who we are as an       organization. We do think that engagement is the best way to       bridge cultural divides, the best way to grow the game across       borders.''        The repression in Xinjiang is aimed primarily at Uighurs,       but foreigners also have been harassed. One American coach       said he was stopped by police three times in 10 months. Once,       he was taken to a station and held for more than two hours       because he didn't have his passport at the time. Because of       the security restrictions, foreigners were told they were not       allowed to rent housing in Xinjiang; most lived at local       hotels.        Tatum said the league wasn't aware any of its employees had       been detained or harassed in Xinjiang.        Most of the players who trained at the NBA's Xinjiang       academy were Uighurs, but it was unclear to league employees       who spoke with ESPN if any were impacted by the government       crackdown.        After returning from Xinjiang last fall, Corbin Loubert, a       strength coach who joined the NBA after stints at the IMG       Academy in Florida and The Citadel, posted a CNN story on       Twitter describing how the network's reporters faced       surveillance and intimidation in Xinjiang.        ``I spent the past year living in Xinjiang, and can confirm       every word of this piece is true,'' Loubert tweeted. ``One of       the biggest challenges was not only the discrimination and       harassment I faced,'' he added, ``but turning a blind eye to       the discrimination and harassment that the Uyghur people       around me faced.''        Loubert declined several interview requests from ESPN.        In a bipartisan letter to Silver last October after Morey's       tweet, eight U.S. legislators--including Rep. Alexandria       Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Cruz--called for the NBA to       ``reevaluate'' the Xinjiang academy in response to ``a       massive, government-run campaign of ethno-religious       repression.''        Even though the NBA now says it had left Xinjiang in the       spring of 2019, the league did not respond to the letter. The       Xinjiang academy webpage disappeared soon after.        Last week, in response to Sen. Blackburn of Tennessee, the       league wrote, ``The NBA has had no involvement with the       Xinjiang basketball academy for more than a year, and the       relationship has been terminated.''        John Pomfret, whose 2016 book, ``The Beautiful Country and       the Middle Kingdom'' covers the history of the U.S.-China       relationship, called the decision to put an academy in       Xinjiang ``a huge mistake'' that made the NBA ``party to a       massive human rights violation.''        ``Shutting it down was probably the smartest thing to do,''       he said. ``But you can clearly understand from the NBA's       point of view why they wouldn't want to make an announcement:       Then you're just rubbing China's nose in it. What would you       say, `We're leaving because of human rights concerns?' That's       worse than Morey's tweet.''        Tatum said the league decided to end its involvement with       the Xinjiang facility because it ``didn't have the authority,       or the ability to take direct action against any of these       local coaches, and we ultimately concluded that the program       there was unsalvageable.''        Tatum said the NBA informed its coaches in Xinjiang that       the league planned to cease operations, and coaches were then       ``moved out.'' But when Tatum was told that multiple sources       had told ESPN that the NBA never informed the coaches of its       plans to close Xinjiang, Tatum said he wasn't actually sure       what conversations had taken place.        Two sources disputed that the NBA had any plans to leave       Xinjiang in the spring of 2019. One coach said the league was       still seeking other coaches to move there well into the       summer and that the league's statement to Blackburn was       ``completely inaccurate.''        ``They were still trying to get people to go out there,''       the coach said. ``It didn't end because [Tatum] said, `We're       gonna end this.' ''        ``They probably finally said, `Why are we doing this?' ''       he continued. ``Like we told them from the start, `Why do we       need to be here? We're the NBA, there's no reasons for us to       be here.''     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
