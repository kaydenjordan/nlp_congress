Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 3981, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3981, as amended. This  bill makes improvements to protect veterans while they are using their  GI Bill.   Specifically, this bill would require schools to self-report adverse  actions to their State approving agency in addition to the VA within 30  days.   State approving agencies are required to approve and review schools  and training programs for the GI Bill. This bill would also require VA  to create a risk-based survey database within 180 days.   Congress has been waiting for the VA to implement this database for a  long time. This proposal would make it clear to the VA that Congress  still intends for this database to be implemented.   I appreciate the bipartisan work that has been done at the committee  level to ensure that this bill supports veterans while also not  increasing government spending.   I thank Mr. McGarvey for his work in introducing this proposal, and I  urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3981, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage the Members on our side the  aisle and all of our colleagues to support this good piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1530) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  requirement to publish disability benefit questionnaire forms of  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 1530, as amended.  [[Page H4360]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1530, as amended,  offered by my friend from Texas and our Subcommittee on Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs chairman, Representative Luttrell.   I also congratulate Representative Luttrell on this bill as it is his  first one to come before the floor since coming to Congress.   Now, this bill would make vitally important improvements to the VA's  disability claims process for veterans applying for benefits, and I am  grateful to my fellow veteran for his work on it.   It is no secret that the VA disability claims process is lengthy and  difficult, but Mr. Luttrell's bill is the right solution to modernize  the process, an example of which would be the requirement for VA to  publish disability benefits questionnaire forms on the VA's website to  ease access between veterans and providers completing disability  claims.   This is a commonsense change that honestly we should have done a long  time ago. This bill also includes Representative Ciscomani's  legislation to create a new internship program at the Board of  Veterans' Appeals. This program would offer certain incentives to legal  interns to get them into VA and fighting for veterans while also  addressing hiring and retention challenges at the board head on.   Lastly, this bill includes Representative Self's proposal to make  sure that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has enough judges to  process the backlog of appeals and expected growth since the passage of  the PACT Act last year.   These commonsense solutions should help us make the claims process a  little easier to navigate for veterans and their families. It would  also provide the courts with the additional resources we know they need  to manage the workload coming in from the board.   Once again, I thank Representative Luttrell, Mr. Self, and Mr.  Ciscomani for their work on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1530, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Luttrell), the chairman of the DAMA Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Self).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani).    Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 112) to amend title 38, United States Code, to strengthen  benefits for children of Vietnam veterans born with spina bifida, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  S. 112.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Senator Braun of Indiana's  bill, S. 112, which strengthens the spina bifida program at VA.   Children who are born to veterans exposed to Agent Orange and other  herbicides have a higher risk of being born with this condition. Their  condition can range from mild to severe, but children faced with this  lifelong impact of spina bifida have many special needs.   Under current law, the VA Spina Bifida Health Care Benefits Program  provides monetary and healthcare benefits to select children of  Vietnam-era veterans and veterans of covered service in Korea or  Thailand.   Senator Braun's commonsense legislation would improve the current  program by establishing care and coordination teams for these children  to ensure they have the care and support and continued connections that  they need for their entire lives.   Additionally, this bill would require VA to create an advisory  council on healthcare and benefits for children living with spina  bifida. This council would solicit feedback on healthcare, job  training, and monetary benefits to ensure that these children have  access to leading therapies and medical research.   For a lot of veterans' families, I know this legislation would make a  real difference in their daily lives.   I thank Representative Baird for his work on this issue and for  introducing the House companion to this bill, H.R. 3888.   I know these Members have heard from Hoosiers about this problem for  many years, and I appreciate their efforts to help their constituents  and other families.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 112  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 475) to designate the clinic of the Department of Veterans  Affairs in Gallup, New Mexico, as the Hiroshi ``Hershey'' Miyamura VA  Clinic.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 475         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF HIROSHI ``HERSHEY'' MIYAMURA                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Hiroshi ``Hershey'' Miyamura was born on October 6,       1925, in Gallup, New Mexico.        (2) A second generation Japanese American, Hershey Miyamura       first served in the  [[Page H4363]]       United States Army near the end of World War II.        (3) Hershey Miyamura served in the Army at a time when many       of his fellow Japanese Americans, and that includes his       future wife, were detained in internment camps in the United       States.        (4) Hershey Miyamura served in the storied 442nd Infantry       Regiment, which was composed of soldiers with Japanese       ancestry and became one of the most decorated units in the       history of the United States military.        (5) Following the start of the Korean War in 1950, the Army       recalled Hershey Miyamura, who had remained as a member of       the reserve components of the Army, back into active duty.        (6) During an overnight firefight from April 24 to April       25, 1951, then-Corporal Miyamura covered the withdrawal of       his entire company from advancing enemy forces as a machine       gun squad leader.        (7) The selfless actions by Hershey Miyamura that night       allowed all 16 of his men to withdraw safely before he was       severely wounded and captured as a prisoner of war.        (8) Nearly 2\1/2\ years later, following his release and       return to the United States, President Eisenhower presented       Hershey Miyamura with the Congressional Medal of Honor in a       ceremony at the White House.        (9) The lifelong dedication of Hershey Miyamura to the       United States never ceased. It continued long after his       decorated military service ended.        (10) After he received his honorable discharge from the       Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route       66 in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.        (11) Hershey Miyamura remained active in his community       until his dying days, advocating for his fellow veterans and       inspiring young people with lectures on patriotism, faith,       and service.        (b) Designation.--The clinic of the Department of Veterans       Affairs located at 2075 South NM Highway 602, Gallup, New       Mexico, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be       known and designated as the ``Hiroshi `Hershey' Miyamura       Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic'' or the ``Hiroshi       `Hershey' Miyamura VA Clinic''.        (c) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       clinic referred to in subsection (b) shall be considered to       be a reference to the ``Hiroshi `Hershey' Miyamura VA       Clinic''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  S. 475.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill designating the  Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in Gallup, New Mexico, as the  Hiroshi ``Hershey'' Miyamura VA Clinic.   Hiroshi Miyamura was born in Gallup, New Mexico, the son of a  Japanese immigrant. He received the nickname ``Hershey'' from his  fourth grade teacher, who could not pronounce his first name correctly.  I know how that happens.                                time  1645    He joined the U.S. Army during the final days of World War II, served  as a machine gunner in the storied 442nd Infantry Regiment. Following  the war, he remained in the Army Reserve.   At the onset of the Korean war, ``Hershey'' was recalled to Active  Duty and, once again, sent to the front lines. He earned the Medal of  Honor for his actions during a firefight that occurred overnight from  April 24 to April 25, 1951.   Overwhelmed by the enemy forces, Corporal Miyamura covered the safe  withdrawal of his entire company, despite being wounded himself.  Unfortunately, he was captured immediately after his heroic actions. He  was held as a prisoner of war for 28 months and released on August 20,  1953, a month after the end of the Korean war.   In October of that year, President Eisenhower presented the Medal of  Honor to Staff Sergeant Miyamura.   After his honorable discharged, he returned to his community in  Gallup, New Mexico, where he became an automobile mechanic and service  station owner. More importantly, he remained active supporting his  fellow veterans and inspiring young people with his patriotism and  continued service.   Hiroshi Miyamura is an inspiring American hero. He was born to  immigrants, rose to the call of a Nation, put himself before others in  combat, and served as a valuable member of society afterwards.   This bill ensures his sacrifice and legacy will always be remembered.   Madam Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this bill, Senator Heinrich, as  well as the entire New Mexico delegation, for recognizing this American  hero. I urge all my colleagues to support S. 475.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, once again, encourage Members to support  this legislation. This is truly a piece of legislation that helps the  community know and understand how a gallant hero served this Nation. A  Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award. It is not given  lightly. For a person who truly did face a time when persecution  happened to his people but still served this Nation, it is a true honor  that we need to bestow on him.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
