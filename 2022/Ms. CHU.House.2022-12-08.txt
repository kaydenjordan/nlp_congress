 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give my strongest support for  the Respect for Marriage Act.   It is hard to believe that today, in 2022, we are still fighting to  protect the right of all Americans to marry the person they love.   The Supreme Court's actions this summer have shown us that we cannot  take our rights for granted. No one should have to live in fear that a  Supreme Court decision could invalidate their marriage in the blink of  an eye.   The Respect for Marriage Act enshrines the right to marry the person  you love, regardless of gender, race, or identity, into Federal law.   It finally repeals the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act from  our lawbooks, and it reaffirms our commitment to a promise of equality  for all by ensuring critical Federal and State protections for same-sex  and interracial marriages.   I have spent my career fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ+  community, both at the State and Federal levels, and so I am proud to  stand on the House floor today in support of the Respect for Marriage  Act.   Sending this bill to the President's desk sends a powerful message  that love is love, that family is family, and that this Congress stands  together against hate and discrimination.
