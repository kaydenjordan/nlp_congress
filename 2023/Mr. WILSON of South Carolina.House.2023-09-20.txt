 Mr. Speaker, this month, Luke Coffey of  the Hudson Institute addressed ``The Top Myths about US Aid to  Ukraine,'' revealing: ``Every dollar spent in support of Ukraine is  authorized by Congress and used for a specific purpose.''   ``As of September 2023, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with $101  billion, or about 0.43 percent of America's GDP.''   ``The vast majority of this money never leaves the U.S. and instead  supports American jobs.''   ``There has likely never been more accountability in place for U.S.  foreign assistance,'' with the U.S., ``Ukraine Oversight Interagency  Working Group. More than 160 officials across 20 Federal oversight  agencies monitor U.S. aid to Ukraine.''   ``According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy's Ukraine aid  tracker, total European commitments are now more than double those of  the U.S.''   ``Russia is China's junior partner. A defeated Russia means a weaker  China.''   Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, ``The security of the  Indo-Pacific region cannot be separated from the European security.''   I support the proven Republican policies of Barry Goldwater and  Ronald Reagan of why not victory over dictators.                            ____________________
