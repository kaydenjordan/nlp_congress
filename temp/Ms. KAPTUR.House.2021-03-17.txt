 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Women's History Month to  celebrate countless women across America making a difference. From  coast to coast, in every community and every industry, women are  getting it done.   Take Kishia Powell, the current chief operations officer and EVP of  DC Water. I had the great pleasure to meet Kishia last week while  visiting the brand-new headquarters. She is working in an industry  dominated by men, and Kishia has stayed dedicated to her role as a  woman leader in the water utilities industry. She is literally turning  sludge into a new energy utility for Washington, D.C., and the  surrounding regions.   Then there is Sister Pamela Marie Buganski, a native Toledoan who  dedicated her life to faith and community. I remember meeting her in  Matamoros, Mexico, as she was witnessing what was happening to  immigrant children and families as a result of President Trump's Remain  in Mexico order. Pamela gave everything she had to others before she,  sadly, passed away last year.   Women like former Member Jill Long Thompson from Indiana have played  an instrumental role in advancing change and conversation across  America. As a Member and as a teacher, she recently wrote a book about  government ethics and how President Trump's Presidency undermined the  ethics of our democracy.   Finally, there are women like Patsy Pasquale, who humbly carries on  her father's Toledo shoe business and legacy in orthopedic footwear  after his death from COVID-19 last December.   This Women's History Month, we strive to celebrate all that women do  in this country and the lasting impact they create. Let us be thankful  for their beautiful lives that elevate the worth of our families,  communities, culture, and economy.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly stand with all my sisters this evening.                            ____________________
