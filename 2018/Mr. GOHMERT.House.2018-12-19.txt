 Mr. Speaker, I just want to applaud my friend's efforts  on behalf of people who have counted on us. The 2 weeks he spent over  there have been invaluable to the people who were counting on us. Some  of that time was spent with a dear friend named Dave Eubanks.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Tom Garrett, for  arranging this Special Order. He is on his way out, and he cares so  deeply about this country and this country's allies that he would put  his life at risk and go and spend time with another American hero.   In fact, Dave Eubanks is a hero, and he is someone who has dedicated  his life as a Christian, as an American, trying to make the lives of  others in the world better, and I thank my friend, Congressman Garrett,  for spending that time with him. We shouldn't turn our back on our  friends.   Sometimes it seems that Mr. Erdogan is not our friend, but we  certainly have had a tremendous amount of friendship and lives lost in  the Kurdish community, standing up for us, with us, in defense of  freedom.   That is important. And I also want to address the issue of the wall  on our southern border. It appears clear, since we lost over 70,000  American lives last year--that is more than all of the precious  American lives we lost in the whole time of the Vietnam war--and we  lost those in 1 year from drugs.   Most of those drugs coming across our southern border in the form of  opiates and other hallucinogens, including fentanyl, are coming from  Mexico. So if you want to see another 70,000 Americans die again next  year, you don't want a wall. Let's not build a wall.   If you would like to have illegal aliens continue to pour into this  country in the hopes that they will be able to vote illegally, you  don't want a wall, even though you supported one in the past. You don't  want one now because you may get those votes if you can stop a wall  from being built.   If you want Mexico to remain as a country with so much incredible  potential whose people are suffering and keep the people of Central  America suffering at the hands of the drug cartels, you don't want a  wall. Because if we build a wall where we need it, we build a fence  where we need it, we totally secure the border, what happens? The  money, by the tens of billions, pouring into the drug cartels south of  the border dries up.   That means the corruption in Mexico and south of there dries up. That  means Mexico, with its incredible national resources--the natural  resources of that Nation are incredible. Its location, actually, for  commerce is even better than the United States.                                time  2145    It sits between two continents. It sits between two oceans. Its  potential is unlimited. But what limits it is the corruption from the  drug cartels that America is continuing to fund.   So do you want that to continue?   Yeah, you don't want a wall.   Our elected leaders in the House and the Senate--the Republican  elected leaders in the House and Senate--were not in favor of a wall or  total border security in the last election in 2016. It was unfortunate.   The President knew and heard the voice of the American people, and he  echoed it. But that is why back in September of this year at our  conference--and I know it wasn't popular and people didn't like me  saying it--but I had to make clear, it was clear to me, if we don't get  money for a wall, then the people, the voters that put President Trump  in the White House will not come out in the same numbers, and we will  not likely remain in the majority. I said it 2 weeks in a row, and the  response was to cancel that last week of votes before the election.   We didn't fund the wall. We said: Oh, let's wait until December.   My comment then was: This will be my 14th December in Congress, and I  have lived through 13 where we were told we will fight in December.   We have yet to fight in December.   Now is the time. I know people want to go home. I want to go home.  But this is our chance to protect America for our future. Let's help  the President keep our promise. Let's help him keep our promise.   I know the Speaker and the majority leader were not big on this 2  years ago, but most of America heard commercials from our majority  leaders saying: Help Kevin McCarthy and President Trump build the wall.   Well, now we need Americans to help remind our Republican leaders to  help our President build the wall like we said. If that doesn't happen,  I don't think the Senate can count on being back in the majority. They  won't be. It is that serious.   I have heard that the feeling in the Senate among Republicans now is,  let's not do reconciliation so we only have to pass the money for a  wall with 51 votes. We don't want to do that.   If you don't do that, get money passed for the wall, then you are not  coming back in the majority. Maybe you would enjoy the minority. Get  used to it. That is where you are heading in 2 years.   It doesn't have to be that way. We can still have the White House in  2020. We can still have a majority in the Senate in 2020. We can get  the majority back in the House in 2020. But if we drop the ball on this  biggest campaign promise, then we are not going to have the majority in  either the House or the White House.   And that, to quote my friend from Houston, my fellow former judge,  that is just the way it is.
