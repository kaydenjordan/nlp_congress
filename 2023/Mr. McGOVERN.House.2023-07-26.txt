 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned about the ongoing  political, human rights, and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and its  hemispheric consequences, including the arrival of 187,000 desperate  Venezuelans at our southern border last year.   This crisis has many causes, beginning with misguided and distorting  economic policies implemented by successive Venezuelan Governments.  Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the maximum pressure secondary  and sectoral sanctions policy put in place by former President Trump  and continued by President Biden has deepened the economic pain and  hardship suffered by the Venezuelan people. The goal of that policy was  to remove Nicolas Maduro from power in Venezuela. It has not worked.  Rather, as The New York Times editorial board wrote on July 22, that  Maduro ``instead consolidated his grip on Venezuela, blamed its  economic misery on American sanctions and drew his country closer to  Russia and China.''   Throughout my time in Congress, I have strongly defended the idea  that human rights should be at the center of U.S. foreign policy, and I  have led many bills to redress human rights abuses, including the  Global Magnitsky targeted sanctions legislation. Nevertheless, I don't  support the use of sanctions to punish entire peoples for the actions  of their leaders or to bludgeon an adversary into submission.   This is why I have said that the Trump-era sanctions should already  have been lifted by the Biden administration, and I continue to believe  that. However, unfortunately, that has not happened, and it seems  unlikely that it will in the near future.   In the end, human rights advocacy is meant to improve and restore the  lives of victims of abuses and to change conditions so that abuses will  not recur. As a human rights advocate, I have a moral responsibility to  do whatever I can to advance these goals.   That is why I welcomed the administration's support for the  resumption of negotiations between the Maduro government and Venezuelan  opposition in Mexico last year. It is why I believe the social fund for  the basic needs of the Venezuelan people, whose creation was agreed to  during those negotiations, should be stood up as soon as possible.  Additionally, it is why I was encouraged to see the statement of  principles that came out of the International Conference on Venezuela  convened by the Colombian government last April.   The statement laid out three steps--the establishment of a chronogram  for elections, the easing of sanctions in parallel as agreements are  reached between the parties, and the continuation of the negotiations  accompanied by accelerated implementation of the social fund--that,  taken together, offer a real opportunity to begin to resolve  Venezuela's crisis.   These steps would empower and benefit all Venezuelans seeking to  rebuild their country and their future.   Everyone who is concerned about the human rights of the Venezuelan  people should take advantage of this opportunity. I still believe the  Trump-era sanctions should be lifted, and I will continue to urge the  Biden administration to do so.   Democracy and civil rights will not be advanced by maintaining  punishing economic sanctions. All that does is continue to hurt  innocent people. Nonetheless, we need to find a way to move the ball  forward, and I believe there is an opportunity now. Time is short, and  there is a lot of uncertainty, but there is also some hope, and that  should guide us.                            ____________________
