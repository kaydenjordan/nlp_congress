 Madam Speaker, today indeed I do rise in strong support of  H.R. 1526, a bill to honor the life and legacy of Eva G. Hewitt by  renaming the Post Office in Tumwater, Washington, in her honor.   A few blocks from where we stand today is the Smithsonian Postal  Museum, a museum that preserves and promotes postal history from every  era. In it you can read about the rural letter carriers. This is  personal with me. As it turns out, my grandfather was a rural postal  delivery member of the post office from 1905 to 1944. Out of Henrietta,  Texas, he for many years delivered the mail on horseback. One of the  biggest days of his life was when he got a Model T. He, in fact,  delivered letters right up to the day he died in 1944. You can read  about him and a lot of other people in the museum.   Most notably you can learn about the women trailblazers who built the  postal service into what it is today, women like Sarah DeCrow who in  1792 became the very first woman postmaster; or Ethel Hill, who in 1900  became the first woman listed as a full-time rural delivery carrier.   This year, in celebration of the city of Tumwater's 150th  anniversary--they call that the sesquicentennial--they are sharing many  of the stories there about their own women trailblazers, women like Eva  G. Hewitt. She was indeed Tumwater's first woman postmaster during a  very pivotal time in Tumwater's history. So it is fitting to rename the  post office for her.   In 1893 she and her husband, Charles, purchased that drugstore  alluded to earlier right in the heart of Tumwater, and their drugstore  became known as Hewitt Drug Store. It was the center of the community,  and it housed a store and, yes, a soda fountain, and the post office,  all under one roof.   She started as an assistant there, but--get this--prior to that time  her husband was the postmaster, but it turns out when the Postal  Service adopted civil service rules, she and her husband both took the  examination. And guess what?   She passed; he didn't; she became the postmaster in 1915. It sounds  like something that would happen in my home.   So following the death of her husband in 1927, she took over the  business and served there until her retirement in 1942. She was the  very first person to hold the position of Tumwater postmaster. At the  time of her retirement she was also the longest serving postmaster in  that city's history which dates back to 1824.   During her decades at the store, she saw a massive growth in mail  volume throughout the Pacific Northwest. As a matter of fact, she once  remarked that the volume at the Tumwater Post Office in terms of  monthly mail in 1942 was equivalent to annual mail at the turn of the  century.   Yes, indeed, the store was torn down and the post office was torn  down to help make way for Interstate 5, the main arterial between  Canada and Mexico that runs throughout the West Coast.   Although the drugstore may be gone, her legacy isn't. As postmaster,  as business woman, and as community member, it lives on. So I was  delighted when the city approached me about this long overdue  recognition for Eva. Very few post offices, let us note, are named for  women, much less the women who carried out the mission of the Postal  Service.   In fact, take note, of the 823 post offices that have been renamed,  only 98 of them have been renamed for women--less than 12 percent. We  have got a parity issue here, Madam Speaker. That is why I am even more  than proud to introduce and support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Olympia Tumwater Foundation for  helping to tell Eva's story. I thank the city of Tumwater for sharing  her story with our community. And I want to thank all the members of my  delegation who joined in to cosponsor this. Eva has earned her place in  the South Sound history books that she helped write.   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to support this bill to rename the  Tumwater Post Office in her honor, and I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.                                time  1600
