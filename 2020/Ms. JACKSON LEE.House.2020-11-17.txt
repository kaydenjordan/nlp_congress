 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Homeland, and Budget Committees, and Founding Chair of the  Congressional Children's Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8326,  the ``Child Care is Economic Development Act''.   First and foremost, I wish to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Abby  Finkenauer, for her leadership on this vital, bipartisan piece of  legislation.   H.R. 8326 requires grant applicants for certain public works and  economic development projects to describe in their comprehensive  economic development strategy how they will increase the accessibility  of affordable, quality child care.   By doing so, this bill makes it easier for child care to be an  essential part of plans for local economic development projects.   The child care industry has served as a crucial backbone to the  United States' economy for decades, and it, too, continues to be rocked  by the devastating effects of the coronavirus.   Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, we have seen a tremendous surge  in the number of coronavirus cases across the United States.   As of today, health authorities have identified more than 11 million  COVID-19 cases throughout the United States since the start of the  pandemic in January.   Just last week, my home state of Texas surpassed 1 million cases and  reported over 20,000 related deaths.   At the county level, Harris County, which includes my district, has  reported more than 175,000 cases and over 2,360 related deaths.   Before the pandemic, Texas had more than 11,000 child care  operations.   Yet, as a result of this disease, that number has reduced  dramatically as these facilities have had to permanently close their  doors.   According to a survey conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Center,  nearly two-thirds (63 percent of parents across the United States had  difficulty finding child care amidst COVID-19.   Furthermore, about 47 percent of parents are concerned they won't be  able to afford child care when they can return to the workforce.   As we seek to regain control over this virus and poise our economy to  rebound from the effects of the coronavirus, these closures will,  without a doubt, affect parents and families who need to return to work  yet no longer have a child care provider.   Child care facilities provide an immense and unquestionable public  value.   Workers in every industry rely on child care centers to provide  capable care for their children, helping them juggle both parenting and  employment responsibilities.   The child care industry is even more essential to single parent  households.   In 2019, 15.76 million children lived with a single mother and  approximately 3.23 million children lived with a single father.   For these millions of families, child care is a lifeline.  [[Page H5853]]    I have been a long-standing advocate for the child care industry  because I understand the challenges many working families face when it  comes to obtaining reliable, affordable, and quality child care.   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have supported numerous  initiatives that strengthen the viability of the child care sector.   Most recently, I supported:   H.R. 7327, the ``Child Care for Economic Recovery Act'';   H.R. 7027, the ``Child Care is Essential Act''; and   H.R. 7909, the ``Ensuring Children and Child Care Workers are Safe  Act''.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, voicing my support for H.R. 8326  because it serves as a vital component to our nation's economic  reopening strategy.   According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, approximately 50 percent  of parents who have not yet returned to work cite childcare as a reason  they have not returned.   By passing H.R. 8326 today, we have the opportunity expand access to  quality child care, so that individuals who are pursuing opportunities  with these public works projects will not have to worry about choosing  between employment opportunities and child care.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 8326, the ``Child  Care is Economic Development Act.''    Madam Speaker, just recently I read an article that  indicated that one in six Texans had been infected with COVID-19. As  the study indicates in our local newspaper, that may be the case for  States around the Nation. So I think it is extremely important that the  General Services Administration and the administrator of that  department follow their administrative duties to allow the President- elect and Vice President-elect to be engaged in COVID-19 briefings to  save lives.   In addition, I think it is crucial that we move forward on the Heroes  Act that will provide for PPEs, will provide for payroll protection,  and, of course, testing. Early on, testing was supposed to be 5 million  a day. We have only tested 1.6 million a day minimally in the United  States at least. We have to do more to save lives. Testing, social  distancing, washing your hands, and wearing a mask will save lives. It  will save lives here, and it will save lives across America.   Finally, we must pass this legislation to help with the mental health  stress people are facing and the economic stress they are facing.   The General Services Administration needs to do their job and do it  now so that the American people's lives can be saved.                            ____________________
