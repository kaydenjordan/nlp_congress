 Madam Speaker, it is not a surprise why we  are here. To the gentlewoman from Arizona, it is not a surprise. They  have nothing else to put on the floor except political statements a  month before an election and to further an agenda that they don't like  with ICE and the immigration process, which we have heard now in the  Committee on the Judiciary for well over 2 years. Again, there are no  actionable items that actually can fix them but a lot of talk.   So let's continue with this just amazing reason we are here on the  floor. Because the majority has embraced this absurd and baseless  accusation that employees and doctors at the Irwin County Detention  Facility in my State of Georgia are engaged in a conspiracy--this is  amazing--with local doctors to systematically sterilize illegal aliens.   They have proven to the American people that no story is too  outlandish to use in furtherance of their radical agenda.   It would be a completely different situation if we were standing here  today to take action on substantiated claims of mistreatment, but we  are not.   We are here today so that the majority can attempt to squeeze one  last bit of value out of the false claims propagated by Project South's  complaint about the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia.  The left knows these complaints are not true, but they are hoping we  will ignore the mountain of evidence contradicting them--Madam Speaker,  I have news for them--we are not.   If claims of mass hysterectomies were true, or even if they were  substantiated by the smallest amount of evidence, then there would be  swift action. But to the contrary--and to the dismay of my Democrat  colleagues--the claims of mass hysterectomies were quickly proven false  mere days after the complaint was released. In fact, as Mr. Scott said,  just days later, both the hospital and the detention center confirmed  only two such hysterectomies were performed since 2017.   Madam Speaker, that didn't stop the whistleblower. That didn't stop  Project South. That didn't stop us from bringing this show to the floor  of the House.   In fact, in the complaint Ms. Wooten called the doctor at the center  a uterus collector. Where does he go to get his reputation back from  somebody who in a group who makes basic claims?   I need to remind Project South; they don't have speech and debate  privileges like we do. They ought to be careful about who they are  slandering and how they are doing it.   Ms. Wooten said she has spoken out about several inmates who have had  hysterectomies. Even more sensationalized, Ms. Wooten stated that:  Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy--just about everybody. This is  what she is saying about the doctor.   Project South alleges that a detainee at the facility had talked to  five different women detained between October and December 2019 who had  hysterectomies done. But both the detention facility and the local  hospital have clear evidence directly contradicting this hearsay:  records showing that only two detainees have had hysterectomies since  2017. Let that sink in: Only two since 2017.   How can they claim mass hysterectomies performed by the uterus  collector are true? The simple answer is they are not.   In fact, Project South's attorneys and lead investigator admitted to  The Washington Post that she had not even spoken to or identified a  detainee claiming to have undergone a hysterectomy. The group providing  these claims has no evidence to back them up, but nonetheless, we are  here embracing them and continuing to perpetrate a falsehood. Sounds  like a little bit of another resolution that we are dealing with here  today.   As the facts have come out to disprove these absurd claims, did the  Democrats acknowledge they were wrong? No. There has been no  acknowledgment of their wrong. They conveniently shifted their argument  to uninformed consent and expanded the allegation to medical procedures  generally and the lack of adequate translation services to strengthen  their faulty arguments. But even those failed.   According to the employees at the facility, the center has 24-hour  access to interpreters for virtually every language, which they  consistently utilize. In fact, they even have several remote  interpreters who specialize in relaying medical terms and advice to  non-English speakers.   Clearly, the majority does not care about the credibility of their  witnesses and their whistleblowers. They want the publicity. They want  the political aspect of this because we are coming to the real reason.  As long as they espouse these claims, it allows them to continue their  attack on two places: The President and law enforcement. We have seen  this during the sham impeachment, and we are seeing it here again  today.   The Democrats have already expended a lot of time and effort trying  to make the claim in this complaint true by writing letters to DHS IG  and traveling to Ocilla. In fact, just 2 days after the release of  Project South's complaint, 173 Democrats wrote DHS IG urging an  investigation centering their call almost entirely on Ms. Wooten's  debunked claims of mass hysterectomies.   Madam Speaker, now that is a mass progression to something--173 on a  debunked complaint that has already been done. They have conveniently  failed to update the DHS IG and the American public that their claims  of a eugenics conspiracy in south Georgia have been proven false.   They have also conveniently failed to mention that, according to its  website, Project South is committed to ending the use of local police  to enforce what they characterize as the Federal Government's draconian  and racist immigration policies. Further, the group  [[Page H5131]]  boasts a goal of shutting down immigration centers and is a frequent  user of the hashtag, #abolishICE.   To set the record straight, Representative Austin Scott and I wrote a  letter to the DHS IG to shed light on the developments that followed  Project South's complaint and the group's anti-law enforcement, anti- Trump agenda.                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, in the quest of their further  radical agenda, the left has cast a shadow over an entire town in  Georgia.   This is more than just political fodder here for this floor when the  majority has nothing else to put on this floor and is wasting the  American people's time here. This goes back to disparaging a respected  doctor in the community, an Indian-American immigrant, who provides  free medical services to low-income patients simply for political gain.  The doctor has been viciously slandered by the left's accusation that  he carried out mass hysterectomies.   Frankly, he should sue these organizations.   It is truly sad to see the lengths that the majority is willing to go  to advance their own misguided policies, and they should apologize to  the doctor and to the center.   It is clear to me that Project South has ulterior motives, and it is  dangerous that the majority is permitting the group's complaint to  serve as the foundation of a resolution when so many of the claims have  already failed under scrutiny, and the credibility of the entire  complaint is shattered by Project South's anti-ICE motives.   Despite Democrats' wishes, the American people deserve to know the  truth, and they deserve to see the motives behind the claim. An  investigation is always there; an investigation can start. But it is  pretty amazing that the investigation--173 of my majority colleagues  rushed to sign a letter without even knowing the facts, and especially  because it has salacious details that they could get at ICE and to get  at a system that they don't like, actually protecting the American  public, enforcing our immigration laws.   Project South is an anti-law enforcement organization that has a  stated mission of shutting down detention facilities. They included  patently false claims in a complaint to the DHS IG.   Detention facilities like the Irwin County Detention Center serve an  important purpose in upholding our Nation's immigration laws, and  efforts like this one to disparage them and shut them down by choosing  to ignore facts in favor of fiction is disgraceful, not even meeting  with the hospital administrator.   Again, what are we here for? This is shown to be exactly what it is.  This train is on the tracks. We are putting this up here for political  purposes because, frankly, Madam Speaker, the majority has nothing else  to put up, so let's get a last couple of days in to throw at our  favorite targets: ICE and this administration. And who cares who we  hurt, a hospital, a community, and a doctor who simply was doing his  job.   This is an investigation that needs to happen, and the smear needs to  stop now.
