 Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today to offer my  tribute on behalf of my predecessor, mentor, and most importantly my  friend, the late Congressman Ralph Regula. We not only had the chance  to share the same district but we celebrated the same birthday,  something that always made our connection feel stronger.   Congressman Regula represented the 16th District of Ohio in the  United States House of Representatives from 1973 until his retirement  in 2009. For thirty-six years and eighteen terms, Ralph Regula brought  common-sense, Ohio values to Washington each and every day.   Ralph came to Washington, often in his ubiquitous red pickup truck,  to do a job for the American People. His was an office held in trust  for a time and then relinquished with grace when that season of his  life was over.   Ralph Regula began his career as a teacher and grade school  principal. Throughout his long career in public service he always  encouraged students who approached him to ``Learn something new every  day''. It was more than advice: it was a heartfelt wish that every  young person he met would embrace a lifetime of learning and go on to  become the very best versions of themselves.   As a public servant, Ralph Regula was a thoughtful, conscientious man  of the people. From humble beginnings as village solicitor in Navarre,  Ohio, Ralph brought his experience as an educator to the Ohio Board of  Education, and from there, to the Ohio state house where he served in  the Ohio House of Representatives and the Ohio Senate. In 1972, Ralph  Regula was elected to Congress to represent the 16th District of Ohio,  an office he always said he held in trust for the people he represented  back home in Ohio. His constituents sent him back to Washington  eighteen times, asking for and receiving his best service and judgment  on their behalf in the People's House.   In Congress, Ralph Regula served most of his tenure in the Committee  on Appropriations. Ralph would say he was one of the keepers of  America's checkbook. In that role, Ralph brought his own brand of  fiscal conservatism to bear on the great issues facing the United  States. As chairman of the Committee on Appropriations Interior  subcommittee, Ralph was instrumental in securing the future of Cuyahoga  Valley National Park.   I have no doubt that Ralph Regula will be remembered for many things  during his time in Congress. I think his sense of fairness and his bi- partisan approach to lawmaking will, no doubt, be among the best  attributes recalled by his friends and colleagues. Debate ended at the  doors to the House, but the friendship always endured.   Ralph was foremost, though, a family man. The great love of his life,  Mary, was his partner through thick and thin. Partners in all things,  Ralph and Mary built a life together and raised three wonderful  children: David, Richard and Martha.   In closing, Mr. Speaker let me just say this: It truly was the honor  of a lifetime to know Congressman Ralph Regula and call him my  predecessor, mentor, and my friend. He will be dearly missed by all.                            ____________________
