 Mr. President, before turning to the bipartisan bill that  brings a number of us to the floor this afternoon, we have been  listening to a number of my Republican colleagues throw stones at Build  Back Better, and I would like to simply state for the record that  Democrats are committed to lowering costs for families, such as making  childcare more affordable, and home care for seniors. Democrats are  committed to lowering taxes for people, such as the child tax credit  that, by the way, provides much needed financial support for families,  including for the families of over 200,000 children in Hawaii alone-- all by making the richest people in our country, who got the benefit of  $1.5 trillion in totally unnecessary tax cuts that the Republicans  pushed through--by making the richest people in our country pay for  these much needed programs and actually support American families.   Meanwhile, what are the Republicans doing? Nothing. Zero. Nothing for  American families. So I would like to set the record straight as to who  actually is working hard to help American families, and, believe me, it  is not the Republicans.                  American Innovation and Choice Online Act    Mr. President, turning to the bill that we are talking about today,  today's big tech behemoths like to tout their claimed consumer-focused  approaches--Amazon, with its ability to deliver seemingly any product  to your doorstep within 2 days; Google, with its goal of organizing the  world's information and making it accessible to all; Apple, with its  mission of bringing the best personal computing products and support to  the end user; and Facebook, looking to give users the power to build  communities and bring the world closer together. Each claims that their  success has been the direct result of their consumer focus, that  consumers choose their products and services because they are the best  in class.   That may have been true at some point, but it is certainly not true  today. Today, consumers have no real choice. Amazon, Google, Apple, and  Facebook have become gatekeepers that too often limit, if not outright  squash, competition online. The result is unprecedented market  domination that allows these small handful of giant companies to  influence the choices and actions of literally billions of people every  day.  [[Page S7710]]    Think about how many times each of us goes on Google. Multiply that  by the billions every day. That is the kind of influence these large  companies have.   Take Amazon. Just yesterday, the Judiciary Committee heard from a  small business owner who sells his Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty on  Amazon's dominant online marketplace. He watched as Amazon leveraged  its dominance by using the data it collects from these sales to  introduce a knockoff of his product. This is consistent with reporting  from Reuters and others that Amazon recruits small businesses to its  marketplace and then systematically uses the seller data it collects to  develop competing products and preferences those products by placing  them at the top of its search results.   Google uses similar tactics to preference its own products and  services. The company controls over 90 percent of the search market--90  percent. That might not be such a big deal if Google simply fulfilled  the promise of its cofounder, Larry Page, to ``get you out of Google  and to the right place as fast as possible,'' but that simply isn't the  case anymore. About two-thirds of searches on Google result in zero  clicks; in other words, they start on Google, and they end on Google.  That means, for example, that more and more diners looking for the best  restaurants don't get directed to Yelp, the site Google's own search  criteria identifies as best; rather, they get Google's inferior  reviews. It means that travelers looking for travel deals on the top  tourist attractions don't get sent to Expedia or Tripadvisor; they are  stuck with Google. This is becoming the case for more and more  searches.   Apple, likewise, uses its complete control over the iPhone and IOS  operating system to give its product a leg up. The company has  introduced a number of products, including Apple Music, AirTags, and  others, to compete with third-party products--except it is really no  competition at all because Apple pushes those third parties into its  payment system and then charges a tax of up to 30 percent. Sure,  consumers can still use Spotify or Tile, but they all have to pay more  to do so. In either case, Apple wins.   These companies have made clear time and again that they are not  interested in competing on a level playing field; instead, they are  determined to totally control the playing field. Unless the Federal  Government steps in, they will continue to do whatever it takes to hold  on to their market dominance, competition be damned.   This isn't good for consumers. That is why I cosponsored the American  Innovation and Choice Online Act. The bill will put an end to these  abusive and anti-competitive practices. Among other things, it will  outlaw self-preferencing by the dominant online platforms, prevent  these platforms from using a competitor's data to compete against them,  and ban the biasing of search results to benefit the company's own  products. Unlike the words of the big tech behemoths, the American  Innovation and Choice Online Act isn't an empty promise; it will  actually put consumers first by restoring competition in the online  marketplace.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield to my colleague Senator Blumenthal.
