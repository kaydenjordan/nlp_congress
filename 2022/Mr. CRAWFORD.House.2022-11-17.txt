 Madam Speaker, today, I am here to talk about reopening  the very building in which we stand, the United States Capitol.   It has been 2\1/2\ years since Speaker Pelosi closed the people's  House and told Americans it was part of our united effort to stop  COVID-19. Over the last year, we have seen a sharp decline in  hospitalizations and deaths from COVID. In fact, just 2 months ago,  President Biden even declared the pandemic was over. Yet, certain  protocols remain from the height of the pandemic.   Today, when constituents come to visit my office, they need to be  personally escorted around by staff. They have to be a small group.  They can't go to the House gallery to watch votes take place, and my  staff is only allowed to give a tour once a week.   If the Speaker is really trying to prevent the spread of COVID, why  is she forcing people to gather in large crowds around security  checkpoints?   This is the people's House, yet we continue to deny access to the  people, the very people who elected us to serve them, the very people  whose taxes fund our operations.   Because of these regulations, I have had to turn several of my  constituents away. Not only do these regulations make it difficult to  welcome every group into my office, but it also affects the function of  all House offices.   I have multiple visitors a day, and each time they come in, I have to  send one of my staffers to find that visitor in a crowd of people, wait  in a long security line, and then escort them through the House office  buildings. It is inefficient and takes staff away from the valuable  work they should be doing on behalf of the people of Arkansas.   To top it all off, none of this makes any sense. Why does one of my  staffers need to escort someone who has already been cleared by  security into the building? How does this protect against COVID-19?  What is so dangerous about allowing visitors the ability to watch their  government function? How can we claim to be a transparent government  when we prohibit access to their elected officials?   It is far past time to truly open up the Capitol to the people and  restore its operation to prepandemic times. We cannot afford to keep  distance between the American people and their elected Representatives.    These regulations prevent constituents from freely visiting their  Representatives and hinder productivity in our offices, and none of it  makes us any safer.   The people are an important part of the legislative process. In fact,  they are the reason for it. Madam Speaker, they should be welcomed  here.                            ____________________
