 Madam Speaker, thank you to my colleague,  Congresswoman Meng, for her tireless efforts in combating hate crimes  during the COVID-19 pandemic and championing this legislation. Thank  you, Madam Speaker, for your extraordinary leadership as well.   In the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only been a  significant threat to public health; in some instances, it has brought  out the worst impulses in people. Since the start of the pandemic,  there has been a spike in hate crimes and acts of hate against Asian  Americans, with thousands of reported hate incidents across this  country. Asian Americans have been verbally accosted and frequently  told to go back where they came from. Countless Asian Americans have  been pushed to the ground, shoved, punched, beaten, and struck with  weapons all across our country. We are still mourning the eight victims  shot in an Atlanta spa in March, six of whom were of Asian descent.   Asian Americans are being scapegoated for the ongoing health crisis.  It is disgraceful, and we must act.   By passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, we are sending a message  that hatred and bigotry have no place in the United States of America.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  1415
