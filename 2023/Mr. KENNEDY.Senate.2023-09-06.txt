 Mr. President, I am going to talk for a few minutes  about NATO, but before I do that, I want to make two preliminary  points.   I believe that America's aid to Ukraine is not charity. I believe  that aid is in America's national security interest, and I have voted  accordingly.   I am convinced that Vladimir Putin, President Xi Jinping, and the  Ayatollah of Iran are working together. I am convinced that their  objective is to have Russia dominate Central and Eastern Europe; the  Ayatollah from Iran dominate the Middle East; and China, through  President Xi, dominate the Indo-Pacific, Sub-Sahara Africa, and South  America. That is not a world that is safe for the United States of  America. That certainly isn't a world that is safe for democracy. That  is point one.   Point two, I have been sorely disappointed at the refusal of the U.S.  Senate to appoint or to pass a bill that would allow the President to  appoint--confirmed by the U.S. Senate--a special inspector general to  follow the money in Ukraine.   Once again, I have voted to send that money to Ukraine not as an act  of charity but because I believe it is in America's national security  interest. But that money didn't just fall from Heaven. That money that  we sent to Ukraine--we thank Heaven for it, but it came out of the  pockets of the American taxpayer. I understand that we have an  inspector general from the Department of Defense following the money,  and I don't mean to be overtly critical.   I would point out as an aside that I find it somewhat ironic that the  Department of Defense inspector general says ``We have got this,'' but  yet the Department of Defense has never been audited. Ever. Never. The  Department  [[Page S4234]]  of Defense is the only Agency in the U.S. Government that has never  been audited, and the American people know that.   That is why I and a number of my colleagues have asked this Senate to  pass a bill to allow the President to pick a special inspector general  of his choosing to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate to follow every  single dollar we are sending to Ukraine and to answer to the Members of  the Senate, Members of the House, and, most importantly, to the  American people.   Many Republicans and many Democrats have supported that effort, but  many Democrats and many Republicans on both sides of the aisle have  refused. Now, I am going to keep trying, but, as I said, this money  didn't just fall from Heaven; it came out of people's pockets.   (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)                                     NATO     Madam President, a word about NATO. For the past 18  months, the United States and our NATO allies have worked together to  support our Ukrainian friends as they push back against Russian  President Vladimir Putin's violent attack on their sovereignty.   Putin's war in Ukraine is illegal, and it has presented one of the  most serious challenges that NATO--the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization--has faced in decades. As with many challenges in life, I  believe that the difficulties we face today can make NATO stronger  tomorrow. I believe that. But that will only happen if we are honest  with each other. Friends tell friends the truth. Friends tell friends  the truth.   Here is the truth as I see it: NATO is one of the most impactful  defense PACs in all of human history. The United States is a proud NATO  member. The American people support NATO. But it is also no secret that  some of our friends in NATO have not been taking their own defense and  defense spending seriously, and they had not been taking their own  defense and defense spending seriously even before Vladimir Putin began  his illegal assault on Ukraine.   As the full extent of Putin's cruelty unfolded last year, NATO  leaders--they appeared at first to regard it as a wake-up call, and  that is a good thing. It was a wake-up call for many people throughout  the world. But sometime, somehow, over the past year, those same  countries fell back asleep.    You see, when Putin began his march into Ukraine, key NATO leaders  said that they would start spending 2 percent of their gross domestic  product on defense. That is a promise that they had made before but had  reneged on until Putin's assault. But it took less than a year after  Putin entered Ukraine for those same leaders to begin to renege again,  and that is just a fact. Friends tell friends the truth. Recent  analysis shows that as of today, just 11 out of the 31 countries  currently in NATO are on track to fulfill their 2 percent defense  spending obligation.   Now, this is becoming a frustrating pattern for some of our NATO  allies. As a smart person once said, history doesn't repeat itself, but  sometimes it rhymes, and that is the case here. If you take a look at  NATO today and compare it to NATO in 2014, it, frankly, would make  Michael Avenatti blush.   Let me paint the picture for you. NATO countries first agreed to  spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense in 2006. The  2 percent figure was designed, as the Presiding Officer knows, to be a  floor, not a ceiling. And this didn't mean--this promise made by all  NATO countries in 2006--this didn't mean that each country was required  to cut a check to NATO. That is not what it meant. It just meant that  each country would spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on  itself--on itself--in its own military and in its own national  security. Why? Because all NATO countries understood then that our  alliance was stronger when everyone pulled their weight.   Now, we know a lot of what has happened since then. The world economy  sank into a recession in 2008. We all felt the brunt of that, including  the American people. But for some of our friends in NATO, that 2  percent commitment fell apart. After the great recession, as we call  it, just three NATO members--three--fulfilled their promise to invest 2  percent or more in defense. Do you know who took note? Vladimir Putin.   In 2014--fast-forward a few years--Putin invaded Ukraine's Crimean  Peninsula. Putin made it clear that he intended to take that key block  of land on the Black Sea and make it his own, and he did. This was a  blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. It was an unmistakable  foreshadowing as well of what would come.   Now, Putin's aggression outraged NATO. It should have. It outraged  all fairminded, freedom-loving people. At a conference that year, 2014,  in Wales, each member country of NATO reaffirmed their commitment to  spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024.   At the time, President Obama was President. In a speech at the  conference in Wales where each country pledged to spend 2 percent--the  second time it made the pledge--President Obama said:         [T]his commitment makes clear that NATO will not be       complacent.    I remember when the President said that.   President Obama also said:         Our Alliance will reverse the decline in defense spending       and rise to meet the challenges that we face in the 21st       century.    He later added:         Here in Wales, we also sent a strong message to Russia that       actions have consequences.    Well, that turned out to be debatable. By 2021, just a few years  later, only seven NATO members were spending the minimum 2 percent on  defense, and that is just a fact. Friends tell friends the truth. In  fact, President Trump was met with scorn when he asked our friends in  NATO to keep their word and reinvest in defense. Germany's Foreign  Minister, Heiko Maas, said:         Our common response today to the President of the United       States and his assertion of ``America First'' must be       ``Europe United.''    Apparently, Germany and others felt that upholding their pledge to  spend 2 percent on their own defense was somehow an ``America First''  policy. And do you know who took note? Vladimir Putin.   Flash-forward to 2022. Putin's tanks are rolling farther into  Ukraine. And just like in 2014, our NATO friends issued statements a  third time once again pledging to spend 2 percent of their gross  domestic product on their own security. Yet, today, despite Putin's  ongoing attack on Ukraine, today, some of our friends in NATO have  already stopped or postponed their 2 percent spending plans, and that  is just a fact. Friends tell friends the truth.   French President Macron, for example, promised to increase France's  defense spending in the days following Putin's invasion. I remember  when he made that promise. But French officials have also announced  that it will take until 2025 to hit the 2 percent defense spending  threshold. Similarly, Italy announced it would not hit 2 percent until  2028. Spain said it won't hit its 2 percent goal until 2029. Belgium  said it won't hit its 2 percent goal until 2035.    The war is going on.   To be fair, Belgium and Spain, both good friends of America, have  made some small progress in their defense spending over the past year.  I want to make that clear. They may come through eventually. But  France's spending has hardly changed at all, and Italy will actually  spend less on defense this year, in the middle of the war which is  happening in Europe, than it did in 2021, before Putin even entered  Ukraine.   Germany's failure to follow through on its 2 percent commitment is  especially disappointing and consequential. As the world's fourth  largest economy--Germany is the world's fourth largest economy behind  only the United States of America, China, and Japan, the world's fourth  largest economy. So Germany's defense spending shortfall, and it is a  shortfall, leaves a much bigger hole. We are talking about a lot of  money. Germany will only spend 1.6 percent of its GDP on defense in  2023. That is $18.1 billion short of the commitment that it has made  not once, not twice, but three times.   Now, NATO is an alliance. It means we are friends, and we are. It  means we know that we are stronger together. It means that if you come  for one of us, you are going to have to fight all of us. That is what  it means.  [[Page S4235]]    At the end of the day, an alliance, though, is just a promise. That  is all it is, but it is built on mutual trust. It states that we won't  leave each other to fight threats alone, and that is what NATO is  supposed to stand for and I am very proud of that and so are the  American people. We support NATO.   But when countries in NATO choose not to keep their commitment to  spend 2 percent on their own defense, they weaken the alliance of NATO.  It shows us and it shows our enemies that we cannot count on those  countries to step up to help keep all of us safe. And it tells Putin-- it tells Putin that some NATO members are content sitting back and  waiting, rather than remaining strong together, and that is just a  fact. Friends tell friends the truth.   Now, the United States of America, we keep our promises. And all  along, every year through the history of NATO, we have proudly invested  in our defense to the benefit of our allies--to our own benefit but to  the benefit of our allies. And it was important to our allies in  Europe. It was.   I don't know what would have happened in Europe had the American  people not come to Ukraine's rescue. Putin may be in Paris right now,  for all I know, God forbid.   Now, a few of our NATO friends have kept their commitment, and I want  to thank them. Our friends in Greece, for example, our friends in the  United Kingdom, our friends in Estonia, they spent 2 percent of their  GDP on defense before Putin invaded. Our friends in Lithuania and in  Hungary and Romania and Slovakia, they will all reach the 2-percent  threshold by the end of this year. And that is a good thing. Thank you,  Greece. Thank you, United Kingdom. Thank you, Estonia. Thank you,  Lithuania and Hungary and Romania and Slovakia, for keeping your word.   Now, Finland--Finland just joined NATO. We are so pleased. Our  friends in Finland spent 2 percent on defense before joining NATO, but  they didn't use the alliance as a reason for taking their foot off the  gas. Instead, Finland increased their defense spending even more to 2.4  percent of GDP. Thank you, Finland. I hope our allies, which have been  nestled safely under the NATO umbrella for years without pulling their  financial weight, will take note of Finland's dedication.   Let me say it again: Thank you, Finland.   And we have got to commend Poland. Poland spent 2 percent on defense  long before Putin invaded Ukraine, but over the past 2 years, it hasn't  spent 2 percent--Poland hasn't. It nearly doubled its defense spending  to 4.3 percent. It is investing that money, in part, by buying American  weapons, and it is showing Putin that Poland is serious about its  sovereignty and that Poland is serious about freedom. By the end of  this decade, Poland is on pace to have more tanks than the United  Kingdom, than Germany, than France, than the Netherlands, than Belgium  and Italy put together--put together. Thank you, Poland.   Now, I understand you don't have to be Mensa material to understand  that Putin's threat is more visceral when it is happening next door,  and of course Poland is much closer to Russia than Germany or France  is. I get that. But when you are allies, when you are friends, when you  have promised not once, not twice, but three times to have each other's  backs, you are not only supposed to think of yourself and your  proximity to the threat.   You know, as Americans, we have got an entire ocean between us and  Russia. We have got an entire ocean as our buffer against Putin's  tanks. But I doubt that Germany or France--both good friends, love them  to death--but I doubt that Germany or France would support the United  States backing away because we aren't close enough to the shelling to  be bothered.   Let me be frank. Allies through NATO have pledged to have each  other's backs, and I see no sense in bubble-wrapping it. That starts by  putting your money where your mouth is.   I want to be frank again. Some of our friends in NATO have engaged in  a cycle of broken promises time and time and time again. Putin shows  his cruel aggression, and horrified European leaders pledged to invest  in defense. Then Putin's aggression maybe falls off the front page of  the paper, and leaders forget their promise to invest until Putin's  rockets start blowing up another city.   It has been more than a year, as the Presiding Officer knows as well  as I do, since Putin sent Russian tanks and troops into Ukraine. And  maybe for some the horror of it all has worn off, maybe. It hasn't worn  off for most Americans, and it sure hasn't worn off for Ukraine.  Citizens of a sovereign Ukraine are still dodging missiles on their own  streets, and Putin is still watching too many NATO members bury their  heads and drag their feet. And so is President Xi Jinping.   Now, I don't mean to offend anyone--I don't--but friends tell friends  the truth, and everyone in NATO is a friend. And I am so proud that the  United States of America is a member of NATO. But NATO is only as  strong as our confidence in one another. If we want to strengthen  NATO's ability to deter bad actors from bad acts, we have each got to  do our part. It is time for all of us in NATO to start keeping our  promises and investing in our defense.   The American people have sent over $100 billion to fight Putin in  Ukraine, and I don't regret a single penny. We kept our word. But,  again, friends tell friends the truth: Not all of our allies in NATO  have, and it is time they put their money where their mouth is.                            ____________________
