 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I stand in strong support of Representative Lee's resolution to  repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq.   The Constitution is unambiguous; it is clear: Congress has the power  to authorize war.   In 2002, Congress passed an Authorization for Use of Military Force  to address the ongoing threat from Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq to  this country.   With the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by U.S. military forces and the  establishment of a new Iraqi Government, this AUMF became obsolete; but  we continued, Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents, to use  the Authorization for Use of Military Force ongoing, as if the same  conditions existed then.   If there is a need for the authorization for the use of military  force against any threat, we should bring it up and have a full and  fair and open debate on what that threat is constituted of and, as a  Congress, exercise that constitutional authority to declare war.   This language does not prevent a President from defending America.  Don't let anyone tell you that.   It is important that we exercise our constitutional role.                                time  1145
