 Madam Speaker, first, let me associate myself  with the gentleman from Texas and his fine remarks about the strengths  of this country and how this country has led the world in every way and  is the envy of the world. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  inspirational remarks on this House floor.   Madam Speaker, I look forward, too, with optimism to the 116th  Congress. I refuse to be pulled down by the vortex of negativism and  profanity that is engulfing social media and cable television  programming. Instead, I am  [[Page H298]]  grateful for the opportunity to work to pursue policies that improve  our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I spent my first two terms in Congress building  relationships with my colleagues, in both the House and the Senate and  in both political parties. I have done this based on my experiences  that I had in the 1980s as a staffer on the Senate Banking Committee,  as well as my 4 years of service in the executive branch in the  administration of President George H.W. Bush.   I value political leaders reasoning together to find common ground to  tackle our Nation's policy challenges, large and small.   In this context, I host periodic, bipartisan dinners. I call these  the ``Longworth-Garner Dinners,'' so named for Nick Longworth from  Cincinnati, Ohio, Speaker of the House from 1925 to his untimely death  in 1931, and his great friend, Congressman Jack Garner from Uvalde,  Texas, minority leader much of the time when his friend Nick was  Speaker.   These two men could not have been more different. Longworth was from  a patrician family who settled in Cincinnati in the early 19th century,  and he was married to Teddy Roosevelt's oldest daughter, Alice.   ``Cactus Jack'' Garner was a rough-and-tumble small-town lawyer from  Uvalde who rose to be a successful county judge and then became a  terrifically successful Member of the U.S. House. As Garner put it, ``I  was the heathen, and Nick was the aristocrat.''   Longworth and Garner came to Congress at the same time in 1902. Both  served with distinction; both rose to the top of their political  parties; and both were terrific friends.   When Longworth was sworn into speakership for the last time in April  of 1929, he paid tribute to his friend, the minority leader and future  Speaker, by saying: ``The gentleman from Texas and I entered Congress  together 26 years ago. That he is a better man than I, in the  estimation of his constituents, is made clear by the fact that his  service has been continuous, whereas mine was interrupted by a vacation  of 2 years, by no means of my own motion. During all these years, our  friendship has been continuously abiding, and our affection, esteem,  and respect, the one for the other, is and has been, I am proud to say,  mutual.''    For his part, on the untimely death of Longworth in 1931, Garner, who  did become Speaker, said: ``He was an aristocrat; I am a plebeian.  Perhaps . . . our different rearing intensified our interest in each  other. I have lost one of the best friends of a lifetime, the country a  good citizen, and the Congress a most valued legislator.''   It was ``Cactus Jack'' and Nick who cooked up the tradition in room  H-128 of the U.S. Capitol. Each afternoon, no matter how much fighting  took place on the floor of the U.S. House, they retreated to H-128,  which they nicknamed the ``Bureau of Education,'' to have a drink and  ``strike a blow for liberty.''   Room H-128 went on to even greater fame, as longtime Speaker Sam  Rayburn from Texas continued this tradition that he had witnessed as a  young Member.   The purpose of my Longworth-Garner Dinners is to get to know each  other, to understand what our goals and objectives are for our  constituents and how we can work effectively together on the House  Financial Services Committee.   Madam Speaker, I will continue the tradition of Longworth and Garner  in the 116th Congress. I look forward to working hand-in-hand and  shoulder-to-shoulder with my colleagues in both parties and on both  sides of the U.S. Capitol to move this country forward and seek a  better Nation through our partnership.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to again add my  congratulations to the incoming chairwoman of the House Financial  Services Committee. I look forward to working with her and our  committee in the 116th Congress.   But like my friend from Georgia and my friend from North Carolina,  this bill is not a constructive effort today, Mr. Speaker. We voted on  this bill last week. The McConnell Senate is not going to take it up.  It is not going to produce our government reopening. It is not helping  the government get reopened to put people back to work doing the  people's work.   So this is really a waste of our time to be on the floor today. We  should be putting that emphasis on a bipartisan effort to get  Democratic leadership in the House and Senate working with the  President on a solution to a comprehensive border security plan and  reopen this government.   I want to also thank my friend for letting me talk about the  insufficiency of the Senate bill, as it does not contain our bipartisan  provisions, 20 provisions this House approved, that we worked on on a  bipartisan basis, that will improve access to capital across this  country for small businesses, for our capital markets, and will lower  the cost and make more transparent home buying.   Two things in particular I worked on with my friend, Bill Foster,  from Illinois. The Volcker Rule Regulatory Harmonization Act, which we  passed in this House, was not included in the Senate provision; and a  provision to make insurance disclosures more transparent and more  accurate for consumers for home mortgages, which was also passed,  strongly bipartisan, by our committee and by this House was originally  in our proposal, and it is not in the Senate bill, Mr. Speaker.   Therefore, let's say to the American people, the bill we have on the  floor today is not going to result in the government reopening; it is  not going to be voted on in the Senate; it is not going to be approved  by President Trump; and it is deficient. It does not include the  bipartisan priorities in financial services ably included in the House  version by Mr. Graves.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Graves for his leadership.
