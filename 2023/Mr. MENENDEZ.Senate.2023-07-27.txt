 Mr. President, that only means I got there before you.   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Kennedy's amendment. I  have a great deal of respect for my colleague. No one--no one--in this  Chamber has taken a harder line against the Iranian regime than I have.  No one. But in this case, a well-intended motion can produce very bad  consequences. So let me speak to why I oppose the Senator's amendment.   These special drawing rights--I always love how my colleague from  Louisiana can bring it to an earthy tone. We have poker chips we are  throwing around, but these aren't quite poker chips; they are a  critical liquidity tool to support lower income countries in response  to global financial youcrises. It is in our interest to do so, to  create stability. They assist in creating economic stability. They are  an absolutely essential part of U.S. foreign policy tools, especially  as we are dealing with the China challenge. We want to help these  countries instead of China helping them.   The Biden administration supported a new round of special drawing  rights allocations at the IMF. This funding played an essential role in  helping countries address the COVID-19 pandemic and the related  economic fallout of the pandemic, which we are still hearing about from  many of these countries. Without this funding, many of these countries  would have fallen to economic crisis, which means political  instability, which means chaos, which means refugees coming to the  shores of many countries.   The International Monetary Fund's rules dictate that a new general  issuance of special drawing rights must go to all members. That means a  requirement to prohibit SDRs for one country would prohibit SDRs for  all countries. As a consequence, Senator Kennedy's amendment would  effectively kill the possibility of issuing SDRs to any country ever  again.   Now, Senator Kennedy offered the same exact amendment with the  Endless Frontier Act on the floor in May of 2021. That amendment failed  by a significant vote.   Of course we oppose those state sponsors of terrorism. Of course, we  oppose those who would be responsible for genocide.    But I would note that most of our adversaries the Senator wants to  pursue--which I would agree if we could do it antiseptically, but we  can't--already face obstacles to drawing special drawing rights because  of the sanctions that we have against them.   So due to the harmful impact this amendment would have on the  Treasury Department's ability to respond to deficit in the global  supply of reserves on a global crisis, I would vote no and I would  recommend my colleagues do so, as well.   I reserve the balance of my time.    If we were talking about poker chips, I would be all in  with Senator Kennedy. But what we are talking about is the ability to  prevent a crisis in the world. That is something we can use. That is  why the Senator's amendment needs to fail.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1034     Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 638 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask that there be unanimous consent  for 3 minutes, equally divided.    Mr. President, this amendment is to reauthorize the  Firefighter Cancer Registry, which was passed unanimously by Congress  and signed into law in 2018.   The Firefighter Cancer Registry improves our Nation's ability to  conduct research and gather data on the cancer risk associated with  firefighting. It is a vital program, one that furthers our  understanding of how to protect the brave first responders who run  toward danger when everyone else runs away from it. And yet, on October  1 of last year, the program expired.   My bipartisan, commonsense amendment would reauthorize the program  for an additional 5 years while bringing it into line with the current  appropriation level.   Supported by Senators Murkowski, Brown, Klobuchar, Fischer, Rubio,  and Tester, it would benefit both career firefighters as well as  volunteers like my constituent Edward Diaz. He was the son of Eduardo  Diaz, a North Bergen firefighter who tragically passed away in 2017  from pancreatic cancer. Today, he carries on his family's legacy of  service as a volunteer firefighter in Hasbrouck Heights, NJ.   I submit to my colleagues, the Diaz family, along with their fellow  brothers and sisters in the profession, are the reason we should all  support this amendment today. Firefighting is more than a job. It is a  calling, a calling that sometimes takes your life as we saw in the loss  of two Newark firefighters within the last month.   Let's honor that calling by reauthorizing the Firefighter Cancer  Registry Act with this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it  and reserve the balance of my time.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 638     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, as a strong supporter of U.S. assistance  to Ukraine, I am keenly aware of the important role that appropriate  and effective oversight plays in ensuring that support can continue. I  support independent, effective oversight and believe we should be doing  all that we can to make sure those oversight mechanisms are strong and  that our inspectors general have the resources they need to carry out  their work.   But given that we have an existing framework, given that there are  three inspectors general who have been working day in and out,  effectively, to conduct such oversight, I do not think we should create  new offices and additional layers without evidence that the current  framework is not working. So while I appreciate that my colleagues  share the same goals of ensuring we have robust oversight of U.S.  assistance to Ukraine, I do not agree that these amendments are the  best way to achieve that goal.   The Wicker amendment would create a new office that could impede the  work that is ongoing, not enhance it. There is an existing statutory  framework for designating a lead inspector general. I have not heard a  good case for why that framework should not be used here.   The inspectors general from the Department of State, USAID, and  Department of Defense have been on the ground in Ukraine, conducting  work of virtually all U.S. assistance involving multiple Agencies. They  have an established working group that ensures oversight is efficient  and not duplicative. Creating a new office, with the need for new staff  and potentially conflicting roles, would likely make those efforts  less, not more, efficient.   The Paul amendment would add further and unnecessary complexity to  ongoing oversight efforts. It would likely impair ongoing oversight by  drawing personnel away from the inspectors general already engaged in  oversight work. Instead of ramping up current efforts, inspectors  general would spend time deconflicting or sorting out personnel issues.  It is also unclear how an expanded Special Inspector General for  Afghanistan Reconstruction--SIGAR--would successfully pivot to  oversight of Ukraine assistance or how it would an expanded mandate  would be funded.   I am committed to ensuring that we have robust, independent,  effective oversight of all U.S. assistance to Ukraine. But the answer  to ensuring that we have successful mechanisms for such oversight is  not to create new structures and additional layers of bureaucracy. It  is to make sure those who already have the tools, expertise, and  resources to conduct oversight and audit spending, have sufficient  resources to do so, and for us to hold them to account. That is  precisely what I intend to do, and I call on my colleagues in this body  to do the same.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent  [[Page S3742]]  to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                    Romania--Assault Amphibious Vehicles         The Government of Romania has requested to buy sixteen (16)       Assault Amphibious Vehicles (AAVs), Personnel Variant (AAVP-      7A1); three (3) Assault Amphibious Vehicles, Command Variant       (AAVC-7Al); two (2) Assault Amphibious Vehicles, Recovery       Variant (AAVR-7Al); sixteen (16) 50 Cal Machine Guns (Heavy       Barrel); and five (5) 7.62 mm M240B Machine Guns. Also       included are MK-19 Grenade Launchers; M36E T1 Thermal       Sighting Systems (TSS); supply support (spare parts); support       equipment (including special mission kits/Enhanced Applique       Kits (EAAK)); training, unclassified technical manuals,       technical data package, engineering and technical support and       assistance (including Contractor Engineering Technical       Services (CETS)); and other related elements of program and       logistics support. The total estimated program cost is $120.5       million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) Ally which is an important force for       political and economic stability in Europe. It is vital to       the U.S. national interest to assist Romania in developing       and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Romania's capability to meet       current and future threats by modernizing and ensuring       Romania's continued expeditionary capability to counter       regional threats. Romania will have no difficulty absorbing       this equipment and services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        A principal contractor has not been determined for       potential sale. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government personnel but will require the       assignment of one (1) contractor representative to Romania       for approximately one (1) year to deliver AAVs, related       equipment, and support.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-54       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The mission of the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) is       to maneuver surface assault elements of the landing force and       their equipment from assault shipping during amphibious       operations to inland objectives and to conduct mechanized       operations and related combat support in subsequent       operations ashore.        a. The AAV-7A1 family of vehicles includes the personnel       variant, which carries troops in amphibious operations from       ship to shore, through the surf zone, and to inland       objectives. The AAVP-7Al provides protected transport of up       to 25 combat-loaded personnel through all types of terrain.        b. The Command Variant, AAVC-7Al, is an armored assault       amphibious full-tracked landing vehicle. The vehicle provides       a mobile task force communication center in amphibious       operations from ship to shore through surf zone to inland       objectives.        c. The Recovery Variant, AAVR-7A1, is an armored assault       amphibious full-tracked vehicle. The vehicle is designed to       recover similar or smaller size vehicles. It also carries       basic maintenance equipment to provide field support       maintenance to vehicles in the field.        d. The 50 Cal Machine Gun (Heavy Barrel) is the standard       weapon for the AAVP-7A1.        e. The 7.62 mm M240B Machine Gun is the standard weapon for       the AAVC-7Al and the AAVR-7Al.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Romania can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign pc,Hcy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Romania.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  tireless efforts of one man to protect and defend the beating heart of  the American economy: our manufacturing industry. Over a long career of  service, Mr. John W. Kennedy of Madison, NJ, has advocated for greater  prosperity and economic security in the Garden State. In particular, I  want to thank Mr. Kennedy's outstanding work at the New Jersey  Manufacturing Extension Program, or NJMEP.   Since 2012, Mr. Kennedy has led NJMEP, first as chief operating  officer and then as chief executive officer, working to advance their  mission of providing U.S. manufacturers with the resources they need to  succeed. Supported by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, NJMEP has spread innovative technologies and best practices  across New Jersey, boosting operational excellence, innovation and  growth, and workforce development.   Studies have shown that for every dollar invested into NJMEP, they  have in turn generated over $13 of added value. This remarkable return  on investment goes hand in hand with the mission-oriented focus of the  program which seeks to serve those who serve others. Today, Garden  State residents can thank NJMEP for creating hundreds of thousands of  highly skilled manufacturing jobs and contributing more than $7 billion  in economic value.   Make no mistake, NJMEP has been able to succeed thanks to Mr.  Kennedy's shining leadership. When his colleagues speak of him, the  first thing they mention is his signature emails fired off every  morning at 5:30 AM. This unflagging work ethic and unbridled passion  for improving the lives of those around him is an inspiration to us  all. He is the reason that NJMEP was able to grow from a 12-person  operation to a well-oiled machine of more than 50 employees,  catapulting it as the top-rated manufacturing extension program in the  country.   Three years ago, when the first COVID wave reached our shores, John  [[Page S3748]]  and NJMEP were swift in identifying critical actions that governments  could take to shield manufacturers from bearing the brunt of the  impact. Whether it was prioritizing the health and equipment needs of  frontline workers or advocating for manufacturers to be properly deemed  as essential businesses, John's expertise and decisive leadership was  invaluable.   In a similar way, Mr. Kennedy was immensely involved when Congress  was drafting the CHIPS and Science Act last year. He provided strategic  clarity about how to best protect and secure our domestic and  international supply chains, the lifeblood of our Nation's economy.  Thanks to him and his insightful recommendations, we included  provisions in the bill that established a National Supply Chain  Database, a landmark program that accurately tracks American  manufacturing capabilities and inventories in real time. Because of  John, our economy is now more secure against not only global pandemics,  but also natural disasters, cyberattacks, foreign adversaries, and a  myriad of other threats.   Beyond his professional career, Mr. Kennedy takes time to give back  to the community. Prior to serving at NJMEP, he founded and sold two  manufacturing businesses which provided him firsthand knowledge of the  sector. He has also served on the local and national executive board  for the Boy Scouts, the New Jersey Special Olympics, and the board of  directors of the Park Avenue Club Foundation.   Today, I join his loving wife Cecelia, their son Sean, and all New  Jerseyans in congratulating Mr. John W. Kennedy on his storied career  and selfless service. Thanks to his dedicated leadership, not only has  our economy created untold prosperity, we have also secured that  prosperity for future generations. He is a shining example of why  ``Made in the USA'' and ``Made in New Jersey'' are the best labels in  the world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to  recognize and celebrate Mrs. Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, an exemplary leader  in New Jersey and a lifelong advocate for social and economic justice.   Born and raised in Bradley Beach, Mrs. Salowe-Kaye graduated from  Asbury Park High School and received her bachelor of arts in education  from Boston University. In college, she began staging her first  political actions: demonstrating against the Vietnam war and starting a  ``food fight'' to protest poor cafeteria options. After earning her  diploma, Phyllis began a teaching career in the city of Newark,  ultimately rising to become a leader in the Newark Teachers Union.   It was in this role advocating for better conditions on behalf of her  fellow educators that a fire was lit inside her. After nearly a decade  as an elementary school teacher, she transitioned to organizing for  more affordable housing. First as president of the tenant association  in her building, then with the local tenants association in the city of  Orange, and finally as head of the New Jersey Tenants Organization,  Mrs, Salowe-Kaye's commitment to social activism and public advocacy  was formed.   For the last 35 years, Mrs. Salowe-Kaye has capably led New Jersey  Citizen Action--NJCA--the Garden State's largest and oldest multi-issue  nonprofit organization. As a champion for fairness and justice, she has  brought to the forefront many of the quality-of-life issues that are  most important to New Jersey's residents. From healthcare to housing,  environmental protections to a living wage, Mrs. Salowe-Kaye has  consistently marshalled the full force of her organization's 60,000  members to move the needle on issues and push our State forward.   Of her many crowning achievements, she has successfully leveraged the  Federal Community Reinvestment Act to secure more than $30 billion in  commitments from local banks. These commitments have opened doors of  opportunities for thousands of low-income families, women, and  minorities who have been able to access financial tools including  housing counseling, affordable mortgages, and more.   In addition to her public advocacy and leadership in civil society,  Mrs. Salowe-Kaye has sat on too many councils, boards, and task forces  to list. However, among other roles, she has proudly served as a  trustee of the Teacher's Pension and Annuity Fund, a commissioner for  New Jersey's Public Broadcasting Authority, and a member of the Federal  Reserve Community Advisory Council during the Obama administration.   In 2012, I was honored to recognize her work by presenting her with a  Trailblazer Award at my annual Women's History Month celebration. Since  then, not only has she continued to demonstrate visionary leadership,  genuine care, and selfless commitment, she has also grown the reach and  influence of New Jersey Citizen Action. For this and for all she has  done to distinguish herself as a passionate leader, I am honored to  recognize her with these remarks which will live on forever in the  Congressional Record.   Today, I join her loving husband of 47 years, Mr. Stewart Kaplowitz;  her children Joanna and Zachary; and her three grandchildren in  thanking Mrs. Phyllis Salowe-Kaye for her lifelong service as a  community leader who has never stopped fighting for a better New Jersey  for all.                            ____________________
