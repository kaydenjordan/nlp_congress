 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   Defense Security,                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION       United Kingdom--Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) Follow-On Support         The Government of the United Kingdom (UK) has requested to       buy follow-on support for all three segments of the United       Kingdom's Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS). This includes the All       Up Round (AUR), Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System       (TTWCS) and Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC). The       support includes recertification of the UK's missiles;       unscheduled missile maintenance; spares; procurement;       training; in-service support; software; hardware;       communication equipment; operational flight test; engineering       and technical expertise to maintain the TWS capability; and       other related elements of logistical and program support. The       total estimated program cost is $368.53 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally that is a force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale will sustain the operating capability of       the United Kingdom, ensuring maritime forces'       interoperability with United States and other allied forces       as well as their ability to contribute to missions of mutual       interest by delivering follow-on support and sustainment. By       deploying the Tomahawk Weapon system, the United Kingdom       contributes to global readiness and enhances the capability       for the U.S. forces operating globally alongside them. The       United Kingdom already operates this capability, and will       have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed       forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Raytheon Missiles and Defense,       Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple       trips by U.S. Government representatives and the assignment       of contractor representatives to United Kingdom on an       intermittent basis over the life of the case to support       delivery and integration of items and to provide supply       support management, inventory control and equipment       familiarization. There will be one (1) U.S. Government       representative and three (3) U.S. contractor representatives       in the UK full-time for the duration of the case.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
