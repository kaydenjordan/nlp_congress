 Madam Speaker, the impeachment inquiry being led by the  House Democrats is a sham process. Over the last 3 weeks, we have seen  a stunning lack of transparency, the failure to provide basic due  process rights to the President, the selective leaking of testimony and  information, and Members of Congress being refused entry to the closed- door hearings.   I was even denied this week the opportunity to review the Volker  testimony, despite being on one of the committees responsible for fact  finding in this nontransparent inquiry.   Since day one, Democrats in this Chamber have been attempting to  overturn the results of the 2016 election by any means necessary. They  have been so focused on impeachment, that recently it seems like this  Chamber, Democrats' friends in the news, and pundits cannot focus on  anything else.   As Democrats continue to focus on keeping the curtain closed on these  proceedings to the public, the minority and the President, the American  people are left to suffer without passage of the USMCA, bipartisan  prescription drug reform, and border security measures.   The people in my district, both Republicans and Democrats, have  repeatedly told me they are sick and tired of this nontransparent  inquiry, and the fact that Congress fails to do anything other than  focus on tearing down the duly-elected President.   It is time to stop this nonsense. It is time to stop the madness. It  is time to stop the opaque inquiry for the benefit of the American  people.                            ____________________
