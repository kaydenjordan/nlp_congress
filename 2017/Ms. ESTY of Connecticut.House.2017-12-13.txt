 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of tonight's  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, December 14, marks  the 5-year anniversary of the horrific school shooting in the home  community of Sandy Hook Elementary School.   That day shocked the Nation. Twenty schoolchildren and six  educators--20 6-year-olds and 7-year-olds--were ripped from the  community of Newtown and from the United States.   I remember that day. I was a newly elected Member of Congress  learning about what it means to serve in this  [[Page H9892]]  august body. I was with about 40 or 50 of my colleagues learning about  our duties when I started to get emails and text messages that  something terrible had happened at home. By noon, I learned the worst.  Dozens of children had been gunned down, in cold blood, along with  their teachers.   I threw my things in the back of the car and I drove from Boston. I  called my mother, I called my minister, and I prayed for wisdom and I  prayed for guidance and the courage to face those families.   I arrived in Newtown while families were being notified that their  children who they had put on the bus that morning, thinking about  Hanukkah or Christmas or thinking about the snow that was already on  the ground, would never come home.   It is sad. It is sad and it is inexcusable that I stand here 5 years  later. In that time, this Chamber, the people's House, has not taken up  the people's business.   As of this fall, in fact, over 90 percent of Americans still support  having universal background checks on all gun sales to keep guns out of  the hands of dangerous people. Over 90 percent of American households  that have guns also support that commonsense legislation. Yet, in this  House, we have not been given the opportunity to vote on that  legislation. In those 5 years, 170,000 Americans have lost their lives  to gun violence. Think about that: 170,000.   Newtown, like my hometown of Cheshire, is about 30,000 people. That  is multiple Newtowns all day, every single one. Every single one of  those Americans was a son or a daughter of someone and had friends and  neighbors and loved ones. Again, in that time, this body has not acted.   Two weeks ago, I was in church in Danbury, Connecticut. I was at  services with a congregation I try to get to every 6 months or so. I  saw a couple of people I didn't expect to see. I saw the mother of one  of the little girls who was killed 5 years ago. I saw the daughter of  the principal. They were there for guidance, for wisdom, for courage to  fight the battle that the American people are waging for this House to  take action on.   The American people know the right thing to do. Our law enforcement  know the right thing to do. The vast majority of responsible gun owners  know the right thing to do. Yet, somehow, this body has failed to act.   But it is never too late. Now is the time for us to step up. Now is  the time for us to shoulder our responsibilities so that no other  community has to go through what Newtown has gone through. Although, in  that time, we have now seen Las Vegas, we have seen Charleston, we have  seen Orlando. There are killing fields now in America. That is not  right. It doesn't need to be.   I am joined tonight by several of my colleagues who are passionate  advocates for gun sense and gun safety in America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), my friend and the leader in our effort, who  is an expert in guns. He has experienced more than his share of gun  violence as a decorated servicemember fighting our Nation's battles,  and he has now led us for the last 5 years in our efforts for a safer,  better society and a better world as the head of our Gun Violence  Prevention Task Force.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations of the House Judiciary  Committee and vice chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.    Mr. Speaker, as we have heard so eloquently  from my colleagues, everyone agrees that we should keep guns out of the  hands of dangerous people. But, in fact, this House and this  administration have been moving in the opposite direction.   Just last week, hundreds of Americans whose loved ones had been  killed by guns in the last few years came to Washington for a long- planned memorial vigil, a national vigil, to honor those whose lives  had been taken from us from gun violence. On that very day, this House  decided to call up an offensive dangerous piece of legislation on  concealed carry permits.   This bill will make it easier for domestic violence abusers to pursue  their victims across State lines carrying loaded concealed weapons into  States that do not allow that, overriding the choices of States like  mine in Connecticut that have strict laws to protect domestic violence  victims, who are five times more likely to be killed if there is a gun  in the household.   That is why my State has taken action to protect women and children  from death by gun from domestic abusers. But now my State--if this law  gets passed by the Senate and signed by the President--my State's  choices will be overridden. The law enforcement in my State will be at  greater risk.                                time  1930    That is not protecting the American people. That is putting them at  risk.   Recently, the administration decided to take the names of all  fugitives. One of the categories of those who are not permitted legally  to own weapons are people who are fugitives from justice. It seems like  a fairly sensible rule, just like it is a sensible rule to not have  those who are believed to be terrorists to legally purchase guns.   Yet, this administration recently took tens of thousands of names of  people who have been on the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System as prohibited from purchasing a gun legally. Because of their  criminal history, the fact that they are fugitives from justice, tens  of thousands of those names have been taken out of the records. They  have been sent back to the States, saying they should look at them  again.   In so doing, how long is it going to be before one of those dangerous  people buys a gun because the name is no longer in the system?   And who knows if it is going to be your child or your child or your  loved  [[Page H9896]]  one or your neighbor. That is not what we are sent here to do.   The families of Newtown have persevered. Despite all odds, they have  found the courage to get up every day. Some are pursuing brain research  to figure out how to encourage empathy. Some have written beautiful  music, composed poetry. Some have started programs in schools to teach  children how to be kind to each other. Some have stepped forward as  extraordinary citizen activists and come to Washington and pound the  halls, the marbled halls of State capitols around the country. They are  true American heroes fighting for what they believe in and a better  society.   And some, in some ways I think the bravest among them, have chosen to  bring new children into this world--the sort of optimism and courage  that I can't fathom if my child at 6 or 7 years old had been gunned  down in those classrooms in the Sandy Hook Elementary School. But if  they can have that resolve and that courage and that faith in this  country, so can we.   A good and a great nation takes care of its citizens. A good and a  great nation responds to the cries of the people. A good and a great  nation, above all, protects its children.   Madam Speaker, we have the opportunity to do that. Thoughts and  prayers and moments of silence are not enough. The American people  deserve action. When I get on a plane tomorrow to fly back to  Connecticut to attend memorial services on the 5-year anniversary of  those tragic and shocking murders of children in Sandy Hook Elementary  School, I would like to be able to tell them that we are doing our job  and our duty in this House by taking action and honoring their memories  with truly taking action to protect them.   I want to thank my colleagues for joining me here tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Connecticut for her stirring words. Abbey Clements is an extraordinary  woman, and her daughter, Sarah, is now a college student here in  Washington and is helping take up that charge of being one of the  citizen activists and one of the citizen leaders who understands that  democracies empower and charge us to correct that which is wrong.   What is happening in this country is wrong. These are not tragedies  from above. These are not natural disasters. These are man-made  tragedies and man-made deaths, and it is up to us to do better.   Again, I want to thank my colleagues for joining me here this  evening. I will take their wishes, their words, their energy, their  passion, and their commitment to action back with me to Newtown  tomorrow evening.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
