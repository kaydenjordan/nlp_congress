 Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible bill. It is a terrible  bill. It is wrong for the country.   Why would the President, why would the leadership on the Republican  side here in Congress, why would they choose as the first order of  business taking healthcare coverage away from 24 million Americans?   It is wrongheaded. It is immoral. It is inhumane. It makes no sense.  It is wrong for America.   In the people's House, we need to vote it down.
