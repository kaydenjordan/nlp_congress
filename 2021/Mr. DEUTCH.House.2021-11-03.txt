It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) ongoing efforts by the government of President Daniel       Ortega in Nicaragua to suppress the voice and actions of       political opponents through intimidation and unlawful       detainment, civil society, and independent news media violate       the fundamental freedoms and basic human rights of the people       of Nicaragua;        (2) Congress unequivocally condemns the politically       motivated and unlawful detention of presidential candidates       Cristiana Chamorro, Arturo Cruz, Felix Maradiaga, and Juan       Sebastian Chamorro;        (3) Congress unequivocally condemns the passage of the       Foreign Agents Regulation Law, the Special Cybercrimes Law,       the Self-Determination Law, and the Consumer Protection Law       by the National Assembly of Nicaragua, which represent clear       attempts by the Ortega government to curtail the fundamental       freedoms and basic human rights of the people of Nicaragua;        (4) Congress recognizes that free, fair, and transparent       elections predicated on robust reform measures and the       presence of domestic and international observers represent       the best opportunity for the people of Nicaragua to restore       democracy and reach a peaceful solution to the political and       social crisis in Nicaragua;        (5) the United States recognizes the right of the people of       Nicaragua to freely determine their own political future as       vital to ensuring the sustainable restoration of democracy in       their country;        (6) the United States should align the use of diplomatic       engagement and all other foreign policy tools, including the       use of targeted sanctions, in support of efforts by       democratic political actors and civil society in Nicaragua to       advance the necessary conditions for free, fair, and       transparent elections in Nicaragua;        (7) the United States, in order to maximize the       effectiveness of efforts described in paragraph (6), should--        (A) coordinate with diplomatic partners, including the       Government of Canada, the European Union, and partners in       Latin America and the Caribbean;        (B) advance diplomatic initiatives in consultation with the       Organization of American States and the United Nations; and        (C) thoroughly investigate the assets and holdings of the       Nicaraguan Armed Forces in the United States and consider       appropriate actions to hold such forces accountable for gross       violations of human rights; and        (8) pursuant to section 6(b) of the Nicaragua Investment       Conditionality Act of 2018, the President should waive the       application of restrictions under section 4 of that Act and       the sanctions under section 5 of that Act if the Secretary of       State certifies that the Government of Nicaragua is taking       the steps  [[Page H6148]]       identified in section 6(a) of that Act, including taking       steps to ``to hold free and fair elections overseen by       credible domestic and international observers''.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) On November 27, 2018, the President signed Executive       Order 13851 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to blocking       property of certain persons contributing to the situation in       Nicaragua), which stated that ``the situation in Nicaragua,       including the violent response by the Government of Nicaragua       to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega       regime's systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic       institutions and the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate       violence and repressive tactics against civilians, as well as       its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua's       economy, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to       the national security and foreign policy of the United       States''.        (2) Article 21.2 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-      United States Free Trade Agreement approved by Congress under       section 101(a)(1) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-      United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (19       U.S.C. 4011(a)(1)) states, ``Nothing in this Agreement shall       be construed . . . to preclude a Party from applying measures       that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its       obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of       international peace or security, or the protection of its own       essential security interests.''.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the President should review the continued participation of       Nicaragua in the Dominican Republic-Central America-United       States Free Trade Agreement if the Government of Nicaragua       continues to tighten its authoritarian rule in an attempt to       subvert democratic elections in November 2021 and undermine       democracy and human rights in Nicaragua.

Section 1(a) of the Nicaragua Human Rights and       Anticorruption Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-335; 50 U.S.C.       1701 note) is amended to read as follows:        ``(a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the `Nicaragua       Investment Conditionality Act of 2018' or the `NICA Act'.''.       SEC. 14. DEFINITION.         In this Act, the term ``Nicaragua Investment Conditionality       Act of 2018'' means the Public Law 115-335 (50 U.S.C. 1701       note), as amended by section 13.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 1064.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1064, the RENACER Act.   I thank my good friend, Albio Sires from New Jersey, for his tireless  work in championing this bill and continuously drawing attention to the  antidemocratic actions taken by the Ortega regime.   This legislation makes clear that the United States will not sit by  quietly as another country in our hemisphere slides further away from  our democratic values. Working with our friends and partners in the  international community, this bill will allow us to continue applying  pressure on the Ortega regime ahead of the elections later this month.  Sadly, all signs indicate that these elections will be far from free  and fair.   Passing this bill will demonstrate the United States Government's  strong belief that a commitment to upholding human rights and free  expression are key pillars of promoting and preserving democracy.   The legislation takes a number of important steps. It restricts the  Ortega regime's ability to access capital for corrupt purposes via  international financial institutions and will bolster transparency  mechanisms to ensure any that funds Nicaragua receives are not siphoned  off for illicit or illegal purposes.   The RENACER Act will also ensure our sanctions policy is thoughtful  and effective by focusing targeted sanctions on bad actors undermining  the rule of law and democracy and not on the Nicaraguan people.   Crucially, the legislation requires the Secretary of State to work  with partners to make our sanctions multilateral and even more  effective.   The RENACER Act also serves a crucial factfinding purpose by  including important reports on regime corruption, human rights abuses,  arms sales, and Russia's role in the country. Just as this bill builds  on the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018, these  report provisions will help Congress develop and mold additional  responses should the Ortega regime continue down an illiberal and  undemocratic path.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                   Washington, DC, November 2, 2021.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning S. 1064,       Reinforcing Nicaragua's Adherence to Conditions for Electoral       Reform (RENACER) Act of 2021. In order to permit S. 1064 to       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo       formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of S. 1064 in light of our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of S.       1064 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this or similar legislation moves forward with       regard to any matters in the Committee's jurisdiction. The       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation that       involves the Committee's jurisdiction and request your       support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of S. 1064.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, November 2, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I am writing to you concerning S.       1064, Reinforcing Nicaragua's Adherence to Conditions for       Electoral Reform (RENACER) Act of 2021. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on S.       1064 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on Financial Services conferees during any       House-Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, RENACER is an excellent piece of legislation. I thank my  colleagues who, in a bipartisan way, worked together under  Representative Sires' tireless leadership, and for his work with  Senator Menendez in getting this bill across the finish line.   The United States must stand for democracy. We must stand for  democracy in Nicaragua. This legislation shows that we will not  abdicate our responsibility to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 760) expressing solidarity with Cuban citizens  demonstrating peacefully for fundamental freedoms, condemning the Cuban  regime's acts of repression, and calling for the immediate release of  arbitrarily detained Cuban citizens.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 760         Whereas, on July 11, 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the       streets to express their dissatisfaction with Cuba's       continued repression of its people, its worsening economic       situation, and shortages of food and medicine;        Whereas these demonstrations were the largest protests on       the island in over 25 years, with courageous Cuban men,       women,  [[Page H6152]]       and youth taking to the streets in cities and towns across       the country;        Whereas the Cuban regime arbitrarily denied a request to       allow a peaceful demonstration on November 15, 2021, which       the organizers have specified would be ``against violence, to       demand that all the rights of all Cubans be respected, for       the release of political prisoners and for the solution of       our differences through democratic and peaceful means'';        Whereas the Cuban regime also denied an earlier request for       protests to be held on November 20, 2021, stating that date       was off-limits because it would conflict with ``national       defense day'' and claiming without evidence that ``subversive       organizations'' with links to the United States Government       were promoting the protest;        Whereas artists, academics, activists, and journalists have       been long engaged in ongoing protests calling for an end to       Cuba's persecution, censorship, arbitrary detention, and       other human rights violations;        Whereas expanded internet access is foundational for the       Cuban people to be able to exercise their internationally       recognized human rights of access to information and freedom       of expression, creating opportunities for Cubans to       communicate more openly with one another and for their voices       to be heard around the world;        Whereas numerous public reports and first-hand accounts       revealed that the Cuban regime deliberately blocked access to       certain websites and messaging apps, throttled internet       access, and launched targeted attacks to disrupt the internet       connections of private Cuban citizens;        Whereas during the July protests, regime security officials       physically assaulted domestic and international journalists,       including Associated Press correspondent Ramon Espinosa, and       prevented dozens of reporters from leaving their homes to       report on the protests, according to the Committee to Protect       Journalists;        Whereas Cuba is among the most restrictive countries in the       world for journalists, ranked 171 of 180 countries in       Reporters Without Borders' 2021 World Press Freedom Index;        Whereas Cuban human rights groups report there were already       at least 150 political prisoners in Cuba before the July 11       protests, and Cuba has reportedly been responsible for over       400 additional arrests or forced disappearances since then;        Whereas hundreds of Cubans who participated in the July       protests continue to face unjust detention and other forms of       retribution, including dozens who have been sentenced in       summary trials without due process and dozens of others who       remain unaccounted for;        Whereas United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights       Michelle Bachelet expressed concern about ``the excessive       force against demonstrators in Cuba and the arrest of a large       number of people, including journalists'' and noted ``it is       particularly worrying that these include individuals       allegedly held incommunicado and people whose whereabouts are       unknown'';        Whereas, on July 25, 2021, Secretary of State Antony       Blinken and the foreign ministers of 20 countries issued a       statement to ``condemn the mass arrests and detentions of       protestors in Cuba and call on the government to respect the       universal rights and freedoms of the Cuban people, including       the free flow of information to all Cubans'';        Whereas, on October 17, 2021, Assistant Secretary of State       for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian A. Nichols said       ``Denying the right of peaceful assembly to Cubans this       November 15th shows the Cuban regime's disregard for the       human rights and freedoms of its people. This and other       blatant attempts to intimidate their citizens is a clear sign       the regime won't listen to what Cubans have to say.'';        Whereas over the summer, Cuba has seen record numbers of       COVID-19 infections and deaths, pushing hospitals and health       centers to near collapse; and        Whereas basic medicines and common goods have become scarce       throughout the country and economists estimate Cuba's       economic conditions will become even worse in the coming       months: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses strong solidarity with the Cuban people who       took to the streets throughout the country on July 11, 2021,       and with those who plan to peacefully demonstrate on November       15, 2021, to once again express their desire to live in a       free country with self-determination;        (2) condemns the Cuban regime's violent repression of       peaceful protesters and journalists and its other efforts to       restrict the Cuban people's right to peacefully protest,       freely express themselves, and exercise their other universal       human rights;        (3) calls on Cuba to end all efforts to block or throttle       the Cuban people's internet access or restrict their access       to certain websites or applications and to permit them to       freely communicate online, including during future       demonstrations and peaceful protests;        (4) calls on members of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed       Forces, the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, and Cuba's       National Revolutionary Police Force to not arrest or detain       peaceful protesters, provide due process to all individuals,       and immediately release all political prisoners and       arbitrarily detained individuals still in their custody; and        (5) urges the Biden administration to--        (A) work with Cuban activists, civil society groups,       private United States companies, and the international       community to expand internet access for the Cuban people;        (B) support the Cuban people's inherent right to       demonstrate peacefully in the name of democracy and human       rights;        (C) continue to stand behind the aspirations of the Cuban       people for freedom, for dignity, for prosperity, and the       basic rights that they have been denied by the regime since       1959;        (D) assess whether the United States can develop methods to       allow remittances, medical supplies, and other forms of       support from the United States to directly benefit the Cuban       people in ways that alleviate humanitarian suffering without       providing United States dollars to the Cuban military; and        (E) rally the international community to join the United       States in condemning human rights abuses and honoring the       Cuban people's demands for freedom.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 760.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 760, introduced by my friend and colleague,  Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, together with my friend, Congressman  Diaz-Balart, and chair of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee,  Congressman Sires, supports the basic human rights of the Cuban people  and stands with them in their right to peacefully protest their own  government.   In July, the largest protest in decades swept the island of Cuba.  Activists, in turn, were beaten and jailed by the government. Many  remain jailed. According to Human Rights Watch, many have been  subjected to abuse and torture simply for standing up for access to  food, to medicine, to information, and to have their rights respected.   This resolution expresses solidarity with the Cuban people ahead of  planned nationwide protests for November 15. The organizers of these  protests sought approval from the government, as the Cuban constitution  allows for legitimate protest. They were denied.   We must stand with the people of Cuba as they exercise their right to  free expression. We must condemn the violent response to peaceful  protests by the Cuban people. That is what this resolution does.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for working to bring this  resolution to the floor, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is a great champion for human  rights and an outspoken champion for those human rights when they are  violated so close to our own shores.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Mr. Speaker, the people of Florida stand with the people  of Cuba.   I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Demings), another colleague from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, before we vote on this, I yield an  additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz), the driving force behind this.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Green, I want to thank Ms. Wasserman  Schultz and Mr. Diaz-Balart, as well as our good friend Mr. Sires, all  of them, for their bipartisan leadership of this important resolution.  I want to thank Senator Menendez and Senator Rubio for the same.   We have the opportunity today here, at this moment, to show  unequivocally that the United States stands with the people of Cuba,  that we stand with them in their desire for basic rights, that we want  to see relations between the United States and the Cuban people  flourish, that we support today and will always support the Cuban  people in their pursuit of freedom, the right to free expression, and  the right to live and be free.   I thank the bill sponsors for their important work on this  resolution. I urge all of my colleagues to stand for human rights, to  stand with the people of Cuba, and to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
