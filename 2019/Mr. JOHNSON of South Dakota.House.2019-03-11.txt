 Mr. Speaker, since it is National  Agriculture Week, I thought I would highlight how important market  access is to South Dakota.   Now, the numbers don't lie. South Dakota is our Nation's 10th largest  ag exporting State. In fact, we send out $4 billion of ag products  every single year.   NAFTA deserves a lot of credit for that. In fact, our Nation at large  exports more than $38 billion every year to Canada and Mexico.   We need to keep that momentum going, which is why this body needs to  ratify the newly negotiated United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.   USMCA is clearly better than NAFTA was. Let's be clear: That doesn't  mean that it is perfect, but it does mean that it is clearly better for  our country.   President Trump and his administration have made a number of much- needed improvements to that trading agreement. Let's send a clear  message that the United States and South Dakota are open for business.   Mr. Speaker, let's get to work.                            ____________________
