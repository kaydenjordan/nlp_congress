 Madam Speaker, it is fitting that we are honoring  Congresswoman Slaughter during Women's History Month because her legacy  is planted firmly in the history books.   She wasn't the daughter of wealth or privilege, but she traveled from  the coalfields of Kentucky to become the first woman ever to chair the  House Rules Committee.   Louise's 30 years of service here embodied what it means to be a  public servant: writing the STOCK Act and the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act, shepherding through the Affordable Care Act. I  could go on and on.   There was no special interest too influential for her to take on, no  politician too powerful.   Many of us saw her determination firsthand, whether we were with her  on an issue or especially if we were on the opposite side. We are all  better for it. This Chamber and this country are better for it.   I am proud to have worked alongside her. I am glad that she will be  joining so many pioneering women in the National Women's Hall of Fame  this year.   Madam Speaker, and on behalf of all the Members of this Chamber and  on behalf of her staff, especially in the Rules Committee, let me just  say we loved her, and we miss her a lot.                            ____________________
