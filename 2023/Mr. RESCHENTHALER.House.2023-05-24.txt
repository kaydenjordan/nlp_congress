 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 467,  the HALT Fentanyl Act. Every day an average of 14 Pennsylvanians die as  a result of drug overdose.   In 2021, Pennsylvania recorded 5,449 overdose deaths, which is the  fourth  [[Page H2562]]  largest amount in the Nation. Preliminary data shows that in 2022,  roughly 110,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in the U.S., which  is a new record, as the fentanyl crisis deepens across this country.   Just for perspective, fentanyl kills more Americans under age 50 than  any other cause of death, including heart disease, cancer, homicide,  and suicide.   We must ensure law enforcement has all the tools necessary to  prosecute and seize all dangerous addictive and deadly forms of  fentanyl substances. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.                            ____________________
