 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  longtime Summerville High School football coach, Hall of Famer, John  McKissick, who passed away on Thanksgiving Day.   Coach McKissick was the greatest high school football coach our  country has ever seen. In fact, he held the record for the most wins of  any football coach anywhere at any single level. Over the course of his  62-year career, he led the Green Wave to 10 State championships and 621  wins.   Coach McKissick was a mentor and a father figure to thousands of  student athletes. In total, he coached over 5,000 young men throughout  his career.   I had the honor of attending his funeral earlier this week, and I got  to meet several of his former players, many in their fifties, sixties,  seventies, and even eighties, who all told me about the incredible  impact he had on their lives.   He famously told his players that it is not about the Xs and Os; it's  about the Jims and the Joes. He called his players his boys. He treated  them like family because they were, and that feeling was mutual.   It is impossible to imagine high school football or Summerville  without him, but his amazing legacy will live on forever.   May God bless his family, his friends, former players, and the entire  Summerville community.   Thank you for everything, Coach.                            ____________________
