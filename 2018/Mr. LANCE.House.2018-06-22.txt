 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this bipartisan  package, H.R. 6.   The Energy and Commerce Committee, under the leadership of Chairman  Walden, has again delivered for the American people on the pressing  public health challenges facing the Nation. From combating childhood  cancer, to improving mental health care, to fighting the scourge of  drug addiction, the Energy and Commerce Committee produces results.   The menace of drug abuse and addiction has manifested itself in  opiates. Every corner of this country has known the heartache of losing  a life from this terrible problem. Congress has acted before with  passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, but CARA needs  reinforcement. H.R. 6 delivers more resources, treatment, and  mitigation tools to fight opiate addiction.   Included in this package is the Eliminating Opioid-Related Infectious  Diseases Act, legislation I have authored with my colleague on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III.   Infectious diseases compound and complicate the lifelong path toward  recovery from substance abuse, and threaten the lives and safety of the  loved ones of those addicted, especially children.   This is how Congress is supposed to work, both sides coming together  to confront a national crisis, going through the committee process with  bipartisan bills, and getting to the root of the country's challenges.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
