 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to stand in support of H.R. 5430, the  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act.   The legislation we are considering today is the result of almost 14  months of negotiations between House Democrats and Ambassador  Lighthizer, and I am very proud of the outcome that we have reached.   As a result of these months of work, the USMCA is a transformative  agreement that creates a new high-water mark for U.S. trade deals going  forward.  [[Page H12247]]    When we assumed the majority this year, we were asked to consider a  renegotiated NAFTA that had structural flaws in a key number of areas:  enforcement, labor rights, environment, and access to medicines.   Let me start with enforcement, which was the crux of this agreement.   As I have noted many times over the past year, I did not vote for the  original NAFTA. The chief reason was the lack of enforceability  mechanisms. During these past 25 years, we have seen the shortcomings  of the original agreement, much of which comes down to a lack of  enforcement, in my view.   House Democrats, working with Ambassador Lighthizer, fixed many of  those issues. The improvements to the USMCA that we negotiated finally  make the agreement enforceable by preventing a country from being able  to block the formation of a dispute settlement panel.   On labor, our trade agreements, in many cases, have failed American  workers. NAFTA has been symbolic of our broken promises to these  workers.   Over 25 years of the NAFTA, there have been 39 petitions filed  documenting the exploitation of workers and zero enforcement actions  taken to remedy those violations.   In close partnership with labor unions and with the robust support of  Ways and Means Democrats, support from Republicans, we negotiated  improvements to the rules and to our monitoring regime, and we  established a new enforcement mechanism.   On the rules, we strengthened certain provisions and addressed  obstacles to enforcement in many others. On monitoring, for the first  time we have created a proactive monitoring regime for labor  obligations in a trade agreement. The implementing bill establishes an  Interagency Labor Committee that will actively monitor Mexico's  compliance, and report back to Congress.   On enforcement, we negotiated a historic mechanism never included in  a trade agreement before. As a result of Democratic efforts, we will  now have a facility-specific, rapid-response mechanism to address  violations of key labor obligations.   We have made great improvements to environmental provisions. The  USMCA will now include the highest environmental standards of any trade  agreement in history and will include a new customs verification  agreement to enhance enforcement.   The implementing bill, and I hope our colleagues in this Chamber will  hear this, also secures more than $600 million in funding for  environmental problems in the NAFTA region and reauthorizes the North  American Development Bank.   Through the dedication of the working group members, the Trade  Subcommittee members, we also secured important changes to USMCA that  preserve Congress' ability to change U.S. law to address the crisis we  face with respect to high prescription drug prices.   These changes set a new standard for U.S. trade agreements, and  demonstrate that trade agreements can achieve broad, bipartisan support  if they empower workers, protect patients, provide access to affordable  healthcare, and improve our shared environment.   I am proud of what we did here. After 14 months of negotiating on  every conceivable front, we have improved the old NAFTA.   Madam Speaker, I want to remind our colleagues today, if they decide  that they are not going to vote for this piece of legislation in front  of us, that is up to them. But one thing they cannot say is, this is  not much better than what we have had in the past.   So the options here are clear: you can vote for what we have  negotiated or you can embrace the status quo. And if this fails today,  that is precisely what you are doing: embracing the status quo.   This agreement, based upon the painstaking efforts of members of the  committee and Ambassador Lighthizer, was done with full transparency.  No surprises are in this legislation.    I hope that today we can say at the end of the time limits that this  was a successful negotiation of the largest trade agreement in American  history, a hemispheric agreement that I think we can stand in support  of with great pride today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, who  also made an invaluable effort in terms of the working group that  assembled the document that we will vote on this afternoon.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis), whose legendary work on behalf of America is well  known to all.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, we consider it a bit of a miracle that the  gentleman did not show up with his charts.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), whose invaluable work on the committee and a  steady hand all of the time is very much appreciated.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), a member of the working task force that  assembled the document in front of us today, again, whose keen mind and  good sense is always very helpful to these debates.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind). His advocacy on behalf of agriculture is well- known to all in this body.    Madam Speaker, it is always an honor to endorse the Speaker  of the House and to welcome her to the floor, but also to point  something out.   On weekends, from Brussels, from Madrid, from Paris, she called me.  And on the final weekend, time and again, with the U.S. trade rep on  the line, the three of us went back and forth with Rich Trumka, who was  in Pennsylvania on vacation, who couldn't have cell access until 5  o'clock in the evening. The Speaker was totally involved in this  endeavor.   But most importantly, she called me in the middle of a Patriots game,  and I was smart enough to take the call.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), who is a well-known champion of all  things Chicago and a great advocate of working men and women.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Buffalo, New York (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who, again, was an invaluable member of the  Trade Working Group. Her advocacy for people in her constituency is  well known to all.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. DelBene), whose well-acknowledged efforts on  behalf of the best and most important trade State in the country,  Washington, as well as being a knowledgeable forecaster of  international economics for all benefit all of us on the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Judy Chu), another invaluable member of the Committee on Ways and  Means whose knowledge about southern California is very important to  all of us.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), whose district I recently visited, a real  champion of the airport, a real champion of the seaport, and a real  champion of international economics.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), a very knowledgeable member of the Ways and  Means Committee whose district I visited not that long ago.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), a very invaluable member of the Ways and  Means Committee, advocate of the ``Salad Bowl of the World,'' and a  good friend.    Madam Speaker, this is really a happy moment for me to  acknowledge the work that the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez) did  on behalf of labor rights. He stood up in the working group on behalf  of the working people, and I think that he considerably shifted this  argument in their direction.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez).   (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), an important advocate of environmental  issues as a member of the Trade Working Group.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a formidable negotiator and a very  important member of the Trade Working Group.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a formidable negotiator, a great  friend, and, I must say, an invaluable member of the working group that  helped assemble this document.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cuellar), a real champion of this agreement.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn), a real champion of agriculture and small  business.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), a courageous congresswoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gonzalez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Allred), a courageous congressman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), who I can assure everybody was an assertive  advocate for this agreement.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens), a ferocious advocate.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the very capable  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Torres Small), who once even followed  me into the coffee shop to advocate on behalf of this agreement.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Axne). I can assure the people of Iowa that she advocated on  behalf of this agreement.    Madam Speaker, I am glad to yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Costa), who is an assertive advocate of USMCA.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), and I want to recognize  the critical role that he played in getting us to this bipartisan  negotiation of USMCA.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), a well-regarded Congresswoman whose district I  have visited.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a very good friend of mine.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Brindisi), a very accomplished gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis), a very capable Congresswoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), a very capable Member of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Delgado), a very capable Congressman and my neighbor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Mrs. Fletcher), who is very capable.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   So on this occasion, Mr. Speaker, we conclude after 14 months of  negotiating a hemispheric trade agreement--no small matter and no small  accomplishment. It included a visit with the delegation to Mexico to  meet with the President of Mexico, President Lopez Obrador. It included  a delegation that visited Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada and intense  negotiations in both countries, and I think it is fair to say that the  conversations in both countries were indeed very spirited.   But before I go to more of the specifics, we would not have gotten  here without some very important and critical moments of focused and  diligent work by Members of the House and the staff that got us to  where we are today.   First, an acknowledgment to Speaker Pelosi, who from day one said  that the game plan is to get to yes. Her leadership to get the deal  across the line, I think, was matched almost by her top trade adviser,  Katherine Monge.   Let me thank the working group members, Trade Subcommittee Chairman  Blumenauer and his staff Laura Thrift and David Skillman;  Representative Thompson and his staff, Jennifer Goedke; Representative  Larson and his staff, Scott Stephanou; Representative Terri Sewell and  her staff, Rob Nuttall; Representative  Jim Gomez and his staff, Sam  Negatu; Representative Rosa DeLauro and her staff, Jack Spasiano;  Representative Schakowsky and her staff, Syd Terry and Osaremen Okolo;  and Representative Suzanne Bonamici and her staff, Allison Smith.   I want to thank the House Legislative Counsel, Mark Synnes and  Kalyani Parthasarathy for their expertise, creativity, and many hours  of hard and good work with our staff to prepare this legislation that  is more than 200 pages long. They represent the very best of this  institution's professionalism.   For the support of colleagues and staff that I received from the  diplomatic corps in Mexico City and Ottawa, we should express our  gratitude as well to Ms. Elizabeth Hoffman at  [[Page H12267]]  our Embassy in Mexico City for her extraordinary talents and efforts to  support our attempts as we got to yes.   I have great confidence and belief in the staff members at the Ways  and Means Committee, and, yes, on both sides. So I want to thank my  committee staff who have worked tirelessly on this agreement: Chief  Trade Counsel and staff director of the Trade Subcommittee, Katherine  Tai, who led us through the process along with her staff, Keigan Mull,  Julia Friedman, Katie White, Alexandra Whittaker, John Catalfamo, and  Kate Connor Linton. They were supported by a cast of very bright  fellows and interns, Brishailah Brown, Chenoa Lee, and Tiffany  Venmahavong.   I also want to thank our colleagues across the aisle. Especially I  want to acknowledge today the role that Ambassador Robert Lighthizer  played in this. There is something to be said for the experience of  Capitol Hill and having been a former staff member. Time and again we  thought we weren't going to get to where we wanted to be. And there  were some moments, I would say, of incendiary commentary back and  forth. Though there were many threats to leave the negotiation, it  never materialized because a long walk through this Capitol can solve a  lot of challenges.   Mr. Brady was invaluable as well, and his committee staff, Angela  Ellard, Josh Snead, Blake Harden, and David Giordano all played a very  important role here.   This really is a bipartisan agreement, and I hope and expect that the  challenges to USMCA will allow H.R. 5430 to enjoy broad, bipartisan  support.   I certainly am urging support for this because of the following: it  bolsters workers' rights; it corrects earlier Trump administration  backsliding on environmental obligations to get us to this trade  agreement; it eliminated many big giveaways to companies that would  have locked in high medicine prices, and it preserves Congress' freedom  to legislate to bring those prices down; and it incorporates the  strongest enforcement mechanisms, including specifically enhanced  mechanisms for enforcing labor rights in any U.S. trade agreement.   There are three titles that are devoted to the United States  Government and our role: monitoring and enforcement of USMCA partners'  obligations, monitoring and enforcement of USMCA partners'  environmental obligations, and more than $843 million over 4 years that  will be dedicated to monitoring and enforcement of labor and  environmental obligations, including funds for education and training  of workers and inspectors.   We would not have gotten here today, however, without the important  considerations of organized labor and the honorable men and women of  the AFL/CIO and the Teamsters. We had broad support by including them  in the negotiation and the discussions. This agreement is much the  better for it, but it also is the signature accomplishment for all of  us who had a chance to participate in it.   Every once in a while, Mr. Speaker, you get to participate in these  it-will-never-happen moments, and I believe that this indeed is one of  them. So we also thank the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice,  American Chemistry Council, Association for Accessible Medicines,  Coalition of Services Industries, Farmers for Free Trade, Information  Technology Industry, the National Association of Manufacturers, the  National Council of Textiles Organizations, The Software Alliance, and,  indeed, many others.   I hope that this will serve as a template going forward for the two  sides to reach a combination on many of the priorities that expire this  year that we will include next year. But, also, I think it is an  example of when men and women in this institution of goodwill--not just  in the season--but men and women of goodwill can find common occurrence  and common ground on an issue, in the end, that is really important to  all members of the American family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 19, 2019, on page H12267, ``*ERR08*'' inadvertently  appeared at one place.
