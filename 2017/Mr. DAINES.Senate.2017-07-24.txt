 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to complete my remarks.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, David Bernhardt is a well-qualified  nominee to serve as our next Deputy Secretary of the Interior.   The Department of the Interior is charged with managing our wildlife,  our public lands, including our national parks and refuges, and our  Nation's rich natural resources, which are key to American energy  independence. They are charged with the sacred responsibility of  protecting the Federal Government's trust responsibility to Indian  Tribes.   Managing the Department of the Interior is a complex balancing act.  We need someone who is able to balance these competing interests, and  we need someone who understands the importance of our public lands.  [[Page S4130]]    David Bernhardt has spent his life balancing competing interests,  weighing the stewardship of our natural resources and wildlife with the  letter of the law. His relationship to our lands and the western way of  life is not second nature; it is first.   Mr. Bernhardt was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 2006 as the  Solicitor of the Department. As Solicitor he proved he was capable of  upholding the law, even under difficult situations. My colleagues may  remember that he wrote the opinion that decided to list the polar bear  and drafted a workable rule. As we know, Secretary Salazar then upheld  this rule.   As Solicitor, he prioritized establishing a robust ethics team at the  Department. That ethics team still exists today.   Mr. Bernhardt has proven to have the highest level of integrity and  work ethic. For heaven's sake, he is a westerner. He is from Rifle, CO,  and the importance of our public lands and wildlife flows through his  veins like a lot of us who live out West. I have confidence that he  will be a dedicated servant to our western way of life, where we love  to hunt, to fish, to hike on our public lands. I have confidence in  this because I know he loves this way of life as well.   I am not the only one who has this confidence. Listen to this list of  support from groups across our country that support his appointment:  the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership; Ducks Unlimited; the  Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Boone and Crockett Club, and others  that many Montanans are members of, including the Mule Deer Foundation,  the NRA, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.   While the U.S. Senate confirmed Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the  Interior, he became the first Montanan, my friend Ryan Zinke, to serve  on the President's Cabinet since our statehood in 1889. It sent a  message that the Department of the Interior would have our Montana  values and our western values, and the confirmation of David Bernhardt  as Deputy Secretary would make good on that promise.   While Montanans and westerners highly value access to our public  lands and wildlife, Montanans are also pleading--pleading--for our land  management agencies to be better partners, to work alongside our  States, and to work alongside our landowners.   Secretary Zinke needs a right-hand man to make sure we uphold our  commitment to Indian Nations. Secretary Zinke promised to rebuild trust  in our Federal land and wildlife management agencies and strengthen the  government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes. He needs a  deputy in place who can help implement this vision to restore trust and  balance to the Department of the Interior for Montanans.   My colleagues, it is time Secretary Zinke has a Deputy we can all  count on, and I look forward to casting my vote for David Bernhardt.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time  is expired. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the  Bernhardt nomination?    Mr. President, as I speak, wildfires are blazing across  Montana. In fact, as of this moment, we have 21 active fires, with just  about 300,000 acres burned, which has turned our big sky into gray  smoke. In fact, the Lodgepole fire in Eastern Montana alone has burned  over 250,000 acres, and there are 300-plus heroes bravely working to  tame those growing flames.   I was on the phone a couple of times with our county commissioner  from Garfield County, and we talked about how to get more resources for  these devastating fires. I just got word an hour ago that the Sunrise  fire on the western side of our State, near Superior, MT, was just  elevated in the last couple of hours as the No. 2 national priority  fire in the Nation.   Montana is hot, Montana is dry, and there is a long way to go yet in  this fire season. The status quo is simply unacceptable. With these  fires blazing and the ground cracking beneath us, we are reminded of  how fragile the way of life in Montana is.   Our No. 1 economic driver in Montana is agriculture. Montana ag  supports our economy in seasons of plenty, as well as in seasons of  drought, including physical drought and unseasonable rains. We have  seen both in Montana, and farmers and ranchers have risen to the  occasion each time. As they have supported us, we must support them.   The historic drought conditions in Eastern Montana warrant relief  from regulations that limit the producers' abilities to use our land in  the best ways possible. I was pleased by the decision of Secretary  Perdue and the USDA to allow impacted producers to best use the  Conservation Reserve Program acreage for grazing, but I believe Montana  producers are not able to sleep at night for fear of losing their  family farms. They deserve more support from those who benefit from  their legacy of hard work.   I have held and will continue to hold USDA's feet to the fire, urging  additional emergency relief for farmers and  [[Page S4131]]  ranchers. I have been engaging with Montana farmers and ranchers. Most  recently, I spoke with officials; I was literally on the phone last  night with officials from Garfield County, talking with folks on the  ground as to what the lack of rain has meant for them.   I understand the severity of drought and the risk of wildfires. Let  me tell you, wildfires are all too common for those of us who live in  Montana. Hundreds of fires burn through Montana's forests every year,  with countless firefighters fighting to protect lives and property.  Year after year, I will come down here, and you will hear me speak on  the floor; you will hear me in committees; you will hear me back home,  talking about the fact that these fires are ready to ignite at any  moment. You can see the unmanaged forests we have in Montana are  literally just waiting for a massive wildfire. With nearly 300,000  acres burned--and we aren't even in August yet; it is still July--it is  a big deal for a State known for its wide open landscapes.   We need forest management reform urgently. It is a topic always on  the forefront of my mind and on the forefront of Montanans and those of  us out West, but it is on the back burner of the swamp here in  Washington, DC, until, of course, we get to fire season; then we will  talk about it.   We must reform the way we manage our national forests. We can use  proven tactics to reduce the threat of wildfires, as well as to reduce  the rate of spread and intensity of those fires when they occur. We  need a wildfire funding fix because we can't just keep hoping the  Congress will pay back the Forest Service at the end of every season.  It is not the way a family budgets, and the Forest Service shouldn't  have to either.   We have nearly 5 million acres of national forest in Montana that  have been identified as critically in need of restoration. We are  talking about dying and dead timber, primarily because of beetle kill,  and we can't even get in and manage the timber because we have these  far-left groups that would challenge many of our timber sales in court.  I have joined Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in sponsoring  legislation to encourage partnerships between the Forest Service and  the State foresters to carry out these cross-boundary restoration  projects.   A fire does not respect boundaries; it doesn't know where the State  land ends or Federal land begins or where private land is or  reservation lands are. We need to work better as neighbors along the  fence line to reduce fuels and wildfire hazards across the country.  These partnerships and projects will make fighting these wildfires  safer for firefighters and allow them to return home safely to their  families.   At this time of year, we recognize our firefighters, in particular,  as some of the bravest men and women out there. The courage with which  they run toward danger--I tell you, if you have never seen a wildfire  burning out west, it is an incredibly terrifying sight to see huge  plumes of flames that reach up to 30,000 feet in the atmosphere. They  are ominous. These brave men and women run toward danger to protect our  lives and our homes.                           Honoring Trenton Johnson    Mr. President, let me close by recognizing a young man who lost his  life in Montana just this past week. His name was Trenton Johnson.  Trenton Johnson was such a man--one of those brave heroes. It is with a  heavy heart that I offer prayers of strength and peace to the family  and friends of Trenton Johnson, who died fighting a fire just last  Wednesday near Seeley Lake in the northwest corner of Montana.   Trenton will be remembered for his bravery, and I pray that his  family and friends find solace and encouragement in the memories of his  vibrant but way too short life. He was just 19 years old.   As we pray for rain in Montana, we also pray for the safety and  protection of all of our firefighters who, as we speak at this very  moment, are still battling blazes all across our State and across the  Western United States.   Mr. President, as I said, it is with a heavy heart that I offer  prayers of strength and peace to the family and friends of Trenton  Johnson. This brave Montanan died fighting a fire last Wednesday near  Seeley Lake in the northwest corner of our State. Over this past  weekend, in his hometown of Missoula, Trenton's loss was mourned by his  family and friends, his fire crew, and many of his fellow Montanans.  This 19-year-old was celebrated by many as a successful high school  leader and athlete, a student at Montana State University, and a fire  crew member in his first season battling forest fires. The tragedy of  his passing was felt across the State.   The inherent danger firefighters face with bravery when they defend  the lives and livelihoods of a community from the path of an  unpredictable fire is awe inspiring. In Montana, the annual efforts of  firefighters at every turn is essential to our collective safety. The  men and women who make up these fire crews are a combination of  expertise, courage, and grit.   I pray that Trenton's family and friends find solace and  encouragement in the memories of his vibrant life, and I pray for the  safety of all firefighters still battling blazes across Big Sky  Country.   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.                                  Healthcare
