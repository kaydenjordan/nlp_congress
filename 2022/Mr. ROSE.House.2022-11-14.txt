 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for allowing me time to  speak on this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter from the Tennessee  Farm Bureau and Kentucky Farm Bureau Federations opposing H.R. 5441.                                                 November 14, 2022.      Honorable Members of Congress,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: Please accept this letter as a       statement of opposition to H.R. 5441, the Prevent All Soring       Tactics (PAST) Act by the Kentucky Farm Bureau and Tennessee       Farm Bureau.        The PAST Act is misleading in its strategies and purpose       and sets a dangerous precedent for animal agriculture. Please       take the time to review it closely and understand this       initiative and the agenda of the Humane Society of the United       States (HSUS). While the PAST Act expressly targets Walking       Horses, this push by the HSUS brings to question which       segment of animal-based agriculture will be targeted next.        Supporters of the PAST Act argue the bill will ``eliminate       soring'' within the Walking Horse Industry. However, soring       is essentially nonexistent today. The bill professes to end       soring by banning hoof pads and action devices which are used       in Walking Horse performance shows, and implies such items       cause soring. Hoof pads and action devices do not cause       soring. Hoof pads are used to provide protection from ground       force, to accentuate movement, and balance motion. These pads       are used in many breeds other than the Walking Horse       including the American Paint Horse, American Quarter Horse,       American Saddlebred, and Morgan breeds. An action device is a       band/chain weighing six (6) ounces or less. We are not aware       of a study that indicates action devices or pads produce pain       or cause tissue damage.        The Tennessee Walking Horse is the most inspected horse in       the world. The industry and its shows maintain a compliance       rate with the Horse Protection Act that averages 99 percent.       This rate is significant considering the inspection process       today is almost 100 percent subjective.        The PAST Act eliminates the organizations established by       Congress in the original Horse Protection Act called Horse       Industry Organizations (HIOs). These independent       organizations provide inspectors for shows and are trained       and certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).       Without HIOs, the PAST Act requires an increase in the USDA's       workforce as well as additional employees for the U.S.       Department of Justice. The Congressional Budget Office       numbers reflect this cost.        We urge you to not accept the mistreatment claims from       years past as true today. Visit a Walking Horse farm and see       the horses. Visit with a horse owner, trainer, farrier and       their veterinarians. Contact your state Farm Bureau, the       Tennessee Farm Bureau or the Kentucky Farm Bureau if you want       assistance arranging a visit or tour.        We urge you to oppose H.R. 5441.        Thank you for your consideration of this information.            Sincerely,      Eric Mayberry,        President, Tennessee Farm Bureau.      Mark Haney,        President, Kentucky Farm Bureau.     Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 5441, the  PAST Act. As an eighth-generation farmer and Tennessean, the grand  tradition of Tennessee Walking Horses is among my earliest and fondest  memories. We take great pride in the fact that the Tennessee Walking  Horse National Celebration draws neighbors and tourists alike each year  to Shelbyville, Tennessee, for our world-class showcase.   However, over the years, this grand tradition has, on occasion, been  marred by a few bad actors looking to gain a competitive edge at the  unfair expense of the hundreds of other Walking Horse exhibitors who do  things right, and at the grossly unacceptable expense of the horses  themselves that suffer from the cruel and unconscionable technique  known in the industry as soring.   Those who sore our Tennessee Walking Horses compromise the integrity  of the competition, put a stain on what has long been a wonderful  family-oriented tradition, and by far most importantly subject our  prized Tennessee Walking Horses to harm and suffering. I can assure you  that we in Tennessee stand strongly against this vile technique.   My strong disgust to soring is actually why I rise today in  opposition to the PAST Act. This bill is not the best solution to end  this cruel practice. While I appreciate the sincere motives of those  supporting this bill, I call on my colleagues to consider another  better solution.   I am a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 6341, the Protecting Horses  from Soring Act of 2021, authored by my friend and colleague from  Tennessee, Congressman Scott DesJarlais. This bill works to end soring  in another way that is fair to those acting properly and humanely and  provides timely consequences for those who are not.   Inspections must be objective, but the PAST Act does not correct the  subjective process currently used. My colleague's bill, H.R. 6341,  creates a framework for consistent, scientific, and objective  inspections. The bill also prevents conflicts of interest and suspends  horses from shows if they are found to be sore.  [[Page H8476]]    Industry wide, the current compliance rate is between 96 and 99  percent, which is an increase from the 92 to 95 percent compliance rate  that the industry had when we debated this bill last Congress. This is  a 4 percent increase in less than 3 years. These compliance rates are  based on USDA standards.   Overall, the Walking Horse industry has a USDA compliance rate higher  than even the food industry achieves. With that record, the rate of  catching bad actors at this point is, of course, extremely low. Those  low rates mean we must be vigilant if we are going to find and stop the  remaining bad actors. Vigilance will require a new system.   The PAST Act does not create a scientific, objective process for  inspections, and until we have that, the remaining bad actors will  continue to go under the radar, while those acting with integrity could  be treated unfairly. The PAST Act is the wrong approach and will  actually be counterproductive.   It is because of these concerns that I will oppose the PAST Act today  and call upon my colleagues to also oppose it and instead stand with me  in truly stopping soring by supporting H.R. 6341, the Protecting Horses  from Soring Act of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H8477]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.
