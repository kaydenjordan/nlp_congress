 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of my friend Nick  Buoniconti, the humanitarian and football legend. He passed away on  July 30, 2019, at the age of 78.   Nick's career with the Miami Dolphins began in 1969. With his help,  the Dolphins went undefeated in 1972, culminating with a Super Bowl  victory. The team won the Super Bowl the next year as well and remains  the only team in the National Football League to go an entire season  undefeated.   After Nick retired from professional football, his son Marc sustained  a spinal cord injury in a college football game, leaving him paralyzed  from the neck down.   After this, Nick dedicated himself to focusing on his son's health  and supporting the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, of which Marc  currently serves as president.   In addition, Nick and his family founded the Buoniconti Fund to Cure  Paralysis, which has raised over $500 million in support of the Miami  Project's research objectives.   Nick Buoniconti's influence will be felt in Miami for years to come.  We will remember him with love and pride.                            ____________________
