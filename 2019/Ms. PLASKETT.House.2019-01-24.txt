 Madam Speaker, I also rise to share a shutdown story  from my district in the U.S. Virgin Islands.   Vanessa Thomas, a resident of St. Thomas, shared a heartfelt story  with me on her personal experience with the government shutdown.   In 2017, less than 2 years ago, she lost her home in the two  hurricanes that we had. Her home insurance is through the USDA Rural  Development program.   Prior to the shutdown, she did not receive homeowners insurance  payments regularly. Now, with the shutdown, she is forced to use her  own money to pay  [[Page H1197]]  for materials and labor to repair her home. She has to choose between  having her daughter sit out a semester in college or saving her home.   This is one among many stories that are threatening residents of our  country.   Today, I strongly urge the President to end this shutdown now,  immediately.   Today, we cannot continue using Federal employees and Federal funds  as pawns in a political game.                            ____________________
