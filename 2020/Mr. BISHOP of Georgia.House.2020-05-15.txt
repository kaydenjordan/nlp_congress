 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   From the ag appropriations, the bill provides:   $10 billion for SNAP;   $150 million for food banks;   $3 billion for school food programs;   $1.1 billion for WIC;   $309 million for Rural Rental Assistance.   In addition, it provides:   $1 trillion to States, counties, cities, territories, and Tribal  governments;   Hazard pay for essential workers;   Free widespread testing, tracing, and treatment for every American;   More direct payments to families.   It requires safety in the workplace and support for really small  businesses and nonprofits of all kinds.   Mr. Speaker, it meets the challenges of COVID-19 for every single  American, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it. It is a good bill.  It is a good bill for America.
