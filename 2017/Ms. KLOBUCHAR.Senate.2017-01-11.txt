 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 178 and ask  unanimous consent that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the  amendment by number.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Minnesota [Ms. Klobuchar] proposes an       amendment numbered 178.    The amendment is as follows:     (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to  lowering prescription drug prices for Americans by importing drugs from                                  Canada)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO LOWERING                     PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR AMERICANS BY                     IMPORTING DRUGS FROM CANADA         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution       for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments,       amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports       relating to lowering prescription drug prices, including       through the importation of safe and affordable prescription       drugs from Canada by American pharmacists, wholesalers, and       individuals with a valid prescription from a provider       licensed to practice in the United States, by the amounts       provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided       that such legislation would not increase the deficit over       either the period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through       2021 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2017 through       2026.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to ask that my  colleagues support this very important amendment with Senator Sanders.  I will match his passion with numbers.   The price of insulin, as our colleagues know, has tripled in the last  decade. The antibiotic doxycycline went from $20 a bottle to nearly  $2,000 a bottle in 6 months. Naloxone, the drug used to help with  overdose, went from $690 to $4,500 to date. We cannot sit here and do  nothing. We have an opportunity, for those who believe in the free  market, to allow in competition--competition from the safe country of  Canada, our neighbors to the north. In Minnesota, we can see Canada  from our porch, and we want to see that competition come in and save  our constituents' lives.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Madam Clerk, how am I recorded?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is not recorded.    Madam Clerk, how am I recorded?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is not recorded.    Because there is no plan in the alternative, I vote  no.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is not allowed during a vote.   The Senate will be in order.
