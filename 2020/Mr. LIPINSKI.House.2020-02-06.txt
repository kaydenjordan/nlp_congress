 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Scott.   I am a proud supporter of the hardworking men and women of our  Nation, and no one does more for American workers than organized labor.  Workers standing together and bargaining collectively have been  instrumental in building our country and our middle class for more than  a century. Unions helped bring tens of millions of good-paying jobs to  Americans by working for fair and safe workplaces and better wages and  benefits.   In Chicagoland, we are fortunate to have many labor unions fighting  every day to improve the lives of workers and their families. Across my  district, thousands display a lawn sign created by Chicago Federation  of Labor that reads, ``Proud Union Home.''   But, sadly, some are now trying to hinder collective bargaining and  undermine the National Labor Relations Act just at a time when workers  need greater protection.   Mr. Chair, today, I urge my colleagues to support American workers,  support American prosperity, and vote to pass the PRO Act.
