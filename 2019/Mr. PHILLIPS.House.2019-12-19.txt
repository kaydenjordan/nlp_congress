 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5377,  the bipartisan Restoring Tax Fairness to States and Localities Act,  legislation that will provide immediate relief to American families.   Elimination of the State and local tax deduction in the 2017 tax law  was a bad deal for the State of Minnesota, the people of my district,  and millions across the country. In fact, the SALT cap is a punishment  for States that invest in schools, roads, and people, and it is  punishment to hardworking families in those States who deserve our  appreciation and gratitude--not a tax increase.   Matthew and Karen are two educators in my district who bought a home  for their young family just 3 years ago. Now, with the increased tax  burden, they face the real prospect of losing their home and having to  move farther away from their kids' school and community.   I am fighting hard for this bill, and I am on a mission to make the  tax code more equitable for the people of my State--one that already  shares much more of its hard-earned money with Washington than it gets  back in return--and particularly for people like Matthew and Karen.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  come together to end the SALT cap and repeal such a punitive mistake.
