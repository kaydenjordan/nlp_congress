 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1917, the Hazard  Eligibility and Local Projects Act.   This bipartisan legislation will let communities recover from  disasters more efficiently, and even more importantly, better prepare  these communities for the next disaster.   H.R. 1917 provides assistance for certain mitigation projects that  began before the grant was applied for. Last Congress, the House also  worked in a bipartisan manner to pass this very practical bill under  suspension of the rules. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time as I  have no additional speakers.   In closing, H.R. 1917 benefits our communities by allowing them to be  eligible for Federal disaster mitigation assistance for projects  started prior to their request for assistance. I believe that this bill  is a good bill, and I urge support of this bipartisan legislation. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank Ranking Member  Graves for his leadership on this important piece of legislation that  would eliminate hurdles and leverage Economic Development  Administration dollars to invest in broadband deployment across  America's rural communities.   By utilizing public-private partnerships and consortia between  internet service providers and economic development agencies, EDA  dollars could be leveraged to deploy broadband and spur modern economic  development for rural and economically distressed communities.   Many of these consortia exist within the private sector, including  many large corporations working to deploy broadband across vast rural  areas. However, EDA funds have been held back from small towns and  communities working to attract private investment in their communities.  The E-BRIDGE Act would directly respond to the needs of these  communities and provide flexibility to leverage in-kind services and  other Federal resources.   The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the necessity of the internet  in our lives and the need to close the digital divide that exists  between rural and urban areas. This bill is supported by The App  Association, American Farm Bureau, and the National Association of  Development Organizations.   I appreciate the chairman and ranking member for bringing this  legislation to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3709, the Preliminary Damage  Assessment Improvement Act of 2021, introduced by the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Katko).   FEMA's preliminary disaster assessment is crucial when determining  eligibility for disaster assistance. This bill will ensure State and  local stakeholders are involved in reviewing and developing  recommendations for improving this process. This bill will help reduce  unnecessary delays and get assistance to disaster survivors more  quickly so they can recover faster and move forward with their lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.   H.R. 3709 makes disaster recovery easier for victims by improving  State and local communities' abilities to coordinate with FEMA when  determining the impacts of major disasters.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this important bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6144]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2220, which would allow the General  Services Administration, or GSA, to enter into bargain-price purchasing  agreements in situations where the buying of Federal property is the  cheaper alternative to a long-term lease.   Designed as a measure to bring free-market efficiency into Federal  real estate, H.R. 2220 would save taxpayers from costly, long-term  lease contracts where bargain purchases better suit the situation.   For example, the Tacoma Union Station purchase approved by the  Transportation Committee earlier this year shows the benefits of  allowing these bargain-price purchases. Prior to a scoring rule change,  the GSA negotiated a $1 purchase price of the facility in order to  undertake necessary seismic and building system modernizations.   By purchasing the property, the GSA will be making the needed  investments to modernize the facility for Federal use while realizing a  lease cost avoidance of approximately $6.4 million and protecting  American taxpayer dollars.   This legislation provides a commonsense correction that will continue  this committee's work in reducing the taxpayers' burden in Federal real  estate.   I appreciate the chair and ranking member of the committee for  bringing this legislation to the floor and my colleague and friend from  Indiana, Congressman   Greg Pence, and his office's work on this issue  in the previous Congress.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence).    Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 2220 ensures that the GSA  is able to negotiate discounted purchase options and leases to save  potentially billions in taxpayer dollars.   I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 390, which designates the Federal building  located in Memphis, Tennessee, as the Odell Horton Federal Building.   Judge Odell Horton served his community with great honor and great  distinction.   I thank Transportation Committee members Representatives Cohen and  Burchett, along with members of the Tennessee delegation, for their  leadership and bipartisan work on this bill.   I also know that my colleagues in the Senate are very interested in  this issue, and I hope that we can work together to find a resolution  that works for both Chambers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, it is appropriate to honor  Judge Horton's service to our country by naming this building after  him.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4679 designates the U.S. Department of  Transportation headquarters as the Norman Yoshio Mineta Federal  Building.   Norman Mineta served as both the chairman and ranking member of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and, later, as the  Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Both his work on  the committee and as DOT Secretary demonstrates his commitment to  public service.   Madam Speaker, I know that our colleagues in the Senate are also very  interested in this issue, and I hope that we can work together to find  a resolution that works for both Chambers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to again recognize Norman Mineta  for his service on both the committee and the U.S. Department of  Transportation.   Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4660, which designates the  Federal  [[Page H6147]]  Building and U.S. Courthouse located in Wheeling, West Virginia, as the  Frederick P. Stamp, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse  in honor of Judge Frederick Stamp.   I thank my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. McKinley, for his  leadership on this bill. I know that our colleagues in the Senate are  very interested in this issue, and we want to work together with them  so we can resolve this. I hope my colleagues will support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think it is appropriate to recognize Judge  Stamp's service to our country by naming this Federal building after  him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
