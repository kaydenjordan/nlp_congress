 Mr. President, first, I am going to commend the senior  Senator from Florida for what he said. Throughout my career, I have  been so impressed and so grateful for his strong voice on the  environment. He is the only Member of this body who has seen Earth from  space.    Mr. President, I hope the Saudi royal family was paying  attention to yesterday's debate in the U.S. Senate. The bipartisan vote  on S.J. Res. 54, of which I am a cosponsor, was significant for  multiple reasons, but most of all for what it says about the potency of  the outrage and disgust in this country and in the Congress about the  conduct of Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi Crown Prince.   That outrage has been building over time, as the number of civilian  casualties since Saudi Arabia's intervention and ongoing aerial  bombardment of Yemen--one of the world's poorest countries--has swollen  into the thousands. We have all seen the photographs of the dead and  dying and of children who are just skin and bones. It is said that  85,000 children already have starved to death. The UN warns that 13  million Yemeni civilians could starve to death by the end of this year,  if the war does not end.   Of course, the Houthis and their Iranian benefactors share much of  the blame for the death and destruction in Yemen, but we are not  supporting them. Rather, until recently, we were providing aerial  refueling for Saudi warplanes, and we continue to provide the Saudis  with intelligence and targeting assistance.   As if the kidnapping of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri, the blockade  of Qatar, the imprisonment of women's rights activists, and the carnage  in Yemen were not enough, the outrage toward the Crown Prince finally  boiled over with the horrific, premeditated murder of Jamal Khashoggi,  a respected journalist, Saudi citizen, and American resident, who had  criticized the royal family.   Mr. Khashoggi's murder and dismemberment by Saudi Government agents  at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul triggered an international outcry,  and it exposed the depth of depravity of the Saudi royal family. That  an ally of the United States would so brazenly commit such a crime and  then so blatantly attempt to cover it up, speaks volumes.   After a string of lies by the Saudi authorities, it is only due to  the Turkish  [[Page S7230]]  Government and independent investigative journalists that we know that  Mr. Khashoggi was murdered, a crime punishable by death in Saudi Arabia  and many other countries. In fact, far lesser crimes--even some  nonviolent crimes--are punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.   While we owe thanks to the Turkish Government for exposing the facts  about Mr. Khashoggi's case, we cannot ignore that Turkey's President  Erdogan is also responsible for widespread repression, including the  arbitrary arrests and imprisonment of journalists, civil servants, and  thousands of other critics who have been convicted and locked away  after unfair trials. Torture is rampant in Turkey's jails, as it is in  Saudi Arabia.   We know that multiple Saudi officials, including the Foreign  Minister, Minister of Interior, Ambassador to the United States, and  others--all members of the royal family--lied to the world, including  on international television, repeatedly changing their story about what  happened to Mr. Khashoggi. Perhaps most revealing was how cavalierly  and shamelessly they lied, clearly assuming that their lies would be  accepted at face value.   According to press reports the impulsive Crown Prince, while  disclaiming any involvement in or knowledge of the crime, shortly after  Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance referred to him as a ``dangerous  jihadist,'' which was also false.   The Saudis have yet to say what happened to Khashoggi's remains,  except that they were turned over to a ``local collaborator.'' Who and  where is that person? What more are they hiding?   Reports indicate that the Saudis sent a team to Istanbul to destroy  evidence of the crime, during the very period when the White House and  State Department were insisting that the Saudi Government deserved more  time to determine the facts. Instead, the Saudis were trying to cover  their tracks.   There is every reason to believe that the Saudi royal family is still  lying about who was involved.   We also know that, before murdering Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudi  Government has had a long history of abducting, imprisoning, and  executing dissidents and others after sham trials in violation of  international law.   In the United States, the media's attention, for a time, was diverted  by President Trump's racist rants about a so-called migrant invasion,  his made up claims of voter fraud, his partisan lies about Democrats,  his steady stream of vitriolic and divisive rhetoric that has incited  others to violence here and abroad, premidterm election frenzy, and now  its aftermath.   I mention this because, for the past few weeks, the murder of Mr.  Khashoggi had been eclipsed by other headlines. No longer. The vote on  S.J. Res. 54 is the Senate's initial answer to the Saudi royal family  and to the Trump administration.   This crime, on top of everything else, was so wicked, so repulsive,  that no amount of money, no amount of oil, and no amount of lies can  obscure it.   The Trump administration lobbied hard against the resolution, warning  that, despite the Saudi royal family's many transgressions the U.S.- Saudi relationship is too important to risk. No one is seeking to sever  relations with Saudi Arabia. But far more important is that the United  States stands for the truth, for justice, for the laws of war, and that  we don't stand by when top officials of another government, whether  ally or adversary, conspire to murder a journalist or dissident and lie  about it.   As of today, the Saudi authorities continue to ignore appeals to  reveal what happened to Khashoggi's remains. After so many lies, they  insist that the 18 men under arrest are the only ones involved in Mr.  Khashoggi's murder. No one who knows anything about the Saudi royal  family, which controls the Saudi Government with an iron fist, believes  that.   President Trump, who has been loath to say anything that might  implicate the Saudi royal family, at one point said there would be  ``very severe'' consequences if investigations conclude that the Saudis  are responsible. Since then, even as it has become obvious that the  Saudis, including the Crown Prince, are responsible, he has said  nothing further about what those consequences would be. To the  contrary, he said ``maybe he was, maybe he wasn't,'' but either way, it  doesn't matter to President Trump.   Secretary Pompeo has said that Saudi Arabia has made a ``serious  commitment'' to hold senior leaders and officials accountable for the  murder of Mr. Khashoggi; yet so far, no senior Saudi leader or official  has been arrested, and the Saudis appear to have rejected the Turkish  Government's demand that the 18 individuals who have been arrested be  turned over to face justice where the crime occurred.   According to press reports, the conclusion of U.S. intelligence  experts is that such a heinous, premeditated crime by Saudi agents  inside the Saudi consulate could not have taken place without the Crown  Prince's knowledge and support. Does anyone seriously believe  otherwise? Yet yesterday, the CIA Director was barred by the White  House from meeting with Senators to answer questions about this.  Knowing what we do about this White House, the inescapable conclusion  is that whatever she would have told us would have contradicted the  President's defense of the Saudi Government.   Despite all the Saudis' phony denials, the President appears disposed  to ignore his own intelligence experts and rely instead on the Saudi  royal family to investigate itself. Why? To protect billions of dollars  in contracts for U.S. weapons purchased by the Saudis for use in Yemen.  The White House has apparently concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin  Salman will ride out this storm and remain in power for years to come.   Journalists the world over face unprecedented dangers. Those who  criticize corrupt, repressive governments do so at great risk to their  own safety and the safety of their families. They are regularly the  targets of harassment, threats, and assassination for nothing more than  doing their job. If the Saudi royal family can escape punishment for  the premeditated murder of a Washington Post journalist, what does that  say to journalists everywhere? What does it say about the United  States, if we are willing to accept that?   Yesterday, the vote to discharge S.J. Res. 54 showed that we do not  and will not accept it. If the Saudi royal family hopes to salvage its  tattered reputation and relations with the United States, it will need  to take far more decisive action to end the mayhem in Yemen and bring  to justice all those responsible for murdering Jamal Khashoggi.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay  tribute to Luigi Telara, who passed away earlier this year on April 1.  An Italian sculptor who hailed from the marble quarries of Carrara,  Italy, Luigi's life was one of hard work, dedication, and beauty. While  he spent a majority of his life in Italy, Luigi lived in Proctor, VT,  where he worked for the Vermont Marble Company for 6 years. Although  his time in America was short, the impact of his work can still be seen  today in Vermont, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and even  right here in the U.S. Capitol.   Although fostered and honed in his home country, Luigi's love for the  art of sculpting spread far beyond his European roots. After attending  Professional Institute for Marble, Industry, and Crafts--l'Istituto  Professionale per l'Industria e l'Artigianato del Marmo--and later on  Magistero d'Arte in Florence, the State of Vermont was lucky enough to  become a second home and a source of inspiration for Luigi's grand  marblework and refined artistry. He joined the Vermont Marble Company  in 1955, where he was able to sculpt pieces we continue to feature here  today, on the steps of our Capitol.   It was during his 6 years at the Vermont Marble Company that Luigi  Telara made his mark on our great democratic institution with his  assistance in the creation of the plaster models of the god of war and  goddess of peace statues that stand atop the Capitol steps. ``War'' is  a male figure with his head slightly titled and his gaze fixed ahead,  ready to conquer what is ahead of him. To the right of ``War'' is  ``Peace,'' standing in a contrapposto pose, holding a fruit-bearing  olive branch in her left hand, extending it towards ``War.''   Luigi's work should serve as a subtle reminder of what is at stake  when you  [[Page S7231]]  are a Member of the Senate, the Nation's conscience. An important  message that is too often overlooked. Next time you are running up the  steps to make it for a vote, take a second to appreciate the dedication  to detail that was put into the statues by Luigi, by Francesco Tonelli,  by Franco Marchini, and by Geno Fregosi at the Vermont Marble Company.   Following his tenure at the Vermont Marble Company, Luigi went back  to his hometown of Carrara where he became a teacher at the Instituto  d'Arte Felice Palama di Massa and held the position of chair for 30  years. He never lost his passion for the art of sculpting, as he would  continue to carve as a private practice.   Although not a citizen on paper, Luigi exemplified what it means to  be an American. The United States is a country of immigrants after all,  a great melting pot of cultures, and as Luigi's life and work  demonstrated, our democratic institutions are the better for their  service. Legacies like Luigi's serve as a reminder of what we as a  nation lose when we put up walls and close our doors to those seeking  to do what our ancestors did before us. We must not turn inward. We  must continue to shine our great light and be the beacon of hope for  the rest of the world.                            ____________________
