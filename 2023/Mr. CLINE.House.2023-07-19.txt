 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration's radical open  border policies have turned every community into a border community.   Since President Biden took office, CBP officials have encountered a  record high of 5.5 million illegal immigrants at the southern border,  and nearly 2 million of those have been released into our Nation.   Unfortunately, to deal with this crisis, liberal cities such as New  York City are planning to house migrants in public schools--setting a  dangerous precedent. This brings an unnecessary problem that  administrators are simply not equipped to handle, nor should they have  to.   That is unacceptable, which is why I am proud to join my colleagues  in passing the Schools Not Shelters Act. This legislation would ban the  use of taxpayer-funded schools as shelters for illegal migrants.   America's schools should be focused on providing the best  opportunities for students, not be forced to deal with the  repercussions of President Biden's failure to secure the border.                            ____________________
