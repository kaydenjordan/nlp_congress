 Mr. President, I wish to speak on S. 1862, the  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2017.    I appreciate the Senator's question and his partnership  with me on this legislation to advance the fight against modern-day  slavery.   Our bill and the underlying Trafficking Victims Protection Act are  designed to eliminate forced labor around the world and do not affect  the Exchange Visitor Programs, under the J-1 visa, which is authorized  by Congress and administered by the State Department. The J-1 exchange  programs are important tools that Congress authorized to enhance mutual  exchange and cultural understanding between people in the United States  and other countries, and they are subject to regulatory safeguards and  oversight by the Department of State. Recruitment and placement fees  referenced in S. 1862 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act are  fundamentally different from the program fees in our international  exchange programs, which are fees required to be charged to program  participants who receive J-1 visas in order to fund the program. Our  legislation does not affect the exchange programs, which are an  important diplomatic tool which I strongly support.    I thank the Senator from New Jersey and our distinguished  ranking member for his question and for working with me to pass this  important legislation.                            ____________________
