 Mr. Speaker, each January, we honor the life of  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for all he did to help us live out the  true meaning of our creed.   Dr. King dedicated his life to justice and equality, and he died for  it. But even with his ideals, Dr. King would have never had the impact  he did if it weren't for his willingness to dedicate his life to  service. That path of service is open to us all.   As Dr. King said: ``You don't have to have a college degree to serve.  You don't have to have to make your subject and your verb agree to  serve. You don't have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve.''   Dr. King knew that service isn't about your education or your  background. It is about much more than that. He taught us all that all  you need to serve is ``a heart full of grace, a soul generated by  love.''   That path is not an easy one, but it is one we can all take, and we  should.                            ____________________
