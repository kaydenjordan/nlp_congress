 Madam Speaker, I know I am going to be the third  Democratic speaker to talk about the debt limit, but I think it is a  point that needs to be made.   Madam Speaker, every single day Americans across our country are  forced to take extraordinary measures just to keep a roof over their  head and food on the table. Now, because of the extremist agenda of  some of our Republican colleagues, the Department of the Treasury has  begun to do the same to avoid a default.   The consequences of such a default could be catastrophic. The first  real default in U.S. history could lead to a sudden jump in interest  rates and raise mortgage, car, and credit card payments for our working  families. As the Federal Government struggles to maintain its financial  commitments, payments for Social Security, benefits for veterans, and  paychecks for military servicemembers could be delayed and suspended.   By one estimate, a default could add $130,000 to the cost of an  average 30-year mortgage, eliminate over 3 million jobs, and increase  the national debt by an additional $850 billion. As much as $15  trillion in household wealth could be wiped out in the ensuing  recession. Our competitors across the world, like China and Russia,  would surely see this U.S. default as an indication of American decline  and be further emboldened.   As the Representative of Hawaii's Second Congressional District, I  speak on behalf of the diverse communities I represent, spanning all  eight Hawaiian islands. I am here to fight for working families  struggling with the high cost of living, small businesses providing  jobs and opportunities for our residents, senior citizens seeking  security in retirement in old age, and above all, our children and  their futures.   In my first month alone on this job, we find our country inching  toward a debt crisis at the national level that could devastate my  constituents and their ability to care for their families--all caused  by the extreme politics of my Republican colleagues.  [[Page H288]]    This is not a short-term, one-off issue. The implications for our  economy, on our foreign policy, and on our communities are severe and  long term.   When I sit down at my kitchen table every night and look across at my  sons, I worry. Will they have their own kitchen table filled with  family in Hawaii?                                time  1045    If Republicans force our country into a default, their future will be  even more challenging to afford a home of their own or to be able to  even rent one, to own a car to get to work or to save for their  children's future.   Hawaii is one of the most expensive places to live in the country,  with residents paying on average 42 percent of their income on rent,  the highest of any State. I know that workers and families of every  single one of our districts are struggling every day to make ends meet.   The American people need to see solutions, not just grandstanding.  They need to see progress so that they can hope for a better future.  That means we have to build and act on the progress delivered by the  first 2 years of the Biden administration and one of the most  productive Congresses in modern history. In these 2 years, Democrats  have lowered healthcare costs, created nearly 11 million jobs,  supported over 10 million new small business applications, put shovels  in the ground on 7,000 new infrastructure projects, and invested in a  revival of American manufacturing.   This Congress should be building on the progress of the last 2 years,  not tearing it down by flirting with default and make unacceptable  demands to cut Social Security, Medicare, and other critical programs  that working families across the country depend on.   Why would House Republicans hold our economy hostage and the American  people in anxious suspense for months when they can pass a clean debt  limit increase right now?   When House Republicans tried to do this in 2011, they forced an  unnecessary economic shock to our country that resulted in the first  time our credit has ever been downgraded in our history. We cannot do  that again.   We can have a reasoned debate, discussion, and negotiations over the  right level of government spending, as every Congress does every year  through the budget and appropriations process. But whether the United  States pays its bill on time must not be a pawn in a Republican  political game. Our families work hard to pay their bills on time;  their government should too.   I have heard from so many people how much they love Hawaii; so do I.  If you have the chance to visit our home stop and take a look. One in  five residents depend on their Social Security benefits every single  month. Madam Speaker, 1 in 10 people who call Hawaii home are veterans  or Active-Duty servicemembers. These are the faces of the people held  hostage and hurt by Republicans.   We have an opportunity to rise above our differences and give them a  Congress that has their best interests squarely in sight, one that  gives them hope.   Madam Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to work with us to  quickly pass a clean debt limit raise as soon as possible. The American  people and our constituents deserve no less.                            ____________________
