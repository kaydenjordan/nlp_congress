 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule to  advance this cruel, extreme, and unworkable default on America act that  will throw us into a recession, that will crash our economy, and that  will throw 1.7 million women and children off of nutrition assistance  and seniors off of Medicare.   It is hypocrisy for my Republican colleagues to say that they somehow  suddenly care about the debt when they passed the 2017 tax scam that  increased the deficit by $2 trillion. Nearly half of those tax cuts  went to the top 5 percent, but now, all of a sudden, they care about  debt and want to cut nutrition assistance to nearly 3 million women,  children, and seniors.   Democrats cut child poverty in half, and we taxed the wealthiest  billionaires and corporations to pay their fair share. We are building  our economy while MAGA Republicans are threatening to throw us into  chaos, and that is on the pocketbooks of regular, working Americans,  who are going to suffer if we go into default, if we go into recession,  and if we lose millions of jobs.   This is a bad bill. Vote ``no.''
