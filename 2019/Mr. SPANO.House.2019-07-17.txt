 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  582, which would more than double the Federal minimum wage.   Numerous studies show that doubling the minimum wage to $15 an hour  would be catastrophic for small businesses. The Congressional Budget  Office estimates that this bill would result in the loss of up to 3.7  million jobs, which is approximately the same number of people who live  in the State of Oklahoma.   When I started my own business, I went without a salary for a full  year to invest in the business, to pay for overhead, and to keep my  employees paid. I could not have borne these expenses under a $15  minimum wage.   I think of my scheduler, Naomi Hilton. As a teenager, I hired her in  my small business to be the receptionist in my office. She worked hard,  and within a year she was promoted to legal assistant, and then to  paralegal, and eventually she earned more than $15 an hour.   If not for a much lower minimum wage, I would never have been able to  start my business, hire Naomi, and pay her more than the minimum wage  proposed in this bill.   I support higher wages for all, and the economy has given us these  jobs without costing millions of jobs and thousands of small  businesses.                            ____________________
