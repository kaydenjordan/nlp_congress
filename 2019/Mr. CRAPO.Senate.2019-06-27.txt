 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator  James Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ  Fulcher, I congratulate Trent Clark on his upcoming retirement from the  Bayer Corporation after 26 years of service. We have greatly enjoyed  working with Trent over the course of his career and thank him for the  service he has provided to the people of Idaho in both his official and  individual capacities.   On behalf of Bayer, Trent has provided steadfast dedication to his  responsibilities inherent as public and government affairs director. In  that role, he has provided invaluable assistance to Bayer's operations  in Soda Springs, which are an integral part of the southeastern Idaho  economy. Most notably, Trent has played a critical role in the effort  to permit Bayer's next phosphate mine, Caldwell Canyon, which has 40  years of estimated reserves and will be one of the world's most  environmentally sustainable mining operations, particularly in its  approach to sage grouse habitat. Trent has also helped to further  important company efforts to support our local communities,  particularly their school systems, and to protect our environment.  Additionally, for many years, Trent has worked in a collaborative  manner with key stakeholders with a genuine humility and desire to  achieve a positive outcome.   As an individual citizen, Trent has also provided excellent service  to the people of Idaho in his capacity as chairman of the Idaho  Workforce Development Council and as a member of the boards of the  Idaho Humanities Council, Idaho Community Foundation, and the Idaho  Association of Commerce and Industry. Trent's prior public service  includes 2 years as the State executive director of the Farm Services  Administration, 3 years as chairman of the Idaho Republican Party, a  year as staff to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, and 8 years  as staff to former U.S. Senator Steve D. Symms.   Prior to joining Bayer, Trent graduated with honors from Brigham  Young University, where he majored in political science and botany. He  also earned an associate of arts degree from Ricks College in Rexburg,  ID. After college, Trent worked as a botany instructor for the  Yellowstone Institute, as well an executive vice president for the Fox  Creek Pack Station.   In addition to Trent's strong record of leadership and service to the  community, Trent has served his family and church well. Trent has been  married to the former Rebecca Lee since May 23, 1986, and together,  they have four children: Brittany (deceased), Kathleen, Christin, and  Alexander. Trent and his family enjoy horseback riding and backcountry  hiking and camping. It is our sincere wish that Trent be blessed with  many years of retirement with his family.                            ____________________
