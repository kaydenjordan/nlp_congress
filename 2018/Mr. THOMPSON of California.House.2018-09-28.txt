 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bill.   This bill represents a gross disregard for the responsibilities  entrusted to us by our constituents. We are the stewards of Medicare, a  critical support for nearly every American at some point in their  lives. This bill will trigger hundreds of millions of dollars in  across-the-board cuts to that important program.   We are responsible for the Federal Tax Code, a charge that requires  us to consider tax proposals fully and fairly. Yet, we will vote on  this unpaid-for tax bill developed behind closed doors without the  benefit of a single hearing. Most important, we are the custodians of  the Federal budget.   With passage of this bill, Republicans will have added more than $3  trillion to our national debt in less than a year. This is a handout  for the rich at the expense of our children and our grandchildren. It  is an excuse for the majority party to ransack Medicare and Social  Security. It is dangerous, and it is reckless. We should vote ``no'' on  this bill.
