 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1934) to prevent catastrophic failure or shutdown of remote  diesel power engines due to emission control devices, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1934         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Remote Generator       Reliability and Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. REVISION OF REGULATIONS REQUIRED.         (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Environmental       Protection Agency shall revise section 60.4216(c) of title       40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of       enactment of this Act), by striking ``that was not       certified'' and all that follows through ``compared to       engine-out emissions'' and inserting ``must have that engine       certified as meeting at least Tier 3 PM standards''.        (b) Emissions and Energy Reliability Study.--Not later than       1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in       consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall submit to       the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate       and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives a report assessing options for the Federal       Government to assist remote areas in the State of Alaska in       meeting the energy needs of those areas in an affordable and       reliable manner using--        (1) existing emissions control technology; or        (2) other technology that achieves emissions reductions       similar to the technology described in paragraph (1).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a targeted exemption for remote villages in  Alaska from EPA's most recent emissions rules on diesel generators.   EPA and State officials have found that diesel generators compliant  with the most recent standards do not work reliably in harsh, cold  winter conditions. To preserve the health and safety of the people  relying on diesel generators, these are less strict but actually  workable standards.   Our colleagues in the Senate passed this bill with unanimous consent.  It is reasonable legislation that deserves our support.   I see Senators Whitehouse and Carper were supportive of this bill. It  comes out of the Committee on Environment and Public Works.   Mr. Speaker, I ask our colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Alaska (Mr. Young), the only House Member from Alaska and the dean of  the House.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, just to help clarify the argument,  obviously, I have a few questions.   Define an isolated village.    How long would that flight be?    How many people are in an isolated village?    If the gentleman will continue to yield for a last  question, I hear that these new generators cost around $66,000 to  $75,000?    So if you have 60 people, that is $1,000 each.    I thank my colleague for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I will just continue to respond to what the  chairman said.   I think if we are going to err, we ought to err on the health and  safety of Alaskans. I hope my colleagues will join us. I look forward  to working with them in the next Congress?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
