 Mr. Speaker, Big Tech is crushing competition and crushing  conservative speech. H.R. 3843 contains three important measures that  will help America with Big Tech.   The first gives State attorneys general the ability to file their  lawsuits and keep those lawsuits in their States. The 48 State  attorneys general have asked Congress to move this bill forward. It  received broad bipartisan support in the Committee on the Judiciary.   The second is a bill that Senator Hawley and our colleague,  Congressman Fitzgerald, have supported. It basically prohibits China  from buying small high-tech companies so that they can steal our  innovation.   The third bill that is combined with H.R. 3843 raises filing fees.  Make no mistake, there are controls on these filing fees. They have to  be appropriated for the FTC by the Appropriations Committee. That is a  control. The Appropriations Committee, I hope, will be under Republican  control in the next Congress, and it will be controlled so that nobody  in the FTC is using these funds in an inappropriate way, other than  reviewing the mergers at issue.   Mr. Speaker, my friend Senator Cruz has said it absolutely correctly:  The greatest threat to democracy in this country is Big Tech.   Senator Lee, Senator Cotton, and Senator Grassley support the House  version of this bill because it is a conservative bill, a bipartisan  bill, and a bill that will help America deal with Big Tech. I hope my  colleagues will support H.R. 3843.
