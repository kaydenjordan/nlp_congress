 Mr. President, it is Thursday, and I am back on the  Senate floor, partaking in one of my favorite times of the week, which  is to come down to the floor and talk about somebody who is making a  great difference in my State. We call this individual our Alaskan of  the Week. To those who watch the floor back home, sometimes we break  the rules a little bit and recognize more than one person. We just call  them the Alaskans of the Week, with an ``s.'' Pandemic or no pandemic,  I think it is still important that we come down and recognize,  particularly during these challenging times, people who are making a  difference in our State and across our country.   As I mentioned last week, this pandemic is definitely testing the  character of our Nation. You might remember, right when it was hitting,  some reporters from the Washington Post wrote a story, saying that  Americans are going to be tested and that they don't think they are  going to be able to pass--maybe not like they had in World War II and  at other times--that the mettle, the toughness, and the resiliency of  Americans might not be able to get us through this. That was the  Washington Post--classic, clueless, inside-the-beltway reporting.   In my remarks on the floor--this was about 6 weeks ago--I said: You  ought to come up to Alaska, Washington Post, and see my constituents,  or maybe come out with my marines and see the marines.   You have to know America. Alaska is America, and we are going to pass  this test as a nation, and we are--all across the country and certainly  in my great State. In small, rural villages and in urban centers, from  the tundra to the rainforests, all across the State, people are helping  each other. They are passing out food. They are helping the elderly,  making sure they are not lonely. They are tending to those in need and  are displaying generosity, strength, and amazing resilience. The paper  should write more about that.   Our frontline workers have now become our national heroes. Some of  them are working day in and day out to ensure that our grocery stores  are stocked, that the goods are transported, that the buildings are  maintained, that our telecommunication systems are running, that our  airplanes are flying, that our hospitals are open, and that our  community healthcare workers can give care. The list, as we all know,  goes on and on and on.   Because of those back home, because of these great Americans all  around our country, and because of what is happening in my State with  our State's leadership, Alaska has done well from a health standpoint  in terms of this virus. Knock on wood, of course--and I am doing it-- things could change. They could change anywhere. They certainly could  change in Alaska, but so far so good.   Alaskans are known for their rugged individualism. Alaskans are not  naturally people who automatically follow  [[Page S2467]]  orders without having a good reason to do so, but almost everybody  across our State has taken this virus seriously in their helping one  another and in their following the guidance that has been given by our  State's leaders. I chalk that up to good leadership from our very  attentive mayors--city mayors, borough mayors--to our local leaders  across the State, to our Governor, Mike Dunleavy, and to the healthcare  team he put together in his administration that was ready when this  pandemic hit.   I am going to talk about the healthcare team. It has been led by the  commissioner of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services,  Adam Crum, and by Alaska's chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink. Both  of them are our Alaskans of the week. They have both worked day and  night throughout these past several weeks since this pandemic has hit  our Nation, has hit my State, and they have been trying around the  clock to keep our fellow Alaskans safe. As I mentioned, both are more  than deserving of this very, very prestigious award. They have risen to  the challenge in so many impressive ways in working for their State and  their country.   As Alaskans do, both of them have interesting life stories,  compelling life stories. Let me tell you a little bit about both of  them.   Adam Crum lives in Wasilla with Colleen, his wife. He was born and  raised in Alaska. He grew up on the Kenai Peninsula and went to Homer  High School. He was a graduate there and a good football player. He  went to Northwestern and walked on the football team. That is Big Ten  football. That takes a lot of guts--center, guard, offensive lineman.  He did great there.   In fact, look at the Crums, his siblings. They are a big family-- impressive, a big group. There are brains and brawn in that family.  Adam's three brothers all played college ball--Joey at Puget Sound,  Richie at the University of Idaho, and Cody at West Texas A&M. Their  dad also played at the University of Arkansas. Like I said, when you  line up the Crum brothers, you look like you have a serious pro- football offensive line right there. It is an impressive family.   Adam enjoyed Northwestern and playing ball there, but on his first  visit back home from college, he began to realize just how unique the  great State of Alaska was where he grew up. He said: ``For me, I really  didn't appreciate it until I actually went someplace else.''   Like all of us who love the outdoors, the scenery, the diversity, the  opportunities, when he moved back from college, he was committed to  coming back to our State to serve our State. He went into his family  business. He got his master's degree in public health from Johns  Hopkins University. Then, when Governor Dunleavy, whom I mentioned, was  elected in November of 2018, Adam was offered the job of commissioner  of Health and Social Services.   His starting date was going to be December 3, 2018, but in Alaska,  there are always adventures and challenges, and on November 30, the  south central part of our State got hit with a huge shock, a huge  earthquake--7.1. There were cracking and collapsing roads and highways.  It damaged buildings, destroyed schools, knocked out power, and sent  people scrambling outside and under furniture. It really damaged  homes. So Adam, who was going to start this job in 3 days, said: I am  going to start now. He moved up the start date and got to work.    It was a crash course in health emergency operations. Brand new on  the job, his Health and Human Services department was in touch with all  the hospitals, all the prisons, the elder care facilities, the  Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. He watched and led these  operations, everybody working together. Here is the miracle: In this  huge earthquake during rush hour in Alaska, not one life was lost. It  was remarkable--literally a miracle. He learned how to bring people  together in emergency operations. That exercise was invaluable with  what came next, and we all know what came next--the pandemic which has  rocked our State, our country, and really our world.   Alaska's chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, appears with  Commissioner Adam Crum and Governor Dunleavy nearly every night to  address Alaskans and our media in a press conference about where we are  with regard to the health of our State and this coronavirus. Versions  of this scene happen nearly every night across the country as Governors  are addressing their public. But I am willing to venture to say that if  there is a marker of success with such briefings, it is this: how much  the people are trusting of what is being told to them. I would state  that Alaska's healthcare team, Commissioner Crum and Dr. Zink, have  passed with flying colors.   Dr. Zink is certainly one of the stars of this nightly show as she  appears from her yurt in her backyard in Palmer, AK. She has become so  popular in Alaska that there is even a Facebook page dedicated to her  called ``Think like Zink.'' Rorie Watt, Juneau's city manager, actually  wrote an ode in her honor. It is a lengthy poem, and it starts like  this:         Oh Alaska, I love you and it feels like we are teetering on       the brink; who can guide and steer us? The unflappable Dr.       Zink!    You know if a poem is written about you, you are doing a good job.   Dr. Zink was raised in Colorado with physician parents. She was no  stranger to Alaska. She worked as a mountaineering guide in Alaska  during college. So after getting her M.D. from Stanford, she made her  way back to our great State 11 years ago and has worked as an ER doctor  in the Matanuska Valley.   Last July, she was with her family in Bhutan on a yearlong sabbatical  when she got a call from Adam Crum, asking her to come to be the  State's Chief Medical Officer. Commissioner Crum, speaking like a true  Big Ten football player, said: ``She was my number 1 draft pick.''   So Commissioner Crum made the smart decision to bring on Dr. Zink to  the medical team and healthcare team that he leads. Commissioner Crum  and Dr. Zink have, along with the rest of the country, been closely  watching the virus migrate from China to the United States since the  early stages. Remember what happened when the State Department brought  our diplomats home from Wuhan. A planeload of our diplomats were coming  home, and they had to stop in Anchorage on January 28 for a refueling  stop. We later learned that nobody on the plane actually had the virus,  but Commissioner Crum and Dr. Zink started to get our State ready. They  prepared for the worst, contacting local and Tribal medical facilities.  They were in constant coordination with the CDC. They were in  communications with all the State agencies and divisions and, very,  very importantly, with the public.   This began their outreach to our citizens. They have continued that  frenzied pace ever since, working day and night with the Governor's  office to try their best to keep the virus at bay, to keep our citizens  healthy, and so far it is working.   Like other places, businesses in Alaska have been shut down and are  now slowly beginning to open back up. We need to open back up. We need  to keep our citizens healthy, but we need to get our economy open and  moving again.   Among the other precautions, the Governor established a ban for a  time on travel throughout the State and a 14-day quarantine still in  place for anybody who comes from outside of Alaska to the State.  Commissioner Crum said that mandate was probably the most effective  thing they have done so far to keep the virus from spreading.   Again, that doesn't mean it can't flare up in Alaska. It has flared  up in other parts of our country. For example, we have some 200  villages that are not connected by roads and many of which do not have  healthcare facilities. If they do have them, they are very, very  limited. These communities were hit very hard by the Spanish flu, so  there is a lot of trepidation in rural Alaska.   We have a fishing season that will start and will begin to bring  people in from out of State--thousands of people--to work in Alaska.  This is very important for our economy, but the communities need to  feel safe. I have raised this issue with the President, the Vice  President, and the Chief of Staff, and to their credit they have  responded.    As a matter of fact, right now we have a doctor from DHS who is going  around the State, with Dr. Zink and others, who was sent there by  Admiral Brett Giroir, the HHS Assistant Secretary, in charge of  testing. They are  [[Page S2468]]  all out there. They are going to be in Kodiak, Bristol Bay, and  Cordova, trying to make sure that our fishing communities are ready.   When the admiral called me, he said: We are working with the State,  Senator Sullivan. This direction is from the highest senior officials  in the White House to get out there and bring resources to your fishing  communities, and I will say, working with Dr. Zink, she is one of the  top medical officers in the country. This is Admiral Giroir speaking  about Dr. Zink.   So as you can tell, the utmost diligence is required and so is  planning, communication, and bringing people along, particularly when  you are asking them to take extreme measures. Again, because of the  leadership we have, it is something that I think so far is going well  in our State.   Commissioner Crum said:         Alaskans are contrarian by nature. They want to be       educated. They don't want to be forced. When they were told       that it was the right thing to do, to comply with the       mandates--that if we do this now, it will hurt less later--      they did it.    Alaskans did this. Commissioner Crum continued:         It was the most painful thing I've ever done--asking people       to close their businesses. But not as painful as it was for       the people who actually had to shut down their business. But       Alaskans complied and we worked together.    True leaders emerge during times of crisis. We are grateful that  these two leaders emerged for us in Alaska. They are working, along  with the Governor and the rest of his team, to do a very good job for  our State.   Like I said, we aren't past this. We have enormous challenges in our  Nation and huge economic challenges in our State, but we know a few  things. We have good people at the top who are guiding us, and we know  that Alaskans will do the right thing when they are asked by these  people. We also know that we are resilient, our State, our people, and  our Nation.   In a recent interview, Dr. Zink said that one of her big takeaways  throughout this entire pandemic is just how important resilience is and  how very resilient Alaska is. She said, ``Adversity can bring out the  best and worst in people, and we have a choice to grow in response to  the challenges or crumble from them.''   Well, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I am convinced  that Alaska will grow from these challenges and that America will grow  from these challenges, and I am convinced that what we are seeing all  around our State and our Nation is amazing generosity, people working  together through these difficult times. We will emerge stronger and  more resilient.   So I want to thank two leaders in our State who are responsible, in  many ways, for getting us through, so far so good, on the health side,  Commissioner Crum and Dr. Zink. Thank you for your service. Thank you  for your hard work and your sacrifice. Thank you for stepping up and  congratulations on being our Alaskans of the Week.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
