 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the 50th  anniversary of the Apollo 11 series.   When I think of Apollo 11, I am reminded of a feeling that many of us  have forgotten in this current time of divisiveness and anger. Apollo  11 reminds me of an America that pulled together; a time when America  prioritized impossible dreams, because impossible dreams were what  built this country; a time when we understood that achieving those  impossible dreams was a way to make every child feel prouder to be an  American and every adversary feel that our Nation loomed larger than  they could hope to surmount.   As Americans, we work hard, we get better, then we become the best.   At its core, space exploration and the Moon landing were rooted in  the American Dream, and I believe that dream is still worth dreaming  today.   Fifty years later, the Apollo series and the space exploration of  that time remind us that we are part of something bigger than  ourselves. I stand here today as the congresswoman of a district that  is incredibly proud of our contributions to space technology, flight,  and exploration. Really, our contributions to bringing that dream to  life.   My district is home to many of the Edwards Air Force Base workers who  are critical to our country's defense and service. We often say that  the Antelope Valley is actually the aerospace valley because of how  much testing, research, and development takes place in our community.   The NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base  made countless contributions to the NASA human spaceflight program  during the sixties, from the X-15 rocket plane hypersonic research  program to the lunar landing research vehicle, both of which had a  direct impact on the Apollo missions. In fact, the first flight of a  lunar landing research vehicle was in 1964 at Edwards Air Force Base.  These vehicles were later used at Ellington Air Force Base to train the  Apollo flight crew, including Neil Armstrong.   For my constituents and so many others across the Nation, the  celebration of the Apollo mission is the celebration of our history. It  is the celebration of people like my grandfather, who worked on the  thrusters for the lunar lander. From 1961 to 1970, he was involved with  Apollo service module rocket development, qualification, and  production.   In talking with my grandfather, I have seen how much of a catalyst  this work is for our identity as Americans. The Moon shot gave so many  of us something to believe in, and that belief paid off in its enduring  impact to scientific discovery and commercial applications. We need to  realize that triumph in this generation of Americans.   My work on the House Armed Services Committee has also shown me that  the military and our defense capabilities simply don't work any longer  without a mastery of space. Our adversaries are on their way to the  Moon, and we have no choice but to be there, as well. That is a vital  part of how we maintain our status as the global leader that we have  always been. To keep our strongest position, we have to have a plan and  a strategy for space.   In doing so, we will inspire a generation of STEM workers, many of  them young women, people of color, and first-generation college  students, to be part of something great, something that defines our  identity as Americans. We will stimulate our economy, innovate products  that stretch beyond use in space, and contribute to our comfort and  well-being here in America.   On the 50th anniversary of Apollo, I am honored to champion a program  that unlocked so much American greatness. I am even more honored to  stand with the knowledge that greater things are yet to come. Together,  we can do so much and go so far, further than we have ever gone before.  Because we can. Because we have to. Because our security demands it.  Because, without doing so, we will never know what is possible. And as  humans, as Americans, we will not let the impossible stop us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give voice to  what so many individuals and families in my community and across the  country are feeling: deep anger at the threat of losing access to their  healthcare.   First, I have to condemn the developments in the Ninth Circuit case  that state title X providers can no longer lawfully refer women for  abortion services.   Healthcare is personal. The conversations that take place between a  woman and her doctor cannot be policed by Congress. These rules are  damaging to  [[Page H5926]]  providers and dangerous--possibly even deadly--to patients.   What is worse is that it is not just reproductive care. This  administration is using stacked courts to dismantle the healthcare  system that gives coverage to millions of Americans, including 60,000  individuals in my district, without even the vaguest plan to replace  it.   My colleagues and I are working every day to lower the cost of  prescription drugs and to ensure that we have a healthcare system that  works for everyone, while this administration tries to rip coverage  way. As Members of Congress, we owe it to our communities to fight back  against these rollbacks at every step, and we will.                            ____________________
