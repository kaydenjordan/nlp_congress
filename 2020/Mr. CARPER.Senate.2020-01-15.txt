 Madam President, before the senior Democrat, the ranking  member of the Finance Committee, leaves the floor and before the  Senator, my colleague from Ohio, leaves the floor, I want to thank them  both. We would not be here on this day without them and without their  leadership--both of them.   When Sherrod Brown says that he has never met a trade agreement he  wanted to even think about supporting--thank you for making this one  that virtually all of us can support. My highest regards.                 United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement    Madam President, I have a speech here that starts off with ``Mr.  President'' over and over again, but I am going to say ``Madam  President.'' I rise today to discuss the new treaty to replace the  North American Free Trade Agreement, affectionately known as NAFTA.   Last week, those of us who serve on the Finance Committee had an  opportunity to evaluate the new NAFTA. In fact, about a half dozen or  so committees have been given different jurisdictions to do that, with  respect to this trade agreement.   As you know, trade deals are often dense agreements that have  hundreds of provisions relating to any number of issues. Ultimately,  trade agreements and trade legislation move through the Senate Finance  Committee. We just heard from two of our senior members.   As another senior member of that committee for many years now, I have  considered many trade bills and looked at what impact those bills would  have on American consumers, producers, manufacturers, farmers, and  businesses--citizens. After all, our economy depends on making sure  that other countries can sell to us and that we can sell to other  countries, especially close allies like Canada to our north and Mexico  to our south.   Following years of uncertainty, thanks to the President's haphazard  trade wars, I believe this agreement will provide a measure of  certainty for those who help drive our economy. Provisions included in  the new NAFTA will help in our State, on the Delmarva Peninsula, our  poultry producers gain better access to Canadian markets. It is not  just important to Delaware; it is important to Delaware, Maryland,  Virginia, and other places where they raise chickens.   Further, the new trade deal increases market access for dairy farmers  in Delaware, and those across the country, to sell their milk  products--products like powdered milk--to Canada. The International  Trade Commission estimates that this will allow for an additional $315  million in exports annually. That is a $315 million increase in exports  just under the milk side, the dairy side, in sales to Canada every  year.   When we evaluate the new NAFTA as what it is--a trade deal--I believe  that it makes significant improvements on past trade agreements,  including the  [[Page S230]]  original NAFTA. New NAFTA adds stronger language to ensure that the  obligations to all three counties under multilateral environmental  agreements, including the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol,  can be fully enforced. I will come back and talk more about that in a  short while.   Thanks primarily to Democrats, though, it is no longer the case that  the failure of one NAFTA country to ratify an environmental agreement  can be used to prevent the others from being held accountable for  failing to honor their obligations. New NAFTA also includes new  provisions that have never been included in trade agreements before.   Environmental violations will now be treated as trade violations, so  when the United States does bring cases under the new NAFTA's  environmental obligations, those cases will be easier to win going  forward.   This agreement also includes significant new wins for coastal States,  including binding provisions around overfishing, around conservation of  marine species, and marine debris. When we talk about marine debris,  just keep this in mind: There is, floating out in the oceans of the  world, something called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It is largely  plastics. It is twice the size of Texas--not twice the size of  Delaware, not twice the size of Maryland; it is twice the size of  Texas.   In addition to the $88 million for environmental monitoring,  cooperation and enforcement, the new NAFTA creates an enforcement  mechanism that gives environmental stakeholders an expanded role in  enforcement matters. This will go a long way toward ensuring that  environmental violations can be investigated and remedied in a  substantive and timely manner.   My colleagues have heard me say before that I have a friend who, when  you ask him how he is doing, he replies: Compared to what?   Well, compared to all the previous trade agreements that this body  has considered, new NAFTA and its implementing legislation have the  strongest environmental enforcement provisions we have seen to date,  period. That is good news, especially for a trade deal put forth under  this administration.   Does the new NAFTA include everything that my Democratic colleagues  and I--and some Republican colleagues--would have liked to see with  regard to environmental protection? No, it does not.   This new NAFTA fails to recommit the United States, for example, to  the Paris accord. It fails to ratify the Kigali amendment that I  mentioned earlier to the Montreal protocol, which could bring the  global community together to reduce the use of something called HFCs,  hydrofluorocarbons, found in products like air conditioners and  freezers, and prevent, by the use of those follow-on products to HFCs,  up to a half-degree Celsius increase in global warming by the end of  this century, just for doing this one thing--one thing.    Like so many of the Trump administration's proposals, the new NAFTA  fails to even mention the words ``climate change.'' This trade  agreement does add important tools and resources that were primarily  negotiated by Democrats to strengthen the deal, hold the administration  accountable to enforce NAFTA countries' obligations, and help ensure  that those who break the rules are actually held accountable.   As the senior top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works  Committee in the Senate, I am especially aware of the extreme and  destructive environmental policies put forth by the current  administration.   Week after week, I have helped to lead the fight against some  reckless rollbacks, too many unbelievably unqualified candidates, and  their relentless attempts to chip away at our Nation's bedrock  environmental protections. We know what to expect from this  administration when it comes to environmental policies.   As a result, I know that the environmental provisions in new NAFTA-- thanks to the hard work from Democrats in both the House and the  Senate, and some Republicans too--are far stronger than where we  started. It is certainly not perfect, and we can, and we must, do more  going forward. But it is better than we have ever done before, and that  must be recognized.   I want to pause for a moment to thank Ambassador Robert Lighthizer  and his staff--the Trade Ambassador, Trade Rep's office--for their hard  work and their willingness to engage with my colleagues and with me. It  has been an extraordinary outreach, great responsiveness. I just want  to say thank you to the Ambassador and to his team. It reminds me of  what we had with Michael Froman when he was the Trade Rep in the last  administration.   Let me end it with this, if I could: While it is good news that we  were able to reach an agreement on the new NAFTA, I want to caution my  colleagues that the uncertainty caused by President Trump's haphazard  approach to trade is far from over. President Trump's multifront trade  war with our allies and our trading partners is approaching 2 years  now. That is 2 years of American farmers, American manufacturers,  retailers, and small businesses experiencing increased costs from  President Trump's tariffs while simultaneously being locked out of  overseas markets due to retaliatory tariffs.   That is 2 years of uncertainty and disruption for American business  that have had to put investments and hiring decisions on hold and 2  years of uncertainty for the American workers who are not sure if their  jobs will continue to exist as trade wars drag on.   Where has that gotten us? A limited trade agreement with Japan, which  may be better than nothing, but it is largely an attempt to cover up  some of the negative effects that withdrawal from the transpacific  trade partnership, TPP, has had on our economy and our global  competitors.   For those who don't remember, TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, as you  will recall, negotiated in the last administration, was a 12-nation  trading bloc, negotiated primarily by the U.S. Trade Representative,  Michael Froman, and his staff. That included 40 percent of the world's  economy in one trading bloc, 12 nations. Guess who led it: We did.  Guess who was excluded: China, for the bad behavior they sometimes  follow. On the outside, they were looking in. And somehow we walked  away from that. What we have come up with in its place is something  that is, in my view, not nearly as bold and, unfortunately, not the  path we have taken.   I am still reviewing the text of the ``phase one''--I will put that  in quotes--China trade deal that was signed, I think, today. But from  what I have seen, the agreement falls far short of the structural  reforms to China's planned economy that President Trump has  ``trumpeted'' for some time. As best as I can tell, the structural  reforms in China's economy did not make the final cut.   As we enter this new year and a new decade, I sincerely hope our  President will rethink what many believe are senseless approaches to  trade and return to a multilateral approach--much as we had on the  Trans-Pacific Partnership--where the United States works with our  allies and trading partners to constructively write the global rules of  trade.   With that, I see one of my colleagues, also from Ohio, rising to  address a welcoming audience.   I yield the floor.
