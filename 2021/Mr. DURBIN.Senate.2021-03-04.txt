 Mr. President, some of our Republican colleagues say that  America doesn't need President Biden's COVID rescue plan because ``the  pandemic is nearly over.'' Funny. I have never heard them say we  shouldn't spend money to help tornado victims in their States after the  tornadoes were gone.   Let me say it clearly. We are not out of the woods yet. I wish we  were. There are 510,000 Americans--maybe more now--who have died. The  United States has 5 percent of the world's population. We have 20  percent of the COVID infections and deaths. Why? Because of poor  leadership during the first year of this pandemic.   We had a President then, who is now gone, who would announce it was a  hoax, and it was going to disappear by Easter, downplaying the  seriousness of the situation with his fanciful flights about certain  chemicals that were going to save us or whether or not we should all be  gargling Lysol every morning. It made no sense, and the American people  came out of that experience confused and infected, with deaths in their  families. That was the reality of the first year of the pandemic.  [[Page S1040]]    There was also another reality, which the Republican leader just  alluded to in that, 12 months ago, we passed something called the CARES  Act. It was historic--the largest Federal expenditure in the history of  the United States of America. Who designed that bill? Well, it was  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, whom I didn't know well but who,  apparently, had some skill as a negotiator because he managed to not  only speak for President Trump but to negotiate a bipartisan package in  March of last year, called the CARES Act, for $2 trillion. It came to  the floor of the Senate, with a vote of 96 to nothing. Every Democrat  voted for the COVID rescue plan of the Trump administration a year  ago--every Democrat.   The second major bill occurred in December, that of $900 billion,  designed to help us through the first 3 months of this year--again,  with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin at the table on behalf of President  Trump, negotiating with Democrats and Republicans. It came to the floor  of the Senate, and, this time, there were 92 votes in favor of it,  including every Democrat, and 6 Republicans voted no.   So, you see, when it came to COVID rescue plans under the Trump  administration, the Republicans were happy to ask us to join them, and  we did. Oh, some people said we were giving them a political advantage  here or there or the other place, but those arguments didn't prevail on  the Democratic side. The Nation came first. The pandemic came first.  Unemployed people and businesses that were struggling came first, and  we voted that way.   Then came a new President: Joe Biden, elected November 3, despite the  denial of some. It was a reality. He took this pandemic and faced it  squarely--no excuses about hoaxes or ``it is going to go away'' or ``I  have got a favorite chemical that will save everybody's life.'' He  faced it squarely. He accepted the responsibility, as President of the  United States, to tell the American people the truth.   The first thing he told them was that we cannot, we should not, stop  in our efforts to end this pandemic and put America back on its feet.  So he made a proposal, a proposal with at least $160 billion in it, for  buying vaccines, administering those vaccines, and distributing them  across the United States. I would think that everybody would agree with  that as a starting point. It wasn't the end point.   As for the cash payment promised by the Trump administration and  agreed to by most Democrats, he wanted to keep his word on that--$1,400  more for families all across America.   He talked about State and local aid. I can tell you that this is more  than a theoretical exercise in my State of Illinois. We need help. The  expenses of COVID-19 and the lost revenue by our shrunken economy have  taken their toll in my State and in the cities across the State.   I just got off a Zoom call with a dozen small towns in Illinois. They  are all down from my neck of the woods. They are great folks, doing  their best, struggling under COVID-19.   They asked me: Are you going to send us any help?   I said: President Biden has made his American rescue proposal. If we  can pass it, help is on the way.   Assistance won't just go to Springfield, our State capital, or to  Chicago, which does need help, but to cities across our State and  across our Nation. That is included in this bill too. Help for our  schools is included in this bill too. The list goes on, and it is an  important list because it really highlights the priorities of recovery  in the United States.   President Biden and all of us heard the news a day or two ago when  the Governors of Texas and Mississippi, in full-throated denial of the  reality of this pandemic, basically took off all the limitations on  businesses and on individuals. No more mask requirements. Let's open up  everything all the way. The President was right. That was not a smart  choice. It was not a wise choice. We are up against it, and we have to  remain united in our effort to defeat this coronavirus.   So this week, in a day or two, President Biden's American Rescue Plan  will come to the floor. Will we have another bipartisan rollcall, 96 to  nothing, 92 to 6? I am afraid not. As of this moment, and I hope it  changes, no single Republican Senator has expressed an interest in  voting for this bill. Not one. I hope it changes, and it could. Some  Senators at the last minute, I think, will realize this is the right  way to go.   Meanwhile, the Republican leader comes to the floor every day and  mocks this plan--a Democratic wish list, a liberal wish list, Nancy  Pelosi's wish list. This is the American people's wish list. Eighty  percent of the American people support what President Biden is trying  to do, and the leading economists have told us we have to do this. If  we don't inject money into this economy to restore its energy and  future, we will pay for it not just for months to come but far beyond.   It is a situation that every parent knows, when they go to the  doctor, to the pediatrician, with their little boy or little girl with  an earache, and he says: I am going to give you some antibiotics. Now,  this is a 5-day prescription. This little boy is going to start feeling  better on the second day, and by the third day, he is going to be  playing as usual. You are going to think, well, he doesn't need the  rest of these antibiotics. Don't make that decision. Keep giving him  the full dose of medicine to get well completely, or he may lapse back  into it again and get sick all over again.   So you stick with it even when your little boy is running rings  around you or the little girl is getting ready to get on her tricycle,  because that is what the doctor said, and that was the right thing to  do.   That is the same thing with this. If we accept the Republican  argument that this pandemic is really over; if we accept the argument  of the Governor of Texas--that was yesterday; we don't have to worry  about it tomorrow; if we take that approach, we could have a disastrous  result. We could be back in trouble again in just a few weeks.   I hope we don't. I hope we come together in the Senate, preferably on  a bipartisan basis, and help the President get us through this  pandemic. This is our chance. We have no greater responsibility than to  put an end to this pandemic, put the economy on its feet, get the kids  back in school, and let grandparents visit those grandkids again. That  is part of getting America back where it needs to be.   We need bipartisan support. As Democrats, we provided that support to  a Republican President. Now that we have a Democratic President, will  our Republican Senators do the same?   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 601         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
