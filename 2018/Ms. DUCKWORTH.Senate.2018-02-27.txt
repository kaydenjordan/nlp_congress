 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to  Commander Paul Bauer, a 31-year veteran of the police force who was  fatally shot on Tuesday February 13, 2018, while in the line of duty.  Commander Bauer had a remarkable career with the Chicago Police  Department and will be remembered by his colleagues as a model police  officer. Commander Bauer made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting  our city and its people, and I am thankful for all of his years of  service. He leaves behind his wife, Erin, of 16 years and his 13-year- old daughter, Grace. May his service, sacrifice, and kind spirit serve  as an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
