 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the House  Appropriations Committee and his great staff who have worked diligently  all year, month after month after month. Five months ago next week,  they approved all 12 appropriations bills, one after another, regular  order, through the House of Representatives. But there they sit over in  the Senate and the Democrats block them.   What brings us here today is really important work. What brings us  here today is that we are taking care of significant public healthcare  issues. We are fully funding for the next 2 years community health  centers.  [[Page H895]]    I have heard from my colleagues about the things that aren't in this  bill that they wish were, so that is why they are going to vote ``no,''  or some other thing that is not even before us and that is why they are  going to vote ``no.''   But let's talk about what is actually before us.   What is before us is taking care of our men and women in uniform and  their needs, especially when they are in harm's way, and fund really,  really important public health programs that used to always be  bipartisan.   Let's talk about those. Valley Family Health Care Outreach Center in  Ontario and Winding Waters Clinic in Wallowa County. I have visited  both of these recently. They are on the front lines of healthcare  prevention. They are on the front lines of saving lives and helping  children and adults. Or La Clinica down in the Medford-Ashland area.   In fact, in my district, we have 12 federally qualified health  centers and 63 delivery sites that give care for 240,000 Oregonians.  Twenty-four million nationwide are served by this.   On November 3, this House had the opportunity to fully fund those  community health centers for 2 years and take care of children's health  insurance and a lot of these other programs. It was a separate bill  brought to the House floor, and a handful of Democrats broke with their  party and voted with us. But, unfortunately, when it got to the Senate,  they couldn't be freed up to support it. So we had to come back in the  last continuing resolution and fully fund the Children's Health  Insurance Program. I am not sure many Democrats voted for that here,  unfortunately.   But here we are today, same process, same situation to fund community  health centers. So we are going to do that. Your choice when you vote  is ``yes'' or ``no,'' you want the community health centers funded or  not, you want to shut the government down or not, you want to take care  of our military or not.   Then there is the disproportionate share hospitals.   What are those?   Those are the hospitals in our districts and States that take care  disproportionately of more poorer people than other hospitals. Under  the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, however you want to describe it,  there was prescribed in law automatic cuts to these hospitals that take  care of the poorest of the poor in our communities. Those cuts totaled  $2 billion.   In this legislation, as in the legislation we brought from the Energy  and Commerce Committee on November 3, we turn off those cuts. We say:  Don't do that to our DSH hospitals.   If you are at Saint Alphonsus in Ontario, Oregon, that is the most  affected hospital, I am told, and they will lose money and have to  decide how they cope with that. We solve that here for 2 years at $6.8  million in my State.   Then we extend the special diabetes programs. For heaven's sake, we  should be able to come together in this Chamber and in this Congress to  take care of people with diabetes. My grandfather lost both legs due to  diabetes. They were amputated. I have other relatives and good friends  whose kids have dealt with diabetes and still do to this day.   For our Native Americans and others, we have two separate programs.  We fully fund them and tie them together. That is done in this  legislation. Fifty thousand people in my district have diabetes. My  hunch is all of our districts are not dissimilar from that. We take  care of those people in this legislation.    Then we take care of therapy caps. Since 1997, when this law was put  in place, people who needed physical therapy--my colleague from  Tennessee talked about it--stroke victims, seniors who need therapy,  rather than the physical therapist or the speech therapist saying,  ``Here is the program you need to get well, get on your feet, recover  from whatever it is that afflicts you,'' the government put an  arbitrary cap, and that was it. You were done whether you were done or  not.   Everybody is different in terms of recovery. We repeal the therapy  caps in here.   By the way, we have heard about all these things that now won't get  funded because a part of this funding comes out of the Public  Prevention Fund. Mr. Speaker, $2.85 billion is not insignificant, it is  true, but we are applying that money to help prevention and community  health centers, as we did before for the Children's Health Insurance  Program.   We are providing it for diabetes health. We are removing the physical  therapy caps so that people can get well. That seems to me to be pretty  good use of the Prevention Fund.   By the way, during the same period we are spending $2.85 billion out  of that, there will still remain $12 billion left, and the talented  folks at the Appropriations Committee will decide how that money is  spent on vaccines and all these other issues, all these things we care  about. There is still $12 billion left. So we are using discretionary  funds that were set aside for that very purpose here.   Then we heard about some Medicaid cuts. Let me tell you what those  are. We said: If you are a big lottery winner, maybe now that you have  won a big prize, you shouldn't be on government-funded Medicaid  because, by the way, you won a bazillion dollars.   So we are taking lottery winners and saying you have got to treat  that big windfall when you calculate whether that person is poor or not  anymore. So that is in here.   Then, on third-party liability, we said that if insurers actually are  responsible for the cost, insurers should pay the cost rather than the  taxpayer. So we make a little reform here that puts the insurers first  to pay rather than the taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the marvelous work he has done.                                time  1830
