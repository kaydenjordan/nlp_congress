 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my profound support  for the work of the House Appropriations Committee and highlight the  inclusion of the Fiscal Year 2023 Community Project Funding requests  for Indiana's First Congressional District.   I am grateful for the ability to collaborate with local units of  government, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher  education to effectively advocate in a transparent fashion for their  eligible projects.   Notably, the House-approved legislation includes funding for vital  economic and transportation assets in Northwest Indiana, including the  Gary/Chicago International Airport, the Burns Waterway Small Boat  Harbor in Portage, and shoreline restoration efforts for Mount Baldy  within the Indiana Dunes National Park.   I look forward to continuing to work with all my colleagues to  complete our constitutional work to fund government and advance the  needs of our districts.                            ____________________
