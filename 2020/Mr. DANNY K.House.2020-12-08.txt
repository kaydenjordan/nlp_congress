 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman for yielding.   As a cosponsor of the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, I rise in  strong support of this bill that removes the harmful 5-month waiting  period for earned Social Security Disability Insurance benefits.   For years, representatives from the greater Chicago chapter of The  ALS Association have raised the financial hardship caused by this  waiting period. Disability insurance is an earned benefit. Federal law  should ease suffering and promote the well-being of persons eligible  for SSDI.   This bill will help alleviate the financial burden of persons and  families struggling with ALS, making it a little easier as they battle  the tremendous loss associated with this illness.   Enacting this bill is an important step forward to removing barriers  to disability benefits. I look forward to advancing additional bills to  eliminate obstacles to disability benefits, including advocating for  the elimination of the waiting period for financial and Medicare  assistance for all SSDI-eligible individuals.    Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
