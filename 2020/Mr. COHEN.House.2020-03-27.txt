 Mr. Speaker, the words above the Speaker's head at the top  of this Chamber are from Daniel Webster. He says: `` . . . see whether  we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to  be remembered.''   Today, we have something worthy before us and something to be  remembered. We should all vote ``aye.''   I am here to vote ``aye'' and to encourage the President to use the  Defense Production Act for everyone and to continue talking to the  President of China because this is a worldwide pandemic.                                time  1300
