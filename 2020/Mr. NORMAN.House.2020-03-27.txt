 Mr. Speaker, during times like this, it brings out the  best and the worst. The best has been a President who is working  nonstop. The best have been those businesses that are producing the  masks and the things that we need, and the best has been the churches  that are praying nonstop.   Now, the worst has been the price tag, and the worst has been the  things that were added to this that had nothing to do with the  coronavirus, the $25 million for the Kennedy Center and $75 million for  the national arts. This has nothing to do with the coronavirus.   This Nation shall survive. In the words of Winston Churchill: There  are times when doing our best isn't good enough. We will do what is  required in spite of this.
