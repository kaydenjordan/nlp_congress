 Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the  Arkansas Broadcasters Association, ABA, on its 70th anniversary and  celebrate the organization's decades of service to radio and television  broadcasters in my State.   Established in 1949, the Arkansas Broadcasters formed to help  broadcast organizations by educating its members about opportunities  available through free, over-the-air broadcast operations and provide  technical support, regulatory expertise, and advocacy coordination. The  trade association's support and the services associated with it have no  doubt been a tremendous asset to broadcasters across the State. Today,  the ABA highlights its mission to help members in ``Broadcasting  Naturally,'' which aptly distills the organization's mantra in simple,  clever terms.   Arkansas' radio and television broadcast outlets provide vital  information and quality programming to communities across our State.  They educate, inform, entertain, and communicate with Arkansans in a  variety of ways. When we turn on our televisions or radios and perhaps  just as much these days by opening our smartphones and tablets or  powering on our computers, we have come to expect the content we are  looking for will be readily available and accessible.   We are able to find what we are looking for on TV or radio or their  technology-enabled apps and online platforms because of the hard work  that broadcasters do to ensure their product is meeting the demands and  desires of consumers. I believe these broadcasters will be the first  people to tell you that the Arkansas Broadcasters Association has  played an integral role in their ability to provide that service, adapt  to changing technology, and better understand the market they operate  in.   It has been a pleasure to work alongside the ABA on legislative  efforts that help the organization and its members continue to do the  job they want to do as well as they can. I have been a supporter of  legislation the broadcasters have advocated for, including the Local  Radio Freedom Act, and I was especially honored when the group named me  its Arkansan of the Year in 2017 for my work to support the association  and its members.   Congratulations to the Arkansas Broadcasters Association and all of  its members on reaching the tremendous milestone of seven decades  working on behalf of their industry. I applaud them and am confident  the ABA will enjoy many more years of success on behalf of the Natural  State's television and radio broadcasters.                            ____________________
