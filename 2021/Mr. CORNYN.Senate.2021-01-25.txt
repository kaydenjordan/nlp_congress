 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, the country and the world  watched as our Nation carried out one of its most sacred traditions-- the peaceful transfer of power, which is the hallmark of American  democracy, that has defined our country since its earliest days.  Between the pandemic and heightened security concerns, this  inauguration looked far different than those of former Presidents, but  the will of the people was carried out just as it has been following  every Presidential election throughout our Nation's history.   President Biden, in his inaugural address, stressed the importance of  unifying our country. I agree, and I hope that the President and our  Democratic colleagues in Congress lead by example.
