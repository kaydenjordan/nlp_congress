 Mr. Speaker, there is a lot I could say, but I want to  point out a couple of things.   Right now, the Border Patrol has detention facilities that are  designed to hold 4,000 people but are holding 19,000 people. ICE has  facilities to hold 45,000 people, but it is holding 52,000 people.   We are releasing people regularly into communities and throughout  this country. Mr. Speaker, ICE alone has released over 200,000 family  units into the country this year.   In Yuma, Arizona, a facility designed for 250 people is currently  housing 1,100 people.   It is going to be 110 degrees tomorrow. Most of those people are  being held outside under awnings with a large swamp cooler to cool  them. That will work okay. It will be livable. It will be  uncomfortable, but livable. But in about 3 or 4 weeks, when it is 115,  120 degrees and the humidity is out of this world, those swamp coolers  will not work.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking and going to make a motion to adjourn  because our colleagues refuse to bring a supplement that would pay for  humanitarian and detention facilities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 140,  nays 254, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 37, as follows:                               [Roll No. 250]                                 YEAS--140       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Baird      Balderson      Barr      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (UT)      Brady      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Budd      Burchett      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Cline      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Conaway      Crawford      Crenshaw      Davidson (OH)      Davis, Rodney      DesJarlais      Duffy      Duncan      Dunn      Emmer      Estes      Ferguson      Fleischmann      Foxx (NC)      Fulcher      Gaetz      Gibbs      Gohmert      Gooden      Gosar      Graves (GA)      Griffith      Grothman      Guest      Guthrie      Hagedorn      Hartzler      Hern, Kevin      Hice (GA)      Hill (AR)      Holding      Hollingsworth      Hudson      Huizenga      Hunter      Hurd (TX)      Johnson (LA)      Johnson (SD)      Jordan      Joyce (PA)      Keller      Kelly (PA)      King (IA)      Kustoff (TN)      LaHood      Lamborn      Latta      Lesko      Luetkemeyer      Marchant      Marshall      Massie      Mast      McCarthy      McCaul      McClintock      McHenry      McKinley      Meadows      Meuser      Miller      Mitchell      Moolenaar      Mooney (WV)      Mullin      Newhouse      Norman      Palazzo      Palmer      Pence      Perry      Posey      Rice (SC)      Riggleman      Rodgers (WA)      Roe, David P.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION     Mr. Speaker, due to the humanitarian crisis and border  crisis, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R. 3056, an emergency  supplemental to provide critically needed funding for the humanitarian  crisis at the border, and I ask for its immediate consideration.
