 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of parental and  maternal rights and in opposition to H.R. 26.   I am the first mother in history to represent west Michigan in  Congress. This matter is deeply personal to me. I recently shared  publicly about my own experience navigating a complex miscarriage and  the loss of my daughter. As a pro-choice Christian who chose life, this  issue is so personal to me. My faith informs my actions, but it doesn't  dictate the policy of an entire nation.   Further, when I read the Scripture, I am guided by passages like  Jeremiah 1:5, which states: I knew you before I formed you, and I  placed you in your mother's womb. It doesn't say the government's womb  or the Speaker's womb, it says the mother's womb.   I believe life is precious, but I reject the idea that if I embrace  the sanctity of life, I also must be forced to invite the Federal  Government in to regulate it. We must protect families from unnecessary  government intrusion into the most sacred and personal decisions of our  lives and our children's lives.
