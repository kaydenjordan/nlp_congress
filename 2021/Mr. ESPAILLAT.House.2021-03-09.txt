 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  work of a great New Yorker, a great Dominican-American, Ramon Anibal  Ramos, who was born in San Pedro de Macoris in Ingenio Angelina.   Over 50 years in radio and TV, that is what he gave our community. He  conducted Fiesta de Tele Antillas on channel 47. He would listen to  rock and roll as a young man, at an early age.   He began La Voz del Tropico in 1958. He worked at Radio Radio, Onda  Musical, Radio Reloj. In 1973, he went to work for Radio Clarin,  ``Entre Carrera y Carrera,'' then Colorvision at a program called ``La  Alegria del Pais y Fiebre del Sabado,'' and also Super KQ FM98.   He was an advocate for the community, and he worked right in the  middle of the pandemic with SOMOS, a group of community-based  physicians in the community of northern Manhattan.   Madam Speaker, as the newspaper reported flocks of vultures flying  over Manhattan in those tough months of February, March, April, during  the pandemic, Ramon Anibal Ramos was out there documenting everything  that was going on in the city of New York and reporting on what  community doctors at SOMOS were doing on behalf of my constituents. He  was an advocate for the community. He worked with those doctors.   I want to extend my condolences to his wife and family, and to say  that Ramon Anibal Ramos and his show, ``El Show de Ramon Anibal  Ramos,'' was truly ``lo mejor del cable.''   Madam Speaker, I bring his name up because we are about to pass a  $1.9 trillion rescue package, and I am amazed. I am taken aback. I am  surprised how many in this Chamber and in the Senate don't see the  importance of this rescue package.   Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, a flock of vultures flew over New  York City. Imagine that, the number of dead people, families mourning,  people fighting for their lives on ventilators in hospitals across the  city, families quarantined, businesses shut down. Some of them will not  be able to open again. Some of them are struggling to open right this  very moment.   Imagine the heroes, nurses and doctors and police officers and  firefighters, community-based physicians, who were out there supporting  our community, putting their lives on the line--including Ramon Anibal  Ramos, who put his life on the line to help New Yorkers.   Yet, many in this Chamber across the aisle and in the Senate don't  see the importance of passing this $1.9 trillion package, which  provides $75 billion for increased vaccination. As we see a new  variant--by the way, it has been determined by researchers that only  one out of the four antibodies available work against this new variant.   In fact, we are not over this pandemic, and we must bring additional  dollars for vaccination. We must bring additional help for small  businesses: the EIDL Forgiveness Act, additional PPP money, $25 billion  for restaurants that have been hurt; $1,400 for families, for  individuals, including those children and young people who are in  school and college, and dependent parents who may be living with us.   Madam Speaker, the other side of the aisle and some of our Senators  fought against the $400 unemployment benefits. They fought over a mere  $100. What is $100 in today's cost of living? What can you buy with  $100? Yet, they scrabbled and fought over $100 of unemployment  benefits. Incredible.   Madam Speaker, this is an important package that will not only save  America; it will put us on the right track to recuperate from this  horrendous pandemic, which may be the crisis of our generation. We are  here to support that package, to open up the schools safer. Let's bring  health to the American family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.                                          International Alliance of                                      Theatrical Stage Employees,                                        New York, NY, March 8, 2021.      Re H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.         Dear Representative: I write to you on behalf of the over       127,000 American members of the International Alliance of       Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) to urge you to support       H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, and       to oppose any weakening amendments or motion to recommit when       the U.S. House of Representatives considers the bill this       week.        The IATSE proudly represents behind-the-scenes workers in       all forms of live theater, motion picture and television       production, trade shows and exhibitions, television       broadcasting, and concerts, as well as the equipment and       construction shops that support these areas of the       entertainment industry. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put       millions out of work and threatens the safety of countless       others. Over the course of the last year, we have seen that       belonging to a union can, quite literally, be the difference       between life and death on the job. The time to act is now.        Labor unions are under assault, with policies across the       country undermining workers' collective bargaining rights and       stripping union workers of the wages, benefits, and       retirement security they deserve. The PRO Act would help       level the playing field in an economy pillaged by inequality       and anti-worker legislation and would make the freedom to       negotiate collectively a reality for millions of American       workers.        The PRO Act, which passed the House with bipartisan support       last year, will restore the original intent of the National       Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which was to give working people       a voice on the job so they can negotiate for higher wages,       better benefits, a safe workplace and protection against       discrimination.        Among its key provisions, the PRO Act gives the National       Labor Relations Board (NLRB) authority to ensure employers       not only negotiate in good faith but incur financial and       legal penalties for union-busting. The status quo gives       employers perverse incentives to lie, threaten, and coerce       workers out of joining a union. They routinely fire union       supporters and force workers to attend mandatory ``captive       audience meetings'' where they slander union membership.        Too often, when workers choose to form a union, employers       stall the bargaining process to avoid reaching an agreement.       The  [[Page H1146]]       PRO Act would establish a process for mediation and       arbitration to help the parties achieve a first contract.       Employers would also be prohibited from hiding behind       subcontractors, or deliberately misclassifying employees as       independent contractors, to evade their responsibilities of       providing a livable wage, health benefits, or safe work       environment.        The bill protects the right to strike and makes it illegal       for bosses to fire and replace workers who walk off the job       in protest of better conditions. Workers must be allowed to       picket and withhold their labor in order to have the power       necessary to improve their workplaces.        Finally, this crucial piece of legislation eliminates the       ``right-to-work'' laws of the Jim Crow era that enable union       ``free riders'' and ultimately put lives at risk. Each year,       dubious special interest groups and their billionaire funders       push these laws to give corporations even greater power at       the expense of American workers. The last seven decades have       shown that people in states with right-to-work laws receive       lower wages and reduced access to quality health care and       retirement security.        The passage of the PRO Act is an important step to       rebuilding America's working class, not just from the policy       failures of the last few decades, but also the ongoing COVID-      19 pandemic. This crisis has shown the importance of having a       voice in the workplace and support for labor unions is at a       historic high. Recent studies have found that nearly half of       all nonunion workers, more than 60 million people, would join       a union today if given the chance. This is that chance. That       is why I urge you to support the PRO Act when it comes before       you for a vote on the House floor.        Thank you for the opportunity to provide input.            Sincerely,                                                   Matthew D. Loeb,                                           International President.     Mr. Speaker, the PRO Act puts workers first.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all of the critical sectors of  our economy that have remained open and functioning have relied on  union labor and union workers. They are our frontline workers.   We depend on frontline workers in our hospitals, in our transit  systems, in our classrooms, our schools, in our essential businesses,  like supermarkets and corner stores. Frontline workers are, indeed,  essential workers.   Every time you go to any of my neighborhoods in Harlem, East Harlem,  Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, Inwood, and the northwest Bronx,  you find these essential workers, 24/7, working to support their  families and our communities.   The PRO Act puts workers first with the respect and protections and  security that they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support the PRO  Act. No more lip service. No more empty promises. Let's vote for the  PRO Act today.
