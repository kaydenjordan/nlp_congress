 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  rise in opposition to H.R. 1373, the so-called Grand Canyon Centennial  Protection Act. It is an antimining attack on northern Arizona and my  district.   This legislation imposes a massive land grab of more than one million  acres, permanently banning mining and other multiple-use activities in  an area nearly the size of Delaware. The withdrawal is also, I would  like to point out, very far outside the Grand Canyon. The actual Grand  Canyon, of course, is already subject to a multitude of Federal  protections.   Around one-third of the proposed withdrawal area in this bill is in  my district. The rest is in Representative O'Halleran's district. And  none of the lands in this bill are in the sponsor of this bill,  Representative Grijalva's, district.   This bill would have direct negative impacts on six counties in  Arizona and Utah, with an estimated two to 4,000 jobs lost and $29  billion in foregone overall economic activity. The withdrawal area also  contains 4,204 acres belonging to the Arizona State Land Department for  the benefit of Arizona's school children. This withdrawal will mean  hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue for local communities  and for our schools. I think every single school district is hurting  for money in Arizona.   Further, the majority of the active and historic mining claims are in  my district, and the main point of this bill is to lock up those lands  for mineral development.   I said that this is an attack on northern Arizona, and that is true,  but that is not all. This bill is a specific, targeted attempt to  prevent access to the  [[Page H8610]]  highest grade and largest quantity of uranium reserves in the country.  In doing so, this legislation has serious defense and energy security  implications for the entire Nation.   Uranium is a uniquely valuable element. It is a source of renewable  energy and also an irreplaceable application in defense and medicine.  And yet, domestic uranium production in 2018 was 33 percent lower than  in 2017. This year those numbers are likely to be even worse. Our  domestic industry is disappearing. If nothing is done, it will be  completely gone in just a few years. Look at what has happened with our  timber industry in Arizona. We have completely wiped out the mechanism,  and now we are victims of catastrophic wildfires.   During consideration of this bill in committee, my colleagues across  the aisle claimed that we source most of our uranium from allies like  Canada and Australia. But they neglected to mention that a Canadian  mine, which provided 15 percent of the global uranium supply, closed  just last year. An Australian mine is scheduled to stop operations in  2021 after 40 years of mining.   But why is this? Why is our domestic industry struggling to stay in  business and the uranium supply from our friends in Canada and  Australia shrinking?   Well, the largest uranium producer in the world is Kazakhstan, and  together with Russia and Uzbekistan, these countries have been  deliberately trying to ``corner'' the global market. Yes, I said it.  Corner the global market. They are pushing the price of uranium down to  artificially low levels and driving competitors in the United States  and elsewhere out of business. In fact, China is joining in it too,  buying up mines in Namibia.    We currently import about 97 percent of our uranium from foreign  sources. As of 2018, the majority of our uranium imports now come from  hostile nations like Russia. This is not always the case, but the  problem has gotten worse and worse over time, especially in recent  years. I think all of us here today should consider that very alarming.   Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have cited concerns  about water quality as a reason to prevent mining in the withdrawal  area. But, in fact, successful uranium mining occurred in the 1980s.  These mines were reclaimed so well that you can't tell where they have  even existed. There was no damage done to the Grand Canyon watershed.  In fact, they may have improved the watershed. And due to the small  footprint of a typical breccia pipe operation, usually less than 40  acres, even if every mining claim in the area became a mine, only a  small fraction of the withdrawal area would be affected.   Keep in mind that this is an area where mining and other multiple-use  activities can coexist. In fact, a thoroughly-negotiated compromise to  do just that was created by the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984,  supported by the entire Arizona and Utah delegations. 387,000 acres of  land was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System in  exchange for 540 acres to be available for multiple use, including  mining.   Unfortunately, some of the environmental groups involved in that  compromise have forgotten why it was made. Attempts to withdraw this  area have returned with very strong opposition from my constituents and  residents of northern Arizona.   There is no question that H.R. 1373 will hurt local revenues, kill  jobs, and undermine American energy security. It is opposed by the  people of my district, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  opposition.   Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I want to explain. This is a cross- section of geological formations. These yellow areas are called the  breccia pipes. What ends up happening is these alluvial fans actually  direct water. Uranium is water soluble. This is the Grand Canyon down  here. This is where the springs come through. So what ends up happening  is it dissolves into water, and it comes into the water.   So it seems like to me, what we would want to do is get rid of that  so there was not a perpetual leaching into the subsurface water.  Geology tells us a lot.   Madam Chairwoman, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Kirkpatrick)  for acknowledging that.   We are going to go back to learning about geology. Once again, we  have these breccia pipes, and you can see them on this location on the  platform here.   Now, let's look at something that naturally occurs in the next  picture. What do you think this is? This is an exposed breccia pipe  next to an alluvial fan.   This is exactly what she was talking about. When water and air get to  this, it immerses it into the water and carries it down.   This is a concentrated supply of uranium. Wouldn't it be better to  mine that area? That is what we have to get after. It is safe; it is  effective; and it will show some mitigation.   Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Madam Chair, it is great that the gentleman brought this up. So once  again, let's go back to our geological timeframe.   This water cuts through. This is the Grand Canyon. This is the shelf  that you go over and look over at the beautiful, majestic aspect of the  river.   Look at what we have cut across, these breccia pipes. Once again,  this is exposure. It is water-soluble, air-soluble. It goes back into  the watershed.   Once again, we are talking about up here, where mitigation should be  very, very important.   Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber). He has been a stalwart person in regard to the mining  industry; that it is a way of life in northern Minnesota.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H8613]]    Madam Chair, once again, let's look at mitigation. The previous  speaker on our side, Mr. Stauber from Minnesota, actually talked about  it.   Well, here is an active mine site called the Pigeon Mine. This is  what it looked like: a footprint of less than 40 acres; right around 30  acres. And this is it, newly minted right as it was done for  reclamation. In 2 years, you are not going to be able to find anything  here.   Once again, look at what we are dealing with here. This is an exposed  breccia pipe. Any water, any rain, any snow, any air will actually  dissolve this and put it in the air--not just uranium, but arsenic as  well. These are eroded away.   Once again, geology teaches you everything you need to know. Once  again, all these breccia pipes are built here.   Here is the Grand Canyon. We are not doing anything here. But look at  the exposure here for the uranium leaching into the subsurface and into  the Colorado River--not just that, but arsenic as well.   Look at what we are mining up on here, protecting and clearing that  out. And you can see that their mitigation is exemplary.   Eighty years ago, we abandoned a bunch of mines, but a lot of Federal  Government was to blame about that.   We also heard the dissertation in regards to the park could generate  all sorts of other revenue. Well, the last time I looked, the park  wasn't generating; they were going in the negative. In fact, the  backlog on maintenance is over $12 billion.   The government doesn't run these very, very well, and this is a great  opportunity for multiple use. It actually cleans the water, improves  the drainage into the subsurface water, and gets to a problem with a  solution that works and has been trusted.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, once again, geology tells us everything we need to know.  Once again, the gentlewoman actually talked about the Boundary Waters  Canoe Area Wilderness. Once again, I feel sorry for the public being  misused and used like pawns by the other side about the misnomer.   Once again, the Grand Canyon--this is the Grand Canyon. There is  nothing going on right here. Oh, I forgot. Water runs down, dissolves  uranium and arsenic, and puts it into the water.   What we are talking about is mitigation on this plateau. This is  outside the Grand Canyon experience. This is what is so important is  that this is helping out the health and the strength of the purity of  water. That is the key here.   Not only that, but the last time I knew, Arizona fights over water  because we have to drink whiskey. We want clean water here, so we are  enabling, actually, clean water here.   Once again, there are dozens of fights for the conversation we are  having today. The American people are being used like pawns. They don't  know what is right. Go back to geology. The geology sets you free.   You have seen the mitigation. Yes, 80 years ago, there wasn't great  mitigation. That was a big part of the U.S. Government and its  oversight. But now, there is great opportunity for this to happen. We  are not talking about the Grand Canyon. It is outside on the plateau.   Once again, as these are exposed through erosion, you have  contamination of subsurface water. It seems to me like we should  actually clean it up.   The other thing I keep hearing about is we have got plenty of  supplies. Well, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so  narrow-sided that they forgot about: How did China actually grow to own  the world market of rare earths? I mean, think about that. In order to  have a cell phone, you have got to have these critical minerals and  rare earths.   In the trade debate, what did China threaten us with? Withholding  rare earths.   Why do we have some of our leading battery technology over in China?  Because we didn't have supply chains here.   The other side talks about globalization. Well, let's talk about  globalization. Nobody--let me repeat--nobody--in the world does mining  like the U.S. No one does it under the same protections, and the same  protections for the workers--nobody.   And if we are talking about globalization, which always keeps coming  out of the other side's mouth, well, then we ought to be bringing all  this home so that we are the entrepreneur, we are the one forcing this  issue, and we are the one who controls our own destiny.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, once again, the gentleman made my point perfectly for  me: This is about people.   There is mitigation. We are holding people accountable. They are  empowered because now we are controlling the energy cycle. We are not  indentured to another country like China or Russia.  [[Page H8614]]    We are looking at the long series, making sure that we control our  own destiny. That was the American experience. And we are accountable.  That is key.   So when you look at mitigation like this, you can't dispute it. You  are not entitled to your own facts. The facts are what they are.   So there is a way forward and a way forward to do this right, and it  is being presented right here. The answer is not ``no''; it is about  what it takes to get to ``yes.'' This bill is totally wrong for that  very format.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a list of organizations that are  opposed to this bill; a Statement of Administration Policy threatening  to veto this bill if it were even to get through; a letter from the  Uranium Producers of America in strong opposition to the bill; an  article from The Epoch Times, dated September of 2019, basically  talking about the U.S. needs alternatives to China's rare earth  monopoly, once again, a stranglehold.                    Western Caucus, Chairman Paul Gosar                           Opposition to H.R. 1373         So far H.R. 1373 is opposed by: American Exploration &       Mining Association (Group Letter), Arizona Liberty (Group       Letter), Arizona Mining Association (Group Letter), Arizona       Pork Producers (Group Letter), Arizona Rock Products       Association (Group Letter), Citizens For America (Group       Letter), Conservative Coalition of Northern Arizona (Group       Letter), Conservatives for Property Rights (Letter), Denver       Lumber Company (Letter), enCore Energy Corp (Letter), Lake       Havasu Chamber of Commerce (Letter); the Mohave County       Supervisors (Resolution), National Mining Association       (Letter), National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association (Letter),       New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association (Letter), New Mexico       Federal Lands Council (Letter), New Mexico Wool Growers       Association (Letter), Western Energy Alliance (Group Letter).                                   ____                      Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 1373--Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act--Rep. Grijalva, D-AZ,                             and 122 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1373, the Grand       Canyon Centennial Protection Act. This bill would permanently       make more than 1 million acres of Federal lands in Arizona       off limits to development and uses that would otherwise be       permissible under Federal laws governing public lands,       mining, mineral, and geothermal leasing. The Administration       opposes such a large, permanent withdrawal, which would       prohibit environmentally responsible development, as       determined through site-specific analysis, of uranium and       other mineral resources.        The United States has an extraordinary abundance of mineral       resources, both onshore and offshore, but this legislation       would restrict our ability to access critical minerals like       uranium in an area known to have them in large supply.       Moreover, the size of the withdrawal included in H.R. 1373 is       inconsistent with the Administration's goal of striking the       appropriate balance for use of public lands described in two       executive orders. This withdrawal would conflict with the       objectives set forth in Executive Order 13783, Promoting       Energy Independence and Economic Growth, and Executive Order       13817, A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable       Supplies of Critical Minerals. Development of our Nation's       mineral resources is essential to ensuring the Nation's       geopolitical security, and this bill would not help us       achieve that goal.        If H.R. 1373 were presented to the President, his advisors       would recommend that he veto it.                                   ____                                     Uranium Producers of America,                             Santa Fe, New Mexico, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop: On behalf       of the Uranium Producers of America (UPA), I write to express       our strong opposition to H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon       Centennial Protection Act. The permanent mineral withdrawal       imposed by H.R. 1373 unnecessarily eliminates access to       significant known deposits of uranium, rare earth elements,       and other critical minerals.        UPA is a national trade association representing the       domestic uranium mining and conversion industries. UPA       members conduct uranium exploration, development, and mining       operations in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, South       Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. UPA members operate       valuable, high-grade uranium deposits that provide quality,       high-paying jobs, tax revenues, and produce clean energy for       the citizens of the United States. UPA's mission is to       promote the viability of the nation's uranium industry, while       being good stewards of the environments in which we work and       live.        H.R. 1373's permanent withdrawal of over one million acres       of federal land from mineral development ignores the       comprehensive suite of federal, state, and local       environmental regulations that apply to the mining process,       from exploration and production to reclamation and closure.       H.R. 1373 disregards the well-documented success of mine       reclamation in the withdrawal area and the fact that all       federal lands within Grand Canyon National Park were already       withdrawn from the Mining Law when the park was created.       Moreover, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are       significant undiscovered uranium resources in the withdrawal       area, but the mineral assessment required as part of the       current moratorium has not yet begun. This means H.R. 1373       would permanently strand resources without an informed       understanding of the economic value of the deposits and the       national security impact of their permanent withdrawal.        Ensuring responsible access to uranium deposits on federal       land is a crucial component of ensuring the long-term       viability of the domestic uranium industry, the survival of       which is vital to energy and national security. Despite the       existence of vast deposits, domestic producers forecast 2019       production to plummet below one percent of what is required       to power our commercial nuclear reactors, which is not enough       uranium to power even one of our nation's 98 reactors. These       reactors produce approximately 20 percent of the electricity       for the U.S. power grid, representing the world's largest       commercial nuclear fleet and supplying more than half of the       carbon-free power in the United States. In addition,       international agreements require domestically-sourced uranium       to meet our defense requirements, including our nuclear       weapons and the nuclear-powered Navy.        H.R. 1373 is particularly objectionable at a time the       United States is at risk of losing its domestic uranium       industry and becoming completely reliant on imported uranium.       Uranium imports from state-backed entities have created an       uneven global playing field on which market-driven uranium       companies in the United States are unable to compete. An       increasing share of uranium imports into the United States       are coming from government or state-controlled entities       located in nations that are not aligned with U.S. interests.       While free market companies are forced to adapt to market       conditions, state-backed entities within the Russian sphere       of influence (RSOI) have ignored the market, increased their       total supply, and added further downward pressure to prices.       U.S. uranium companies are not competing with free market       companies in the RSOI; they are competing with governments       more concerned about increasing market share, and       geopolitical advantage, than profitability.        We urge you to vote against H.R. 1373 and instead       prioritize policies to revive and expand domestic uranium       mining, nuclear fuel production and the provision of clean       energy in the United States.            Sincerely,                                                     Jon J. Indall,      Counsel for UPA.                                   ____                  [From the Epoch Times, September 8, 2019]            US Needs Alternatives to China's Rare Earth Monopoly                             (By James Gorrie)         As the trade war goes on, China threatens to deprive the US       of critical elements its economy and its military can't do       without.        Many consider China's vast portfolio of U.S. Treasuries as       their not-so-secret weapon in the ongoing trade war. And it       some ways. that is certainly true. China could decide to       liquidate much or all of its U.S. bond holdings in response       to rising tariff, and use other tactics. like currency       devaluation.        But such a move would damage their economy along with       America's. The Chinese are smarter than that.                      China State Media Hints at Embargo         Besides. the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has another.       more tangible ace up its sleeve. As unbelievable as it       sounds. China holds a near global monopoly on the supply--or       more accurately. the processing capacity--of rare earth       elements (REE).        Should China decide to impose an embargo against the sale       of REEs to the United States, the American economy and the       U.S. military would be scrambling to replace them, at least       in the short run. That's not overstating this situation, by       the way. As Foreign Policy magazine recently observed.       ``Beijing could slam every comer of the American economy.       from oil refineries to wind turbines to jet engines. by       banning exports of crucial minerals.'' The list of REE-      critical products includes smartphones. special alloys.       navigation systems, and much more. China, of course. is well       aware of this. In fact. China's state-run media have been       promoting an embargo, or leveraging the threat of one. in       response to the U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. and       specifically. against the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei.       China's biggest telecom equipment manufacturer and a leader       in 5G networks. Since all media in China is controlled by the       Chinese Communist Party (CCP). it's a certainty that this       message is being sent to U.S. trade negotiators directly from       the CCP.  [[Page H8615]]                              China Made This Play Before         If China docs stop selling REEs to the United States. it       wouldn't be the first time they've played that card. In 2006.       China began limiting its exports of REEs. reducing them by 40       percent until 2010. The reduction caused the prices of non-      China-sourced REEs to skyrocket. China also took advantage of       its market dominance and stopped selling to Japan in       retribution for a maritime incident.        After the United States. along with Japan and Europe.       prevailed against China in a WTO fight in 2015. China       dramatically dropped its REE prices and drove the only active       REE processing plant in the United States, Molycorp, into       bankruptcy. At that time China produced 95 percent of the       world's rare earth metals.                             How Did We Get Here?         But how has the U.S. allowed itself to be put in such bind?       Wouldn't it make sense to have secured an American or at       least a friendly source of these REEs on which so much of our       military preparedness and our economy are reliant? Shouldn't       that have been a priority, say, decades ago?        Actually. it was. But that changed in 1980. when rare earth       mineral mining and processing came under the purview of the       Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the International Atomic       Energy Agency. Regulatory guidelines became increasingly       restrictive, driving up costs, steadily decreasing U.S.       producers' competitiveness. By the mid-1990s, the U.S. was no       longer producing REEs.                 Rare Earth Elements Aren't so Rare After All         Fortunately, REEs aren't rare at all. In fact, they're       actually quite plentiful around the world, even in the United       States. The 17 elements that are categorized as REEs have       magnetic and conductive aspects and are typically unearthed       as a result of mining operations. but most are present in       only small amounts. There are few, if any. specific ``rare       earth mines.'' The costs and health risks of producing REEs       are in the processing. For instance. since toxins and       radiation are a by-product of processing REEs. many Western       nations' environmental and labor laws make processing them       both costly and a health risk to miners. It has been easier       much cheaper for other nations to let China produce them,       since neither health codes nor environmental standards are       significant factors there.                           An REE Shortage Crisis?         But the costs of allowing China to gain the upper hand in       the world's supply of REEs are now becoming clear. If China       does in fact restrict REE sales to the United States in the       near future. it would certainly impact both the consumer       product markets and the military.        The key question is, how long it would take to bridge the       supply gap and find alternatives? One mitigating factor is       Australian-based Lynas. the world's only major rare-earth       producer outside of China. It has partnered with Texas-based       Blue Line to establish U.S. operations by 2021. However, the       United States still lacks any REE processing capacity,       representing a critical and ongoing vulnerability in its       military capabilities. But the news isn't all bad. The       Mountain Pass mine in California is currently being prepared       to ramp up REE processing operations by 2020. Coincidentally.       Mountain Pass was previously owned by Molycorp, which had       invested over $1.5 billion in the processing project. before       being forced out of business by China in 2015. The critical       role that REEs play in both military and consumer products is       impossible to overstate. The U.S. economy is dependent upon a       steady and dependable supply. If America is to be successful       in its bid to roll back China's power and influence over the       rest of the world. ensuring its own supply of strategic REE       is not just an option. it's a necessity.     Once again, let's go back. Let's look at the geology. The  geology tells us everything that we need to know.   We need to understand the minerals. The minerals are water soluble.  These are condensed pipes, vertically. What is happening is that, as  water runs--and this is a lot of sedimentary rock. That is why the  Grand Canyon is so deep.   When it runs over these breccia pipes, like we have talked about,  they are exposed naturally. Prior to that, they are covered with what  they call a sulfite cap. But once they are exposed--and you can see  this under the Grand Canyon experience--you walk over these breccia  pipes. You walk over them. They are exposed naturally.   Don't you think it is wise to remove these? It is a good  concentration. It keeps the supply chain in.   And if you get rid of our only mining uranium concentrator, it  doesn't come back. It won't come back. And then you sold your soul to  China and you sold your soul to Russia, because they own the monopoly.                                time  1315    That is what is wrong here.   Last, but not least, we also have to make sure that multiple-use is  put down forward. We are stewards of that--we, as Congress.   Public lands were taken aside by the Federal Government from the  States in a joint tenancy, that they would be vested properly for the  best use, the best investment, and the best return. The last time I  have been watching, we have been actually denigrating that.   When is enough enough? Arizona has more national monuments than any  other State in the country.   Congress then told the people that we will give payment in lieu of  taxes. We have had to beg for every penny that we get. That is wrong.  This contract is about, yes, you can do all this. You can clean up mine  sites that were left before.   And don't get me started on the Bennett Freeze, by the way. The  Federal Government put an arbitrary line, that you can't do anything  under that Bennett Freeze line. Wow, that is wonderful. Thank the  Federal Government for that. That is amazing, and particularly a lot of  the mine shafts that have been exposed from that very era.   Once again, this is about common sense, facts. We have disputed  everything that they have talked about. This is a natural formation. It  is millions upon millions upon millions of years old. As that water  runs down, as that air runs down, we contaminate it with low levels of  uranium. Wouldn't it be better if we actually got rid of that and  actually got better and more clean water, clean of uranium and arsenic?   That is an important process here. That is where we are actually  helping people out. People benefit from it.   Once again, here is a breccia pipe exposed, not by man but by nature.  You are walking all over it.   Once again, you see this alluvial fan where water runs. What do you  think it is running over? What do you think it is dripping down  through? What do you think is dissolving in there?   Madam Chair, this isn't rocket science, but it is not an emotional  one either. It is an articulated, scientific argument.   Once again, the mitigation, I could take somebody up here and nobody  could find this mine site now. This is after immediate resolution on  it. But what is different about this than 80 years ago is that we are  holding people accountable. The government failed at that before. We  have seen this type of mitigation over and over again.   In the Resolution Copper mine down in southern Arizona, we have seen  an investment of almost $1 billion by the mining company to mitigate a  previously mined area. It is beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful. I  want people to go see it. I want them to try the water. It is pristine.  It is cleaner than they found it.   That is good stewardship. That is utilizing the things that were  given to us to make this country and technology grow. That is the  opportunity that we have.   Arbitrarily just taking things off back and forth, that is not the  right way to go.   Talking about the indigenous people there, well, it is sad when we  use them as pawns, when we have a press conference and they don't even  know what they are coming to the press conference for. That is sad.   America needs to wake up. This has nothing to do with the Grand  Canyon. This has everything to do with monopolization and removing part  of the segment that we promised future generations for that investment.  That is what we have done. That is what the other side wants to do.   There is a way forward, responsibly, clean, and proper.   Madam Chair, I would like to have all of my colleagues vote against  this measure. Once again, the President issued a SAP that he will not  sign the bill, and it will die in the Senate.   Once again, this is a messaging bill. It is sad that we are  bombarding everyone with bad facts. Spend time looking at the facts.  Geology, the rocks, set you free. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I include in the Record this document.   It is titled ``Why I Changed My Mind About Nuclear Power.''   It details very clearly and wisely why nuclear power and its supply  chains are very important.             [From Environmental Progress, September 12, 2019]     Why I Changed My Mind About Nuclear Power: Transcript of Michael            Shellenberger's TEDx Berlin 2017--November 21, 2017                         (By Michael Shellenberger)         Like a lot of kids born in the early 1970s, I had the good       fortune to be raised by hippies. One of my childhood heroes       was Stewart Brand. Stewart is not only one of the original       hippies, he's also one of the first modern environmentalists       of the 1960s and 70s. As a young boy, one of my favorite       memories is playing cooperative games that Stewart Brand       invented as an antidote to the Vietnam War.        I'm from a long line of Christian Pacifists known as       Mennonites. Every August, as kids, we would remember the US       government's atomic bombing of Japan by lighting candles and       sending them on paper boats at Bittersweet Park.        After high school, throughout college, and afterwards, I       brought delegations of people to Central America to promote       diplomacy and peace and to support local farmer cooperatives       in Guatemala and Nicaragua.        Over time, as I've travelled around the world and visited       small farming communities on every continent, I've come to       appreciate that most young people don't want to be stuck in       the village. They don't want to spend their whole lives       chopping and hauling wood. They want to go to the city for       opportunity--at least most of them them do--for education and       for work.        What I've realized is that process of urbanization of       moving to the city is actually very positive for nature. It       allows the natural environment to come back. It allows for       the central African Mountain Gorilla, an important endangered       species, to have the habitat they need to survive and thrive.        In that process you have to go vertical, and so even in       places like Hong Kong you can see that with tall buildings       they can spare the natural environment around the city.        Of course, it takes a huge amount of energy to go up, and       so the big question of our time is how do you get plentiful,       reliable electricity without destroying the climate?        I started out as an anti-nuclear activist and I quickly got       involved in advocating for renewable energy. In the early       part of this century I helped to start a labor union and       environmentalist alliance called the Apollo Alliance and we       pushed for a big investment in clean energy: solar, wind,       electric cars.        The investment idea was eventually picked up by President       Obama, and during his time in office we invested about $150       billion to make solar, wind and electric cars much cheaper       than they were.        We seemed to be having a lot of success but we were       starting to have some challenges. Some of them you're       familiar with. Solar and wind generate electricity in Germany       just 10 to 30 percent of the time, and so we're dependent on       the weather for electricity.        There were other problems we were noticing, though.       Sometimes these energy sources generate too much power and       while you hear a lot of hype about batteries we don't have       sufficient storage even in California, where we have a lot of       investment and a lot of Silicon Valley types putting a lot of       investment in battery and other storage technologies.        While we were struggling with these problems, Stewart Brand       came out in 2005 and said we should rethink nuclear power.       This was a shock to the system for me and my friends. Stewart       was one of the first big advocates of solar energy anywhere       during the early 1970s. He advised Governor Jerry Brown of       California.        But he said, look, we've been trying to do solar for a long       time and yet we get less than a half of a percent of our       electricity globally from solar, about two percent from wind,       and the majority of our clean energy comes from nuclear and       hydro.        And according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate       Change, nuclear produces four times less carbon emissions       than solar does. That's why they recommended in their recent       report the more intensive use of renewables, nuclear and       carbon capture and storage.        Let's take a closer look at Germany. Germany gets the       majority of its electricity and all of its transportation       fuels from fossil fuels. Last year Germany got 40 percent of       its electricity from coal, 13 percent from nuclear, 12       percent from natural gas, 12 percent from wind, and six       percent from solar.        Keep in mind that you don't just have to go from 18 percent       solar and wind to 100 percent solar and wind. To replace the       entire transportation sector with electric cars you'd need to       go from 18 percent renewables to something like 150 percent.       Germany's done a lot to invest in renewables and innovate       with solar and wind, but that's a pretty steep climb--even       before you get to the question of storage.        Let's look at last year, Germany installed four percent       more solar panels but generated three percent less       electricity from solar.        Even when I'm in meetings with energy experts and I ask       people if they can make a guess as to why they think that is,       and you'd be shocked by how many energy experts have no idea.        The reason is just that it wasn't very sunny last year in       Germany.        Well, that probably meant that it was windier, right?       Because if it's not as sunny then maybe there's more wind and       those things can balance each other out?        In truth, Germany installed 11 percent more wind turbines       in 2016 but got two percent less of its electricity from       wind. Same story. Just not very windy.        So then you might think, ``Well, we just need to do a lot       of solar and wind so that  [[Page H8617]]       when there's not a lot of sunlight or wind we can get more       electricity from those energy sources.''        That's what Germany is trying to do. Its plan is to       increase the amount of electricity it gets from solar by 50       percent by 2030, which would take you from 40 to 60       gigawatts.        But if you have a year like 2016, you'll still only be       getting nine percent of your total electricity from solar.       And this is the biggest solar country in the world. Germany       is the powerhouse of renewables.        The obvious response is we'll just put it all in batteries.       We hear so much talk about batteries. You would think that we       just have a huge amount of storage.        Environmental Progress took a look at our home state of       California and we discovered that we have just 23 minutes of       storage for the grid--and to get that 23 minutes you'd have       to use every battery in every car and truck in the state.       (Which, as you can imagine, is not super practical if you're       trying to get somewhere. And Germany might be a little       different but not very different from California.)        Most people are aware that to make this transition to       renewables, Germany has been spending a lot more on       electricity. And German electricity prices rose about 50       percent over the last 10 years. Today, German electricity is       about two times more expensive than electricity is in France.        You might think, look, that's a small price to pay to deal       with climate change. And I would agree with that. Paying a       bit more for energy--at least for those of us in the rich       world--is a decent thing to do to avert the risk of       catastrophic global warming.        But when you compare French and German electricity, France       gets 93 percent of its electricity from clean energy sources,       mostly hydro and nuclear while Germany gets just 46 percent,       or about half as much clean energy.        Here's the shocking thing: German carbon emissions have       gone up since 2009, and up over the last two years, and may       go up again this year. And while German emissions have gone       down since the 1990s, most of that is because, after       reunification, Germany closed the inefficient coal plants       from East Germany. Most of its emissions reductions are just       due to that.        Let's look at last year. One of the ways you can reduce       emissions quickly is by switching from coal to natural gas,       which produces about half as much emissions. Coal to gas       switching would have resulted in lower emissions except for       the fact that Germany took nuclear reactors off-line. And       when it did that, emissions went up again.        There's still question about the future: if we do a lot of       solar and wind, won't it all work itself out?        One of the biggest challenges to solar and wind has come       from somebody in Germany who is not a pro-nuclear person at       all. He's an energy analyst and economist named Leon Hirth.       What he finds is that the problem I described earlier--where       you have too much solar or wind and you don't know what to do       with it--reduces their economic value.        The value of wind drops 40 percent once it becomes 30       percent of your electricity, Hirth finds, and the value of       solar drops by half when it gets to just 15 percent.        One of the things you hear is that we can do a solar roof       fast--just one day to put up the thing--whereas it takes five       or ten years to build a nuclear plant. And so people think       that if we do solar and wind we can go a lot faster.        But the speed of deployment was the subject of an important       article in the journal Science last year, which was       coauthored by the climate scientist James Hansen. They found       that even when you combine solar and wind you just get a lot       less energy than when you do nuclear. That goes for Germany       as well as the United States. They just compared ten years of       deployment for the two technologies and it's a stark       comparison.        Well, I can tell what you're thinking, because it's what I       was thinking: it sounds like I might need to rethink my views       of nuclear power. But what about Chernobyl? What about       Fukushima? What about all the nuclear waste? Those are really       reasonable questions to ask.        When I was starting to ask them, there were other people       who were starting to change their minds. One of the ones I       was most impressed by, and who was very influential, was       George Monbiot.        Monbiot wrote a column shortly after Fukushima where he       went through the scientific research on radiation and       concluded, ``The anti-nuclear movement to which I once       belonged has misled the world about the impacts of radiation       on human health.''        I write some pretty harsh things sometimes, but this was a       pretty strong column. He was talking to a lot of scientists       who study radiation.        One top British scientist who studies radiation is Gerry       Thomas. She started something called the Chernobyl Tissue       Bank out of her concern for the accident. She's a totally       independent professor of pathology at Imperial College in       London.        I called her and said, ``I'd like to present on the science       of radiation but I'm not a radiation scientist, so can I just       steal your slides? If you let me, I'll put your picture on       them.''        The first thing she points out is that most ionizing       radiation--that's the kind of radiation that is potentially       harmful that comes from a nuclear accident--is natural.        I was like, ``That sounds alright. I like natural foods.       Natural radiation from hot springs.''        Gerry said, ``No, actually, natural radiation is just as       potentially harmful as artificial radiation.''        What's striking is that the total amount of ionizing       radiation we're exposed not just from Chernobyl and Fukushima       but all of the atomic bomb testing in the sixties and 70s       totals just 0.3 percent. Most of the radiation we're exposed       to comes from the earth, the atmosphere, and the buildings       around us.        Let's look at the big one: Chernobyl. This was the event       that led me to be anti-nuclear and become an anti-nuclear       activist.        The United Nations has overseen these very large research       efforts involving hundreds of scientists around the world who       do this research. So the possibility of somebody fudging the       data or covering something up is pretty low in that       environment, because there are so many credible scientists at       different universities doing the research.        This was a pivotal moment for me. Chernobyl is the worst       nuclear accident we've ever had. Some people say it's the       worst accident we'll ever have. I don't need to make a       statement that strong. But they literally had a nuclear       reactor without a containment dome and it was on fire. It was       just raining radiation down on everybody. It was a terrible       accident.        But when they start counting bodies, what they come up with       is 28 deaths from acute radiation syndrome, 15 deaths from       thyroid cancer over the last 25 years. As horrible as it       sounds, thyroid cancer is the best cancer to get because       hardly anybody dies from it. It's highly treatable. You can       have a surgery to remove the thyroid gland and take       thyroxine, which is a synthetic substitute. In fact, most of       the people who died were in remote rural areas where they       couldn't get the treatment they needed.        If you take the 16,000 people who got thyroid cancer from       Chernobyl, they estimate 160 of them will die from it. And       it's not like they're dying of it right away. They'll die       from it in old age. That's not to say it's okay, but it's to       put it in some context.        And there's no evidence of any increase in thyroid cancer       outside of the three nations most affected, Russia, Ukraine       and Belarus.        There's no evidence of an effect by Chernobyl on fertility,       birth malformations, or infant mortality; nor for causing an       increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes or still births; nor       for any genetic effects.        I think this last one is the most striking thing: there's       no evidence of any increase in nonthyroid cancer including       among the cohort who put out the Chernobyl fire and cleaned       it up afterwards.        I'm still surprised by this finding, and so I put the link       to the web site on that slide, because I don't think you       should take my word for it. Reading about Chernobyl was, for       me, a big part of changing my mind.        What about Fukushima? It was the second worst nuclear       disaster in history and a lot smaller than Chernobyl. There       have been no deaths from radiation exposure, which is pretty       amazing. Meanwhile, 1,500 people died being pulled out of       nursing homes, hospitals--it was insane. It was a panic. The       Japanese government shouldn't have done that. It violated       every standard of what you're supposed to do an accident.       You're supposed to shelter-in-place. In fact, by pulling       people out of their homes and moving them around outside they       actually exposed more people to more radiation.        And you have to put that in comparison of the other things       that were going on, like the 15,000 to 20,000 dying instantly       from drowning--pinned down by many different technologies, by       the way--from that tsunami.        So while there was no increase in thyroid cancer, there was       the stress and fear from believing you were contaminated       despite the evidence showing that that wasn't the case at       all.        Some scientists did an interesting study. They took a bunch       of school children from France to Fukushima and had them wear       dosimeters, which is what we call geiger counters now.        You can see here that when those kids go through the       airport security system their radiation exposures spiked.       When they flew from Paris to Tokyo on the airplane their       radiation exposures spiked. They went through the French       embassy's security system their radiation exposures spiked.        When they went to the city of Tomioka, which received a lot       of radiation from the accident, it was just a tiny blip       compared to the security systems.        Let's put this in an even larger context. If you live in a       big city like London, Berlin, or New York, you increase your       mortality risk by 2.8 percent, just from air pollution alone.       If you live with someone who smokes cigarettes your mortality       risk increases 1.7 percent.        But if you were someone who cleaned up Chernobyl, your       mortality risk increased just one percent. That's just       because there wasn't as much radiation exposure as people       thought.        I'm from the state of Colorado in the United States where       we have an annual exposure to radiation about the same as       what people who live around Chernobyl get.        This is really basic science and is right there on their       web site but nobody knows it. Only eight percent of Russians       surveyed accurately predicted the death toll from Chernobyl,       and zero percent accurately predicted the death toll from       Fukushima.        Meanwhile, there are seven million premature deaths per       year from air pollution  [[Page H8618]]       and the evidence against particulate matter only gets       stronger. That's why every major journal that looks at it       concludes that nuclear is the safest way to make reliable       electricity.        All of this leads to an uncomfortable conclusion--one that       the climate scientist James Hansen came to recently: nuclear       power has actually saved 1.8 million lives. That's not       something you hear very much about.        What about the waste? This is the waste from a nuclear       plant in the United States. The thing about nuclear waste is       that it's the only waste from electricity production that is       safely contained anywhere. All of the other waste for       electricity goes into the environment including from coal,       natural gas and--here's another uncomfortable conclusion--      solar panels.        There's no plan to recycle solar panels outside of the EU.       That means that all of our solar in California will join the       waste stream. And that waste contains heavy toxic metals like       chromium, cadmium, and lead.        So how much toxic solar waste is there? Well, to get a       sense for that, look at how much more materials are required       to produce energy from solar and wind compared to nuclear. As       a result, solar actually produces 200 to 300 times more toxic       waste than nuclear.        What about weapons? If there were any chance that more       nuclear energy increased the risk of nuclear war, I would be       against it. I believe that diplomacy is almost always the       right solution.        People say what about North Korea? Korea proves the point.       In order to get nuclear power--and it's been this way for 50       years--you have to agree not to get a weapon. That's the       deal.        South Korea wanted nuclear power. They agreed not to get a       weapon. They don't have a weapon.        North Korea wanted nuclear power. I think they should have       gotten it. We didn't let them have it, for a variety of       reasons. They got a bomb. They are testing missiles that can       hit Japan and soon will be able to hit California.        So if you're looking for evidence that nuclear energy leads       to bombs you can't find it in Korea or anywhere else.        Where does that leave us? With some more uncomfortable       facts. Like if Germany hadn't closed its nuclear plants, it's       emissions would be 43 percent lower than they are today. And       if you care about climate change, that's something you at       least have to wrestle with--especially in light of the facts       I've presented on the health impacts of different energy       sources.        I'd like to close with a quote from somebody else who       changed his mind about nuclear power, and somebody else who       was a huge childhood hero for me, and that's Sting: ``If       we're going to tackle global warming, nuclear power is the       only way to generate massive amounts of power.''        Thank you for listening.     Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment states that this act shall not  become effective until the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation  with the Secretary of Labor, finds that the withdrawal will not  adversely affect jobs available to Native Americans, other minorities,  and women.   I believe deeply in protecting the environment for my grandchildren,  but I also believe in protecting the potential employment opportunities  of Arizonans, especially those in underserved communities. Resource  development benefits the economies of local communities.   As noted at markup in the Committee on Natural Resources, the  temporary political mineral withdrawal imposed in 2012 by the Obama  administration, which focused on banning mining, cost Arizona and Utah  thousands  [[Page H8619]]  of jobs and $29 billion in economic activity.   We should not entertain any withdrawal without confirmation that this  bill will not adversely affect jobs, particularly for Native Americans,  minorities, and women.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, through the Chairman to the gentleman on the  other side, I would like to know if the gentleman actually supports a  mine in Arizona.   That is a question.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, now we find out the true  understanding of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), that he  doesn't approve of any mines whatsoever. And why that is so important  here is that we talk about indigenous people and empowerment. Well,  let's focus back on this.    Recently, the Navajo Generating Station, which was commissioned by  Congress to provide power for the water for CAP that revolutionized  Arizona for its growth, the delivery of water, was all given to the  Tribes, the Navajo and Hopi--not just the coal mine, but the power  plant as well. These were great-paying jobs. They had benefits. It  empowered the Native Americans.   Now, what is interesting about that is that now we are shuttering  this enterprise down. Eighty percent of the Hopis' operating budget per  year is going away; 60 percent of the Navajos' operating budget is  going away.   And, interestingly, what is our answer from our colleagues on the  other side? Welfare.   Oh, my Lord, my God, I can't believe what I am hearing. Welfare, that  is the answer.   So let's go back and have a little bit of a geological conversation  again, because rock sets you free.   Once again, these breccia pipes are on this part of the Grand Canyon.  This is where everybody goes.   Look at these breccia pipes that are exposed. They are water soluble.  That drains down. Gravity takes it down. That is why you are getting  that infiltration into the water.   I am not here to hurt anybody. I refuse to do that. But I am not here  to turn my back on Native Americans who are empowered instead of  victimized.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, my points have been made.   This is a good amendment because what it does is it looks at the  overall application to make sure that we are not blindsiding our Native  Americans.   There is hardly consensus whatsoever. We heard from numerous groups  over and over again that they do not agree with this bill.   In fact, when the gentleman from Arizona on the other side actually  had a press conference, they gathered leaders, and the leaders had no  idea what they were there for the press conference with.   Once again, as I asked previously what mine would the gentleman from  [[Page H8620]]  Arizona on the other side actually endorse, the answer was crickets.   That tells you who he is playing for. It is not for Native Americans.   Maybe it is the Sierra Club. Maybe it is The Wilderness Society. And  I wonder if they get any of their payments from China and Russia. I  wonder if there is a collaboration here.                                time  1415    Once again this is a great amendment. It talks about empowering  people with jobs, holding their dignity, and directing the aspects of  their life. That is what is invigorating about America. Victimization  does none of that.   I ask all my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What this amendment basically does is, it takes my district out of  this withdrawal. Seventy percent of the active mine sites and proposed  mine sites are in my district, and we want to make sure that we are not  victimized, that we are taken out of this withdrawal area.   This body actually had rules that they tried to follow that they  didn't usurp Members' districts, they worked with those Members'  districts. And with that, I would ask that we endorse that and withdraw  my district from this withdrawal.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Once again, I am sure glad that the opposition actually brought that  up about New Mexico, because what we are actually doing is, we are  representing the voices that didn't get a chance to speak out on behalf  of their claim, their allotments, but we will get to that. And we will  be showing you exactly why we are doing that.   In my district, there are eight historic mines included in this  withdrawal area. Six are in my district. Also included in the  withdrawal area is the potential for 20 new mines that would provide  hundreds of high-paying jobs to the local communities in Mohave County  north of Grand Canyon. Not only am I opposed to the inclusion of Mohave  County in this bill, but so are the Mohave County Board of Supervisors,  who unanimously voted to oppose this bill.   In addition to the board of supervisors, local business organizations  are also opposed to this bill, including Lake Havasu Area Chamber of  Commerce, Arizona Rock Products Association, Arizona Pork Producers  Council, plus many others.   I say to my colleagues, local residents and businesses in Mohave  County should have a say. They should not be swayed.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the letter against this bill, H.R.  1373, from the Mohave County Board of Supervisors.                         Mohave County Resolution                                No. 2019-065      OPPOSING H.R. 1373 WHICH SEEKS TO MAKE PERMANENT THE 2012 URANIUM                                 MINING BAN         Whereas, Mohave County is located in Northwestern Arizona       and the Mohave County Board of Supervisors is committed to       wise stewardship and land conservation and continued       recreational access for hunters, anglers, campers, and other       recreationists, as well as allowing for productive uses,       including agriculture, timber production, mining, and energy       and natural resource development;        Whereas, on January 9, 2012, President Barack Obama's       Interior Secretary, Ken Salazar withdrew from mineral entry       1.07 million acres of subsurface estate in Coconino and       Mohave Counties, in northern Arizona;  [[Page H8621]]         Whereas, one of the richest grades of uranium ore in North       America sits untouched in the northern region of Mohave       County due to the 2012 withdrawal. The 375 million pounds of       uranium deposit in the area is the equivalent of enough       electricity generating capacity for the entire state of       California's 40 million people for 22.4 years;        Whereas, the affected area included in the withdrawal was       specifically left open for multiple use as part of an open       1984 compromise agreement directed at the behest of House       Interior Committee Chairman Morris Udall among environmental       groups, the mining industry, the livestock industry, both       states of Arizona and Utah and signed into law by President       Ronald Reagan;        Whereas, That compromise created 6 to 8 mile protective       buffer zones around the Grand Canyon National Park in the       form of 300,000 acres of designated BLM and 800,000 acres of       National Forest Wilderness areas while releasing lands with       high potential for mineral extraction and livestock grazing       and recreational purposes;        Whereas, the uranium industry in the southwest has       historically been a major economic driver for the region.       Mohave County and our neighboring State of Utah could see       major economic potential with the opening of more uranium       mining near the Arizona Strip. Mining in the area can bring       in over $40 million annually in payroll, $9.5 million in       mining claim payments and fees to local governments in       Arizona and Utah, and over $30 billion over a 42 year life       span, helping to finance local schools, roads, hospitals, and       other infrastructure;        Whereas, Congressman Raul Grijalva has introduced H.R.       1373, titled the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act that       aims to make permanent the 2012 uranium mining ban along with       including a mining ban on any land or interest in land       acquired by the United States after enactment of the bill;        Whereas, H.R. 1373 is very misguided with its title. Since       the 1984 Compromise there has been no mining allowed within       BLM Wilderness areas or within the Grand Canyon National Park       itself;        Whereas, the Government's own Draft Environmental Impact       Statement stated that there is no evidence to show that       mining activities outside the Grand Canyon National Park pose       a risk to areas within the Colorado River drainage or inside       the National Park itself;        Whereas, Modern mining industry reclamation techniques are       vastly superior to those used by the United States government       during the Cold War era uranium boom of the 1950 and 1960s,       which did bring harm to Native American and local populations       and are demonstrably improved and safe;        Whereas, Arizona and neighboring Utah have abundant in-      ground uranium resources, considerable existing uranium       infrastructure, and large numbers of qualified workers       capable of supplying defense and energy needs for decades to       come;        Whereas, the permanent ban of uranium mining in the Arizona       Strip area would be detrimental to our local economy and       cause severe economic harm to local communities without       promised economic benefits from tourism; Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, by the Mohave County Board of Supervisors that       Mohave County strongly opposes H.R 1373 and any attempt to       make permanent the 2012 Uranium Mining Ban in the Arizona       Strip area of Mohave County.       Adopted on this 17th day of June, 2019:      Mohave County Board of Supervisors: Hildy Angius,                                                          Chairman.      ATTEST:                                                    Ginny Anderson,                                                Clerk of the Board.     Mr. Chair, let's go back through this. You know, we have  heard all about the health implications, but rocks set you free.   Once again, we look at these breccia pipes that are outlined in this  yellow and red. The red are the most concentrated parts of this. What  ends up happening is you see them dissolve in water and in air.   And so when you look at the Grand Canyon, you are seeing this seepage  that comes into the Grand Canyon watershed naturally. What we are  actually doing is cleaning this up. Wouldn't that be amazing, amazing  that we are actually interceding on the best behavior and the best  acknowledgements of the people around there? Amazing.   And I would hardly call this a problem. In fact, immediate  restoration of these lands is impeccable. Yes, we have this negative  connotation about what the past has done. But this is where history and  our new technology actually intercede, where we are actually  intervening on this, making and improving the landscape. That is  amazing. That is absolutely amazing.   Once again, this is untouched. Man is not here. This is what nature  has done to expose this. Once again, you have an exposed breccia pipe.  You have a ravine that carries water that sheets off. Once again, by  taking that out, taking that breccia pipe out, it facilitates  permeation down into lower aquifers replenishing limited water supplies  that we actually have. It is amazing what the rocks do. They set you  free.   And my district has said, listen, exclude us from this overreach by  the Federal Government. The Federal Government has hardly been a  champion in regard to Native Americans and people in this area. We rule  by fiat and scare people.   Once again, this is a good bill. We want to be excluded from this  withdrawal. I would hope that everybody would listen to the people from  my district.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for everybody to vote for this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1373 permanently bans oil, natural gas, geothermal, uranium, and  other critical minerals and rare earth leasing and production on over a  million acres of land in Arizona. This commonsense amendment does not  kill the bill. It delays the effective date until we have done adequate  mapping and surveying of the minerals and resources in this area.   Specifically, the amendment allows the bill to go into effect when  the Secretary of the Interior completes a mineral survey of the area  proposed for withdrawal including uranium, rare earth elements,  geothermal, and oil and gas resources, and determines that there are no  mineral resources, geothermal resources, or critical minerals present,  other than uranium.   The temporary political mineral withdrawal imposed in 2012 by the  Obama administration that focused exclusively on banning mining cost  the surrounding areas in Arizona and Utah between two and 4,000 jobs  and $29 billion in overall regional economic activity. The previous  administration's misguided actions killed more than 7,000 hard-rock  mining claims in the area over a 3-year span.  [[Page H8622]]    This legislation would expand the withdrawal area and also expand the  mineral withdrawal in the withdrawal area to include oil and gas  leasing, geothermal leasing, and other mineral development in addition  to mining.   Mr. Chairman, there are rare earths and other valuable minerals,  including copper and uranium, in this area. There is also a great  amount of geothermal potential. We should at least know all the  minerals and resources potential in this million-acre area before we  permanently lock it up. This just requires mapping and surveying of the  targeted areas for the withdrawal.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this is a typical breccia pipe, and you are  seeing the collapsing of the geological formations. What is so  interesting about that is that it concentrates different minerals  there, not just uranium. Copper, vanadium, there are a number of things  here that have all of a sudden become very critical in our technology  sector.   This is a very important application here, and we want to make sure  that we are studying that properly.   Now, if we are talking about the reclamation process, well, here we  go. Yes, 80 years ago, we didn't reclaim mines right. We didn't ask  them to be bonded. We didn't go back and investigate them for  mitigation.   This is what American mining actually does. It takes what they need;  it returns it. And I would be very interested in taking a Geiger  counter to check this versus this when it started. I wonder if there is  an improvement.   Deja vu? It is. So, once again, the arguments are bland. They are  fraudulent. In this aspect, we show mitigation.   What we can do when we have a mine site like this is we can actually  leverage them and say: Listen, in order to do this, we need you to  mitigate some of these other mining sites.   It has been something that our side has proposed nonstop, but the  other side refuses to let that happen because, they claim, that it is  not going to be up to standard. That tells you people are scared of  their own laws.   This looks pretty good to me. When I look at the mitigation aspects  and what is here and available, that is for the common cause for the  American people. It is an investiture. You are not doing your due  diligence unless you know exactly what you have for today and the  future.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is  smart. It is critical and, from that standpoint, empowering. I ask  everybody to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2181. Mr. Chairman, this  is yet another piece of legislation advanced by my colleagues on behalf  of the radical environmental movement. This bill will unilaterally lock  up oil and gas development on 316,000 acres of federally owned land in  New Mexico.   The Department of the Interior is in the process of drafting a  resource management plan for this area, but this process is still under  review and the resource management plan has not yet been released. This  bill would permanently ban all energy development in the area before we  know all the facts and before a science-based environmental review is  completed.   Decisions made in Washington regarding how to manage federally owned  land have implications beyond the borders of the acreage in question.  Those who own land or operate businesses near federally owned parcels  are oftentimes significantly impacted by poor management decisions made  by the Federal bureaucrats who do not live there or understand the  needs of the rural Western communities.   Similarly, my colleagues claim that this bill will do no harm to  those who own lands and mineral rights in the surrounding area, but  this bill could mean millions in lost revenue for those who own lands  along the proposed withdrawal boundary.   While it is technically true that the acreage off limits to  development under this bill is federally owned, there are lands located  throughout the withdrawal area that are privately owned by the members  of the Navajo Nation.   If you take a look at this map, anything you see in this purple  area--particularly in this area is what we are talking about--is owned  by the Navajo allottees. So when you are looking at the expansion of  this park, it impugns access to that area.   Now, as you see, the Navajo-owned lands and minerals are scattered  throughout and are located outside the withdrawal area. But if these  lands are unavailable for development, they become restricted and  further cut off from access points and from development opportunities.  If the neighboring land can never be developed, as required under this  bill, the economic  [[Page H8624]]  value of these private minerals is diminished and the Navajo owners  will have a harder time attracting investments on their land.   Once again, you see the skirting all the way through this area,  particularly in this band alongside there, so access is critical.   We heard testimony to this fact in the Natural Resources Committee  this summer. Ms. Delora Hesuse testified in opposition to this bill,  stating: ``Our voices as allotted landowners are being silenced by  environmentalists claiming to speak for all of us. These lands were  given to our great-great-grandparents in exchange for citizenship, and  we have rights as citizens and landowners to develop our lands for oil  and gas as we see fit.''   She continued: ``If BLM lands are withdrawn around our allotments,  that means oil and gas companies cannot access our lands, because they  won't be able to access the Federal lands.''   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record her testimony.           Delora Hesuse, Navajo Indian Allottee, Nageezi Chapter  Testimony Before the House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee                on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands        Legislative Hearing on H.R. 2181 Chaco Cultural Heritage Area                        Protection Act--June 5, 2019         Chairwoman Haaland, Ranking Member Young and members of the       subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to bring voice to       those Navajo tribal members who are being forgotten with this       bill--Indian allottees.        I am Delora Hesuse, a citizen of the Navajo Nation, Nageezi       Chapter. My chapter is in the Greater Chaco region and near       the Chaco Culture National Historic Park. My grandmother was       a Councilwoman for the Nageezi Chapter for eight years, and       my father was a Navajo Nation Council Delegate for the       Nageezi Chapter for twenty years.        Many people don't understand our Native American heritage       and the fact that many individual Navajo Nation members such       as I own private lands and the minerals underneath them. This       is a steadfast personal property right that sustains our       livelihoods and way of life. H.R. 2181 would put many of our       mineral rights off limits and stop a much-needed source of       income to feed, shelter, clothe and protect our families. I'm       not exaggerating the importance of this income. In 2015, the       Federal Indian Minerals Office distributed $96 million to       20,835 allottees. That's a significant source of income in an       area that continues to struggle with unemployment.        My ancestors were allotted the land and mineral rights by       the United States government many generations ago, and it       pains me to see that my own leaders, both tribal and in the       U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, are supporting a       bill that would put my oil and natural gas rights off limits       and/or seriously prevent my family from receiving income from       the valuable energy resources that we own.        I am not alone. Many other Indian allottees in the Greater       Chaco region agree with me. In fact, I have here a petition       signed by 131 of us allottees opposing this buffer zone bill.        I also have with me another petition signed by many       allottees that states that the environmentalists' voice is       not our voice. Our voices as Allotted landowners are being       silenced by environmentalists claiming to speak for all of       us. These lands were given to our great, great grandparents       in exchange for citizenship, and we have rights as citizens       and landowners to develop our lands for oil and gas as we see       fit.        I also have two resolutions from the Huerfano and Nageezi       chapters signed by our chapter presidents supporting us       Navajo Allotment landowners and recognizing our opposition to       this bill. These chapter resolutions call for a meeting with       Senators Udall and Heinrich so that we can express our       concerns with the bill and how it will limit our rights.        I am disappointed that the Department of the Interior,       which is supposed to manage our mineral rights in trust to       the benefit of my family and all other allottees, has stopped       leasing for a full year. This action delays income to us       allottees in the short term, but more importantly, sends a       strong signal to oil and gas companies that generate the       income on our behalf that investment in the area is risky and       uncertain in the long term.        I have been participating actively in the Resource       Management Planning (RMP) process which is under pressure       from environmental groups and others opposed to responsible       oil and natural gas development in the area. I continue to       feel that the Interior Department and members of Congress are       ignoring the voice of Indian allottees and listening only to       environmental groups like Dine Care and other outside groups       that want to keep oil and natural gas from being developed at       all.        Besides not being realistic, it would deprive my family of       income to sustain our way of life. Our voices should and must       be heard equally along with the environmental special       interest groups. In fact, with the Interior Department's       trust responsibility, our voices should carry much more       weight than that of outside special interests, but that is       not the case with this bill.        The bill would put off limits my mineral rights and the       mineral rights of thousands of allottees. While the bill       claims not to affect my mineral rights, in fact, many       allottee lands are surrounded by federal lands that would be       withdrawn by this bill. If BLM lands are withdrawn around our       allotments, that means oil and gas companies cannot access       our lands, because they won't be able to access the federal       lands.        Furthermore, since the oil and gas is accessed using       horizontal drilling, putting the federal lands and minerals       off limits will mean my minerals are also off limits. Because       of the checkerboard pattern of lands, where allottee lands       are often surrounded by BLM lands, particularly in the       northeast segment of the buffer, if companies cannot access       all minerals along the lateral of a horizontal well, they       will not access any.        Companies will simply be discouraged from developing the       minerals on my behalf because it just doesn't make sense       economically or technologically to pinpoint my small amount       of minerals stranded amongst federal minerals. What may be       small to them, however, is not small to me. Companies will be       discouraged from developing in all areas of the buffer at       all, even on allottee lands.        I too care deeply about the Chaco cultural heritage. After       all, I'm a Navajo who lives right in the Greater Chaco       region. But the Chaco Culture National Historic Park already       protects the Great Houses. Artifacts that may be outside the       park are protected through the National Historic Preservation       Act. Any development of my minerals and the minerals of other       allottees is done in strict accordance with the act, to make       sure they are protected. Not only do we insist upon it, but       that is the law of the land.        I urge the committee not to pass this bill. Thank you for       the opportunity to testify today.     Further, two chapters of the Navajo Nation representing a  combined 6,000 residents passed resolutions opposing this bill because  it would jeopardize development and potentially ``infringe on their  royalty payments.''   Mr. Chairman, I also include those in the Record.                       Resolution of Huerfano Chapter                           Resolution # Hue-090-18    Supporting the Navajo Allotment Owners in Opposition of ``The Chaco      Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2018'' and Furthermore    Requesting U.S. Senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich to meet with  Navajo Allotment Owners in Northwest New Mexico to Explain the Proposed                             Senate Bill 2907.       Whereas:        1. Huerfano Chapter is a certified governmental entity of       the Navajo Nation charged with the responsibility to solicit,       promote, and protect the interest and the welfare of the       chapter and its community pursuant to the Navajo Nation       Resolution CJ20-55, December 02, 1995 and Resolution CAP 34-      98, adopting the Local Governance Act (LGA); and        2. Huerfano Chapter has a population of 3000 plus       residents, both registered voters and nonregistered community       members. The chapter is one of the largest land based       chapters comprised of 553,528 acres in Eastern Agency, Navajo       Nation and has nine 09) subcommunities including Adobe,       Blanco, Bisti, Carson, Gallegos, Jacquez, Hogback, Huerfano,       and Otis; and        3. The Navajo Allotment owners met on Jun 12, 2018 at       Nageezi Chapter where over eighty-five (85) attended to voice       their opinions on the proposed ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area       Protection Act'' or Senate Bill 2907; and        4. Navajo Allotment Land Owners expressed their concerns       that the ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of       2018'' might infringe on their royalty payments they are       presently benefitting from oil and gas development on their       allotment lands. The Navajo communities, including the Navajo       Reservation has always been in a very depressed economic       state for many years and such development of natural       resources gives Navajo families benefit for their daily       lives; and        5. Navajo Allotment owners are concern that self-serving       special interest organizations are violating the rights of       Navajo Allotment Land Owners, that such publicized       demonstrations and meetings by these special interest and       outside groups have over shadowed the Navajo allotment land       owners who benefits from oil and development on their       allotment lands; and        6. Navajo Allotment Land Owners do not share opinions of       environmentalists voicing their objectives on natural       resources developments. These are over publicized objectives       by the environmentalists have drowned out and overshadowed       Navajo Allotment Land Owners Rights; and        7. Navajo Allotment Land Owners are truly the impacted       people of the Chaco area. These lands were patented and       allotted to the Navajo People in New Mexico and handed down       through many generations. These lands were given in exchange       for land taken by the U.S. Government in exchange for       citizenships. Therefore, as Navajo People being land owners,       they have the right to lease, develop, or excavate their       lands; Now therefore be it  [[Page H8625]]         Resolved That: 1. The Huerfano Chapter hereby supports and       recognizes the opposition by the Navajo Allotment Land Owners       of the ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of       2018'' or Senate Bill 2904.        2. Huerfano Chapter herby further supports and requests       U.S. Senator Tom Udall and U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich to       attend a meeting with Navajo Allotment Land Owners of the       ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2018'' to       explain the content and reasons of the proposed ``Chaco       Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2018''. The meeting       will allow Navajo Allotment Land Owners to express their       concerns of the proposed ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area       Protection Act of 2018'' and how it will limit their rights.                                CERTIFICATION         We hereby certify that the foregoing resolution was duly       presented and discussed at a duly called meeting of Huerfano       Chapter, Navajo Nation (New Mexico), at which a quorum was       present, and that the same was passed by a vote of 12 in       favor, 00 opposed, and 08 abstained this 08th day of July       2018.        Motion by: Larry J. Bonney.      Second by: Cecil Werito Jr.                                                     Ben Woody Jr.,                                                 Chapter President.                                                   Irene L. Harvey,                                            Chapter Vice-President.                                                    Lois Y. Werito,      Secretary/Treasurer.                                   ____          Resolution of Nageezi Chapter--Eastern Agency, District 19                            RESOLUTION # NC-18-077    Supporting the Navajo Allotment Owners in Opposition of The ``Chaco      Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2018'' and Furthermore    Requesting U.S. Senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich to meet with  Navajo Allotment Owners in Northwest New Mexico to Explain the Proposed                              Senate Bill 2907       Whereas:        1. Pursuant to 26 N.N.C. Sec. 1(B), the Nageezi Chapter is       delegated the governmental authority to make decisions over       local matters consistent with Navajo Law, Custom, and       Tradition and under 11 N.N.C., Part 1, Section 10, is       delegated authority to make local decisions in the best       interest and welfare of the community members; and        2. Nageezi Chapter with the population of 2500 to 3000       residents, registered and nonregistered voters, is made of up       of nine (09) sub-communities including and not limited to:       Nageezi, Lybrook, Twin Pines, Blanco, Kimbeto, Chaco Canyon,       Escavada, Betoni Wash, Kinnadiz, and Dzilth-na-o-dith-hle,       being one of the largest land base chapters in the Eastern       Agency of the Navajo Nation; and        3. Navajo Allotment Land Owners met on June 12, 2018 at       Nageezi Chapter where over eighty-five (85) attended to voice       their opinions on the proposed ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area       Protection Act of 2018 or Senate Bill 2907; and        4. Navajo Allotment Land Owners expressed their concerns       that the ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of       2018:'' might infringe on their royalty payments they are       presently benefitting from oil and gas development on their       allotment lands. Navajo communities, including the Navajo       Reservation has always been in a very depressed economic       state for many years and such development of natural       resources gives Navajo families benefits to their daily       lives; and        5. Navajo Allotment Land Owners are concerned that self-      serving special interest organizations are violating the       rights of Navajo Allotment Land Owners. That such publicized       demonstrations and meetings by these special interest and       outside groups have over shadowed the Navajo Allotment Land       Owners whom currently benefitting from oil and gas       development on their allotment lands; and        6. Navajo Allotment Land Owners do not share opinions of       environmentalists voicing their objections on natural       resources developments. These over publicized objections by       the environmentalists have drowned out and overshadowed       Navajo Allotment Land Owners Rights; and        7. Navajo Allotment Land Owners are truly the impacted       people of the Chaco area. These lands were patented and       allotted to the Navajo People in New Mexico and handed down       through many generations. These lands were given in exchange       for land taken by the U.S. Government in exchange for       citizenships. Therefore, as Navajo People being land owners,       they have the right to lease, develop, or excavate their       lands; Now therefore be it        Resolved That: 1. Nageezi Chapter hereby supports and       recognizes the opposition by the Navajo Allotment Land Owners       of the ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of       2018'' or Senate bill 2907; and        2. Nageezi Chapter hereby further supports and requests       U.S. Senator Udall and U.S. Senator Heinrich to attend a       meeting with Navajo Allotment Land Owners on the ``Chaco       Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2018'' to explain       the content and reasons of the proposed ``Chaco Cultural       Heritage Area Protection Act of 2018''. The meeting will       allow Navajo Allotment Land Owners to express their concerns       of the proposed ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act       of 2018'' and how it will limit their rights.                                CERTIFICATION         We Hereby Certify that the Foregoing Resolution #NC-18-077       was duly presented and discussed at a duly called meeting of       Nageezi Chapter, Navajo Nation (New Mexico), at which a       quorum was present, motioned by Delora Hesuse, seconded by       Leon Sam, was voted on with 52 in favor, 00 opposed, and 03       abstained, this 01st day of July 2018.                                                      Ervin Chavez,                                                 Chapter President.                                                   Jessica Platero,                                               Secretary/Treasurer.     I should note, these are significant sums which the Navajo  allottees depend on each and every year. According to a 2017 Department  of the Interior IG report, 20,855 Navajo allottees receive a collective  $96 million per year from revenues raised through responsible oil and  gas development on their allotments. Quite simply, infringing on their  right to develop their mineral resources jeopardizes their quality of  life.   Further, oil and gas development has blessed the State of New Mexico  with significant budget windfalls in recent years. Just last week, the  Department of the Interior announced that the State of New Mexico would  receive $1.17 billion in revenues from Federal oil and gas development,  the highest disbursement in the State's history.   2018 was a record-breaking year for oil and gas development in New  Mexico, with State revenues reaching $2.2 billion, total. Roughly half  of these revenues will return directly to the State's schools,  investing in higher pay for teachers and staff, while other funds were  allocated for infrastructure projects and public services.   These funds were provided by oil and gas operations on not only  Federal lands, but on State trust lands, as well. Roughly 8 percent of  the withdrawal area in this bill is owned by the State of New Mexico  and can be developed for the benefit of its citizens. Enacting this  bill will cut off the revenue streams from both Federal and State  energy development, reducing future revenues for educational  initiatives like those signed into law earlier this year.   Mr. Chairman, the Chaco Cultural History Park is already protected  and off limits to oil and gas development. If leasing were to occur in  the surrounding area, it would be subject to a multitude of Federal  laws and regulations before any development could begin, including the  National Historic Preservation Act, designed to protect culturally  significant areas and artifacts on all Federal lands.   Before we declare a permanent ban on energy development in such a  large area, we need to have all of the facts. We need to have a  complete scientific review and stakeholder engagement process that is  already underway. We need to thoroughly weigh the benefits and  concerns, and we need to consider all those who are impacted. Not doing  so could have significant consequences for the Navajo allottees and for  the State of New Mexico's budget and priorities for its citizens.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I love the passion in the gentleman's voice, but, once  again, it is not me. It is the allottees who brought their voice  forward, the Navajo allottees. They have seen, time and time again,  promises made by the Federal Government and promises not kept.   So, once again, who would you rather believe, the allottees or the  BLM? Personally, I would side with the allottees.   When you look at the map, it tells you the story you need to know. If  we are going to make an amendment, we should guarantee access through  any of that application through this area, not just through the BLM,  but all this area, because those are the resources of the State.    I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.    Yes.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, once again, it says it  takes it off of mineral exposure, but it doesn't give access.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would love to engage with the gentleman from New Mexico if the  gentleman would not mind.   Mr. Chair, Members are bringing up this concept of methane capture.  There is an easy solution.   Is the gentleman in favor of providing a pipeline, because what ends  up happening, we can recover almost 100 percent of the methane  emissions when we have a pipeline nearby, because then it becomes  profitable and it becomes something that we can actually utilize.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.    Mr. Chair, I would let the gentleman know that I am one of  [[Page H8628]]  these technology nerds. I have been visiting with people who have  revolutionized and have new ideas in regard to pipelines that would set  this on fire.   So if we are looking at technology, we ought to be looking at in the  right way. It is beneficial. We are living longer, not like what we  were at the turn of the 1900s, which was shorter.   My point is, if there is technology out there for pipelines that is  very consistent with almost 100 percent capture, wouldn't the gentleman  entertain that?   I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.    Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, I have no problem. What I  would ask in return is let's turn around and go back to Petra Nova down  in Texas where we have a coal-fired plant that actually captures 100  percent of any emissions. It takes it down into the gas areas and  actually injects it back in, squeegeeing what the rest of the oil and  gas is, and then it condenses into limestone. It is pretty interesting  technology.   So I appreciate the gentleman for his back-and-forth, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Bishop), who is the ranking member of the full committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, for the record, I would like to reiterate a number of  institutions that are against H.R. 2181. To preface that, we set  precedents and we codify precedents. So that is why, Mr. Chairman, you  will have multiple States disagreeing with H.R. 2181.   So for those who are against H.R. 2181, you have the American  Exploration and Mining Association, there is a group letter; Arizona  Liberty, group letter; Arizona Mining Association, group letter;  Arizona Pork Producers, group letter; Arizona Rock Products  Association; group letter; Conservatives for Property Rights, a letter;  Denver Lumber Company, a letter; enCore Energy Corporation; Mohave  County Supervisor Buster Johnson, a letter; New Mexico Business  Coalition, a letter; New Mexico Cattle Growers Association; New Mexico  Federal Lands Council; New Mexico Wool Growers Association; Western  Energy Alliance; and Women's Mining Coalition. These are just some of  the people who are against it.   When we look at this board, we have this designation, you see it here  in Chaco Canyon.   What wisdom did they have when they first put this together?   That is what I want to ask. The dimensions here are for a reason.   Why are we expending this, particularly when there is so little trust  in the Federal Government?   I think we have just realized that we had to move a part of our  government--I think the BLM, if I remember right--out to Grand  Junction, Colorado, so that we actually had some bureaucrats who  actually understood the dilemmas that are out there in Western culture  and in Western States.   Yes, Western States gave up a lot. They gave a lot up compared to our  Eastern cohorts. We gave property to the Federal Government for  stewardship, however, that has been abused. The products that we were  supposed to get off those lands as public lands have dwindled.   Eastern States call us beggars in regard to payment in lieu of taxes  because we can't tax these Federal lands. And we are begging for  pennies on the dollar.   Something is wrong with that.   We are also vested in the community application of the best  management of these resources and getting the highest yield out of it.  It is like an investment.   How do we get the best out of this area?   When you look at this, no wonder the Navajo allottees don't trust the  Federal Government. Tell me when the Federal Government has honored  their promise.   Look at the Navajo generating station in Arizona. This was a promise  to the Navajo and Hopi Tribes to have work that was dependent upon  them, that gave them the benefits of that entrepreneurship and that  reflection of minerals. Sixty percent of the Navajo economy is based  off of the Navajo generating station at the mine. That is gone. Eighty  percent of the Hopis on the mine and NGS. That is gone. So it is no  wonder these Navajo allottees don't trust the Federal Government. I  don't blame them.   Trust is a series of promises kept. Until we can start honoring our  promises, we have got to stop this foolishness. There is plenty of land  there. I want to see my sites, but I also want my energy, too. There is  a way of going about it.   We engaged with the gentleman from New Mexico. It is going to be a  wonderful aspect to start talking about technology in regard to  recouping 100 percent of the methane and anything else that comes out  of it.   I do come from northern Arizona where I can see the stars. I don't  want to ever lose sight of that, because I think it was Buzz Lightyear  who said: To infinity and beyond. That is the way we should also be.   But it is not about victimization, it is about empowerment. I believe  these Navajo allottees deserve their rights to make sure that the  government honors their promise. I want cultural sites to be honored.  But I wonder what the difference is when this site is held in this  parameter and why we are going about the business to expand it even  further.   Once again, enough is enough.    I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman  for that. But, once again, trust is a series of promises kept.   When has the Federal Government held their trust up to the Tribal men  or even allottees?   It doesn't matter if they are Native American. We have had a number  of mining claims that have been stymied because the Forest Service or  the BLM will not give them access, even though they have allowed and  stated that they would have access to that claim.    So, once again, it is a hollow promise; and, once again, I beseech  individuals until the government starts honoring promises, they are not  entitled to the hierarchy of trust. That is just it. I trust people  more than I do the government. A government that can give all can take  all. I'm not for that. I'm for empowerment. I'm not for victimization.   What I have seen, I don't like. I have seen that the promise to the  Navajo people and to the Hopi people is lame.   We are going to take these good-paying jobs in northern Arizona, and  we are going to give them welfare?   How discouraging is that?   Does that lift a person's spirit?   No, it doesn't.   It doesn't give them upward mobility. I thought that was the American  experience. It is sad that we are at this point in time. I think we  need to have  [[Page H8630]]  more dialogue on these bills. We need to have more discussions. Yes,  the ranking member made the comment: good process, builds good policy,  builds good politics. None of that exists right now. None of that  exists.   Until we get back to the civil debate on this, it continually won't  exist.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Chair, I include the following letters in the Record.

Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop: I write       to you today to express my strong opposition to H.R. 2181,       the ``Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2019''.       This bill permanently bans oil, natural gas, coal and other       minerals from federal leasing and future development on       316,000 acres in New Mexico while also permanently       terminating leases in the area that have yet to go into       production.        H.R. 2181 places our economic and energy security at risk       by putting an area rich in oil and gas resources permanently       off limits to production. This bill will harm tribal members,       reduce general fund and education revenues infringe on       private property rights and negatively impact local       economies.        The area in question has proven to hold large reserves of       oil and gas resources. BLM recognized the potential in this       area and proposed to include several parcels near Chaco       Canyon in its oil and gas lease sale on March 28, 2019.        The so-called ``buffer zone'' imposed by this bill is       completely unnecessary, as oil and gas production has taken       place in this area for decades, with no damage to the       national park. In fact, the expressed purpose of the park was       to protect the culturally significant ruins and great houses       of the Chaco people, and the boundaries of the park were       drawn for that very goal.        H.R. 2181 will harm education. In fiscal year 2018, oil and       natural gas production generated $2.2 billion for New       Mexico's general fund and accounted for one-third of all       revenue in the fund. More than $820 million of these funds       flowed to k-12 schools, providing enough revenues enough to       cover the salaries of nearly 11,500 teachers.        It was clear from the manner in which the committee treated       this bill that the voices of tribal members were not       adequately considered. In fact, no allottees were invited to       speak at the site visit or at the subcommittee hearing in New       Mexico discussing this legislation.        Delora Hesuse, a Navajo with private mineral rights in New       Mexico, claims the concerns of Indian allottees have not been       heard and that the proposed 316,000-acre ``buffer'' is a       solution in search of a problem. According to Western Wire,       Hesuse stated, ``How come we don't have a voice in this? . .       . Environmentalists and others claiming to speak on their       behalf have `not even consulted us or asked our permission .       . . Her fellow allottees were passed over for [opponents] and       environmental activists and not included in the panel       discussions at the field hearings. We oppose the buffer zone       because it's never been an issue. Everyone knew their       boundaries. She said residents near Chaco have been receiving       royalties since the 1970s and they don't want that critical       income to go away.''        H.R. 2181 imposes an assault on Indian allottees that hold       private mineral rights in the withdrawal area and tramples on       property rights. This bill makes their assets worthless,       taking away valuable royalty payments from these impoverished       communities. To put this in perspective, in 2015 alone, the       Federal Indian Minerals Office distributed $96 million to       20,835 allottees throughout the country.        Allottees in the Chaco region have consistently expressed       opposition to this proposed withdrawal. Instead of listening       to all local voices, the proponents of this bill have       pandered to environmental groups who claim to represent all       the relevant stakeholders on this matter, but clearly do not.        There are already numerous federal and state laws and       regulations on the books that adequately protect the Chaco       National Park. The oil and gas industry has both a legal and       moral obligation to protect the artifacts of the Chaco       people, as well as avoiding impacts on newly discovered       artifacts, which it has always done. American energy       production and protecting the environment are not mutually       exclusive goals. Chaco will continue to be protected while       responsible oil and gas production occurs, benefitting       education and reducing carbon emissions in the process.        Again, I oppose H.R. 2181 and urge its rejection.            Sincerely,                                                 Buster D. Johnson,      Mohave County Supervisor, District III.                                   ____                                                                IPAA                     Independent Petroleum Association of America                                                   October 25, 2019.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop: The       Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) strongly       opposes H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area       Protection Act. IPAA did not object when Interior Secretary       Bernhardt issued a one-year freeze on leasing in order to       complete the ongoing Resource Management Plan (RMP) in the       area. We believe it is important to have all the facts before       making any land management decision involving public lands.       However, despite the fact that the RMP has not yet been       released, House Democratic leadership plans to bring H.R.       2181 to the floor for a vote in the coming weeks. This       legislation is premature and locks-up land in the region       before we have all the facts from the RMP. This bill would       permanently ban federal oil and natural gas leasing on       roughly 316,000 acres of land in New Mexico and terminate       existing leases. It is bad policy to act before we know the       facts.        While the sponsors of this legislation claim it will not       affect Native American allottee mineral rights, the reality       is far different. H.R. 2181 will create significant access       and extraction complications for the Tribal allottees along       with any companies they partner with and will lead to a de       facto mineral extraction ban on their lands.        At a June 5, 2019 hearing in the Natural Resources       Committee on the legislation, a witness with allottee land       from the Navajo Nation, Nageezi chapter testified against the       bill stating that H.R. 2181 would ``put many of our mineral       rights off limits and stop a much-needed source of income to       feed, shelter, clothe and protect our families.'' The witness       also submitted for the record a petition signed by 131 Navajo       allottees opposing this legislation, as well as two       resolutions  [[Page H8631]]       from the Huerfano and Nageezi Navajo chapters, which are       closest to this area, expressing support for the Navajo       allotment landowners and recognizing their opposition to this       bill.        IPAA has been content to let the Chaco Canyon RMP process       proceed to its conclusion. However, we cannot support any       efforts to increase the area's boundary before all the RMP is       completed. The main purpose of establishing the Chaco Culture       National Historical Area was to protect every area of       historical significance. That goal has been accomplished.       Extending the boundaries and adding acreage to the Heritage       Area will not enhance protection of areas of historical       significance. There are no areas outside the currently       designated boundaries that qualify for protections. However,       the park expansion would have economically devastating       impacts on those who live closest to the area.        For these reasons, IPAA urges you to vote ``NO'' on H.R.       2181.            Sincerely,                                                Daniel T. Naatz,          Senior Vice President, Government Relations and Political                                                            Affairs,      Independent Petroleum Association of America.                                   ____                                           WESTERN ENERGY ALLIANCE                                                      July 16, 2019.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop: Western       Energy Alliance strongly opposes H.R. 2181, the Chaco       Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act. This bill permanently       bans new federal oil and natural gas leasing and development       on 316,000 acres in New Mexico while also terminating       existing leases.        H.R. 2181 puts at risk the local economy and the       livelihoods of thousands of Indian allottees in the area by       making it very difficult if not impossible for them to       develop the energy resources they own. While the bill       purports to leave Indian allottees unaffected, the reality is       that the interlocking nature of the federal and allottee       estates means that companies will avoid developing in the       area. With today's horizontal drilling of two-mile laterals       it is not possible to avoid the federal mineral estate while       still producing on pockets of allottee minerals. If the bill       passes, companies will have no recourse but to avoid       developing Indian allottee energy resources.        For this reason, Indian allottees oppose this bill. When       Indian allottee Delora Hesuse testified before the committee       in June, she attached to her testimony petitions with       signatures of other allottees who also oppose the threat to       their families' oil and natural gas income. As she testified,       the money she and 20,835 other Indian allottees earn from       their energy property is about $96 million annually. That       huge source of income in an area otherwise plagued by       unemployment and poverty is threatened by this bill.        The area containing the highly productive Mancos Shale that       would be excluded from federal development has been proven to       hold large reserves of oil and natural gas. But the       exclusionary zone imposed by this bill is completely       unnecessary, as oil and natural gas production has taken       place in this area for decades, with no damage to the       national park. In fact, the expressed purpose of the park       boundaries is to protect the culturally significant ruins and       great houses of the Chaco people.        We urge the committee not to pass this bill. Thank you for       considering our input.            Sincerely,                                                Kathleen M. Sgamma,                                                         President.     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition, although I am not opposed  to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, when I look at this, I see the aptitude to try  to amend this to give access. I have to tell the gentleman, though, it  doesn't go far enough.   Mr. Chair, I think what we have to do is guarantee access so that  Congress is specifically and intentionally demanding that they have  that access because you know as well as I know that, once again,  government problems exist. I will give the gentleman an example.   In the last land package, we have a land package that included the La  Paz  [[Page H8633]]  land exchange by BLM. Do you know what the big problem now has been? It  was signed into law. It has been about access. Our legislation actually  said that it did not impugn any of the mineral estates, but then the  BLM came back and said, listen, that doesn't guarantee you access to  it.   That is why I think it doesn't go far enough.   I would love to see it say that it requires the allottees access to  those lands. But I am not opposed to it. I think it slightly makes it  better.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop),  the ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources.    Mr. Chair, I think we need to devolve this back to the  people of interest, the Native peoples, the people of the State, the  private owners.   Mr. Chair, I lay no opposition to this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow Federal lands  included in the withdrawal area to be conveyed or exchanged with State  trust entities, as well as Native American Tribes.   Currently, over one-third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the  Federal Government. The 316,000-acre withdrawal this bill creates  includes substantial parcels of Native American-owned private land and  State trust lands.   State trust lands are an essential part of funding public services in  the West, especially education. However, Federal overreach, such as  this legislation, puts that funding at risk. Allowing the conveyance of  certain lands in the withdrawal to State trust agencies and private  businesses will help to mitigate the effects of this withdrawal on  essential public services and local infrastructure.   Allowing the conveyance of federally held land will also go a long  way to addressing one of the critical problems with this legislation,  which is access. Denying access to these lands to private landowners  and Native American allottees is simply wrong. The growing Federal  estate is not a good thing for the long-term future of the West.   Instead of locking up more land, like the majority is trying to do  today, we should be focused on increasing multiple use on public lands.  We can have our cake, and we can eat it, too.   To put it simply, instead of needlessly locking up more land, we  should be focused on unlocking the potential of the West, empowering  people to enjoy it.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am not from New Mexico, but I do have an  interest in education because that was one of the standard operating  procedures that we were promised on public land.   If I am not mistaken, the Tribes are beneficiaries, as well, of that  educational fund. And so, when you start looking at this, depriving  that fund of its due resources--I don't know about New Mexico, but  Arizona has got a problem paying for its educational system. It is not  because we don't have enough money; it is because we don't have enough  land. That is a problem.   I am here on behalf of the beneficiaries that the government  promised. So, from that standpoint, I don't see a dichotomy in the  argument until we can understand, until we have a better facilitation  of that exchange, once again, doing something expediently, as we had  the discussion earlier about access to those allottees.   Once again, government hasn't been the solution that it had claimed  to be. We almost have to guide them hand and foot, pushing them to the  right decision.   Mr. Chair, I still rise in favor of this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would ensure this bill would  not take effect if the withdrawal in question is proven to affect  development or economic value of Native American mineral rights on  allotments.   Private property rights are a fundamental American ideal. The  316,000-acre withdrawal this bill creates includes substantial parcels  of privately held land, much of which is owned by Native American  allottees.   The benefits of owning mineral rights are obvious for Native  communities. In 2015 alone, the Federal Indian Mineral Office  distributed $96 million to more than 20,000 allottees around the  country.   At the June 5, 2019, hearing on H.R. 2181, the Committee on Natural  Resources heard testimony from Delora Hesuse, a citizen of the Navajo  Nation, Nageezi chapter, and a Navajo allottee, who owns mineral  resources in the proposed area.   Ms. Hesuse testified that H.R. 2181 would ``put many of our mineral  rights off limits and stop a much-needed source of income to feed,  shelter, clothe, and protect our families.''   Apparently, the voices of Ms. Hesuse and other allottees who have  spoken to the committee have not been heard. This amendment is an  effort to acknowledge that their livelihoods could be drastically  diminished by this legislation.   I ask the Members of this body to put themselves in the shoes of the  Native American allottees who have staked their livelihood on the  mineral rights on their properties that are rightfully theirs, only to  have the Federal Government strip them of their rights. I believe that  is an injustice.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would have loved to hear that argument in  the discussion on ANWR. That would have been interesting to have.   When I look at this, it has become very evident, in my time here in  Congress, to find programs that had no authorization by Congress that  were enacted. Interesting. Interesting, once again, in a government  that is not trusted.   Trust is a series of promises kept. Once again, this reiterates the  private property ownership of these allottees to make sure that it is  not impugned. I do not see the definition of that causing a quandary.   Once again, these are allottees who are deserving for us to require  to make sure that they are held whole.   So, once again, I find it shortsighted in the application that the  other side doesn't want to accept this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I wish everyone would vote for this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
