 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this is a very important bill. Unfortunately, the way  that it is currently written raises some significant concerns.   As the Representative of Tribal communities in Wyoming, I share very  much the notion and the concept of helping to increase self- determination, but I believe that this bill, as it is currently  written, unfortunately, leaves unresolved some major issues with  respect to, in particular, Bureau of Reclamation water projects that  could affect both Tribal as well as non-Tribal interests.   In our Western States where water is a scarce and precious commodity,  water management interests must be carefully balanced, and I am  concerned that S. 209 does not strike that balance.   Over the last several Congresses, House Republicans have offered  solutions to the reclamation projects issues without the need for  courts to step in to sort this out. Unfortunately, this effort was most  recently defeated on a party-line vote with little discussion from the  Democrat majority.   Unfortunately, we still are, today, faced with a situation where we  have got a worthy goal that this legislation is attempting to achieve,  but it doesn't quite get there.   Given these unresolved concerns, I must urge rejection of the measure  as written and ask for a ``no'' vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3160, the Blackwater Trading  Post Land Transfer Act. This bill would place, as my colleague said,  approximately 55 acres of land in Arizona into trust for the Gila River  Indian Community.   These lands and the former Blackwater Trading Post have a historic  connection to the Tribe, as the trading post served many Tribal members  since at least the 1930s.   In 2010, the Tribe purchased the Blackwater Trading Post and  surrounding lands after the former owners retired.   Under the 2004 Arizona Water Rights Settlement Act, the Tribe cannot  acquire off-reservation lands into trust absent an act of Congress.  Therefore, we need to pass this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of this measure and I urge my  colleagues to support the legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. H.R. 3349 would  authorize the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to establish the  Republic of Texas Legation Memorial on Federal land in the District of  Columbia, commemorating those who, as representatives of the Republic  of Texas, served in Washington, D.C., as diplomats to the United  States, and made possible the annexation of Texas as the 28th State.   Texas legation sites in Paris and London have been recognized with  historical markers for many years, but never here in Washington, D.C.  The Texas diplomatic ministers who came to Washington worked out of the  boarding houses in which they lived. Eight boarding houses have been  identified with varying degrees of supporting evidence. This bill would  allow the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to place memorial plaques  in honor of these diplomats.   Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3465 would authorize the Fallen Journalists  Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work on Federal land  to commemorate the sacrifices made by journalists for a free and  independent press.   This bill requires the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation to  follow the standard legal framework established by the Commemorative  Works Act for the placement of commemorative works on Federal land in  the District of Columbia.   According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 1,382 journalists  have been killed since 1992 as a result of their work in combat or  crossfire or while carrying out dangerous assignments. Hundreds more  each year are attacked, imprisoned, and tortured.   Threats and attacks against journalists are not new, but today  journalists face an increasingly hostile environment. H.R. 3465 was  introduced 1 year after the deadliest attack on journalists in modern  United States history when five Capital Gazette employees were killed  in their Annapolis, Maryland, newsroom on June 28, 2018.   Madam Speaker, this memorial will stand as an important reminder of  the First Amendment and the vital importance that a free and  independent press plays in defending all of our rights.   I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4957 reauthorized three programs that are  intended to prevent cases within our Indian communities of child abuse,  neglect, family violence, and trauma, as well as providing treatment  for victims of Indian child sexual abuse.   The authorization for appropriations for these three programs expired  in 1997. This bill also makes important underlying technical changes to  the statute, requiring agency reports on grant awards.   Madam Speaker, while the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence  Prevention Act is one of the only federally dedicated child abuse  prevention and victim treatment programs providing funding for Tribal  governments, Congress has only appropriated approximately $5 million  for this program.   I am grateful to the sponsor for bringing our attention to this  important issue as we all work together to end abuse, neglect, and  violence across our States and on our reservations.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 294 recognizes the important role that business  incubators can play in generating economic growth and economic activity  and supporting our Tribal businesses. I thank my colleague very much  for bringing this legislation to the floor here in the House.   As defined in this bill, Madam Speaker, a business incubator is an  organization that provides physical workspace and facilities resources  to startups and established businesses.   As my colleague has pointed out, there are many challenges that are  unique to our Tribal communities that this bill will help to focus on  and help members of our Tribes overcome.   By offering services that range from workplace enhancement,  comprehensive skills training, and networking assistance, business  incubators have been a reliable and consistent solution to many of the  challenges startup businesses face around the country and to many of  the challenges that continue to plague Indian Country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 832.   As my colleague has described, the bill would nullify an 1865  supplement to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation. It  was signed after the original 1855 treaty.   This supplemental treaty further restricted the rights of Tribal  members to the extent that, among other things, they could not leave  the reservation without written permission from the Federal agency  superintendent.   According to the Tribe, this supplemental treaty was in response to  non-Indian settler concerns with Tribal members using their usual and  accustomed areas to hunt and fish.   The State of Oregon has indicated it has no intention of enforcing  this antiquated and discriminatory treaty, but it does remain on the  books, Madam Speaker, and I support the Tribes' request to have it  struck.   Madam Speaker, I thank the sponsor of the House companion of this  bill, Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Walden, for his  efforts to see this offensive provision removed.   Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of this measure, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 139, the Springfield Race Riot Study Act, which was  sponsored by our colleague, Congressman Rodney Davis, authorizes the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the  site of the Springfield race riots of 1908.   As my colleague has just described, on the evening of August 14,  1908, racial tensions ignited in the Illinois capital of Springfield.  The riot was incited by a White mob who wanted to lynch two Black  inmates housed at the county jail. One had been charged with murdering  a White man, the other with raping a White woman, an allegation that  was later recanted.   After the two inmates were spirited away for their safety, the mob  destroyed Black neighborhoods and lynched two innocent Black men. Soon  after this horrific weekend of violence and racial strife, a prominent  group of social reformers came together in February 1909 and  established the National Association for the Advancement of Colored  People.  [[Page H4567]]    Recently, archeologists uncovered the physical remains of five houses  and their associated artifacts that burned in the 1908 riot. Last year,  the National Park Service completed a reconnaissance survey of the site  and concluded it was likely the site that would meet criteria for  inclusion in the National Park System if fully analyzed through a  congressionally authorized special resources study.   In August, Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt visited the site  of the 1908 riot to declare it part of the recently established African  American Civil Rights Network. One goal of this network is to ensure  that we accurately tell the complete and often painful story of the  struggle for civil rights in our country.   I commend Representative Davis on his work to highlight this tragic  event in our Nation's history. I urge adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the significant and unparalleled  sacrifices veterans have made for our country, my colleague Mr. Steube  introduced H.R. 1702 to waive the application fee associated with  special use permits for veterans' organizations and our Gold Star  families at war memorials on Federal lands.   Special use permits are required by the National Park Service for  activities that provide a benefit to an individual group or  organization and for activities that require the use of a designated  park location for a specific purpose and length of time.   When those who have served our Nation, Mr. Speaker, including Gold  Star families, want to hold an event whose primary purpose is to  commemorate or honor the service of veterans, they should not be  subject to application fees. This bill removes a potential barrier and  ensures our veterans are not discouraged from planning, hosting, or  organizing events on our public lands.   With this bill, Mr. Speaker, we show in one more way our respect for  our Nation's veterans, and we support the special events that honor the  men and women of our Armed Forces.   I commend my colleague Congressman Steube for his work on behalf of  our servicemen and -women.   Mr. Speaker, this bill's sponsor, Congressman Steube, was unable to  be here today to speak on his bill because of commitments in his  district.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure and since I have no  further speakers, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 490 designates the mountain ridge where an Air Force  B-47 strategic bomber crashed while on a training mission in Montana in  1962 as the ``B-47 Ridge.''   This bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 1267, which our Congressman  Gianforte led here in the House. Nearly 60 years have passed since that  U.S. Air Force B-47 bomber left Texas and crashed into Montana's  Emigrant Peak just north of Yellowstone National Park in the Paradise  Valley. Debris remains on the ridge where the plane crashed. S. 490  will rename the area the ``B-47 Ridge'' to honor the four-man crew who  perished in the wreck.   Those brave airmen who died that day on the southwestern slope of  Emigrant Peak during a training mission were: Captain Bill Faulconer,  Lieutenant Lloyd Sawyers, Lieutenant David Sutton, and Lieutenant Fred  Hixenbaugh.   This legislation will also allow for the placement of a memorial  plaque which will be paid for by the crew's families and the local  community.   This is a good and important bill honoring the sacrifice of those  airmen and I applaud Congressman Gianforte and the entire Montana  delegation for their efforts to get this lasting tribute signed into  law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 895. As my colleague from New  Mexico described it, this bill would enable Tribal grant school  employees to participate in the Federal Health Benefits Program.   Under current law, the Bureau of Indian Education employees and  tribally managed schools operating under a self-determination contract  are already eligible for this benefit. It is time that we helped Tribal  grant schoolteachers.   This bill will not only provide parity for the benefits that  employees receive at other schools serving Native children, but it will  help keep essential moneys focused on education itself.   I want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, my colleague  Congressman Dusty Johnson, for his thoughtful leadership on this issue.   This stand-alone legislation will go a long way to help Tribal grant  schools during the COVID-19 recovery period and beyond.   I am disappointed, however, Mr. Speaker, that the Democrat majority  has refused to act on S. 886, the Indian Water Rights Settlement  Extension Act. S. 886 includes the text of this bill and would also  help Tribes in one of the hardest hit COVID-19 regions of the country,  the Navajo Nation, which has cited lack of water as a complication for  fending off and defeating this deadly virus.   S. 886 addresses this very issue by ensuring better access to water  for the Tribe. Unfortunately, the majority has let this water  settlement agreement for the Navajo collect dust. It has been 90 days  since the Senate passed this bipartisan bill. Despite repeated requests  for its consideration, the Democrats have taken no action to see this  critical agreement enacted into law.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Navajo President  Nez asking Speaker Pelosi to schedule a vote on final passage on S.  886.                                               The Navajo Nation,                                     Window Rock, AZ, July 28, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: We respectfully       request that you schedule a vote on final passage of S. 886,       the Navajo Utah Water Rights Settlement Act (NUWRSA), before       the House leaves for the August recess. As discussed and       explained in our June 22, 2020 letter to the House, nearly 40       percent of the Navajo Nation lacks running water or adequate       sanitation in their homes. To make matters worse, the Navajo       Nation's COVID-19 infection rate on a per capita basis is one       of the highest in the country and the Navajo Nation has more       COVID-19 deaths than many states. The House has an       opportunity to take immediate action to mitigate future       COVID-19 outbreaks and address the drinking water crisis on       the Navajo Reservation by passing S. 886. Although the Senate       unanimously passed S. 886, the House of Representatives has       so not acted on it, further delaying the relief that it will       ultimately bring to the Navajo people.        The Navajo Nation has over 300,000 enrolled members and is       the largest Indian reservation spanning portions of Arizona,       New Mexico, and Utah. The conditions on Navajo are dire and       the pandemic only compounds our needs. With so few watering       points across the Navajo Nation, families must travel hours       to reach these points and must ration their water       accordingly. Without access to clean drinking water, the       Navajo Nation will continue to struggle, and its members will       be more susceptible to deadly illnesses such as COVID-19.        S. 886 would provide the means to begin to address these       critical needs. Through NUWRSA, the Navajo Nation would       receive approximately $220 million in federal and state       funding for desperately needed drinking water infrastructure       on the Reservation in exchange for the Nation waiving its       water-related claims against the United States and State of       Utah. In 2016, Congress first introduced the settlement       legislation and on June 4, 2020, the Senate unanimously       passed S. 886, demonstrating the broad bi-partisan support       for the legislation.        The Navajo Nation recognizes that there is more to be done       for Indian Country and we stand ready to assist you on this       work, but S. 886 is ready for final passage. The House's       inaction on S. 886 or sending it back to the Senate for       further consideration will only delay addressing the basic       human needs of the Navajo people. Therefore, we respectfully       request that you schedule a vote on final passage of S. 886       before the House recesses in August.            Sincerely,                                           Jonathan Nez, President.                                       Myron Lizer, Vice President.    Again, Mr. Speaker, we support the passage of Congressman  Johnson's bill, H.R. 895, and would also prefer to enact this provision  into law along with measures that will help the Navajo Nation with  their broader water shortages.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South Dakota  (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
