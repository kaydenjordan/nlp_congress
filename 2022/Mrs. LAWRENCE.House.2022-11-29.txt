 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his dedication  and the efforts of his entire team in bringing this bill to the floor.  I also thank the ranking member for his support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the DOULA for VA  Act.   Maternal mortality in the United States is a public health crisis.  While maternal mortality rates have declined globally over the past  three decades, the United States' maternal mortality rates have  climbed.   As we work to address this serious public health issue, we have a  responsibility to make sure that our pregnant veterans are included in  the conversation. This is because veterans who have experienced  pregnancy disproportionately experience mental health afflictions such  as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.   Studies have found that pregnant veterans were twice as likely to  have a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and stress disorder, and more  than those who had not experienced a pregnancy.   We must provide veterans who have served our country optimal maternal  and mental health care that takes into consideration their veteran- specific experiences.   Doulas have a proven positive effect on the health outcome of the  mother and child. As the use of doula services continue to grow, we  must look at ways to expand maternal health services for our women in  the VA.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women's  Issues for supporting this effort, the House leadership and their  hardworking staff, and the amazing committee staff for working to  advance this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
