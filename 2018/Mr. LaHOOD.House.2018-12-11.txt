 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of Quincy  University soccer coach Jack Mackenzie of Quincy, Illinois.   Hired in 1969, Jack built Quincy University into a college soccer  dynasty, guiding his program at all levels of college soccer, from the  NAIA division through the NCAA's division II status, and even excelling  at the NCAA's division I level.   For 43 years, Jack was at the helm of the Quincy soccer program. He  was a pioneer and a legend, leading the team to nine national  championships between 1970 and 1982, and amassing 516 victories,  putting him 10th on the all-time wins list across all NCAA division  levels.   Upon retirement in 2012, Jack remained involved in the Quincy  University community and could still be found in the stands at every  home game the Hawks played.   As the Quincy University community continues to mourn the loss of  Coach Jack Mackenzie, may we never forget the positive impact he had on  so many lives, the sport of soccer, and his tireless spirit in pursuit  of excellence.                            ____________________
