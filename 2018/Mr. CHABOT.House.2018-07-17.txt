 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and, Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of  2018.   Despite an improving economy, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and  startups still face numerous challenges. One of the chief challenges  that they face is access to capital, getting money.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I am pleased to  say that we have worked together in a bipartisan manner to pass one  piece of legislation that is contained in this, and we support the  whole bill, but this one is the HALOS Act, or Helping Angels Lead Our  Startups Act.   The HALOS Act would improve how investors and small businesses get  together at events, called demo days, where the people who have the  money and people who need the money can actually get together and  streamline some of the problems that they now face.    From my State of Ohio, to California, to New York State, all over the  country, small businesses are the job creators. Seventy percent of the  new jobs in America are created by small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for working with the  Small Business Committee and including the HALOS Act in this very  important legislation.
