 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in H.R. 200.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of my legislation, H.R.  200, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility  in Fisheries Management Act.   Mr. Chairman, as one of the sponsors of the original bill way back in  1975, and I fought to secure enactment in 1976, I can say it is  probably the most successful legislation that ever passed this House to  create a sustainable yield of fisheries for the United States of  America.   I first wrote what would become the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and it  hasn't been reauthorized since 2006. For 6 years, I have worked with  Members of this body on both sides of the aisle to improve this  legislation.   I know some of my colleagues will say that I didn't do enough to  ensure the act retains the strong bipartisan nature of the original  bill. It is important to remember the legislative history. While it is  true that the version of the Magnuson-Stevens Act that became law  passed the House under suspension of the rules, the original bill  passed the Natural Resources Committee after a long markup by a vote of  26-15, with only four Democrats voting in favor of the bill.                                time  1500    So this point that the previous reauthorizations were  noncontroversial and nonpartisan is not true.   My legislation, H.R. 200, would make a number of improvements to the  original act in order to ensure a proper balance between the biological  needs of fish stocks and the economic needs of fishermen in coastal  communities.   The legislation tailors Federal fishery authorities in order to give  councils the proper tools and flexibility needed to effectively manage  their fisheries, and will support a more robust domestic seafood  industry and greater job creation across the country.   This legislation allows added flexibility for fishery managers to  rebuild depleted fisheries, more transparency for fishermen in science  and management, and a requirement for NOAA to provide better  accountability on how fees are collected and used. It also authorizes  appropriations for the act for 5 years.  [[Page H6070]]    I am proud to say my bill protects our commercial and recreational  fishing interests, and will allow councils to do their job in a more  streamlined and effective manner.   My bill would amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act.  It allows for regional management of fisheries. The law gives guidance  through its national standards and creates the process that allows the  councils to develop fishery management plans.   This legislation was written for fishermen to ensure they are able to  catch sustainable yields of fish for the communities. It is critical  for the protection of coastal communities and for allowing the  stakeholders to be part of the management of the fisheries.   To address the ever-changing needs of fisheries and fishery  communities, Congress has passed various amendments to this act.  Changes were based on knowledge of the times gained through experience,  improvements in science, and better management techniques.   In the mid-1990s, Congress addressed overfishing, included  protections of habitat, improvements for fisheries science, and  reductions in bycatch. These were the issues of the time, and they were  addressed as needed. One of these problems also included the lack of  resources to fund stock assessments to provide needed data to the  regional fishery management councils, something that continues to be an  issue today.   The act was last amended in 2007. Congress included measures that set  science-based annual catch limits to prevent overfishing, including a  requirement to end overfishing within 2 years. Accountability measures  were adopted, which meant harvest reductions if harvest levels were  exceeded.   Work to develop H.R. 200 began 6 years ago. The committee held over a  dozen hearings, with testimony from over 100 witnesses. As with past  reauthorizations, and in line with a main purpose of the act--to  balance conservation with economic use of the resource--H.R. 200 takes  a middle-of-the-road approach to fisheries management.   While some today may complain the bill's flexibility rolls back  scientific protections, that statement is just not accurate. The  flexibility in the bill is based on science. Rebuilding of fish stocks  will be based on the biology of fish stock. Harvest levels will still  be based on science and set at levels where overfishing will not occur.  The regional councils will continue to follow recommendations of their  science and statistical committee.   During every reauthorization cycle, the Magnuson-Stevens Act is  updated to be closely in sync with current-day science, management  techniques, and knowledge. As the fishermen, communities, councils, and  fishery managers develop better techniques and learn lessons from  implementing the law, Congress can take that knowledge to improve that  law. Flexibility is a cornerstone of the law. The Magnuson-Stevens Act  promotes regional flexibility that recognizes differing ocean  conditions, variations in regional fisheries, different harvesting  methods and management techniques, and distinct community impacts.   Again, I want to stress: this bill was written for fish and  communities, not for the interest groups. I will not stand by and watch  other interest groups hijack this piece of legislation, taking away the  sustainable concept of our fisheries and the healthy concept of our  fisheries and the healthy concept of our communities for other reasons  and other causes.   While my name will be on the bill as the sponsor, we all know that  bringing legislation to the floor is a group effort and we would not be  here today talking about fish without the support of other members and  a tremendous amount of hard work from staff. So I thank Chairman Bishop  and even Congressman Huffman and his staff--I had to say that--the  bill's cosponsors on both sides of the aisle; staff on the Natural  Resources Committee, Lisa Pittman, Charles Park, Richie O'Connell, Bill  Ball, and former staffer Dave Whaley; and members of my staff, Mike  DeFilippis and Martha Newell.   Mr. Chairman, I have to remind people that when we had this bill  passed originally, we were catching about, I would say, 2 percent of  our fish, and after the passage of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, we are  catching all but 1 percent and foreign countries are only catching 1  percent.   This is a good piece of legislation. It has worked in the past, and  it will work better in the future.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to my good friends on the other  side of the aisle, they are promoting the opposition to this bill from  interest groups that don't have any interest in commercial fishing,  period. Let's be real about this.   What hurts me, I have heard them say that it removes science from  fisheries. Let's explore this. No one is listening, but that is okay.   For starters, the words ``science'' and ``data'' appear 34 times  throughout the bill. Section 207 directs the councils to establish a  plan for cooperative research that brings together a wide variety of  high-quality, non-Federal data to support existing data.   This is about States, coastal areas, villages, communities, fishermen  making decisions instead of the Federal Government, and I know they  don't like that.   Section 208 directs the Secretary to work with the States to find the  best way to incorporate State data, just not their own data.   Section 301 directs the Secretary to develop a strategic plan for  conducting stock assessments for every stock in a fishery's management  plan.   Again, science.   Section 303 replaces an arbitrary 10-year rebuilding requirement. If  the fish come back quicker under this bill, H.R. 200, they could be  fished at a sustainable yield level. Under the present law, which I  wrote, they can't do that. Otherwise, we lose years and management of  the fish for a period of time. That is up to the councils under H.R.  200.   Section 306 directs the Secretary to expedite approval of high- quality State data in the Gulf of Mexico to better advantage those  recreational-heavy fisheries.   Finally, everything in this bill continues to be bound by the  scientific principle of the Magnuson mandate to utilize the best  available science for management decisions. There is nothing in this  bill that weakens it, nothing. Yet I keep hearing the constant waves of  dissension on the other side because they don't want to renew and make  a better bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I again would like to talk about this legislation, the H.R. 200 bill.  I am disappointed in the other side. It is a partisan issue, and,  unfortunately, it is.   I was listening to the speakers on the other side, and they really  don't have a concrete reason to object to this bill other than what  they are being told by those who don't want commercial fishing, and  they don't want recreational fishing. They may not say that, but in  reality, that is really what they are seeking.   Now, I again go back to myself and the period of time when the 200- mile limit occurred. Why did it happen?   I was in Kodiak, Alaska. None of you were even born, probably, at  that time. I was in Kodiak, Alaska, looked out 12 miles off the shore  of Kodiak, and there was a wall of lights. I said: What is that?   This was before I was a Congressman.   He said: That is foreign fishermen catching our fish--catching our  fish, America's fish.   When I got elected to Congress, one of the first things I did was try  to develop the Magnuson-Stevens Act with Gerry Studds from  Massachusetts. He was in the majority; I was the minority; and I  explained to him what was happening.   He went back home to a fishing district and then said: You have got a  good idea. Let's develop an economic zone 200 miles out, and we will  control the fisheries in that area.   So we worked together bipartisanly, wrote a bill with a concrete  suggestion for sustainable yield for fish, fishermen, communities for  America, and for our coastal States that are involved in commercial  fisheries and recreational fisheries.   We passed that bill, yes, out of the House, I believe, pretty much  unanimously. Went to the Senate side, and the Senate sided with  Magnuson-Stevens and decided to do the same thing.  [[Page H6074]]    Out of that, after we had opposition from just about every liberal in  the business--for what reason, I don't know, other than they thought it  would affect the international sea--it was finally signed into law by  President Ford.   From there, we have gone to the best managed fisheries in the world.  From there, under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, we have been able to  achieve what we should do. But we have grown in science. We have grown  in more knowledge about how and where we should fish and when.   People talk about the species that were depleted. There were no  species until this bill was established. And we rebuilt them, and we  are still rebuilding them under our science under this bill. But it  gives that flexibility to States to help manage.   Now, I know on that side of the aisle, they believe that the Federal  Government can do everything--in fact, they should do everything  because we don't know what we are doing. The States aren't really  States, they are part of the Federal Government, instead of the other  way around.    I argue that knowledge within States with science available and  science under present law under this bill, which we do not extinguish,  is really the crux of this issue, that the 200-mile limit, the H.R. 200  bill, my bill today--not because of me. I did not write this bill for  myself. I wrote it for the communities, for the fish, and the fishermen  for America.   Those that oppose it, I said: Uh-uh. They are not listening to the  communities. They believe Big Government can do best for them and  States should not be involved. I argue it is the States' issue to  protect their fish, yes, with supervision of the Federal Government.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the full  committee who allowed me to bring this outstanding bill to the floor of  the House.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a list of  supporters of this legislation.

Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman. I  have no more speakers, and I am going to close by saying this is good  legislation. We may have differences of opinion. It should be done. I  am quite proud of the original act. I am proud of this act, too.  Because I believe in the fisheries, not only commercial, and  recreational, but sustainable; sustainable for the communities, the  fish, and everybody in America.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment makes a series of  modifications in the underlying bill and removes specific provisions  related to the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental  Policy Act, and the Antiquities Act, at the request of my Democrat  cosponsors from Texas, Mr. Gene Green and Mr. Marc Veasey.   I introduced H.R. 200 in the early days of the 115th Congress. We  have made many changes during the committee markup on H.R. 200. We  adopted amendments authored by Ms. Bordallo from Guam, as well as from  the Senate Modern Fish Act that passed the Senate Committee on Commerce  with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.   My manager's amendment eliminated some provisions in the bill that  were most troublesome to Democrats, even though many outside  stakeholders and Members on my side of the aisle considered those to be  important components of the bill. The further spirited bipartisan  compromise and willingness to support a number of Democratic amendments  today--despite the rhetoric coming from the committee Democrats--our  actions, our markup, and our willingness to work with House Democrats  show that we have, in fact, been willing to work in a bipartisan  manner.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, although I do not oppose it.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin), who sponsored the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I understand the intent of my good friend's amendment,  but I reluctantly oppose it.   The amendment would begin to unravel, I believe, this council's  structure that was made in the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the gold standard  of global fisheries management. At best, it erodes MSA's emphasis on  regional management.   Fish stocks migrate up and down the Atlantic coast frequently  incorporated in a prospective of States invested in shared fishery  resources, a goal we all share. That is why Congress authorized the  Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and why my bill before us  today creates a liaison between the Mid-Atlantic Council and the New  England Council and vice versa.   These two mechanisms adequately address overlapping Atlantic coast  fisheries without undermining the fundamental council structure.   Mr. Chairman, reluctantly, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to  oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would not only  hamstring the flexibility of rebuilding fish stocks that this bill  provides, it would add serious bureaucratic delays in the development  of fishery management plans across the country.   Furthermore, according to NOAA, this amendment would eliminate some  of the flexibility currently provided under the national standard, one  which was updated under the Obama administration, and would cause an  unnecessary reduction in the catch.   NOAA also expressed concerns regarding the potential impact on  international fishing agreements that would  [[Page H6089]]  change how the U.S. can negotiate on rebuilding plans. According to a  letter authored by the National Coalition for Fishing Communities, this  amendment would undermine the act, impede reforms that are desperately  needed, and attack jobs in coastal communities.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter to the leadership of the  House and to myself where they say such an amendment sponsored by Mr.  Jared Huffman of California and Mr. Alcee Hastings of Florida will  ensure it does not: ``We believe it would actually undermine the MSA,  impede reforms that are desperately needed, and attack jobs in coastal  communities around the country, including in California and Florida,  the home States of Mr. Huffman and Mr. Hastings.''                                                  National Coalition                                         for Fishing Communities,                                                      July 10, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, United States House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, United States House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McCarthy: H.R. 200       (formerly H.R. 1335), the ``Strengthening Fishing Communities       and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act'' is       the product of three Managing our Nations Fisheries       (``MONF'') conferences, and numerous hearings with well over       a hundred witnesses (from to 2009 through 2017). These many       efforts were held in large part to address unintended       consequences in the implementation of the 2006       reauthorization.        The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management       Act (MSA) has largely been a success, but no law is perfect,       and H.R. 200 contains a number of important updates and       refinements. But as a result of a barrage of last-minute       amendments, proposed outside of the committee process, years       of hard work to create honest reform of the MSA is now in       jeopardy.        One such amendment, sponsored by Congressman Jared Huffman       (D-California) and Alcee Hastings (D-Florida) purports to       ``ensure that rebuilding plans are successful in rebuilding       overfished fish stocks.'' However, we believe it would       actually undermine the MSA, impede reforms that are       desperately needed, and attack jobs in coastal communities       around the country, including in California and Florida, the       home states of Mr. Huffman and Mr. Hastings.        In a letter delivered to their offices on last week, we       asked Mr. Huffman and Mr. Hastings to please explain to us       how they foresee that this amendment could be enacted without       having the effect of reducing commercial, charter and       recreational fishing quotas significantly. We also asked that       since they represent California and Florida, and since our       membership includes members who represent fishing interests       in California and Florida, that they explain how they see       this amendment improving conditions for seafood harvesters       and processors in your respective home states. Unfortunately       we did not receive a response to those questions.        In the provisions contained in this amendment were       implemented, the required theoretical probability of       management measures rebuilding a stock in the shortest time       period as possible would increase from 50% to 75% for many       species. The ``Huffman-Hastings Amendment'' would impose a       burden on many U.S.-managed fisheries.        While this sounds like an innocuous effort to strengthen       and improve the law, the fact is, the only way to meet the       requirements of the amendment would be to significantly       reduce many commercial, charter and recreational fishing       quotas significantly. Considering the status of U.S. fish       stocks recently described in NOAA's 2018 Report to Congress       as ``Overfishing remains near all time lows and we reached a       new milestone with the number of overfished stocks at the       lowest level ever'', the validity and intent of the ``Huffman       Amendment'' should be seriously questioned.        Why, if the current Act's requirements are having success       in rebuilding stocks, is there a reason to require the law to       be substantially more conservative?        In addition, the amendment removes a subtle but important       update to the MSA.        Section 304 of MSA states that ``For a fishery that is       overfished, any fishery management plan, amendment, or       proposed regulations . . . shall . . . specify a time period       for rebuilding the fishery that shall . . . be as short as       possible, taking into account the status and biology of any       overfished stocks of fish, the needs of fishing communities,       recommendations by international organizations in which the       United States participates, and the interaction of the       overfished stock of fish within the marine ecosystem.''        There is widespread support to change the term ``possible''       to ``practicable'' in this section. The intent of this change       is not to compromise or weaken the effectiveness of the MSA,       but rather to help better fulfill one of the fundamental and       original goals of the Act, emphasized in National Standard       1--to prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing       basis the optimum yield from each fishery. Changing the       terminology from ``possible'' to ``practicable'' would       provide Regional Fishery Management Councils with much-needed       flexibility and the option to choose between several       rebuilding scenarios to achieve specified conservation and       management objectives, not just the shortest and, quite       often, most harmful to fishing communities.        We must remain committed to restoring common sense to MSA.       We must not undermine our Nation's fisheries law in the name       of improving it, and cause harm to commercial charter and       recreational fishermen from Alaska to Maine.        Coastal communities and fishing families are relying on the       passage of clean legislation, as developed in committee.        We urge Members to vote NO on the Huffman Amendment to H.R.       200!

Mr. Chairman, I am suggesting, respectfully,  that this amendment is uncalled for and, frankly, will gut the bill and  the MSA, period.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I am sitting here listening to this.  These channels were built for navigation and commercial use by  taxpayers' dollars many years ago, and the seagrass grows back. Each  time, they mitigate when trying to maintain it. Where is the logic?   Where is the logic when we built those channels with American tax  dollars for commerce and now, each time they dredge it--they already  dredged it once--it grows back and they have to come back and file  another ES statement. Why are we doing this?                                time  1630    Who is this helping out? Not the fish because the eelgrass grows back  again, because they have to dredge it again. It costs money, slows down  commerce, and that is interfering with the economy of this country.   I have been through these channels. They can't show me where the  dredging hurts. In fact, it helps. It is like you said, mowing the  grass. You let it grow too long, you are going to get in trouble. We  let this eelgrass grow too long, you are going to hurt the channel or  you are going to hurt the fish in the long run.   So I compliment the gentleman on his amendment, and I will support  this amendment strongly.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for modifying  this amendment. I still have concerns, as I have told the gentleman. I  know the problem.   If I ever hear about a red snapper again, we change this to the  Graves snapper. That is what we are going to call it. I know there is a  problem, and I look forward to working with the gentleman to strengthen  the language and, especially, to making sure this does not include any  other areas, because I want Alaska and the Pacific Northwest left out.  I will say that is being selfish, but I know what the gentleman over  there said.   I understand what the gentleman is trying to do here. We have a  little ways to go. We will work together and try to get something done.    Mr. Chair, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I want to compliment the gentleman on  his amendment. This is long overdue.   We have the technology. The imposition of putting bodies on board  ships that don't really do anything, and I don't think make a great  count, can be done better through technology. So I compliment the  gentleman on his amendment, and I will be supporting his amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I wasn't going to rise in  opposition until I heard about Maine and how beautiful and the free- running streams and all the tourists and the king crab and all those  other things. I do admit, I have been to Maine, and I would agree with  him, but his is just a little tiny one. We are a great big thing with  bigger streams, bigger fish, bigger crab, but no lobsters, though.   I have no lobsters, and I am going to ask Mr. Poliquin why we haven't  seen more lobsters from Maine. I am not sure why, but I yield to the  gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Chairman, I didn't say I wouldn't support  it. I just wanted to make sure I get my licks in for Alaska.   With that, Mr. Chairman, I do not object to the amendment and will  support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, even though  I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Keating for his  amendment. This is long overdue. Collecting those fees and using them  for observer coverage is something that should be done.   If I go back to his first amendment, I want to mechanize it and use  technology to make sure the fishermen have an opportunity to, I  believe, report better.  [[Page H6095]]    This is a good amendment. I will be voting for it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order.    I withdraw the reservation of a point of order.    I claim the time in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    The parliamentarian, I think, made a mistake,  but they have a right to do that, as others Members do, but that is the  way it goes.   Mr. Speaker, let's not kid ourselves. If you listen to the  presentation, it has nothing to do with a fish bill. This is a  procedural trick to delay passage of this bipartisan legislation. And I  keep saying this is a fish bill that has been in existence for many  years, since 1976, and it has been a success, and then we come up with  a recommit motion that has nothing to do with this bill.   The prize is fish communities, sustainable yields, domestic seafood  industry, and a job creation bill.   With all due respect, I strongly urge a rejection of the motion, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of the bill, H.R. 200, the  [[Page H6099]]  Clerk be authorized to make technical corrections and conforming  changes to the bill, including the change I have placed on the desk.
