 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for providing  consideration of my legislation today. I particularly want to share my  appreciation with committee Chair Takano and Ranking Member Bost on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee for moving quickly on this important issue  for the 18 million veterans in our country.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on a topic of vital importance  to my State where veterans comprise about 10 percent of the population,  and I know many veterans who face food insecurity.   This is my first bill as a Member of the U.S. House of  Representatives, which is appropriate. There is nothing more important  than ensuring our veterans and their families can enjoy a safe and  healthy life after their service for our country.   This bill would create an Office of Food Security within the  Department of Veterans Affairs. The office would be charged with  providing information to veterans on the availability and eligibility  requirements for Federal nutrition assistance programs. The office  would work with other government agencies to implement policies to help  veterans at risk or experiencing food insecurity.   A report just 4 months ago from the Center for Strategic and  International Studies was clear, ``Food insecurity among U.S. veterans  and military families is a national security concern: it multiplies  stress on Active Duty personnel, diminishes well-being among  servicemembers and their children--who are more likely to serve in the  military as adults--and may hinder recruitment for the armed  services.''   Madam Speaker, I know this bill will not solve the problem entirely,  but I believe it can help in Alaska and throughout the country. I ask  my colleagues to support H.R. 8888.
