 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a bipartisan proposal that finally  secures clear protections for pregnant workers.   In the year 2020, Federal protections for pregnant workers are stuck  in the 1950s.   Current law does not explicitly guarantee all pregnant workers the  right to reasonable accommodations so they can work without  jeopardizing their pregnancies. Reasonable accommodations like a glass  of water or a place to sit. These are sensible and, quite frankly,  simple requests.   I was pregnant with my twins and then again with my youngest daughter  when I served in the State legislature. While there were obstacles, I  could ask for accommodations and did so without fear, but it was still  a struggle to secure them, even for a State legislator.   Unfortunately, this is the case for many pregnant workers.   We know that COVID-19 has only exacerbated health inequalities for  women, especially women of color. In fact, the most common low-paid  jobs for women, like nurses and home health aides, are on the pandemic  front lines.   Pregnant women across this country are literally putting their lives  on the line. Yet, too often, instead of providing a pregnant worker  with an accommodation routinely given to other workers, her employer  will fire her, depriving her of a paycheck and health insurance at a  time when she needs them most.   Pregnant workers must never have to choose between maintaining a  healthy pregnancy and losing their jobs, especially now when both their  health and economic security are crucial.   The demand for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act even stretches  across religious, ideological and party lines.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter on behalf of faith- based organizations in support of this vital legislation.                                                September 11, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned religious       and faith-based organizations representing a diversity of       faith traditions and communities across the nation, we write       today in support of healthy workplace environments and       conditions for pregnant workers. We urge you to pass the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694). People of faith       across the ideological spectrum understand that prioritizing       the health and safety of pregnant workers should not be a       partisan issue. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would       ensure that pregnant workers can continue safely working to       support their families during a pregnancy. The bill requires       employers to make the same sort of accommodations for       pregnant workers as are already in place for workers with       disabilities.        Our faith traditions affirm the dignity of pregnant       individuals and the moral imperative of ensuring their       safety. We also affirm the dignity of work and the obligation       to treat workers justly. It is immoral for an employer to       force a worker to choose between a healthy pregnancy and       earning a living. By passing the bipartisan Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act (H.R. 2694), Congress will ensure that workers       who arc pregnant will be treated fairly in the workforce and       can continue earning income to support themselves and their       families. Efforts to distract from the central goal of       ensuring pregnant workers can maintain their health and the       health of their pregnancies by inserting unnecessary,       harmful, and politically divisive language into this bill       undermines our obligation to protect pregnant workers across       our country.        While many pregnant individuals continue working throughout       their pregnancies without incident, there are instances when       minor accommodations are necessary at the workplace to ensure       the safety of the expecting mother and the baby. All too       often, requests for simple workplace accommodations like a       stool to sit, a water bottle, or a bathroom break are denied.       Within the COVID-19 context, such critical accommodations       might include proper protective equipment, telework, or       staggered work schedules that offer employees commute times       which avoid crowded public transportation and increased       exposure. Currently, pregnant workers may continue to work       without necessary accommodations because they fear losing       their jobs and need the income, thus endangering their health       or the health of their pregnancy. Without these protections,       it is not uncommon for pregnant workers to be let go or       forced out onto unpaid leave for requesting accommodations.       Many others must quit their job to avoid risking the health       of their pregnancy.        Passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a moral and       economic imperative; two-thirds of women who had their first       child between 2006 and 2008 worked during pregnancy, and 88       percent of these first-time mothers worked into their last       trimester. Keeping these women healthy and in the workforce       is paramount to family economic security. Nearly 25 million       mothers with children under 18 are in the workforce, making       up nearly 1 in 6 of all workers. And about 3 in 4 mothers in       the workforce are working full time. Millions of families       rely on their earnings. In 2017, 41 percent of mothers were       the sole or primary breadwinners in their families, while       23.2 percent of mothers were co-breadwinners. Whole families       suffer when pregnant workers are forced out of a job.        The undersigned religious and faith-based groups are united       in support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. We strongly       urge you to vote for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and       to vote against any motion to recommit that may be offered.            Sincerely, the undersigned:        Ameinu, Arizona Jews for Justice, Aytzim: Ecological       Judaism, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, Catholic Labor Network,       Church World Service, Columban Center for Advocacy and       Outreach, Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good       Shepherd, U.S. Provinces, Faith Action Network, Faith Action       Network--Washington State, Franciscan Action Network, Friends       Committee on National Legislation, Keshet, Jewish Alliance       for Law and Social Action.

People of faith and across the ideological  spectrum recognize that prioritizing the health and safety of pregnant  workers should not be a partisan issue.   It is past time for workplaces to accommodate our families and  protect pregnant workers. They are the ones  [[Page H4520]]  who keep our economy and communities running.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this long overdue  legislation.
