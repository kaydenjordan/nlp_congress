 Mr. President, my State enjoys many legendary  sports rivalries. But make no mistake about it, the Class B Boys High  School Basketball Tournament played every March is, without question,  North Dakota's premier sporting event. This year, 108 teams began the  basketball season in 16 districts and 8 regions. The regional champions  met the third weekend of March to compete for the State title. Every  year, these games draw the attention of the entire State, along with  fans from across the Nation, all of whom claim a connection with at  least one of the competing teams.   This week, I stand a little taller as a proud 1979 graduate of  Kindred High School. The Kindred Vikings won their first-ever boys  basketball State championship title in Minot Saturday night, defeating  the Edgeley-Kulm-Montpelier Rebels 40-34. Their 21-4 season was capped  with impressive tournament matchups, where the Vikings showcased their  agility and skill against some of the best basketball players in the  State. In their semi-final victory against Four Winds-Minnewaukan,  Kindred's Matthew Pearson sunk six three-pointers to score 18 points,  as Paul Olson scored 15 points and Jaiden Peraza 10. In the  championship game, Paul Olson scored 23 points, making 8 of 15 shots  and 8 rebounds. Paul, Jaiden, and Gavin Keller were the Vikings named  to the all-tournament team.   I want to recognize this year's team members: Brock Woehl, Cole  Campbell, Ethan McKenney, Jeremiah Dockter, Matthew Pearson, Jorgen  Swensen, Elijah Heinrich, Paul Olson, Maxwell McQuillan, Trey Heinrich,  Jaiden Peraza, Chase Miller, Gavin Keller, Presley Peraza, and Riley  Sunram, along with manager Jack Davis and statisticians Rylie Ranking,  Leah Rolland, and Zoe Sharp.   As a Kindred High School student athlete who lettered 4 years in  football, basketball, and track, I realize my high school skills would  not qualify me to be the ball boy for this year's squad. I congratulate  the team, as well as Coach Brad Woehl, his assistants Scott Milbrandt,  Matt Hagen, and Jimmy Hoy, and the hometown fans on winning this  championship. I join the rest  [[Page S1704]]  of North Dakota in thanking the Kindred Vikings for being an  inspiration to all of us by demonstrating what can be achieved by  combining a passion for excellence with determination and  teamwork.                            ____________________
