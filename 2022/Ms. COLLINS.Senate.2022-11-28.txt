 Madam President, it is a great pleasure to join  people throughout the State of Maine in thanking Dana Connors for a  remarkable career of nearly six decades of devoted service and lasting  contributions in government and the private sector. In addition to  being an outstanding leader, Dana is a cherished friend to me and so  many others.   I first met Dana when I was working for Bill Cohen in Washington and  he was the city manager of Presque Isle, a position he held for 16  years. Both of us are natives of Aroostook County, so we have always  had that special county bond.   Years later, we served together in Governor John McKernan's cabinet,  where he was commissioner of transportation. Everyone who worked with  Dana during his 11 years in that challenging role was in awe of the  fact that Dana could go into any meeting, and no matter how unhappy the  people might be about the condition of a road or bridge in their  community, they inevitably came out smiling. He just had a knack, which  he still has, of always listening to people and making them feel  valued.   From there, Dana stepped forward to serve as president of the  chamber. Throughout his nearly 30 years of leadership, he has shown a  deep understanding of the role of businesses in our State, particularly  those that are owned by families. He is a staunch supporter of Maine's  traditional industries, including farming, fishing, and forestry, and a  champion of such emerging industries as advanced manufacturing and  biotechnology.   What motivates Dana are his love for our State, his belief in our  communities, and his deep affection for our hard-working, ingenious,  and determined people. He understands the importance of creating an  environment that is conducive to small businesses starting up, growing,  and expanding. Above all, Dana is passionate about ensuring that  Mainers have good jobs and are able to stay right here in Maine. There  is no better demonstration of this desire than his strong and effective  advocacy for vocational education, apprenticeships, and other programs  that provide Mainers with skills that are in demand by Maine employers.   I am especially grateful to Dana for the advice he provided during  the pandemic as I was drafting the Paycheck Protection Program. I knew  I could turn to him for guidance on how it should be crafted and what  would work best to help our small employers remain in business and  continue to pay their employees. Dana was truly an invaluable resource  during that crisis.   There is one special memory of Dana that I want to share. In 2016, he  brought together all five of Maine's living U.S. Senators--George  Mitchell, Bill Cohen, Olympia Snowe, Angus King, and me--for a forum  about public confidence in government and bipartisanship. It is a  testament to the enduring relationships Dana has forged and the respect  he has earned from members of both parties that he was able to convince  all five former and current Senators to come to the same event on the  same night.   There is another part to that story that says so much about Dana. At  the  [[Page S6821]]  time, my husband, Tom Daffron, was teaching a class at the University  of Maine. He told Dana that the Senators forum would be a wonderful  event for students to attend, but they could not afford to pay for the  dinner. Dana quickly devised a solution. He offered students the  opportunity to volunteer at the event, which would allow them to attend  for free. Those students were absolutely thrilled to see five Maine  Senators on the same stage discussing the issues of the day, all  because of Dana's generosity and his caring for the next generation.   Dana has made such a positive difference for Maine in all of the  positions he has held. His legacy is that Maine is an even better place  to live, raise a family, and start a business. He has done so much, and  I know that there is another chapter yet to come. In the meantime  however, I offer my very best wishes to Dana and his wife, Joyce, and  my deepest thanks.                            ____________________
