 Mr. President, this June marks 53 years since the attack  on the Stonewall Inn and 52 years since the first pride parade was held  in New York City. The Stonewall riots are widely recognized as the  catalyst for the resurgence of the fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, queer, and intersex--LGBTQI+--rights, and they were the  first in a series of landmark events that would define the LGBTQ  experience of the late 20th century.   From the UpStairs Lounge arson attack to the devastating AIDS crisis,  the community persevered through many harrowing ordeals. During this  month, we recognize not only the struggles of the LGBTQ community but  the triumphs, both big and small.   Not nearly as well known, the UpStairs Lounge arson attack took place  nearly 4 years after the Stonewall riots, on June 24, 1973. Patrons of  the New Orleans bar, which primarily served as a safe meeting space for  blue-collar gay men, noticed a fire in the front stairwell just before  8 p.m. The fire spread rapidly, forcing patrons to flee to the rooftop  and out the barred windows to escape. Unfortunately, this was not  enough. Twenty-eight people lost their lives in the blaze, and four  more succumbed to their injuries in the following days. This horrendous  act would go on to become the deadliest attack on the LGBTQ community  until the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, which claimed the lives of  49 individuals. Both of these attacks took place during Pride Month, a  month that celebrates love, acceptance, and community.    The celebration of Pride Month also allows members of the LGBTQ  community to reassert their rights to openly be their true selves and  say: ``We are here. We are not going away.'' This message is especially  important now, as the Supreme Court prepares to vote on potentially  overriding Roe v. Wade, the decision that protects an individual's  right to privacy and control over their own bodies. Justice Samuel  Alito's reasoning in this argument, though not final, threatens an  entire line of rights that the Court has inferred from the text of the  Constitution over decades, including foundational protections for the  LGBTQ people such as marriage equality, established in the 2015  Obergefell v. Hodges decision.   I am an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, S. 393, which would  safeguard and protect equal rights for the LGBTQ individuals in areas  including public accommodations and facilities, education, Federal  funding, employment, housing, credit, and the jury system. I am also  the lead sponsor of the resolution to eliminate the deadline for the  ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would strengthen the  constitutional foundation for pro-LGBTQ legislation like the Equality  Act.   I strongly oppose action by the Supreme Court to take away the rights  of Americans by overturning Roe or Obergefell or other cases like  Griswold v. Connecticut, which guarantees the rights of families to  have access to contraception and family planning.   While I am proud that Maryland has, at the State level, protections  in place to preserve the sanctity of same-sex marriage should these  rights come under threat at a Federal level, such fundamental rights  must be respected at the national level. As many have pointed out,  Supreme Court decisions to overturn precedent have historically  expanded individual rights, not taken them away.   LGBTQ Pride Month is an integral part of our community here in  Maryland. Parades and celebrations are taking place all across the  State, from Salisbury to Cumberland. As an ally, I am committed to  uplifting and supporting the LGBTQ voices. In particular, we must make  a special effort to protect transgender children and their parents and  safeguard their access to healthcare and social services during these  challenging times.   As extremism grows louder in many States, we must stand united and  firm in the face of injustice and continue to proclaim that love has  been and always will be love.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today to speak about S. Res. 124  that Senator Wicker and I introduced last year celebrating the heritage  of Romani Americans. I applaud the passage of this resolution which was  voted on favorably in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today and  will now be moved to the Senate floor for consideration.   This resolution is significant as it expresses remembrance for the  genocide of the Roma by the Nazis, commends the work of the U.S.  Holocaust Memorial Museum in promoting this remembrance and awareness,  and further expresses support for the annual International Roma Day to  honor the history, culture, and heritage of the Romani people in the  United States. Roma have been part of every single wave of European  migration to the United States from the Colonial period to today, and  there are now an estimated 1 million Americans who have some Romani  ancestry. S. Res. 124 is the first resolution considered in Congress to  acknowledge Romani Americans and to celebrate their heritage and  history. Its passage will be a milestone for this community.   When Senator Wicker and I introduced S. Res. 124, we observed that  Romani people enrich the fabric of our Nation and strengthen the  transatlantic bond. The resolution mentions two dates of particular  importance on both sides of the Atlantic. First, April 8 was the date  of the first World Romani Congress, held near London. That date is  therefore celebrated as the moment when transatlantic efforts to  improve the situation of the Roma entered a new, more visible and more  productive stage.   But more than that, it has become time for policymakers to focus on  continued efforts to improve the situation of Roma. Ugly discrimination  against the Roma persists and needs to be addressed. The European  Parliament, for example, dedicates a week in April to review and  advance Romani inclusion initiatives. Governments across Europe and the  OSCE also use this as a time to focus on policy and the future. This  resolution welcomes and encourages the Department of State's  participation in such events and activities.   The second date specifically mentioned in the resolution is the night  of August 2-3, 1944, when the Romani camp at Auschwitz was liquidated  and more than 4,200 Romani men, women, and children were killed in a  single night.   This day has been formally recognized as a day of commemoration by  [[Page S2889]]  the European Union, Poland, and other countries. Based on my work over  many years in the Helsinki Commission, I know that the current  situation of Roma in Europe today simply cannot be understood without  learning about the genocide of Roma during World War II and the  enduring legacy of that tragedy.   I believe more should be done to teach about Romani experiences  during the Holocaust, and we welcome the U.S. Holocaust Memorial  Museum's support for scholarship in this area. This resolution commends  the Museum for its work in promoting remembrance of the Holocaust and  educating successor generations about the genocide of Roma.   The museum welcomed the introduction of this resolution last year,  observing, ``House and Senate passage will help raise awareness about  the history of the Romani people, the richness of Romani culture, and  to unequivocally reject the dehumanization of Roma and any violence  directed against their communities.'' I look forward to the opportunity  for this resolution to be adopted by the Senate. I ask unanimous  consent that the text of S. Res. 124 be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                S. Res. 124         Whereas the Romani people trace their ancestry to the       Indian subcontinent;        Whereas Roma have been a part of European immigration to       the United States since the colonial period and particularly       following the abolition of the enslavement of Roma in the       historic Romanian principalities;        Whereas Roma live across the world and throughout the       United States;        Whereas the Romani people have made distinct and important       contributions in many fields, including agriculture, art,       crafts, literature, medicine, military service, music,       sports, and science;        Whereas, on April 8, 1971, the First World Romani Congress       met in London, bringing Roma together from across Europe and       the United States with the goal of promoting transnational       cooperation among Roma in combating social marginalization       and building a positive future for Roma everywhere;        Whereas April 8 is therefore celebrated globally as       International Roma Day;        Whereas Roma were victims of genocide carried out by Nazi       Germany and its Axis partners, and an estimated 200,000 to       500,000 Romani people were killed by Nazis and their allies       across Europe during World War II;        Whereas, on the night of August 2-3, 1944, the so-called       ``Gypsy Family Camp'' where Romani people were interned at       Auschwitz-Birkenau was liquidated, and in a single night,       between 4,200 and 4,300 Romani men, women, and children were       killed in gas chambers;        Whereas many countries are taking positive steps to       remember and teach about the genocide of Roma by Nazi Germany       and its Axis partners; and        Whereas the United States Congress held its first hearing       to examine the situation of Roma in 1994: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the Senate--        (1) remembers the genocide of Roma by Nazi Germany and its       Axis partners and commemorates the destruction of the ``Gypsy       Family Camp'' where Romani people were interned at Auschwitz;        (2) commends the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum       for its role in promoting remembrance of the Holocaust and       educating about the genocide of Roma;        (3) supports International Roma Day as an opportunity to       honor the culture, history, and heritage of the Romani people       in the United States as part of the larger Romani global       diaspora; and        (4) welcomes the Department of State's participation in       ceremonies and events celebrating International Roma Day and       similar engagement by the United States Government.                            ____________________
