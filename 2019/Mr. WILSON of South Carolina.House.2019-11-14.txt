 Mr. Speaker, after over a month of  secret investigations against the President, Democrats have now decided  to open these controlled hearings to the public.   This continued deception by Democrats to mislead the American people  is insulting. No Republican witnesses, no counsel of the President to  participate, and full exoneration by the courageous President Zelensky  of Ukraine.   It is said that, instead of focusing on funding our military through  the National Defense Authorization Act or passing the United-States- Mexico-Canada Agreement to create jobs, which improves our schools,  like Lexington District 1, Democrats continue.   They have wasted $30 million of taxpayer money on the Russian hoax  and are now proceeding with the Ukrainian hoax. This partisan witch  hunt diverts attention from the President's successes.   The unemployment rate is at a record low; there is record job  creation; and the stock market is thriving, showing President Trump  keeps his promises.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Thank you, President Lech Walesa of Poland, a world hero, for  testifying yesterday for freedom.                            ____________________
