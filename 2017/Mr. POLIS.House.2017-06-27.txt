 Mr. Speaker, this week, Senate Republicans are very likely  to vote on a bill that would take away health insurance from 22 million  Americans, people like Marcia and Grace Kohler in Boulder, Colorado.  The Kohlers, like many other families, were able to have access to  healthcare through the Affordable Care Act.   At the age of 8\1/2\, Marcia's youngest daughter, Grace, was  diagnosed with childhood leukemia. She endured 26 months of extensive  treatments and several chemotherapy sessions per week. In Marcia's own  words: ``Going through this process without the assistance of  healthcare is unimaginable. It brings tears back to my own eyes.''   We are simply not a nation that turns its back on our most vulnerable  citizens. 39 percent of all children in this country are supported on  Medicaid, 64 percent of nursing home residents, and 30 percent of  adults with disabilities.   I hope my colleagues in the Senate right now think of Grace and all  those like her. I hope that they think about the millions of Americans  that will have the rug pulled out from underneath them if they pass  their cruel bill. For some it is a matter of debt or taxes, but for  many it is simply a matter of life or death.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today, one that  provides for consideration of the Protecting Access to Care Act. This  bill would significantly alter how families and patients that are  injured as a result of medical error are able to hold healthcare  providers, facilities, or device makers accountable to make sure that  that same thing doesn't happen to other people.   This bill decreases patient safety. It undermines the ability of  people who are wrongfully injured by medical malpractice or faulty  medical devices to be compensated for their injuries, and it violates  the 10th Amendment to our Constitution, the rights reserved to the  States.   Before I turn to the merits, or lack thereof, of this bill, I want to  discuss the process under which this bill came to the floor.   The Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over this bill, had  zero hearings on this legislation, heard from zero experts, and went  straight to markup. Despite the overwhelming opposition to this  legislation, the Judiciary Committee did not want to hear from groups  like the American Bar Association, Patient Safety America, the National  Disability Rights Network, or the National Protection Alliance.   When I see the American Bar Association, who the committee refused to  hear from--I know my colleague from Colorado is an attorney. I just  want to inquire of my colleague from Colorado if he is a member of the  American Bar Association, and I yield to the gentleman.    Okay. Well, that is the association which many attorneys,  excepting, of course, my friend from Colorado, are a member of.   The supporters of this bill point to its consideration in previous  Congresses for hearings, but we have over 50 new Members who didn't  hear a word about this bill from any experts before it was rushed to  the floor.   We are considering this bill under a very restrictive rule. That  means there were 24 amendments filed. This rule only allows the House  to debate and vote on five of them. That means 19 of them, amendments  offered by Democrats and Republicans, were simply just tossed out in  the Rules Committee. That is what this rule does.   If this rule were to pass, it would mean that the efforts of 19  Members to offer ideas to improve healthcare wouldn't even be allowed  to be debated or voted upon here on the floor of this House. It is no  coincidence that eight amendments filed by Democrats, and not one  Democratic amendment was made in order. Only 5 out of 24 ideas from  Democrats and Republicans were made in order.   One amendment filed by my colleague, Representative Jackson Lee,  would have provided an exception to the bill for any medical-related  injury to a child, which seems like common sense. At least have a  debate about it. If people disagree, let them disagree. Let's have a  vote.   This rule continues this very closed process, where Democrats and  Republicans are shut out of participating in the bills that appear  fully formed without the opportunity for us to represent our districts  and offer amendments to improve and make these bills better, to reduce  costs, to improve the quality of care.   What I wonder, Mr. Speaker, is: Where is the open process promised by  Speaker Ryan? This Congress hasn't even considered a single piece of  legislation under an open rule, and we have had many, many bills  brought to the floor under closed rules and without any committee  hearings. But, you know, I am beginning to not be surprised so much  anymore because secretiveness seems to be the standard that Republicans  are setting in this Congress.   How the Republicans have handled their healthcare bill from start  through now is a perfect example of the closed-door, secretive process  that has become, tragically, the standard operating procedure for this  Congress.   The Republican healthcare bill will increase healthcare costs,  provide less coverage--22 million fewer people will be covered-- increase costs for those who are lucky enough to keep their current  coverage, and reduce access to healthcare for the American people.  It puts a burden on small businesses, on the middle class, on rural  healthcare providers, while handing hundreds of billions of dollars in  tax breaks to big corporations and special interests.    TrumpCare is a billionaire's tax cut disguised as a healthcare bill,  and it will be one of the largest transfers of wealth from the middle  class and the working families to the top 1 percent of Americans.  Effectively, it is removing benefits from people in rural counties and  cities across our country and giving those tax cuts mostly to people in  New York and Hollywood. That is what Republicans are delivering with  this bill.   When the American people were finally given the chance to see the  Senate's healthcare legislation, the American people overwhelmingly  rejected it. Only 16 percent of the American people approve of the  plan. Democrats oppose it; Republicans oppose it; independents oppose  it.   The Congressional Budget Office's recent score of the bill says that  coverage will significantly decrease under this bill and that the costs  of deductibles for patients will go up. Patients will have to spend  more out of pocket, those that are lucky enough to even have insurance  after this cruel bill.   But there is still time to stop it, and I call upon my colleagues to  prevent this bill from moving forward.   The bill that Republicans are trying to ram through Congress is not  truly meant to make improvements to our healthcare system but to take  money away from the middle class and working families and put it into  the pockets of a very few people who benefit from the tax cuts under  this bill: for people making millions of dollars a year.   This bill makes it harder for middle-income families and for low- income families to access quality, affordable healthcare, makes it  harder for individuals who have preexisting conditions or have genetic  disorders or long-term diseases from accessing lifesaving medical  attention, and cuts critical healthcare services for disabled children  in schools that many of our school districts rely on. And they want to  do this all with a closed process.   I offered three amendments to improve healthcare in our Education and  the Workforce Committee. All were defeated on a partisan vote.                                time  1245    Every Republican voted not to allow those. No Democrat, as far as I  know--certainly not me--has been invited to present our ideas to  Republican leadership or President Trump.   Democrats have lots of ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act. I am  sure many Republicans do, too. Those ideas are not reflected whatsoever  in this bill or in the closed process that prohibits Republicans and  Democrats from even offering our suggestions to improve this bill.   So, here we are, debating another piece of healthcare legislation  that did not go through an open process. Democrats were shut out of the  amendment process completely.   This bill would make it more difficult for victims of medical  malpractice to seek or receive compensation for their injuries. It is  inconsistent with the 10th Amendment, which reserves these rights to  the States that are not enumerated in the  [[Page H5195]]  Constitution, and unlike the Democrats' approach to medical malpractice  reform in the Affordable Care Act, which provided funding for pilot  programs in the States to reduce the risk of medical malpractice  liability consistent with the 10th Amendment. Many constitutional  experts--I would add, many conservative constitutional experts--believe  that this approach is unconstitutional because of the 10th Amendment.   We have learned that this bill does not actually protect access to  healthcare but, instead, undermines a State-based tort system, making  it more difficult for patients to be compensated from bad actors.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by over 60  national and State organizations opposed to H.R. 1215.                                                     June 12, 2017.      Re Groups Urge You to Vote NO on H.R. 1215.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned       consumer, health, labor, legal and public interest groups       strongly oppose H.R. 1215: The ``Protecting Access to Care       Act of 2017.'' This bill would limit the legal rights of       injured patients and families of those killed by negligent       health care. The bill's sweeping scope covers not only cases       involving medical malpractice, but also cases involving       unsafe drugs and nursing home abuse and neglect.        Even if H.R. 1215 applied only to doctors and hospitals,       recent studies clearly establish that its provisions would       lead to more deaths and injuries, and increased health care       costs due to a ``broad relaxation of care.'' Add to this       nursing home and pharmaceutical industry liability       limitations, significantly weakening incentives for these       industries to act safely, and untold numbers of additional       death, injuries and costs are inevitable, and unacceptable.        The latest statistics show that medical errors, most of       which are preventable, are the third leading cause of death       in America. This intolerable situation is perhaps all the       more shocking because we already know about how to fix much       of this problem. Congress should focus on improving patient       safety and reducing deaths and injuries, not insulating       negligent providers from accountability, harming patients and       saddling taxpayers with the cost, as H.R. 1215 would do.        For example, this bill would establish a permanent across-      the-board $250,000 ``cap'' on compensation for ``non-economic       damages'' in medical malpractice cases. Such caps are unfair       and discriminatory. For example, University of Buffalo Law       Professor Lucinda Finley has written, ``certain injuries that       happen primarily to women are compensated predominantly or       almost exclusively through noneconomic loss damages. These       injuries include sexual or reproductive harm, pregnancy loss,       and sexual assault injuries.'' Also, ``[J]uries consistently       award women more in noneconomic loss damages than men . . .       [A]ny cap on noneconomic loss damages will deprive women of a       much greater proportion and amount of a jury award than men.       Noneconomic loss damage caps therefore amount to a form of       discrimination against women and contribute to unequal access       to justice or fair compensation for women.''        Other provisions in H.R. 1215 are just as problematic. The       proposed federal statute of limitations, more restrictive       than a majority of state laws, lacks complete logic from a       deficit reduction angle since its only impact would be to cut       off meritorious claims, forcing patients to turn to the       government for care. The bill would repeal joint and several       liability even though the Congressional Budget Office says       this could increase, not lower, costs.        H.R. 1215 would overturn traditional state common law and       would be an unprecedented interference with the work of state       court judges and juries in civil cases. Its one-way       preemption of state law provisions that protect patients       (there are some exceptions) makes clear that the intent of       this legislation is not to make laws uniform in the 50       states. Rather, it is a carefully crafted bill to provide       relief and protections for the insurance, medical and drug       industries, at the expense of patient safety. We urge you to       oppose H.R. 1215: The ``Protecting Access to Care Act of       2017.'' Thank you.

I hope my friend from Colorado is a member of at least two or three  of these wonderful organizations. I will furnish the entire list to  him.   This bill preempts State tort law that has been developed over the  last 200 years and is contrary to the 10th Amendment of our  Constitution. It imposes an arbitrary cap on the amount of noneconomic  damages a victim can collect under a Federal law coopting the ability  of States to do their own medical malpractice laws and hamstringing  them with regard to the reforms that they can undertake.   In fact, capping damages also increases taxpayer spending. According  to a joint study by Northwestern University and the University of  Illinois, they found that capping economic damages actually increases  Medicare part B spending.   I would point out another horrible feature of the cruel Republican  healthcare bill is that it guts the Medicare trust fund and would lead  to Medicare becoming insolvent sooner rather than later by draining the  Medicare trust fund of over $100 billion. That is another aspect of  this bill.   No wonder they didn't want us to see it, Mr. Speaker. No wonder they  kept it in a locked closet from even Republicans who were allegedly  writing it, like Ken Buck and my friend, Senator Gardner, who was on  the committee writing it and who later said he hadn't seen it. No  wonder it was hidden, when you find out it actually leads to Medicare  insolvency sooner, when you find that it throws 22 million people off  the insurance that they already have, when you find out it raises rates  for those who are lucky enough to maintain their insurance, when you  find it takes money out of our schools, when you find that it risks  throwing our elderly out of their nursing homes who rely on Medicaid.   This bill is a symptom of a problem. I am not a doctor; my friend  from Colorado is not a doctor; but when I ask my doctor what you do  when there are  [[Page H5196]]  symptoms, it is treat the underlying cause.   Let's do that. This bill doesn't do that. This Republican Senate bill  that throws people off insurance doesn't do that. Let's begin a process  where we get ideas from Democrats and Republicans to work together to  reduce costs in healthcare, to expand coverage in healthcare, and to  improve the quality of healthcare for American families.   This bill is not focused on protecting patients. It increases the  risk to patients. It drains Medicare of additional money. This bill  will not reduce costs to patients. In fact, no healthcare bill being  debated in Congress right now actually improves patient care or reduces  costs to patients.   Those should be two pillars, two goals of healthcare reform: Can we  reduce costs, and can we improve patient care?   This bill risks making patient care worse in an unconstitutional way.  The Senate bill actually will increase costs to patients, increase  deductibles, make more people lose their insurance, make you pay more  for insurance you already have if you are one of the people who is  lucky enough not to lose it under the cruel Republican bill.   Instead of politicizing and polarizing access to healthcare-- literally a life-and-death issue for American families--let's work  together to find solutions that reduce costs, increase coverage, and  improve care. The Senate Republican healthcare bill meets none of those  three critical criteria that the American people demand in healthcare  reform: reducing costs, increasing coverage, and improving the quality  of care for ourselves and for our loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Prosecutors are lawyers as well. So I just wanted to be  clear that it is not an insult. Being an attorney is a fine profession.  There are some attorneys on both sides, both defending as well  prosecuting criminals, but they are both attorneys. I just wanted to  clarify that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. McEachin).   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I think a couple of points, before I get to the main  portion of my remarks, that the manager of the bill threw out need to  be addressed.   First of all, my wife is a prosecutor. I like prosecutors, but they  are lawyers. I was a trial lawyer until December 31 of last year. Guess  what? We sue drunk drivers. We sue for people who get hurt when it is  not their own fault. I come from a State where contributory negligence  is the law. So I appreciate the reverence you hold prosecutors in--I  do, as well--but we are all lawyers.   I also want to point out that, while there may be people on the floor  who are not lawyers, you can't honestly believe this bill gives you  equal access to justice, and here is why: You have a cap on noneconomic  damages. So a person who is injured by a doctor and a person who  receives the exact same injuries from some other tort have two  different recoveries that they can reach. One is capped; one is not.  That is not equal justice, in my judgment, under the law.   In addition, you all are the pro-business party, yet you all want to  get into how people contract with one another. I would suggest that is  inconsistent with your pro-business approach.   Mr. Speaker, what this bill really underlies is a fundamental  mistrust for our constituents. Think about it. Juries are made up of  our constituents. What you are really worried about is that your  constituents are not going to get it right when they are sitting in  that jury box and making decisions.   Your constituents are wise enough to send me and 435 of us here to  the Congress to make decisions about trillion-dollar budgets, yet you  don't trust them to sit in the jury box and make the very important  decisions for their fellow citizens when they are injured.   Mr. Speaker, I want to suggest that this bill clearly violates the  spirit of the Seventh Amendment, the right to trial by jury, by putting  these limitations on the jury, by putting limitations on access to  justice.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is reminded that Members are  to direct all remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I was glad my colleague pointed out that it violates the Seventh  Amendment. Now we add that to the 10th  [[Page H5197]]  Amendment. So there are actually two Amendments. I am not even an  attorney, but I know this violates two Amendments to our Constitution.  That is pretty impressive for one bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to inquire of my friend from Colorado whether  recognizing those savings is in fact a Federal responsibility or a  State responsibility.   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, exactly. What I would further add, then, is  whose prerogative is it to institute this kind of cap: States like our  own State of Colorado, which has that cap? Or Washington, D.C. insiders  behind closed doors?   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, this effectively co-ops  States and forces other States to do the same thing that my colleague's  and my State of Colorado has already done. It goes beyond that as well.  Under the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, this should be a power  reserved for the States.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to shed light on a serious issue facing  millions of students nationally and in my home State of Colorado. Every  day, 50 million students and 3 million teachers face significant health  and safety threats due to inadequate school facilities. I have heard  about many in Colorado, school gyms that are closed down because their  roofs are falling in, staggering statistics that disproportionately  affect high-poverty schools, particularly urban and rural schools, and  many schools serving a high percentage of minority students.   Today we have a chance to address this rampant inequality throughout  our school districts and to create jobs in the process.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up Representative Bobby Scott's Rebuild America's Schools  Act, H.R. 2475, which I am also a proud co-sponsor of. Mr. Scott's  legislation would invest $100 billion in the physical and digital  infrastructure needs of our schools, creating nearly 2 million jobs and  creating the education infrastructure we need for the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Donovan). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the Education  and the Workforce Committee, to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to supply those. To be clear,  the entire school doesn't close, just the gym closes.    Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to supply those. To be clear,  the entire school doesn't close, just the gym closes.    Mr. Speaker, I do have further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Kihuen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, when we think about healthcare, we all think about, of  course, first and foremost, ourselves and our loved ones and our  families. As Representatives of 750,000 people, we also think about  constituents that we know, that we have met, for whom healthcare is  literally a life-and-death situation.   I think of my friend Debbie and her son Sam. Debbie's son Sam was  diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 4 years old. He is now 20 or  21 or so. He was a healthy kid, he ate healthy food, an active young  child. As Debbie pointed out to me, it is not that anybody chooses an  illness or a condition, the illness chooses you. Through the luck of  the draw, her son Sam is afflicted with type 1 diabetes. Like many  people with autoimmune diseases, it was not poor choices, it was not  lifestyle decisions that gave him the disease or even increased his  risk of the disease. He was dealt a bad hand with an autoimmune gene  that his family didn't even know that they had.   Because of that, Sam has a costly disease. Thankfully, one that can  be treated, if not cured, but he has a costly disease for the rest of  his life. There is no cure, and the cost of insulin and other  lifesaving technologies is very high.   Sam has what here in Washington people call a preexisting condition.  That is what we are talking about. Without insurance, the cost per  month would go from about $400, which Debbie and her husband are able  to afford and put together for Sam, to $2,500 a month, which they could  not possibly afford to do.   Sam is now 20, and because of the Affordable Care Act, he will be on  the family's health insurance until he is 26. That is, if the family  can keep their health insurance. The family worries, like so many  others, that they might be one of those 22 million families that loses  coverage under this Republican healthcare bill. It is a lot of  families.   It is not going to be any of my colleagues' families. My colleagues  have a government health insurance plan from serving in the House of  Representatives. Their congressional staff has access to the exchanges,  just like we do, to buy insurance. But 22 million people in each and  every one of our districts, 435 districts in this country, in each and  every one of our districts, not dozens of people, not hundreds of  people, but thousands of real people like Deb and Sam, like a story I  shared earlier of Marcia and Grace, will actually lose their  healthcare. They will be forced to give up their home, become  insolvent, go bankrupt, or die. A choice that no American should have  to face.    Mr. Speaker, the bill under consideration today is one of many that  didn't go through regular order. There were no hearings. Closed  process. They cut out all the Democratic amendments that we had to  improve the bill. That is how the Republicans have been handling  healthcare legislation this Congress. That is why this approach isn't  working. It is why this approach is so unpopular. No hearings, shut  Members out of the legislative process, bring a bill to the floor that  was hidden in some closet, written in secret, widely unpopular,  throwing people off healthcare insurance, raising rates for those who  are luckily enough to keep their insurance.   This bill is not aimed at protecting patients. This bill before us  and the Senate Republican healthcare bill make it more difficult for  Americans to deal with real-life healthcare issues that were dealt over  the course of life for ourselves and our families.   We need a reset, Mr. Speaker. We need to reset and start real  discussions about improving healthcare.   How could Democrats or Republicans work together to reduce costs?   Democrats and Republicans should work together to expand coverage. We  shouldn't be talking about whether 22 million people lose coverage or  10 million people lose coverage or 5 million people lose coverage.  Let's talk about 5 million people gaining coverage, 10 million people  gaining coverage. Let's reset and frame the discussion about how more  people can have access to healthcare.   The problem we are trying to solve is not how can we get less  Americans to have access to healthcare. That is why this bill is so  unpopular. If that is the problem Republicans are trying to solve, they  solved it in this bill. Less Americans will have healthcare. But that  is not the problem that the American people want us to address in  Congress.   More people with healthcare, and people want to save money. They want  their insurance rates to be lower, their deductibles to be lower. They  want to save money. There are some low-hanging fruit in terms of costs  in healthcare, administrative overhead, wasteful and duplicative  spending, that we can go after together. These are good ideas, whether  you are a Democrat or a Republican.   One of the amendments that I proposed was pricing transparency. One  of the problems in the healthcare marketplace is nobody knows how much  anybody charges. Different insurers and private payers pay widely  different amounts for the exact same procedure. Let's at least disclose  the pricing and have transparency so market mechanisms will work to  pull down rates by promoting competition.                                time  1315    By not allowing the market into healthcare, we are creating  inefficiencies and raising rates. Let's come together on that. Let's  come together around a lot of good ideas that Democrats and Republicans  have bills on and have amendments on. But, no, they are not even  allowed to be debated and not even allowed to be voted on either on  [[Page H5199]]  this bill, in which every Democratic amendment was shut down, or in the  Republican healthcare bill, in which no process was allowed for  Democrats to improve the bill.   We have never even been invited into the secret backroom to figure  out what was being debated. We didn't even see the bill until it was  presented fully formed days before it had to be voted on, affecting the  lives of 22 million Americans, one-eighth of our entire economy,  without any hearings, without any expert testimony, and only days to  digest this hundred-page bill.   So look, let's reset, let's work together to bring down costs,  expanding coverage and improving quality, and create a work product in  healthcare reform that we can be proud of as Republicans, as Democrats,  and as Americans; one in which Debbie and her son, Sam, don't have to  worry about giving up their home or facing death; or one in which Grace  and her mother are able to live out their lives without worrying about  their preexisting condition.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to reject this closed rule,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be  followed by 5-minute votes on:   Adopting the resolution, if ordered; and   Agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 234,  nays 184, not voting 15, as follows:                               [Roll No. 325]                                 YEAS--234       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
