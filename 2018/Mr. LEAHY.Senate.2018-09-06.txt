 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in the last few months, the Senate has  achieved record progress in going through our appropriations bills. As  we return from the Labor Day weekend, the Senate has already passed 9  of the 12 Appropriations bills by overwhelming bipartisan margins. The  Appropriations Committee has reported the remaining three bills, again,  with bipartisan support. The end of the fiscal year is only a few short  weeks away, but looking at the record pace of our work here in the  Senate, there is no reason we can't conference all of these bills with  the House and send all nine to the President's desk before October 1.   It would be quite an accomplishment. It would show the American  people that when it matters, Congress can come together and do the job  we were sent here to do. That includes passing responsible, thoughtful,  and well-considered appropriations bills on time and on budget.   When I became vice chairman of Appropriations, with Senator Shelby as  chairman of Appropriations, we pledged to each other and the Senate  that we would move these bills in a way they had not been moved in  years and that we would do it in a bipartisan way.   It is important that we conference all of the bills we have passed in  the Senate so far and then send them to the President's desk. We cannot  just pick and choose and say: We will do this one based on political  expediency but not this one. That would put us right back in the trap  in which we had been in past years. We have to show the American people  that the Senate actually knows how to do its work. The hard work has  been done. We know the issues we need to resolve, so now we ought to  take these bills across the finish line.   It may sound archaic, but let me talk about minibus No. 1, which  contains the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill, the  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies  appropriations bill, and the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. It  provides much needed resources for the support and care of our Nation's  veterans and their family members, and it makes critical investments in  our country's water infrastructure and energy programs. Yesterday, we  held a public conference with the House of Representatives on the first  minibus, and I am pleased to report that we have made some significant  progress.   One of the reasons we are successful in moving bills in the Senate is  that we advance appropriations bills that are free of poison pill  policy riders from either the left or the right. In fact, my experience  and the experience of many others tell us that is the only path to  success in the Senate, where we rightfully need 60 votes to advance  legislation, and it is the only path to success for conferencing the  three minibus bills. I challenge the House Republicans to come to terms  with that reality. No one should mistake--and I want to emphasize  this--Democratic cooperation in the Senate for a sign that we will  support a conference report that contains poison pills. We will not.   Minibus No. 2 contains four appropriations bills--the Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill; the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill; the Financial Services and General Government  appropriations bill; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development appropriations bill. The House plans to appoint conferees  to this minibus later this afternoon, and I encourage the Senate to  follow soon thereafter. Let me take these one by one.   The Agriculture appropriations bill is a win for farmers, families,  and rural communities. Every State in this Nation has rural  communities--the Presiding Officer does; I do; every State does--and  farm economies that benefit from these important programs. From clean  water programs to investments in rural broadband and from rural housing  assistance to agricultural research, this bill touches millions of  Americans all across the country. In the wake of the uncertainty and  chaos that has been caused by trade wars and unnecessary tariffs, our  farmers and rural communities deserve better than inaction on  appropriations. Both the House and the Senate have passed their  versions of the bill. So let's just get to work and send the conference  bill to the President.   The same goes for the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development  appropriations bill, which makes critical infrastructure investments  across the Nation, and we desperately need them. Improving the Nation's  infrastructure was one of President Trump's key campaign promises, but  instead of proposing realistic solutions, he has criticized the very  budget deal that has made increases in infrastructure possible. Instead  of improving our infrastructure, he has proposed cutting--not  increasing--funding in his budget for infrastructure programs. Here we  have an opportunity to invest in our country and to start addressing  our crumbling bridges and roads. We cannot and should not kick the can  down the road. There is not a single Senator here who cannot point to  the needs of the bridges and roads in his or her State.   Then we have the Interior bill that makes critical investments in  programs that help to ensure we have clean water to drink and clean air  to breathe and that funds our national parks and other public lands.  The Financial Services bill funds regulatory agencies that U.S.  citizens rely on to protect them from unfair, unsafe, or fraudulent  business practices, like the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the  Federal Trade Commission.   Congress now stands poised to deliver to the American people, but we  have to get moving. Leaving these important agencies to limp along in a  continuing resolution is unwise and unnecessary. We have laid the  groundwork to finish these bills. Now we just need the will to do it.  [[Page S6046]]    This brings me to minibus No. 3, which contains the Defense  appropriations bill and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and  Education appropriations bill. It funds our national security and many  of our domestic priorities, and it demonstrates the importance of the  bipartisan budget agreement that was reached earlier this year. In this  combination of bills, we see the priorities that are outlined in that  agreement made into real policy to improve the lives of the American  people. It is not empty rhetoric but real policy, and that is why so  many Republicans and so many Democrats voted for it.   As a result of the bipartisan budget deal, the Senate's Defense  appropriations bill provides the men and women of our Armed Forces with  the resources they need to carry out their missions effectively and  safely. This is a goal that Republicans and Democrats share as  Americans, and I know that in working with our House counterparts, we  can produce a good bill for our troops and our Nation.   Then there is the Senate's Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations  bill. I think of the way Senator Patty Murray has worked so hard with  Republicans and Democrats--with all of us--to put together a bill that  reflects the interests of all of the country.   Look at the investments in healthcare and education. It increases  funding for the National Institutes of Health by $5 billion over fiscal  year 2017. The NIH, the National Institutes of Health, is one of the  treasures of America. It backs our commitment to increase access to  higher education by increasing college affordability spending by $2.3  billion over fiscal year 2017. My family came to Vermont in the mid- 1800s. I was the first Leahy to get a college degree--my sister, the  second. Then, when our children came along and our grandchildren, we  never doubted it; of course, they would go to college. Yet that is not  the same for an awful lot of people in this country, so we need this  bill. It also increases access to childcare by $3.2 billion over fiscal  year 2017, and it invests nearly $3 billion to combat the opioid crisis  that has plagued communities across this country.   The House did not follow the Senate's bipartisan efforts. The House  produced a partisan Labor-HHS bill that shortchanged programs for  working Americans and was loaded with poison pill riders that could  never pass in this body--from attacks on the Affordable Care Act to  restrictions on family planning.    My staff and Senator Shelby's staff--several of us--have been working  days and weeks and weekends, and we will continue to do that in order  to work out these differences. The differences are challenging but are  not insurmountable. The reason we have to have a compromise is we have  to get 60 votes in the Senate, and with this hodgepodge of poison pills  that the House has passed there are not 60 votes.   I have said many times that if we are to have a strong national  defense, we need to have a strong economy, an educated and healthy  citizenry, and an able workforce. The programs that are funded in the  Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill are critical to doing  that. The deep ties that run between defense and nondefense priorities  make it fitting that we have packaged these two bills together, but  they have to stay together if we are going to get them across the  finish line by October 1. If they are decoupled, it will destroy the  bipartisan process we have worked so hard to establish, and it will not  go through. It is possible that the CR will be included in this bill,  so it is essential that it be bipartisan and free of any controversial  matter.   Again, the reason we have been so successful in this Senate in moving  appropriations bills is that we have worked together. Chairman Shelby  as chairman and I as vice chairman have worked together. Republicans  and Democrats alike who are on the Appropriations Committee have worked  together. We have cooperated with each other. We have met over and over  again. Each side has shown restraint in pursuing issues we have felt  strongly about because to have done so would have imperiled the whole  process. There are certain things that I would have liked in this bill,  and there are certain things my Republican counterparts might have  liked in the bill, but we all know that the bill would not have gone  anywhere if we had done that. Instead, we have come together on those  things that can pass. Both sides have had to trust the other, as we  have done, so we could reach agreement to move these bills forward.   Let's finish what we have started in the way we started it--through  bipartisanship and cooperation. That means the Defense and Labor-HHS  bills must remain together in one package. We cannot drop one and  finish the other. That is a nonstarter. Everybody knows that. It also  means the Senate must stand together if the House insists on producing  partisan conference reports that contain poison pill riders. They  cannot pass. Finally, it means we have to remain committed to finishing  all three packages of bills and sending them to the President.   If House Republicans decide to delay minibus No. 2 until after the  election and drop the Labor, HHS, and Education bill from minibus No.  3, it will mean the $18 billion increase for Defense that is assumed in  the bipartisan budget agreement will be enacted while the $18 billion  increase of nondefense programs could be left in the dust--a clear  violation of the bipartisan budget agreement that was based on parity  between defense and nondefense programs agreed to by both Republicans  and Democrats. I predict it could not pass.   Funding the government is one of our most basic constitutional  responsibilities. Americans expect us to work together, as the U.S.  Senate did, and across the aisle to reach agreement on these bills. The  programs funded in these bills make a real difference in people's  lives, and they should not be held up due to partisan differences.  Let's do what we were sent here to do and pass these bills before the  start of the new fiscal year. We can do it, and we have shown how to do  it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the decision, announced last Friday, by  Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales to not renew the International  Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG, after its current term  expires next September, was a profound mistake.   That mistake was further compounded on Tuesday when the government  announced that the CICIG Commissioner, Ivan Velasquez, a respected  Colombian jurist, had been summarily declared a ``national security  threat'' and barred from reentering the country. That is the kind of  fear-provoking mischaracterization one might expect from an  authoritarian government that will use any outlandish justification to  silence its critics but not from a democracy.   I urge President Morales to reconsider and to reverse these actions  for the benefit of the Guatemalan people, in the interests of justice  and on behalf of Guatemala's relations with the United States and its  international reputation. There may still be time to turn this  political and judicial crisis into a positive outcome for the country.   At the time of his public announcement to not renew CICIG, President  Morales was joined on the podium by dozens of uniformed military and  police officers. At the same time, military vehicles carrying officers  armed with heavy weapons--vehicles provided by the United States for  legitimate law enforcement purposes--lined the street in front of  CICIG's office. They also drove past the Constitutional Court and the  U.S. Embassy. It was an intimidating display reminiscent of the 1970s  and 1980s, and the intended message was clear: The commanders of  Guatemala's security forces--which in recent years have been reliable  partners with the United States--have sided with those in power to shut  down the only credible mechanism for combating the corruption and  impunity that plague that country.   Not yet determined is the fate of CICIG's 45 or so international  lawyers and investigators, whose work permits have expired. If  Commissioner Velasquez is not allowed to return and CICIG's other  employees are forced to leave the country, CICIG will, for all  practical purposes, cease to exist.   President Morales's decision to do away with CICIG in a manner that  the U.N. Secretary General says ``does not appear to be consistent with  the Agreement on the establishment of CICIG'' was reportedly  precipitated by a decision of the Supreme Court, days earlier, to refer  to Congress a petition by the Attorney General and CICIG to lift  President Morales's immunity for violating campaign financing laws. It  appears that President Morales is more  [[Page S6052]]  concerned with his own legal vulnerability and that of his supporters  than upholding the institutions of justice.   It is also increasingly apparent that this attack on CICIG is only  part of a broader attempt that has been gaining steam over the better  part of a year to destroy the independence of the constitutional court,  weaken civil society, intimidate human rights defenders and  journalists, and undermine the rule of law. It is an existential  confrontation between the forces of corruption and impunity and  Guatemala's fledgling judicial institutions.   Ever since CICIG was established 11 years ago to help combat the  pervasive corruption, infiltration by organized crime, and near total  impunity in Guatemala, the State Department and the U.S. Embassy have  consistently supported CICIG, as have Republicans and Democrats in  Congress. We are all familiar with the historical links between  organized crime, drug traffickers, Guatemala's security forces, and  public officials. It has been widely recognized by the Guatemalan  people that, because of CICIG and Guatemala's Public Ministry, working  together, the cause of justice--including convictions of corrupt senior  government officials--has been significantly enhanced. Without CICIG,  these achievements would not have been possible.   On Saturday, September 1, Secretary Pompeo responded to President  Morales's announcement with a bizarre tweet that did not even mention  CICIG. Instead, the Secretary expressed appreciation for Guatemala's  ``efforts in counternarcotics and security.'' That is a bit like being  told that the courthouse is on fire and responding that the stock  market is up. The State Department should condemn what is occurring in  Guatemala, reaffirm its support for CICIG and Commissioner Velasquez,  and make clear that corrupt Guatemalan officials will be sanctioned  under U.S. law. Otherwise, it will share complicity in the unraveling  of years of U.S. investment in CICIG and in judicial and law  enforcement reform in Guatemala.   Perhaps the State Department is worried that, if President Morales is  prosecuted and convicted of campaign financing violations and removed  from office the way his predecessor was, U.S. security cooperation with  Guatemala might suffer. What it really should be worried about is what  will happen to the fight against corruption and organized crime if  President Morales succeeds in dismantling CICIG. If the country loses  its most effective anticorruption institution, the progress that has  been made in recent years in strengthening the rule of law is likely to  be reversed, allowing drug cartels and other criminal organizations to  grow unchecked. This is particularly alarming with national elections  in Guatemala scheduled for next year. The integrity of Guatemala's  democratic process--not simply the survival of CICIG--is threatened by  the corrupt influences of organized crime.   Like any institution, CICIG is not without imperfections. Several  constructive reforms have been proposed, and I have encouraged CICIG,  the United Nations, and the Guatemalan Government to find a way forward  that strengthens oversight and transparency while preserving CICIG's  mandate and protecting the Commissioner from political interference.  While that process has been eclipsed by recent events, there is still  time to resurrect it. The United Nations, the United States, other  governments that have supported CICIG, and the Guatemalan Government  should urgently resume discussions to achieve such a solution.   Ultimately, if other attempts fail, the future of CICIG, of its  Commissioner and employees, and of the rule of law in Guatemala--not  just under President Morales who has just over a year left to serve but  also in the years ahead--will be in the hands of the Guatemalan people,  the judiciary, and the Congress. As a former prosecutor and the senior  member of our Judiciary Committee, I have long recognized that an  independent judiciary is a cornerstone of democratic government. It is  what gives practical meaning to the phrase ``rule of law,'' which is  fundamental to strengthening democracy. To its credit, Guatemala's  constitutional court has displayed that independence in the past. That  independence is needed today.   As a result of President Morales's actions, security cooperation with  Guatemala and loans from international financial institutions are now  in jeopardy. That is not in the interests of Guatemala or the United  States. Recognizing what is at stake and in support of the courageous  Guatemalans who are defending the Constitution and the rule of law, I  will not support the expenditure of U.S. funds for assistance for the  Guatemalan Government under the Alliance for Prosperity, including for  the military and police forces, until the fate of CICIG and  Commissioner Velasquez is satisfactorily resolved.                            ____________________
