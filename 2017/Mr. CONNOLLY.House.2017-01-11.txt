 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment  and in strong opposition to the Regulatory Accountability Act.   This bill is another thinly veiled mechanism for the majority to  attack agency rulemaking with which they disagree.   This amendment would prevent agencies from publicly disclosing  information that, quote, ``directly advocates, in support of or against  the proposed rule, for the submission of information to form part of  the record of review for the proposed rule.''   I am concerned that the way this language is written it could  restrict agencies from providing information about the benefits of a  rule and soliciting public feedback.   The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to solicit public  comments on proposed rules except in narrow circumstances. We should be  encouraging agencies to solicit public comments in order to provide  businesses, consumer groups, and other members of the public with the  opportunity to make suggestions to the agency for improving the  proposed rule.   Agency employees are already barred under appropriations bills from  engaging in publicity or propaganda.   Agency employees are specifically barred from engaging in  ``substantial `grassroots' lobbying campaigns'' when those campaigns  are aimed at encouraging members of the public ``to pressure Members of  Congress to support Administration or Department legislative or  appropriations proposals.''   While transparency is always helpful in the regulatory process, a  requirement that agencies report to Congress every communication to the  public--including every oral communication from an agency official-- would be unnecessarily burdensome and would not be feasible for  agencies.   The GAO has already defined covert communications, self- aggrandizement, and purely partisan activities as categories of agency  communications that are often restricted by these appropriations  riders.   Agencies are authorized to regulate by Congress, but this amendment  would further handicap federal agencies from fulfilling their critical  missions.   Under the guise of ``accountability'' this amendment is not even a  thinly disguised attempt to muzzle commonsense regulation by  suppressing even the ability to explain the proposed rule in the first  place.   I urge my colleagues to uphold Congress' confidence in the agency  rulemaking process and vote against this amendment and against the  Regulatory Accountability Act.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota  will be postponed.                                time  1600              Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Graves of Louisiana    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.   Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 23, line 24, strike ``and''.        Page 24, insert after line 5 the following:        ``(iii) in the case of a major rule, a report on the       benefits and costs of the final rule on entities whose       conduct is regulated by the rule in the Federal Register, to       be revised every 5 years thereafter while the rule remains in       effect, and including, at a minimum--        ``(I) an assessment of the impacts, including any costs, of       the major rule on regulated entities;        ``(II) a determination about how the actual benefits and       costs of the major rule have varied from those anticipated at       the time the major rule was issued;        ``(III) an assessment of the effectiveness and benefits of       the major rule in producing the regulatory objectives of the       major rule; and        ``(IV) a review by the Administrator of the Office of       Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of       Management and Budget when required under executive order;       and''.        Page 30, line 16, insert after ``the Federal Open Market       Committee.'' the following:        ``(n) Regulation-specific Frameworks.--        ``(1) Report to congress.--The agency shall provide a       report to Congress not later than 90 days after the agency       makes any determination under subsection (f)(4)(I)(iii)(II)       that the cost to regulated entities has exceeded the       anticipated cost at the time the final rule was issued. The       agency, at a minimum, shall assess in the report--        ``(A) whether the major rule is accomplishing its       regulatory objective; and        ``(B) whether the major rule has been rendered unnecessary,       taking into consideration--        ``(i) changes in the subject area affected by the major       rule;        ``(ii) whether the major rule overlaps, duplicates, or       conflicts with other rules or, to the extent feasible, State       and local government regulations; and        ``(iii) other alternatives to the major rule or       modification of the major rule that might achieve better       results while imposing a smaller burden on society or at a       lower cost, taking into consideration any cost already       incurred.        ``(2) Reopening of public docket.--Upon delivery of the       report required in paragraph (1) the agency shall--        ``(A) reopen the public docket for 60 days to receive       additional comments; and        ``(B) consider modifications or alternatives that reduce       costs and increase benefits to regulated entities or       individuals.        ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may       be construed to affect any other provision of law that       requires an agency to conduct retrospective reviews of rules       issued by the agency.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.   Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, since 2008, approximately  3,300 regulations have been issued on an annual basis. I will say that  again. Since 2008, approximately 3,300 regulations have been issued on  an annual basis. The cost of compliance with those regulations is  estimated to be somewhere around $981 million, and if you add up the  costs of compliance of all regulations, it is approximately double  that. According to various studies that are out there, since 2008, the  costs of complying with Federal regulations has doubled.   Mr. Chairman, this isn't about some huge megacorporation that is  worth billions of dollars and is a multinational company. This impacts  individuals. This impacts families. As a matter of fact, a study done  by the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that approximately  $15,000 per year is how much the average American family spends just to  comply with Federal regulations.   Major regulations are regulations that are estimated to cost in  excess of $100 million. Under our amendment, what we do is simply  require that, every 5 years, the Federal agency that has promulgated-- that has finalized--a regulation go back and check how much it is  actually costing to comply with the regulation.   Here is why it is important, Mr. Chairman.   If you go back to a regulation that was proposed by the Department of  the Interior within the last year and a half that has to do with well  control in offshore energy production, the Department of the Interior  estimated that the cost of complying with that regulation was going to  be, approximately, $883 million over 10 years. However, a private  analysis that was done estimated that that figure was approximately  one-tenth of the true cost of compliance over the first decade--one- tenth.   There is nothing that holds the Federal agencies accountable. They  can lowball numbers. They can stay below the threshold of a major  action and not ever have to be held accountable to the additional  analysis that is required for major regulatory actions. This, simply,  makes agencies go back on major regulations to re-quantify--reassess-- the costs of compliance to make sure that their numbers are accurate,  that they understand the costs of compliance,  [[Page H353]]  and the impact on the average American family.   Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I am from the State of Louisiana. A study that  was done by the Mercatus Center found that the State of Louisiana is  the most federally regulated State in the United States. As a matter of  fact, so regulated that we are regulated 74 percent more than the  average State--74 percent more. That has a significant impact on jobs,  on our economy.   The cosponsor of this amendment--the gentleman from Texas with whom I  worked very closely, Mr. Chairman--says his State of Texas is burdened  by an additional 30 percent of regulations above the national average.  It is inappropriate; it penalizes our economy; it sends jobs overseas;  and, most importantly, it penalizes American families.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, any time I hear the name  ``Mercatus Center'' I think of pro-big business, antiregulation. This  amendment imposes even more paralyzing rulemaking requirements to the  more than 60 analytical and procedural requirements that are already  mandated by title I of this bill. You are giving them more homework on  top of homework--busywork, red tape. Gum up the works--that is what  this is all about.   The amendment would require agencies to assess the economic impacts  of major rules every 5 years, including a cost-benefit analysis of the  rule every 5 years, an estimate of the rule's cost on regulated  entities, and whether these costs exceed an agency's initial estimates,  among other requirements. Worse yet, once this information is compiled,  the amendment would also require the agency to reopen the public docket  on the rule for 60 days to consider modifications to the underlying  rule.   Under current law, Federal agencies already conduct an extensive  retrospective review process of existing rules and have already saved  taxpayers billions in cost savings. This is yet another attempt to  derail the rulemaking process by paralysis through analysis.   Since 2011, the Obama administration has made a durable commitment to  ensuring the retrospective review of existing regulatory protections.  Pursuant to Executive Order Nos. 13563 and 13610, agencies are already  required to conduct a periodic review of existing rules to protect  public health while reducing paperwork burdens.   Furthermore, as the Obama administration stated in the context of a  veto threat of a similarly draconian antiregulatory proposal, ``it is  important that retrospective review efforts not unnecessarily constrain  an agency's ability to provide a timely response to critical public  health or safety issues or constrain its ability to implement new  statutory provisions.''   This amendment would do just that by requiring agencies to conduct a  perpetual notice-and-comment process for major rules that have been  adopted long ago. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.
