 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York and Chairman Engel  for their support.   Mr. Speaker, over 8 million metric tons of plastic enters the oceans  each year. That is the equivalent of a garbage truck full of plastic  being dumped out every single minute.   According to the United Nations Environment Program, if no change is  enacted, our oceans could contain more plastic bags than fish by 2050.   Mismanaged plastic waste in our oceans and communities can take  centuries to decompose. That threatens economic development, hurts  marine life, and threatens health systems around the world. Reversing  the trend of increased plastic waste in our oceans will require a  coordinated global response.   It is important to note that just 10 river systems carry an estimated  90 percent of river-based plastic waste to the ocean. China contributes  the largest share of this mismanaged waste, followed by developing  countries, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.   That is why Chairman Engel and I introduced the PLASTICS Act. This  legislation elevates the United States to a leadership role in  international efforts to reduce and safely manage plastic waste.   The PLASTICS Act will allow America to do more to help build the  capacity of developing countries to manage their waste. And it will  help prevent more waste from spilling into the ocean on the scale that  it is today.   The PLASTICS Act elevates ongoing efforts by USAID, and it  prioritizes new partnerships between the private sector and the U.S.  Development Finance Corporation. This will allow us to leverage  additional financing for companies putting these waste management  practices into place in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that yesterday the United States  Development Finance Corporation announced its Ocean Plastics  Initiative, based on this bill, and it is exactly what this bill calls  for. This initiative aims to catalyze $2.5 billion in the private  sector infrastructure investments aimed at reducing plastic waste and  marine debris.   By elevating the role of women and marginalized populations in these  initiatives, we can spur economic development and opportunity across  the globe. Our work to combat plastic waste is an investment in the  health of our oceans and our communities, not just for ourselves, but  also for future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from  New York has no further speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, as my colleagues and I have been speaking on  this bill for the last 10 minutes, over 300,000 pounds of plastic has  entered our oceans. It is amazing to think about that, just in the 10  minutes we have been speaking here today.   Reversing this trend and preventing plastic from choking our oceans  will require this coordinated global response that is both practical,  innovative, measurable, and, quite frankly, it is the right thing to do  for our future generations.   With the PLASTICS Act, we will be taking a huge large step in that  direction. We have a duty to protect future generations from the  repercussions of today's waste. I also strongly support ongoing efforts  to ensure final passage of Save Our Seas 2.0 Act, which includes  components of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their great bipartisan work. I also thank my dear chairman, Eliot  Engel, and the gentleman from New York. Chairman Engel has been a dear  friend of mine in this Congress. We are going to be sad to see him go,  but I know he has bright aspirations for his future, and we look  forward to celebrating with him. And one way we can celebrate this is  by passing the PLASTICS Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his support, and  Chairman Engel, once again. The 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics were a  triumph for the China Communist Party and a significant blow for human  rights.   While the CCP aired lavish television spectacles for the world to  see, they were evicting people from their homes, arresting activists,  and harassing foreign journalists. Now, 12 years later, human rights  abuses have only escalated in China.   The CCP is currently oppressing anywhere from 1 to 3 million ethic  minorities in Xinjiang. These prison camps are described as oppressive  with harsh labor conditions, brainwashing, and even forced  sterilizations and abortions. The Department of Defense has compared  them to concentration camps.   At the same time, the CCP continues to crack down on the people of  Hong Kong for simply asking for the freedoms they were promised. And we  should never forget the role the CCP played in the COVID-19 pandemic.  In an attempt to hide the truth from the world and cover up their own  culpability in allowing what could have been a regional epidemic, they  allowed it to turn into a global pandemic. The CCP destroyed lab  samples and threatened and arrested doctors and journalists who were  simply just trying to report the truth.   However, even with all this happening, Beijing is still set to host  the 2022 Winter Olympics. Unfortunately, the International Olympic  Committee has shown their lack of concern for the CCP's escalating  human rights violations, whether it be the Uighur Muslims, the Tibetan  monks or the Christian population.                                time  1515    They are even refusing to discuss moving the games and have refused  to use the upcoming games to simply put pressure on the CCP to stop  their attacks on human rights.   Just like they did in 2008, the CCP will try to use games, including  American athletes, to whitewash their history and improve their image.   Today, there is no structure to prepare our athletic delegations for  this threat.   That is why Chairman Engel and I introduced the American Values and  Security in International Athletics Act.   This bipartisan bill would direct the State Department to establish a  briefing program on human rights violations and personal privacy  concerns American athletes will face in countries that denigrate human  rights, like China.   So when we send our American athletes to represent us in  authoritarian countries that flagrantly abuse human rights, those  athletes deserve to know exactly what is happening. Then they can make  an informed decision about their own participation, particularly as we  prepare for the 2022 games.   Mr. Speaker, this is the 40th anniversary of the United States  boycott on the Moscow Olympics.   At that time, in support of President Carter's boycott against the  Soviet Union, famous sports journalist Howard Cosell said:         It seemed absolutely wrong to me to let the Soviet Union       use our athletes and our technology capabilities to broadcast       their perverse propaganda to every corner of the globe.    I agree with Howard Cosell.   Mr. Speaker, we need to come together again to raise awareness for  the next winter Olympics in China.   Silence is not an option. And this bipartisan bill is an important  step to ensure the United States Olympians, many of whom are icons and  adored by our children as role models, to make sure that they are  educated about where they are competing when they go abroad to China.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, hosting the Olympics is an honor that indicates the host  country's legitimacy on the world stage, but unfortunately, this honor  has been handed to governments who misuse it time and again.   We cannot let the Olympic games become a tool for corrupt and malign  governments to conceal their behavior and portray themselves in a  positive light. We know that the CCP will use international  participation in the Olympics to normalize its atrocities. They have  done it once before.   At the very least, we should ensure that American athletes have the  opportunity to at least be informed and to protect themselves and their  personal privacy.   We have all traveled, as Members of Congress, across the globe to  oppressive governments. Many of us have been under surveillance in  hostile governments like Russia and China and other countries. This  bill simply allows  [[Page H5915]]  for our athletes to have the same courtesy, to be briefed in advance  about the threats that they may face while they are in the host country  at the Olympics in China.   Again, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for his support;  Chairman Engel, my dear friend, for cosponsoring the bill, along with  Representatives Sherman, Spanberger, and Phillips.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
