 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4861, the  Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department  Act.   Before I tell why, I want to thank my good friend Mr. Pallone from  New Jersey. We came to Congress together a long while ago, and we have  worked very closely together.   And I want to thank Mr. Walden. He said I am thoughtful. He is one of  the most thoughtful Members in Congress. He reaches across the aisle,  and we have made a lot of great progress, and the country is so much  better having people with that kind of temperament to reach across the  aisle. I thank the gentleman for all the kind words. They really mean a  lot.   I authored this legislation with my colleague, Gus Bilirakis, to help  reduce rates of suicide in the United States.   Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. It claimed  more than 47,000 lives in 2017, alone.                                time  1600    According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the suicide  rate in the U.S. increased by an alarming 31 percent from 2001 to 2017.   In this time of COVID, where the pandemic has taken an untold  physical and emotional toll on Americans' health, officials are  reporting surges in mental and behavioral health problems.   Studies show that as many as 11 percent of all patients visiting a  hospital emergency department are at risk for suicide, but only a  fraction of these at-risk patients are ever identified.   Our bill aims to improve the identification, assessment, and  treatment of patients in emergency departments who are at high risk of  suicide.   It provides $100 million over a 5-year period to support emergency  department programs to prevent suicides specifically by:   Training emergency department clinicians to identify patients with an  elevated risk of suicide;   Developing programs to coordinate care and follow-up of those with an  elevated risk of suicide;   Supporting the recruitment and retainment of behavioral health  professionals who specialize in treating individuals with suicidal  tendencies; and   Incentivizing the development of new approaches, such as telehealth,  to help those at high risk of suicide.   Our legislation has been endorsed by over 40 mental health advocacy  groups, including: the Emergency Nurses Association, the American  Nurses Association, the American Psychological Association, the  American Psychiatric Association, The Kennedy Forum, the National  Alliance on Mental Illness, and Mental Health America.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
