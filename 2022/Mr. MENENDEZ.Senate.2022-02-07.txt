The M61Al Vulcan Cannon is a six-barreled automatic       cannon chambered in 20l20mm with a cyclic rate offire from       2,500-6,000 shots per minute. This weapon is a hydraulically       powered air cooled Gatling gun used to damage/destroy aerial       targets, suppress/incapacitate personnel targets and damage       or destroy moving and stationary light material targets.        20. The Joint Programmable Fuze FMU-152 or FMU-139 fuzes       are multi-delay sensors compatible with weapon guidance kits,       tail kits, high-explosive bombs, and reduced collateral       damage weapons which provide all arming and detonation event       functions combined in a single fuze system.        21. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) is a guidance       set that converts existing unguided bomb into an accurate,       adverse weather ``smart'' munition. The Guidance Set consists       of a Tail Kit, which contains the Inertial Navigation System       (INS) and a Global Positioning System (OPS), a set of       Aerosurfaces and an umbilical cover, which allows the JDAM to       improve the accuracy of unguided, General Purpose bombs. The       JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest standoff ranges at       high or low altitudes against a variety of land and surface       targets during the day or night. JDAM is capable of receiving       target coordinates via preplanned mission data from the       delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., FLIR,       Radar, etc.) during captive carry, or from a third-party       source via manual or automated aircrew cockpit entry. The       Guidance Set, when combined with a warhead and appropriate       fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU).      The KMU-556 is the tail kit for a GBU-31, 2,000 pound JDAM.        22. Laser JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munitions) (GBU-54)       converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into precision       guided smart munitions by adding a new tail section       containing Inertial Navigation System (INS) guidance/Global       Positioning System (GPS) guidance and adds a semi-active       laser seeker. This allows the weapon to strike targets moving       at up to 70 mph. The LJDAM weapon consists of a DSU-38       sensor, a JDAM guidance set installed on bomb body and a       fuze. The DSU-38 consists of a laser spot tracker (same size       and shape as a DSU-33 proximity fuze), a cable connecting the       DSU-38 to the basic JDAM guidance set, a cable cover, cable       cover tie down straps, modified tail kit door and wiring       harness, and associated modified JDAM software that       incorporates navigation and guidance flight software to       support both LJDAM and standard JDAM missions.      The KMU-572 is the tail kit for a GBU-54, 500 pound Laser JDAM.         23. The Paveway II (PWII) is a maneuverable, free-fall       Laser Guided Bomb (LGB) that guides to a spot of laser energy       reflected off the target. The LGB is delivered like a normal       general purpose (GP) warhead and the semi-active guidance       corrects for many of the normal errors inherent in any       delivery system. Laser designation for the LGB can be       provided by a variety of laser target markers or designators.       An LGB consists of a MAU-209 or MAU-169 Computer Control       Group (CCG), that is not warhead specific, and a warhead       specific Air Foil Group (AFG) that attaches to the nose and       tail of the GP bomb body.      The GBU-10 is a 2,000 lb GP bomb body fitted with the MXU-651           AFG to guide to its laser designated target. The inert           GBU-12 uses a BDU-50 inert bomb body and MAU-169 CCG           trainer for training purposes.        24. The Enhanced Paveway II (EP II) Laser Guided Bomb (LGB)       is a maneuverable, all-weather, free-fall weapon that guides       to a spot of laser energy reflected off the target. The       ``enhanced'' component is the addition of GPS-aided Inertial       Navigation Systems (GAINS) guidance to the laser seeker.       Laser designation for the LGB can be provided by a variety of       laser target markers or designators. The EP II consists of an       MAU-210 Enhanced Computer Control Group (ECCG) that is not       warhead specific and a warhead-specific Air Foil Group (AFG)       that attaches to the nose and tail of a GP bomb body.  The EGBU-49 is a 500 pound GP bomb body fitted with the MXU-650 AFG to                   guide to its laser-designated target.         25. The Mk-84 General Purpose (GP) bomb body is a 2,000       pound, free-fall, unguided, lowdrag weapon.        26. The Mk-82 GP bomb body is a 500 pound, free-fall,       unguided, low-drag weapon.        27. Mk-82 inert GP bomb body is a 500 pound, free-fall,       unguided, low-drag weapon without the explosive fill.        28. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        29. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        30. A determination has been made that Jordan can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        31. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Jordan.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION     Saudi Arabia--Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Low                        Volume Terminals (MIDS-LVT)         The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested to buy thirty-one       (31) Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Low       Volume Terminals (MIDS-LVT) Block Upgrade 2 (BU2), that will       be added to a previously implemented case. The original FMS       case, valued at $3.0 million, included eleven (11)       Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Low Volume       Terminals (MIDS-LVT) Block Upgrade 1 (BUI). Therefore, this       notification is for a total or eleven (11) Multifunctional       Information Distribution System-Low Volume Terminals (MIDS-      LVT) Block Upgrade 1 (BUI) and thirty-one (31)       Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Low Volume       Terminals (MIDS-LVT) Block Upgrade 2 (BU2).

The proposed sale will provide the Saudi armed forces with       the equipment, training, and follow-on support necessary to       protect Saudi Arabia, and the region, from the destabilizing       effects of terrorism, countering Iranian influence, and other       threats. The proposed MIDS-LVT (BU2) terminals will be       installed on Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD)       platforms, while the previously provided MIDS-LVT (BUI)       terminals were installed on PATRIOT. Saudi Arabia will have       no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor is undetermined as there will a       competitive contractual award process after LOA       implementation. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of any U.S. Government or contractor representatives to Saudi       Arabia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

After this letter is delivered to your office, we       plan to issue a news release to notify the public of this       proposed sale.            Sincerely,                                                   James A. Hursch,                                                          Director.

The case included common spares/repair parts       to support the United Arab Emirates' Homing All the Way       Killer (HAWK), Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on       Target (PA-TRIOT), and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense       (THAAD) weapon systems, additional support; and other related       elements of logistics and program support. The United Arab       Emirates (UAE) has requested the case be amended to include       funding to cover an additional three years. This amendment,       which will add $35 million of non-MDE, will push the current       case above the congressional notification threshold,       requiring notification of the entire case before the       amendment can be offered.        Major Defense Equipment (MDE): None.        Non-MDE: Foreign Military Sales Order (FMSO) II to provide       funds for blanket order requisitions under a Cooperative       Logistics Supply Support Agreement (CLSSA) for common spares/      repair parts to support the United Arab Emirates' Homing All       the Way Killer (HAWK), Phased Array Tracking Radar to       Intercept on Target (PATRIOT), and Terminal High Altitude       Area Defense (THAAD) weapon systems, additional support; and       other related elements of logistics and program support.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: February 3, 2022.        *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             policy justification     United Arab Emirates--Foreign Military Sales Order (FMSO) II Case         The Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has       requested to buy a Foreign Military Sales Order (FMSO) II to       provide funds for blanket order requisitions under a       Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Agreement (CLSSA) for       common spares/repair parts to support the United Arab       Emirates' Homing All the Way Killer (HAWK), Phased Array       Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target (PATRIOT), and Terminal       High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) weapon systems, additional       support; and other related elements of logistics and program       support. An earlier FMS case, valued at $30 million, provided       this requirement. The amended FMS case would extend the       funding to cover an additional three years. The estimated       total case value is $65 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of an important regional partner. The UAE is a       vital U.S. partner for political stability and economic       progress in the Middle East.        The UAE intends to utilize this follow-on support to       maintain its air defense weapon systems in accordance with       U.S. maintenance requirements and standards. This sale       supports the UAE's existing ability to deter and defend       against hostile threats by maintaining the operational       readiness of critical air defense systems. The proposed sale       will contribute to the UAE's ability to effectively integrate       with U.S.-led coalitions and operate independently in support       of U.S. interests and the security of U.S. forces in theater,       and is consistent with U.S. bilateral and multilateral       defense plans in the CENTCOM region. The UAE will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment and services into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        There are no principal contractors involved with this       potential sale. There are no known offset agreements       associated with this sale.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of any additional U.S.  [[Page S544]]       Government or contractor representatives to the UAE.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
