 Madam President, I rise to give thanks to the brave men  and women of law enforcement in Colorado and across the country. Every  holiday season, I am reminded of the sacrifice that these brave  officers make in order to make sure that everybody's holiday season is  enjoyed safely and that every day is enjoyed safely and securely.   Across the United States this year, 115 law enforcement officers have  paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In Colorado, we honor  those who lost their lives this year. Master Trooper William Moden was  killed earlier this year when he was struck by a vehicle as he was  investigating a crash. He served the Colorado State Patrol for 12  years. Corporal Daniel Groves was also killed by a passing vehicle  while assisting another driver during the blizzard last winter.  Corporal Groves also served the Colorado State Patrol for 12 years.    Unfortunately, I also come to the floor to honor three other brave  men and women--you can see them here--who have given their lives just  this past month. Sergeant Joshua Voth served the Colorado Department of  Corrections and was stationed at the Canyon City Correction Facility.  He was killed this month when an issue with the boiler caused an  explosion. Sergeant Voth was 28 years old and leaves behind his wife  and three children. He served at the Canyon City facility for 3 years  and helped teach inmates valuable skills to help smooth the plan to  rehabilitation.   We also lost other beloved members of our first responder community.  They need to be remembered and honored as well. Ken Jones, a member of  the Summit Fire and EMS, was killed on December 7 while responding to a  fire at Copper Mountain. Ken served in that department for 20 years and  was known by his colleagues as ``a firefighter's firefighter.'' Travis  Davis, the deputy chief of operations for Summit Fire and EMS,  remembers him as an ``Oak'' and said everyone in the organization  learned something in Ken's steady and calm demeanor. We thank Ken and  his family for two decades of service and send our sincerest thoughts  to all those who knew him.   I also would like to recognize Troy Jackson, a former assistant chief  of operations for the South Metro Fire Rescue, who passed away just  yesterday morning after a battle of what is believed to be job-related  cancer. Chief Jackson was first hired in 1990 and served nearly three  decades before stepping away in 2016 due to his health. He was open  about his battle with cancer, in hopes that he could teach other  firefighters how to avoid these risks.   We thank Chief Jackson for his service and send our thoughts and  prayers  [[Page S7075]]  along to his wife and two children. Each one of these officers and  firefighters we lost this year was a neighbor or loved one, a member of  the community, and an extraordinary Coloradan who gave their life to  protect their communities. While we remember those whom we lost this  year, we must also continue to celebrate those who continue to serve  today.                            ____________________     Madam President, in August, I was fortunate to award  Officer Michael Lohman of the Greeley Police Department with the  Congressional Badge of Bravery for his heroic actions apprehending the  driver of a stolen vehicle in 2017.   While at the driver-side window of the vehicle, the driver pulled a  gun on Officer Lohman, who immediately engaged with the driver to take  the weapon. The driver pulled Officer Lohman into the vehicle and began  accelerating, dragging him along the street. Officer Lohman kept his  cool and was able to pull the suspect from the vehicle while it was  still moving and apprehended him with the help of other officers.   These actions saved the lives of anyone in the path of that vehicle,  as well as the life of his partner who was at the passenger side of the  vehicle when the gun was pulled. These actions give our communities  peace of mind, knowing that heroes like Officer Lohman continue to keep  all of us safe. But we know every brave action doesn't get the  recognition that it deserves.   Every day, there are law enforcement and first responders who act  with complete selflessness. They do this not to seek recognition or  praise, but simply because it is what they were called to do.   Jamie and I would like to send our thanks to the families of our law  enforcement and first responders. Every day these men and women say  goodbye to their loved ones, unsure of what that day will hold for  them. I am sure these goodbyes are much more difficult during the  holiday season, but without the love and support of those at home, the  jobs of law enforcement and our first responders would be that much  more difficult. We thank them for their continued sacrifice.                     RECOGNIZING THE U.S. CAPITOL POLICE     Madam President, I would also like to take a moment to  say thanks to the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police. They work  long hours to ensure that Members of the staff and Members themselves  are able to carry out their duties safely. On top of that important  duty, they also protect the public who comes to visit to express their  opinion, to express their right to assemble and free speech in the  Capitol and beyond, not only to tour this beautiful Capitol Building,  but to make sure their thoughts are heard on our Nation's policy  issues.   I know every one of my colleagues will join us in expressing our  gratitude to law enforcement and first responders not only in Colorado,  but across this Nation this holiday season. They will give up time with  their own families to make sure that others are safe.   To all those who defend that thin blue line, thank you, and God  bless. You have my enduring support. May you all have a happy and  blessed holiday season.   I yield the floor.
