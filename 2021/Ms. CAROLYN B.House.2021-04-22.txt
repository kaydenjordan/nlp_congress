 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, statehood for D.C.  is about fairness, justice, and ensuring that all Americans have an  equal stake in our Republic. It is not unconstitutional. It is  constitutional. And this is not about politics. It is a fundamental  voting and civil rights issue.   The real wrong is denying 712,000 taxpaying American citizens the  right to vote. Our Nation is founded upon the principle that all people  should have a voice in their government. No taxation without  representation. But without voting representation in Congress, the  people of D.C. are denied that most basic fundamental right.   Today's debate forces us to confront the fundamental question of who  we are as a nation.   Do we believe in the right to full and equal representation? Or are  these just empty words?   D.C. residents are Americans, and they deserve the equal rights our  national ideals promise them.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the outstanding Congresswoman for her  tireless and selfless advocacy to ensure that D.C. residents finally  gain full representation that they deserve. I join many in thanking the  leadership of the Democratic Caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority  Leader Steny Hoyer, and Whip   James Clyburn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote in favor of this critical civil  rights bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
