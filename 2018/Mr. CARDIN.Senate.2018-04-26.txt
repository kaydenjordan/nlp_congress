 Madam President, I take this time because I know that  shortly we are going to be voting on Mr. Pompeo's nomination as  Secretary of State, and I want to explain to my colleagues why I cannot  support his nomination.   As I said in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his  nomination hearing, I appreciate Mr. Pompeo's public service throughout  his career--his service in the military and his service in Congress and  as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I also appreciate the  fact that he is willing to serve our Nation in this most important post  as Secretary of State.   In the United States, we urgently need a confirmed Secretary of  State, but it is our responsibility in the U.S. Senate to advise and  consent on the President's nominations and to act as an independent  branch of government.   I must state that we are in this urgent need because of Mr. Trump's  abrupt dismissal of our former Secretary of State in the midst of many  international challenges. In my view, though, Mr. Pompeo is not the  right person. I reached that conclusion by his actions and his  rhetoric.   If Mr. Pompeo is confirmed, he will be the top diplomat for the  United States. He must be an independent voice in the White House. I  have questions as to whether he will be that independent voice. He  needs to engage our allies. That is how our diplomacy works. He has to  be the loudest voice for diplomacy in our national security, in the use  of our tools, and the military needs to be a matter of last resort.   I was reminded of this challenge for America when President Macron  addressed the joint session of Congress yesterday. President Macron  pointed out that the United States established multinational world  order in the aftermath of World War II, which is embodied in the  transatlantic partnership, and we, the United States, must lead in  order to preserve that national security blanket. So it is incumbent  upon the Secretary of State to work with our allies--particularly our  European allies but all of our allies.   As just one example, when I look at Mr. Pompeo's record in regard to  the nuclear agreement with Iran, during that discussion as to whether  we would have diplomacy, it was Mr. Pompeo who said that the solution  rests with 2,000 sorties to destroy the Iran nuclear capacity. That is  not diplomacy. That is not leading with diplomacy. Now he is espousing  that, if necessary, we should pull out of the agreement if we can't  change it, even though Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That  is not diplomacy, and that is certainly not working with our European  allies.   Yesterday, we heard President Macron assert that it is critically  important that that agreement move forward if Iran is in compliance.  Yes, we can build on it, but to walk away from it would be wrong.   Another example that gives me great concern is Mr. Pompeo's position  in regard to the Paris climate talks. I know we all have different  views about climate and what our individual policy should be in order  to deal with the realities of climate change, but one thing should be  clear: that we want to be in  [[Page S2452]]  the discussions with the international community.   In regard to Iran, Mr. Pompeo would isolate us from our European  allies, but in regard to withdrawing from the Paris climate talks, he  would isolate America from every other nation in the world. We would be  the only nation not a part of that discussion. Let me remind my  colleagues that the commitments made in Paris are only enforceable by  us. There is no international enforcement mechanism.   Words matter. A top diplomat needs to engage a very diverse global  community. Mr. Pompeo's words unfortunately make it very challenging  for him to be able to have the confidence of the international  community.   He associated American Muslims with terrorism by stating that their  perceived silence in condemning attacks ``has made these Islamic  leaders across America potentially complicit.'' I know that after each  of the horrible terrorist activities we have seen in America, Muslim  leaders in Maryland and Muslim leaders around the world have stood up  and said that they condemn in the strongest possible terms those  terrorist acts.   That should have no space. Unfortunately, those types of comments  give space to those who are promoting a form of nationalism that allows  for hate-mongering, and that cannot be tolerated in our country.   The LGBTQ community is rightly concerned. I go to Mr. Pompeo citing  verbatim the following passage from a sermon castrating members of the  LGBTQ community.         America has worshipped other gods and called it       multiculturalism. We have endorsed perversion and called it       an alternative lifestyle.    That type of language should have no place for someone who wants to  be the top diplomat of America.   So I have come to the conclusion, based upon the necessity of the  Secretary of State to engage the national community, to provide  leadership and the use of diplomacy, that based upon those--my  priorities, policy priorities, not politics or partisanship--that I  cannot support Mr. Pompeo for Secretary of State.   I want to conclude with this. I have had the chance to lead the  Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have been a  member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee my entire 12 years in  this institution. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its  leaders have had a long tradition of bipartisanship, of recognizing the  independent role of the legislative branch and the critical role played  by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and we are always stronger  when we act in unity.   That is a tradition of our committee. I want to just point out that I  don't question anyone's motives on how they vote on the nominee for the  Secretary of State, but I have great confidence that we in the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee will continue the great tradition we have  established as an independent voice and as a voice that tries to work  in unity in the best interest of our Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the recent rise of  anti-  [[Page S2473]]  Semitism and racism in our communities.   As Members of Congress, we have an enormous responsibility to take  strong action and stand up against intolerance before it takes root in  the next generation. It is incumbent upon all people to ensure that  adequate tools are in place to counter the resurgence of fear and hate- mongering--whether directed at old targets or new--that led to the  Holocaust and other atrocities.   America must maintain its leadership abroad, especially when it comes  to the issues of human rights and religious freedom--the core  foundations upon which our Nation was built. We must uphold these  standards here at home and defend and promote them globally.   In my role as the representative on anti-Semitism, racism, and  intolerance for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in  Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, I visited Paris and Copenhagen and met  with local leaders in the aftermath of the violent, anti-Semitic  attacks in 2015, including the Charlie Hebdo massacre. The gruesome  murder of Holocaust survivor Mireille Knoll in Paris on March 24 is a  grim reminder of the urgency of our task.   In Poland, there have been no attacks recently, but there is a  growing climate of fear. Government officials have equivocated  regarding Polish responsibility for the World War II massacre in  Jedwabne and the postwar pogrom in Kielce, which occurred on our  Independence Day--July 4, 1946. The Polish President recently signed  into law an anti-defamation bill that makes it illegal to attribute  responsibility for or complicity during the Holocaust to the Polish  nation or state. This law will, in fact, restrict academic freedom,  chill free speech, and hinder teaching about the Holocaust and the  crimes committed in occupied Poland during World War II.    In Hungary, Viktor Orban has stoked a campaign of hatred against  migrants and Muslims in his bid for a third term as Prime Minister. In  the final days of his campaign and perhaps revealing some concerns for  his margin of victory, his party has sharpened its call for a country  that is White and Christian, escalating its anti-Semitic and anti-Roma  rhetoric.   Here at home, we have witnessed extremists and neo-Nazis marching in  the streets openly carrying painful hate symbols from the 1930s. In a  brazen public display, neo-Nazis and White supremacist groups took to  the streets in Charlottesville, VA, last August, inciting violence that  cost 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer her life. Just this  past weekend, another group of neo-Nazis marched in Newnan, GA, and  burned a large swastika afterwards. Burt Colucci, a member of the  National Socialist Movement, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that  there was no particular reason Newnan was chosen for the rally. He  said:         We pick these rallies randomly. It is always preferable       that it is in a white town.    How can we address these challenges and build a more tolerant,  peaceful, and global community?   Earlier this year, in commemoration of International Holocaust  Remembrance Day, the Italian Government hosted the Rome International  Conference on the Responsibility of States, Institutions and  Individuals in the Fight against Anti-Semitism in the OSCE Area. At  that event that convened on the 80th anniversary of the passage of  Italy's ``racial laws,'' which discriminated against Jews and people of  African descent, leaders from across Europe and the United States  recommitted to address anti-Semitism in their societies--from  collecting and reporting hate crime data to supporting education--at a  time when few Holocaust survivors or witnesses to the atrocities of  World War II remain.   The OSCE also reported on its Turning Words Into Action project,  designed to assist governments and civil societies in bolstering  security for Jewish communities, educate our own societies on how to  recognize and address prejudice, and build coalitions between Jewish  and other communities.   Yet, at this critical juncture, we have been cutting funding and  other resources meant to bolster America's diplomatic efforts abroad.  It is for this reason that I fought to include $1 million to combat  global anti-Semitism in the fiscal year 2018 Omnibus appropriations  bill recently passed by Congress. I also wrote letters urging President  Trump and his administration to select a new special envoy to monitor  and combat anti-Semitism. This position has been critical in working  with governments and organizations abroad to facilitate action against  anti-Semitism in communities around the world.   We must all understand that a threat against one religion, race, or  ethnicity is a threat against all religions, races, and ethnicities.  Hatred unleashed rarely forms its own boundaries.   In the aftermath of World War II, a Protestant pastor famously said:         In Germany, they came first for the Communists, and I       didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist; and then they       came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I       wasn't a trade unionist; and then they came for the Jews, and       I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew; and then they came       for me . . . and by that time there was no one left to speak       up.    History has shown time and again that the failure of governments and  political leaders to denounce those who advance an agenda of hate and  bigotry brings instability and violence.   As hate crimes continue to rise in our own Nation and as the number  of refugees around the world fleeing political violence and persecution  reaches record highs, we must reaffirm our sense of duty and our  commitment to preserving freedom, equality, and fundamental human  rights for all people.   Addressing the anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination and  persecution takes a concerted and sustained effort from a coalition of  governments, faith and community leaders, and global advocates to  denounce these atrocities and promote peace and tolerance around the  world.   Now more than ever, we need to join together and speak up to protect  human rights around the globe because it is in all of our interests to  do so. We must also use tools available to us, from hate crime laws to  capacity-building measures for civil society and governments, such as  those offered by the OSCE.   I will continue to stand alongside civil society and remain an  advocate for equality and human rights, and I urge my colleagues to do  likewise.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
