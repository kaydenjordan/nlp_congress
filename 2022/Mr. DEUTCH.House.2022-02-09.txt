 Mr. Speaker, last year, more than 100,000 Americans died  from drug overdoses, 60 percent of them from fentanyl. These were  mothers and fathers. They were relatives, neighbors, friends. One was  my nephew Eli.   Eli died from an unintentional fentanyl overdose, using a legal  herbal supplement that had been laced with fentanyl. He would have  turned 21 tomorrow.   What happened to Eli is not unique. Young people on social media who  think that they are buying Adderall or Xanax are being sold fentanyl- contaminated counterfeits.   It is the responsibility of every Member of Congress to acknowledge  that fentanyl is killing our constituents everywhere in America.   We know that the chemicals to develop these drugs originate in China.  They are shipped to Mexico and flood our country.   We know that social platforms are capable of changing their  algorithms to cut dealers' access to buyers, and we know that fentanyl  test strips save lives but remain illegal in too many States.   Mr. Speaker, we can address these challenges. It is how we ensure  that our kids, other kids like Eli, aren't lost and don't miss the  opportunity to celebrate their 21st birthday.                            ____________________
