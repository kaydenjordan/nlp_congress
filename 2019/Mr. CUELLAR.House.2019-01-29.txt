 Mr. Speaker, I live on the border, and we have to  understand that, every day, there is about $1.3 billion of trade  between the U.S. and Mexico. That is a lot of jobs that are being  created on this side.   When you look at the Mexicans who come over and shop, one out of  every four international tourists will be people from across the river.  That is over $20 billion that is spent on the U.S. side in hotels,  restaurants, and many other places. Those are jobs over here.   We want to see strong border security, but, again, we have to make  sure that we find the balance between legitimate trade and tourism. The  way to do that is to look at technology that has worked for the  military that can work for us on the border and hire the right number  of Border Patrol and CBP officers. If we do that, we can find a way to  find the balance between legitimate trade and tourism, and I ask you to  please consider that as we debate border security.                            ____________________
