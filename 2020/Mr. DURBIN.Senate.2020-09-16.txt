I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I am going to make a unanimous consent  request in a moment, but I would like to preface it by saying what it  is about so that as we explain it after the unanimous consent request  is objected to, it will be clearer.   In the nation of Venezuela, there exists today an incredible  political situation. I have been there to see it. There is a dictator  in charge, and life on the street is deadly--so deadly that millions of  Venezuelans are fleeing the country as fast as possible.   There is a limitation on food and medicine. There is so much  suffering and starvation and deprivation that these people have given  up everything, and they are just leaving. The United States knows that  this is under the leader, Maduro. It reached a point where it is  physically dangerous--so much so that we have a warning to American  travelers not to go to Venezuela, to stay away because it is too  dangerous.   Yet thousands of Venezuelans now in the United States are facing the  threat of being forced return to this deadly, dangerous situation. The  same State Department that warns Americans not to travel to Venezuela  is now trying to force those Venezuelans who are here as students and  others to go back to this deadly situation.   Senator Menendez and I and others think it just makes sense for us to  give these people a shelter until it is safe for them to return to  their home. That is what this request is about.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration  of H.R. 549 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;  further, that the bill be considered read a third time passed and the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I know the Senator from South Dakota is  making the objection on behalf of Senator Lee, and I have been called  to do the same thing from time to time. I won't assign any political  blame to him, but I will say this is a serious mistake and deadly  mistake for these Venezuelans.   This is an issue which in many parts of America is red hot. Those of  Venezuelan ancestry or those who are here in a temporary status cannot  understand what just happened. They want to stay here safely. They  don't want to be forced to return to this nation that is such a  dangerous place under this dictator.   A number of times in the last year, Senator Menendez, who is on the  floor with me here, has joined with me on behalf of the Venezuelan  people. President Trump boasts that he supports these people.   The idea is simple: While the country remains a dictatorial  nightmare, grant Venezuelans in the United States temporary protected  status or TPS. It is the kind of commonsense move a self-confident  nation and one that really cares about humanity would do to demonstrate  real leadership and accept.   TPS is a temporary immigration status provided to foreign nationals  if returning to their country poses a serious threat to their safety  for any variety of reasons--natural disaster, environmental disaster,  extraordinary conditions, armed conflicts. Certainly by every objective  measure, the situation in Venezuela today is deadly and dangerous. It  is not a permanent immigration status we are seeking for these  Venezuelans, just a measure of American decency and solidarity with  those who might be in the United States when a calamity occurs in their  home country. Prior administrations of both political parties have  granted it for people from countries facing these circumstances.   The situation in Venezuela is dire. Currently, the United States is  working with regional partners to foster an end to the disastrous  dictatorship clinging to power in Venezuela.   I was there before the sham 2018 election. What I saw was  heartbreaking--people starving and fainting at work from malnutrition;  hospitals without power or basic medicines. I visited a Catholic  children's hospital in Caracas. They told me they didn't have the  basics to treat these children. Antibiotics and cancer drugs were  unavailable.   Millions were fleeing this country and still are, as refugees into  neighboring countries. There is brutal political repression. If you  disagree with Maduro publicly, be prepared to go to prison. There is  staggering government corruption and dismantling of the government's  democracy. Now, the tragic impacts of coronavirus have made the  situation worse as well.   I supported this administration's efforts to work with other nations  to support the interim Presidency of Juan Guaido. I had a chance to  speak with President Guaido on the phone yesterday. I am deeply moved  by his courage and concern for the Venezuelan people amid the  suffering. Think about what he is up against. Here is a man who at any  moment could face imprisonment or worse.   It is remarkable that more than 2 years after an internationally  discredited Presidential election, Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro  is now planning another illegitimate election instead of finally  holding a fair, credible Presidential contest.   I asked President Guaido: Are there going to be any international  observers of this international election coming up this December?   Oh, yes.   I said: Who?   He said: The Russians.   I said: What a coincidence. They are observing our election too.   Venezuela has tragically fallen from President Trump's attention. One  simple step he could take is grant TPS to Venezuelans here in the  United States. He repeatedly refuses. There are travel warnings to  Americans telling people not to go close to Venezuela, but for the  Venezuelans here on visa or TPS status: You have to go home. The  President has refused, I suspect, because the depth of his anti- immigrant cruelty really has no limits.   Despite the chest-thumping to audiences in Florida about taking on  Venezuelan dictators, President Trump has, in fact, turned his back on  the Venezuelans in the United States who truly need his protection.  Nobody should be surprised, as former National Security Advisor John  Bolton wrote in his book, that the President praised Maduro as  ``smart'' and ``tough'' and waffled on any kind of coherent policy in  the region and told Bolton not to get too deeply involved. President  Trump can't have it both ways.   I have met many Venezuelans in my home State of Illinois. I can tell  you that they are desperately worried about being forced to return to  the chaos, violence, and hopelessness of the current Venezuela   The Trump administration's travel advisory says it all:         Do not travel due to COVID-19, crime, civil unrest, poor       health infrastructure, kidnapping, arbitrary arrest and       detention of U.S. citizens . . . . Violent crime, such as       homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, is       common.    Yet the Republicans come to the floor and object to our efforts to  protect the Venezuelans who are doing  [[Page S5635]]  their best to avoid what I just read as a warning to American  travelers.   Just today, U.N. investigators released findings saying that under  Maduro, Venezuela has ``committed egregious violations'' amounting to  crimes against humanity. How can this President and the State  Department possibly force people to return to Venezuela under these  conditions? And now, with Maduro detaining returning refugees and  calling them ``bioterrorists,'' the idea of going back is even more  dangerous.   Since the White House wouldn't act more than a year ago, the House,  under Democratic control, passed a bipartisan bill granting TPS to  Venezuelans by a margin of 272 to 158. Senator Menendez, Senator Rubio,  and I introduced a similar Senate bill, but the majority leader, Mitch  McConnell, still refuses to bring up any bill that just might not  please President Trump--even ones that supposedly he is publicly  supporting.   Senator Menendez and I have tried to call up the House bill for  passage, only to face objections, just as we did today, from Senate  Republicans who refuse to stand up to this President's failure on this  and so many other foreign policies.   When we brought this up last July, Senate Republicans objected  because they said they wanted to debate it in the Judiciary Committee.  Well, 12 months passed with plenty of opportunities. Our Venezuelan TPS  bill was referred to the committee in February of 2019. Yet there has  been no action, no hearing, no markup. The Immigration Subcommittee is  not overloaded with work. Under Chairman Cornyn, we have had exactly  one subcommittee meeting in the past 1\1/2\ years. It hasn't held a  single hearing this year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee hasn't  considered a single immigration bill.   This administration could grant TPS without congressional action, but  it refuses. Senate Republicans could pass the bipartisan House bill to  grant Venezuelans TPS, but they refuse as well. Let it be clear that  the real failure to help Venezuelans in the United States rests on  their shoulders--the President and the Republican majority in the  Senate.   The Venezuelan policy, like so many others with this administration  and the Senate, is only there to serve President Trump and no one else.   I made my offer in the hope that we could bring this matter to the  floor. I am sorry it met an objection. I thank my colleagues for  joining me on this effort.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, it has been exactly 90 days since the  Supreme Court rejected President Trump's effort to end deportation  protection for Dreamers. Dreamers, of course, are young immigrants who  came to the United States as children, toddlers, or infants and who  grew up in this country believing they were part of America, only to  learn when they were old enough to be told, as teenagers, that they  were undocumented through no fault of their own.   In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court held  that the President's attempt to rescind the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, was ``arbitrary and capricious.''   It was 10 years ago that I joined with then-Republican Senator Dick  Lugar, of Indiana, on a bipartisan basis, to call on President Obama to  use his legal authority to protect Dreamers from deportation. President  Obama heard our call. He responded by creating the DACA Program. DACA  provides temporary protection to Dreamers from deportation on a 2-year  basis, which is renewable if they register with the government, pay a  fee, and pass criminal and national security background checks. More  than 800,000 Dreamers came forward to sign up for DACA.   DACA unleashed their full potential, and they could see there might  be a future. They began to contribute to our country as soldiers,  teachers, and small business owners. More than 200,000 DACA recipients  are essential critical infrastructure workers. That is not my choice of  words. It is the definition of President Trump's Department of Homeland  Security. More than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential critical  infrastructure workers. Among these  [[Page S5639]]  essential workers, 41,700 DACA recipients are in healthcare. They are  doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, and respiratory therapists.   Despite this incredible story of these innocent children coming to  the United States while not having legal status in this country but  having fear of deportation and still being determined to be part of  America's future, as well as the fact that they would serve our country  as essential workers and healthcare workers, on September 5, 2017,  President Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers faced  losing their work permits and being deported to countries they may not  even remember.   The Federal court stepped in and ordered the Trump administration to  continue DACA for Dreamers who had already received this protection.  However, Dreamers who had not already received DACA were blocked from  applying from this protection for nearly 3 years while the case  languished in court. The Center for American Progress estimates that  approximately 300,000 Dreamers had been unable to apply for the program  because the case was in court.   On June 19, the day after the Supreme Court rejected President  Trump's repeal of DACA, I led a letter from 43 Democratic Senators to  the President. We called on the President to follow the law, to  immediately comply with the Supreme Court's decision and reopen DACA  for those who were eligible to apply. It has been 3 months now. We  haven't received any response from President Trump, and the Trump  administration refuses to reopen DACA.   In July, a Federal judge issued an order for the Trump administration  to begin receiving new applications for DACA. Instead, Acting--and let  me underline ``Acting''--Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad  Wolf has issued a memo saying that the DHS will ``reject all initial  requests for DACA.''   Let's be clear. The Supreme Court of the United States rejected  President Trump's repeal of DACA. That means DACA returns to its  original status, and the Trump administration, under Court order, must  reopen the program, and it must do it now. Instead, Mr. Wolf is saying  the DHS will turn away 300,000 applicants who are Dreamers who are  eligible for DACA but who have not had a chance to apply.   It is important to note that the nonpartisan Government  Accountability Office has concluded that Acting Secretary Wolf is  illegally serving. This calls into serious question any legal authority  he claims in issuing a memo to refuse to reopen DACA.   This administration, which is telling America it is dedicated to law  and order, is in open defiance of the Supreme Court. The stakes are  high both for the rule of law and, just as importantly, for the lives  of Dreamers. To ignore this is to ignore a legitimate order of the  highest Court in the land. Republicans and Democrats in Congress should  come together to compel this President to follow the law and  immediately comply with the Supreme Court's mandate.   On June 4 of last year, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6,  the American Dream and Promise Act. This legislation would give  Dreamers a path to citizenship--my goal for years. It passed on a  strong bipartisan vote. It has been pending in the Senate, sitting on  the desk of Republican leader Mitch McConnell, for more than 12 months.   After the Supreme Court decision, I sent a letter, signed by all 47  Democrats, calling on Senator McConnell to immediately give us a vote  on the Dream and Promise Act. It has been 3 months. Still no reply.   The Dream and Promise Act would also provide a path to citizenship  for 400,000 immigrants who have been living in the United States on  temporary protected status. More than 90 percent of them are originally  from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. Most of them have lived in the  United States for over 20 years.   As with DACA, TPS recipients must register with the government, pay a  fee, and clear criminal and national security background checks. Like  DACA recipients, TPS recipients are making important contributions to  America. More than 130,000 TPS holders are essential critical  infrastructure workers, and 11,600 are healthcare workers.   My friend, the Senator from Arkansas, just came to the floor and  lauded our healthcare heroes across America in the midst of this  pandemic. I have given that same speech. I think we all have, and we  mean it. Yet did you ever stop and think how many of those healthcare  workers are the DACA recipients, Dreamers, TPS holders--the so-called  immigrants--whom we want to reject and remove from this country? We  praise them on one hand, and we tell them to get the heck out of the  United States on the other. How can that be consistent?   Two years ago, I negotiated bipartisan legislation with a path to  citizenship for DACA and TPS recipients. President Trump profanely  dismissed our bill in an Oval Office meeting that has now become  infamous. Instead, the President is trying to rescind TPS protections  and deport hundreds of thousands of immigrants from our country.   A Federal judge concluded that the President broke the law and  blocked his effort to end TPS. Earlier this week, in a divided  decision, two Republican-appointed judges ruled the other way and  lifted the injunctions. This decision makes it even more important that  the Senate immediately consider the Dream and Promise Act.   Over the years since I introduced the DREAM Act, I decided the only  way to tell the story of this bill was to tell the story of the  Dreamers. I have come to the floor 125 times to tell the stories. Today  will be the 126th. I want to tell you the story of these two people. I  will start with Esmeralda Tovar-Mora. In this photo, she is with her  husband, whom I will talk about more in just a moment.    Esmerelda is the 126th Dreamer's story I have told in the Senate, and  it is a good one. She came to the United States from Mexico at the age  of 2, so she obviously had no voice in that decision. She grew up in  Hutchinson, KS.   She sent me a letter, and here is what she said about growing up:         Growing up in the United States has been the only thing       that I've known. Pledging allegiance to the American flag and       singing the national anthem on a daily basis made me believe       that I was truly American.    She was a good student--no, she was excellent. In high school, she  was a member of the National Honor Society and president of the Key  Club. She sang in her church choir and played on the tennis team. She  graduated magna cum laude.   Esmerelda's experiences in the Key Club visiting nursing homes  convinced her she wanted a career in healthcare.   Thanks to DACA--thanks to DACA--Esmerelda was able to work as a  waitress to support herself through college. She is now a case manager  at a mental health center and a medication aide in an Alzheimer's ward  in Hutchinson, KS.   She is married to Michael Mora, seen in this picture. Specialist Mora  serves in the Kansas National Guard and recently returned from a 9- month tour in the Middle East--National Guardsman, 9 months in the  Middle East--serving a country that will not recognize his wife as a  citizen.   Let me introduce you to someone else. This is special. This beautiful  little girl is Esmerelda and Michael's daughter Rose. She just turned  4.   Esmerelda is on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, and here  is what she said:         We've been on lockdown since March 30. Since family members       can't visit, my patients are scared and lonely. Many have       started asking me to call them Grandma or Grandpa, a little       crumb of comfort at a time when the world around them is       going crazy. I'm happy to be their adopted granddaughter. It       eases the pain of scrubbing my hands until they're raw and       the anxiety that I could infect my beautiful family. It also       makes me happy to know that I am appreciated here in       Hutchinson, because right now I've got an added stress: The       U.S. government wants to deport me.    I want to thank Esmerelda for her service. She is truly a health  hero--an immigrant health hero. She is a DACA health hero. She is  putting herself and her family at risk every day to protect others-- Americans--loving members of families, and it may be their last day on  Earth. She should not also have to worry about whether she is going to  be deported and her family torn apart. Isn't it enough that her husband  is serving our country to prove how much this family loves America?   Would we be stronger as a country if we tell Esmerelda Tovar-Mora to  leave  [[Page S5640]]  or if she becomes an American citizen and continues to work on the  frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic? I don't think the answer is even  hard. I think it is clear.   Esmerelda and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers and TPS holders  are counting on those of us in the Senate to solve this crisis that  President Trump created.   I am sorry that Senate Republicans are ignoring President Trump's  defiance of the Supreme Court and refusing to bring the Dream and  Promise Act to the floor.   As long as I am a U.S. Senator, I will be coming to this floor to  fight for Esmerelda Tovar-Mora and all immigrants. It would be an  American tragedy to deport this brave and talented healthcare worker in  the midst of this pandemic. We must ensure that Esmerelda and hundreds  of others of our essential workforce are not forced to stop working  when we need them more than ever, and we must give them a chance--just  a chance--to earn their way to citizenship.   Mr. President, it has been my honor to represent Esmerelda and the  hundreds of thousands of Dreamers over the years. They have never  disappointed me--never.   Many times we brought to the floor of the Senate the Dream Act, bills  containing the Dream Act. We have managed to pass them a few times but  never at the same time as the House, so they have never become law. So  for decades--literally for decades--these young people have waited for  their chance. They have done everything they can possibly do to prove  they love this country. What will it take to convince my colleagues?  What will it take to convince them that losing this beautiful young  woman, with this pretty little girl, Rose, and telling this man, who  served our country in the Kansas National Guard in a 9-month tour of  duty in the Middle East--what will it take to convince my Senate  colleagues that these are worthy people to become American citizens?   Some of us just lucked out; we were born here. There was never a  moment where we made a decision; we were Americans from the start. But  for others, they have had to prove their way into this country. Hasn't  this wonderful young woman proved her way into America? Hasn't she told  us why she should be given the right to become--a great honor--a  citizen of the United States of America?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this year, Loyola University Chicago  celebrates the 150th anniversary of its founding, which occurred on  September 5, 1870. Loyola Chicago is a world-class institution with a  storied history as a Roman Catholic Jesuit university, a strong track  record of academic excellence, and the proud home of the Loyola  Ramblers.   Loyola University Chicago was founded under the name of St. Ignatius  College by Arnold Damen, S.J., to serve Chicago's Catholic immigrants.  In 1909, the school was granted a new charter by the State of Illinois  and renamed ``Loyola University Chicago''. That same year, the newly- named Loyola Chicago granted its first professional graduate degrees  and organized its first football, basketball, and indoor baseball  teams. Today, Loyola Chicago is the only Jesuit Catholic university in  Illinois.   Throughout its history, Loyola Chicago has upheld its Jesuit values-- being an institution of rigorous liberal arts education and academic  excellence, while also being a place of inclusion and acceptance for  marginalized communities, including immigrants. Loyola Chicago's  Stritch School of Medicine led the country as the first medical school  to accept DACA recipients, many of whom have committed to working in a  medically-underserved community in Illinois after graduation.   In addition, under its previous president, Father Michael Garanzini,  Loyola Chicago created Arrupe College. Arrupe is a 2-year degree  program that brings Loyola Chicago's academic quality together with a  focus on affordability and care for the whole person. Arrupe's low-cost  and wrap-around services--including meals, chilcare, and  transportation--bring a high-quality Loyola Chicago education to low- income and students of color in the Chicagoland area who otherwise may  not have a chance to succeed in college.   Loyola Chicago's focus on service is part of the fabric of the  institution and its community. Loyola Chicago supports more than 300  community partner organizations in Chicago and the Chicagoland suburbs  through student, staff, and faculty service and volunteer work. Loyola  Chicago's impact can be found almost anywhere in the Chicagoland area.   Illinois has been served well and enriched by the many contributions  of Loyola University Chicago. I look forward to the school's many  contributions in the years ahead and several more successful runs at  the NCAA basketball tournament being led by their team chaplain, the  now world famous Jean Dolores Schmidt, known to all as simply Sister  Jean.   I thank Loyola for its many contributions to our State and country.  It is my distinct honor to congratulate President Jo Anne Rooney--the  school's first female president--and the entire Loyola community of  staff, faculty, students, and alumni on your 150th anniversary.                            ____________________
