 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Pete  Frates.   I am reminded of something my minister at Harvard, Peter Gomes, used  to say often: ``The radical news of the Gospel is not that heaven is a  destination of the faithful. The radical news is that God wants us to  flourish in our present lives, our earthly existence, and to do so more  in the future than in the past.''   Mr. Speaker, Pete Frates flourished, and even in his darkest days, he  looked to the future. He was the epitome of strength, leadership, and  courage, both as an athlete and as an advocate.   I have met a lot of inspiring people in this job, but none more so  than Pete. Because of Pete, we will cure ALS.   Mr. Speaker, to Julie, Lucy, John, Nancy, Jennifer, and Andrew, thank  you for sharing him with us.                            ____________________
