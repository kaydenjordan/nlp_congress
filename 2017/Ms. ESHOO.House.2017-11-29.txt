 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, and I urge my  colleagues to defeat the previous question so that the House can vote  on my bipartisan legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act.  This bill codifies the longstanding, bipartisan tradition of Presidents  and Presidential nominees disclosing their tax return information to  the American people.   The Republican majority and the President are currently working in  overdrive to pass a distorted tax bill that will raise the taxes on 82  million middle class families. It takes one's breath away.   I and many others have spoken at length about the harm this bill will  do to the middle class, from targeting the mortgage interest deduction,  to raising the cost of higher education and graduate school for student  loans, to limiting the deductibility of State and local taxes. And, at  a time when our country is recovering from several natural disasters,  including major wildfires in California where 14,000 Californians have  lost their homes, the House-passed bill eliminates the deduction for  personal property losses resulting from natural disasters, which I find  to be especially cruel.   While it is very clear that the Republican tax bill will harm the  middle class, it is less clear how the bill will benefit one taxpayer  in particular, if he pays any taxes: the President of the United States  of America.   Mr. Trump is the wealthiest President in our Nation's history, but he  is also the only President, going back to Gerald Ford and all  Presidents moving forward who voluntarily put out their tax returns--he  is the only one--to refuse to release his tax returns, a lapse in  disclosure that is made all the more troubling given his all-out push  for tax cuts for the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class and  others in our country.                                time  1315    How can Americans have any confidence in what is going on? They are  not fools. They understand that we are swimming around in conflicts of  interest, and nothing is being done about it.   Today, Republicans have an opportunity. And while we cannot know  exactly how the Republican tax bill will benefit the President, until  he releases his tax returns, we can be sure that this tax bill, which  is skewed toward the top 1 percent, will benefit the billionaire  Commander in Chief and his family. What an example for the American  people.    The Republican tax bill cuts the tax rate for so-called  pass-through businesses, which is how many of the Trump family's  businesses are structured, including hotels, golf courses, and real  estate developments. Specifically, the tax rate for passive business  income, which is derived from licensing, royalties, and other  arrangements that the Trump organization specializes in, will be cut  from 39.6 percent to 25 percent in the Republican tax scam bill.   That same bill also repeals the alternative minimum tax, which we  know from Mr. Trump's leaked 2005 tax return forced him to pay an  additional $26 million in taxes that year. Without the AMT, he is  completely off the hook and would, essentially, have a measly 3 percent  effective tax rate: another great example for the American people. It  is no wonder they don't trust Washington, D.C.   Lastly, the Republican tax bill doubles the estate tax exemption to  $22 million, and guess who wins again? Mr. Trump.   Mr. Speaker, only with full disclosure of the President's tax returns  will we know how much he and his family will benefit from this  Republican tax scam. That is why I urge my colleagues to stand up for  transparency, listen to the will of the American people, and vote on  this bipartisan legislation.
