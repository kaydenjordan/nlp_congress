 Mr. President, the Senate recently voted to move forward  on the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, the annual defense  policy bill. The Senate took this procedural step by what is known as a  voice vote, a process that does not record the final vote tally or how  each Senator specifically voted, but a voice vote is not a sign of  unanimous support for a measure, and I am submitting this statement to  mark my opposition to this year's NDAA and to this process.   When the Senate debated and passed this bill for the first time,  earlier this year, I voted no. I said at the time that I could not go  along with a Republican plan to greenlight $740 billion in military  spending while providing almost nothing to help Americans impacted by  this unprecedented global pandemic.   I said that I could not vote for a defense bill with Federal agents  actively occupying Portland and treating peaceful protestors like  foreign enemies. Donald Trump ordered these occupiers into my hometown,  uninvited, to crack down on Oregonians peacefully demanding an end to  systemic racism.   Senator Merkley and I introduced an amendment to the NDAA that would  have required Donald Trump to remove these unwanted forces from our  State. The Senate majority blocked our amendment and told us that we  were making things up while Trump's goons were shooting protestors with  tear gas, rubber bullets, and other crowd control munitions.   I want to be clear that I support plenty of provisions in this NDAA  and wrote or negotiated some of the language to improve the bill, but I  must oppose the NDAA due to its flaws and its timing, in light of the  lack of help for everyday Americans suffering from the economic  downfall brought about by Donald Trump's inept response to a global  pandemic. For this reason, I have no choice but to oppose.                            ____________________
