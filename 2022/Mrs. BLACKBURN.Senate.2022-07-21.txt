 Mr. President, America is facing a perfect storm of  inflation, unsustainable energy costs, and supply chain chaos. Russia  and Iran are circling the wagons.   Joe Biden is still finding new ways to put the American people last.  In fact,  [[Page S3586]]  when it comes to getting gas prices under control, he has chosen to  unleash a China-first policy rather than unleashing the power of  American energy.   I have spent the past 18 months laying out in great detail how Joe  Biden and the Democrats have damaged our credibility and enriched our  adversaries. They undermined our economic recovery. They abandoned the  border. They destroyed American energy independence. The list goes on  and on, unfortunately. It appears that everything they have done makes  life worse for ``we the people.''   Unfortunately, it is emboldening the axis of evil--Russia, China,  Iran, North Korea. Under normal circumstances, Vladimir Putin's trip to  Iran this week would be a cause for concern, but with the Biden  administration in charge, it appears it could be just the tip of the  iceberg because although Russia and Iran are competitors, especially in  the energy sector, they are absolutely united in their hatred of the  United States and in their desire to undermine Western interests.   When they look at the United States, they see a country whose  President got a head start undermining those interests on day 1 of his  administration, and you better believe they are ready to take advantage  of this. They are ready for it. This week, look at what they have done.  You had Gazprom, which is the Russian energy giant, and the National  Iranian Oil Company come together and announce a $40 billion agreement  to work together on oil and gas development and pipeline construction.  They are reading the writing on the wall, and what they see is  hesitation from the U.S. President to move us back to energy  independence, where we were on day 1 of his administration, so they are  making plans as to how they will work together and dominate the energy  sector.   Meanwhile, Joe Biden has also sold about a million barrels of oil  from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the Chinese Communist Party.  When I have spoken with Tennesseans about this, they are furious. They  cannot understand why he would make a choice to do this. The left has  done their best to provide cover for the President, claiming that a  million barrels is really nothing to worry about, but you know it is  something to worry about. Our SPR has about 750 million barrels in it.  We are drawing it down at about a million barrels a day. Plus, the  President is now selling to our adversaries--selling it.   We did a little bit of research into what China can get out of a  barrel of oil, and here is what we found: That gives you 20 gallons of  gasoline; 12\1/2\ gallons of distillate, which is what we use for  diesel fuel; and about 3\1/2\ gallons of jet fuel. To Tennesseans, this  makes a big difference.   I really agree with my fellow Tennesseans about this. When they look  at this picture and they think about the President's big sale to Hunter  Biden's friends in Beijing, they don't see a gallon of gas here and  there. What they see is 20 million full tanks of gas. They see diesel  fuel that our farmers need. Right now, with the price of diesel  doubling, we have farmers in Tennessee who cannot get crops planted.  They chose not to plant crops because of the cost of diesel,  fertilizer, chemicals, pesticides. They see sabotage of their hopes and  their dreams and their plans--their plans--for their family, for their  business, for their farm.   As I have been out and about around the State and talked to  Tennesseans, they have a message for this President, this  administration, my Democratic colleagues. This is more than just a  political disagreement. In their minds, and I agree, this is a national  security risk--a national security risk.   We are making ourselves vulnerable. Giving any aid or advantage to  our adversaries is wrong, and this has got to end. Joe Biden and the  Democrats must abandon this China-first energy policy and return to an  America-first policy.   Restart the Keystone Pipeline. Approve more energy infrastructure.  Hold more lease sales. Approve drilling permits that are waiting for  approval.   Let's get the regulators out of the way. Stall some of these 42  regulations that the President has put on the oil and energy sector  this year. Let's do this. Let's advantage ourselves with American  energy before it is too late.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in its mission statement, the National  Medal of Honor Heritage Center in Chattanooga, TN, highlights the  values of patriotism, citizenship, courage, integrity, sacrifice, and  commitment as central to the character of every Medal of Honor  recipient. When put into action, these values culminate in uncommon  acts of heroism.   Today, I have the privilege of recognizing two heroes whose valor on  the battlefield earned them the Medal of Honor and the admiration of  their countrymen: Charles H. Coolidge of Tennessee and Hershel W.  ``Woody'' Williams of West Virginia. We lost Charles last year and  Woody just a few weeks ago, but their legacies remain a celebration of  the sacrifice, resilience, and service of the 16 million men and women  who served in the Armed Forces during World War II and saved the world  from the horrors of authoritarianism. The Senate came together and  rallied around one final tribute to the era's Medal of Honor  recipients, and on July 14, Woody Williams became just the seventh  American to lay in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. It was a  lovely, fitting way to show our gratitude not only to Woody, but to all  the World War II Medal of Honor recipients we lost before him.   I can think of no better way to keep this spirit of camaraderie alive  than to put their legacies to work on behalf of younger generations who  are just beginning to understand that the preservation of freedom for  all humanity will require much more than bold words.   Liberty is not an act of sheer will, but a reflection within a people  of the same values that prompted Charles and Woody to put themselves  between their brothers in arms and enemy troops. On behalf of all  Tennesseans, I thank these brave men for their commitment to the common  cause of freedom and pray that all our Nation's leaders will endeavor  to follow in their footsteps.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following interns from my office be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress: Isabella Andrews-Zachry and Eliza Roddy.
