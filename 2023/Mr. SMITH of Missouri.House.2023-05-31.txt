 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 456,  I call up the bill (H.R. 3746) to provide for a responsible increase to  the debt ceiling, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this debate was a long time coming, not because it is  complicated, but because Democrats couldn't accept the solution.   We are here at the eleventh hour, finally dealing with a debt limit  on a bipartisan basis, because President Biden apparently needed 100  days to pick up the phone to talk to Republicans.   During those 100 days, the case for cutting spending as part of a  debt ceiling increase has only grown stronger. We have seen the worst  inflation crisis in a generation--the direct result of reckless  spending--continue to rob the pocketbooks of working families. We have  seen interest rates continue to rise, driving up the cost of purchasing  a car, a home, or a small business loan.   Interest payments on our national debt are $110 billion higher over  the first 7 months of this fiscal year than they were over the same  time last fiscal year. In other words, runaway spending is adding to  our debt crisis on the front end and the back end.   Something else occurred during those 100 days. House Republicans took  action. While the White House was saying they would only accept a blank  check debt ceiling increase, an idea that did not and does not have the  votes even in a Senate controlled by the President's own party, House  Republicans passed a responsible plan to address the debt ceiling while  cutting spending and supporting American workers.   We acted on behalf of working families who are tired of paying more  to put gas in their cars, clothes on their backs, and food on their  tables.   We acted on behalf of the small business owners who are desperate to  remove the ``help wanted'' signs in their storefront windows.   We acted on behalf of the families trapped on government assistance  to help provide them with a path to a more prosperous future.   One has to wonder, what was President Biden waiting for? A massive  slowdown in the economy? We got that, too. In the first quarter of this  year, economic growth slowed significantly to just over 1 percent.   However, these data points do not tell the full story. To get that,  Mr. Speaker, you have to go into the communities across this country  and listen to those on the front lines of the economy.   At the Ways and Means Committee, we have done just that. From West  Virginia to Oklahoma, Georgia to New York, we have listened to American  workers, families, farmers, and small business owners who have shared  their concerns and their solutions.   At the heart of so much of what we have heard is the simple message:  Stop spending money we do not have on policies that do not work.   According to a recent survey, 60 percent of the American people say  that an increase in the Nation's debt limit ought to be accompanied by  a reduction in the Nation's spending.   The Fiscal Responsibility Act is a step in responding to that  request. It does much of what Republicans said we would do: put a check  on Washington spending, claw back the pandemic-era funding that  everyone should agree is no longer needed, take a bite out of the IRS'  recent $80 billion pay raise, severely dampen the regulatory  administrative state, and lift more Americans out of poverty through  commonsense work requirements for those who can work.   Does this bill do everything folks might want? No. However, I am  reminded of a quote by Thomas Jefferson, where he said, in part: ``The  ground of liberty is to be gained by inches. We must be contented to  secure what we can get from time to time and eternally press forward  for what is yet to get.''   This bill keeps alive the precedent that was set decades ago that has  been  [[Page H2693]]  upheld by Republicans and Democrats alike--even by President Biden when  he was a Senator and when he was Vice President. That is, when it comes  to addressing the Nation's debt limit, Congress and the White House  need to come to the table to also help address the Nation's debt  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), who spent hours, days, and  weeks in the negotiation process to help get us where we are today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who has worked for days and  weeks to get us to where we are today.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy). He has worked numerous hours, days--in  fact, he has been working since January--to get to where we are today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, Democrats often say that the new  IRS funding will only be used to go after the wealthy. This is simply  not the case.   I include in the Record a CBO blog post from 2021 examining the Biden  administration's $80 billion proposal and stating that it would return  the audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago, and that that rate  would rise for all taxpayers. Our calculations show that this would  mean 600,000 more audits per year for taxpayers making less than  $75,000 a year.                       [From CBO Blog, Sept. 2, 2021]                The Effects of Increased Funding for the IRS                             (By Phill Swagel)         Last month, the Congressional Budget Office published An       Analysis of Certain Proposals in the President's 2022 Budget.       Since then, CBO has completed its analysis of another       proposal in the President's budget, an increase in spending       for the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) enforcement       activities. CBO estimates that portions of the       Administration's proposal to increase funding for the IRS by       $80 billion over the 2022-2031 period would increase revenues       by approximately $200 billion over those 10 years. That       estimate does not include changes in revenues resulting from       portions of the proposal that involve new information-      reporting requirements and other changes to the tax code;       those changes are estimated by the staff of the Joint       Committee on Taxation (JCT).                                 The Proposal         The Administration proposes funding for the IRS that is $80       billion greater over 10 years than the amounts in CBO's July       2021 baseline projections (which reflect the assumption that       current laws generally do not change). Two types of funding       would be provided: discretionary appropriations, which would       mainly be used for enforcement activities; and mandatory       funding, which would be used for a variety of activities (not       only enforcement but also operations support, business-      systems modernization, and taxpayer services).        Spending would increase in each year between 2021 and 2031,       though the highest growth would occur in the first few years.       By 2031, CBO projects, the proposal would make the IRS's       budget more than 90 percent larger than it is in CBO's July       2021 baseline projections and would more than double the       IRS's staffing. Of the $80 billion, CBO estimates, about $60       billion would be for enforcement and related operations       support.        The Administration also proposes that financial       institutions increase their reporting about account inflows       and outflows. Part of the increased funding would support the       implementation of a new information-reporting system to be       used by those institutions. The resulting effects on revenues       are estimated by JCT and are not included in CBO's estimate       of an approximately $200 billion increase.      How CBO Estimates the Effect on Revenues of Increased IRS Funding         CBO's estimate of revenues is based on the IRS's projected       returns on investment (ROIs) for spending on new enforcement       initiatives. The IRS estimates those ROIs by calculating the       expected revenues that would be raised from taxes, interest,       and penalties as a result of the new initiatives and dividing       them by their additional cost. (The agency has provided ROIs       over the past five years as part of its budget       justification.) The IRS's ROIs ramp up over three years as       staff become trained and fully productive, arrive at the peak       level, and then stay there. In recent years, peak ROIs have       ranged from 5 to 9. That is, a $1 increase in spending on the       IRS's enforcement activities results in $5 to $9 of increased       revenues.        CBO adjusts the ROIs so that they better reflect the       marginal return on additional spending. First, CBO expects       the IRS to prioritize the enforcement activities that it       thinks will have the highest average return; additional       enforcement spending would therefore have lower returns than       previous spending. Second, CBO expects taxpayers to adapt to       the IRS's enforcement activities and adopt new ways of       evading detection, so an enforcement activity may have a       lower return in later years. Finally, the productivity of the       IRS's enforcement activities will also depend on the IRS's       other capabilities. For example, modernized information       technology that stored all of a taxpayer's information in       digital form could increase the productivity of examiners       (the employees who detect taxpayers' noncompliance).        CBO's estimate of revenues also accounts for the timing of       collections resulting from enforcement activity by new hires.       Taxes are assessed at the end of an audit; if taxpayers       disagree with the assessment, they can appeal and continue to       litigate. The length of each step depends on the complexity       of the case. CBO estimates that an audit of medium complexity       would take 24 months to complete. That time, combined with       the expected training time for an experienced new hire,       suggests that the IRS would begin to collect revenues 30       months after the new hire joined the agency. (The timing       would be longer when cases were more complex or when the       taxpayer did not agree to the assessment and appealed.)        What is Incorporated Into CBO's Estimate. CBO's estimate of       the change in revenues is relative to the amount of revenues       collected under current law (which is reflected in CBO's       baseline budget projections). Under guidelines agreed to by       the legislative and executive branches, this change in       revenues typically would not be included in a cost       estimate for legislation that brought about the change,       but it would be reflected in CBO's baseline budget       projections once the legislation was enacted.        CBO's estimate reflects the assumption that the proposed       increase in funding would follow the proposed expansion of       information reporting. Expanded information reporting might       allow the IRS to better target potentially noncompliant       taxpayers; it might also prompt taxpayers to file more       accurate tax returns. It might have a positive effect on       revenues collected, but it might also reduce the ROIs from       enforcement activities, because if returns are more accurate,       there will be less noncompliance to audit. In CBO's and JCT's       judgment, those effects roughly offset each other, on net,       resulting in a small positive effect on ROIs.        CBO's estimate includes ``direct revenues'' and ``protected       revenues.'' Direct revenues are generated from the IRS's       auditing and collection efforts. Protected revenues result       when the IRS prevents a taxpayer from recouping previously       assessed and paid taxes--for example, when the IRS prevents       fraudulent refunds or disallows claims in taxpayers' amended       returns.        The estimate reflects CBO's expectation that the increased       enforcement activities would change the voluntary compliance       rate--that is, the share of taxes owed that are paid       voluntarily and on time--only modestly. The magnitude of that       effect is highly uncertain, however, and the empirical       evidence about the effects of audits on taxpayers' behavior       is inconclusive. Research about such deterrence finds varying       responses, depending on the type of taxpayer. People       generally increase their reported income in the years       following an audit, but people with higher income generally       do not, and neither do corporations. (For more discussion,       see Box 1 in CBO's July 2020 report Trends in the Internal       Revenue Service's Funding and Enforcement.)        How the Current Analysis Differs From Previous Analyses. In       that July 2020 report, CBO estimated that a $40 billion       increase in enforcement funding would raise $103 billion (for       a net effect of $63 billion). The methods used for this       estimate differ in several ways from the methods used for       that one.        First, CBO used updated ROIs that incorporated the IRS's       most recent estimates of the return on enforcement       activities. CBO then adjusted the ROIs to reflect both direct       revenues and protected revenues, increasing the peak ROI from       6.4 to 7.1.        Second, CBO's current methods allow for positive       interaction between enforcement spending and other IRS       funding. That is, CBO accounts for ways in which increased       capabilities, such as more digitization of taxpayers'       information and greater visibility of income flows, can       increase the productivity of enforcement activities.        Third, this analysis reflects a longer time frame for       receiving enforcement revenues because of the complexity of       audits associated with high-wealth individuals, large       corporations, and partnerships. Taxpayers with greater       resources may be more likely to appeal assessments or to       litigate their disputes in the U.S. Tax Court, delaying the       receipt of assessed taxes. As a result, revenues from some       audits will not be received until later than CBO estimated in       its July 2020 analysis.        Sources of Uncertainty. The change in revenues resulting       from an increase in the IRS's funding could be different from       CBO's estimate. It depends on the IRS's ability to hire       experienced candidates, changes in voluntary compliance, and       the interaction of enforcement funding with the IRS's other       capabilities.        The IRS intends to hire mid- and senior-level people with       private-sector experience who will not require a great deal       of training to become productive. But it might not be able to       hire its desired mix of candidates. If it hired less       experienced candidates, it would have to spend more resources       training them. Not only would they take longer to become       productive, but current staff members would have to devote       more time to training them. A related source of uncertainty       in CBO's estimate is attrition: if it proved higher than       expected, personnel would have fewer years at full       productivity.        An increase in the IRS's funding could signal that the       agency was more capable of detecting noncompliance, thus       increasing voluntary compliance and revenues. However, if       there were fewer noncompliant taxpayers to audit, the ROIs       from the IRS's enforcement activities would drop, and the       direct revenues from increased enforcement would be lower       than CBO estimated.        Finally, it is unclear how much the greater information       reporting or the increased IRS spending in areas other than       enforcement (such as technology) could improve examiners'       productivity. Greater nonenforcement spending might increase       overall revenues but decrease ROIs--for example, if improved       services for taxpayers enabled those taxpayers to more       accurately determine their  [[Page H2700]]       tax liability, reducing the pool of noncompliant taxpayers to       audit.                             Effects on Taxpayers         The proposed increase in spending on the IRS's enforcement       activities would result in higher audit rates than those       underlying CBO's baseline budget projections. Between 2010       and 2018, the audit rate for higher-income taxpayers fell,       while the audit rate for lower-income taxpayers remained       fairly stable. In CBO's baseline projections, the overall       audit rate declines, resulting in lower audit rates for both       higher-income and lower-income taxpayers. The proposal, by       contrast, would return audit rates to the levels of about 10       years ago; the rate would rise for all taxpayers, but higher-      income taxpayers would face the largest increase. In       addition, the Administration's policies would focus       additional IRS resources on enforcement activity aimed at       high-wealth taxpayers, large corporations, and partnerships.       CBO estimates that if the proposals were enacted, tax       compliance would be improved, and more households would meet       their obligation under the law.        Higher audit rates would probably also result in some       audits of taxpayers who would later be determined not to owe       additional taxes. However, the Administration's proposal for       more information reporting, as well as additional spending on       IRS technology, might reduce the burden on compliant       taxpayers by allowing the IRS to better target noncompliant       ones and to reduce the number of audits that resulted in no       change in tax assessment.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that  because of the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the bottom 20 percent  of earners saw their average Federal tax rate fall to its lowest level  in 40 years. Low- and middle-income families of four saved at least  $2,000 on their tax bill each year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, we hear the other side of the aisle over and over talk  about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Let me tell you about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr. Speaker. Last  year, we had record revenue into the United States of $4.9 trillion,  which was $900-plus billion more than what the Joint Committee on  Taxation and the CBO predicted would happen upon passage of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered for a family of four who makes  less than $60,000 a year. They paid zero in Federal taxes.   Mr. Speaker, let's talk about tax cuts. The other side passed  something called the Inflation Reduction Act, and it was tax cuts for  their wealthy donors. In fact, the CBO just came out with a new score  saying that it cost over $700 billion.   Guess what? Ninety percent of your tax credits go to corporations  with more than $1 billion in revenues, and $125 billion goes to China.  That is what your tax cuts did.   After years of Washington running in the wrong direction, we have an  opportunity to take meaningful steps in the right direction on  addressing America's debt crisis.   The American people deserve nothing less. They see what inflation,  caused by reckless spending of the Democratic Party, has done to their  family budgets, to their retirement security, and to their small  business plan.  [[Page H2704]]    We have the opportunity to end the constant doling out of tax dollars  under the guise of COVID relief.   We have the opportunity to downsize the $80 billion pay raise that  was given to the IRS last year. The IRS does not need a raise. It needs  a reckoning.   We have the opportunity to support those who can work to find work  and climb out of poverty.   We have the opportunity to put some guardrails on the administration,  so if they are going to spend tax dollars by executive fiat, then they  have to find savings somewhere else.   We have the opportunity and the responsibility to address our debt  crisis as we address the debt ceiling.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
