 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to remind my colleague that her vote today to repeal the  Affordable Care Act will result in 266,000 people from her State of  Tennessee losing their healthcare coverage, 57,000 workers losing their  jobs, and an economic loss of $34.2 billion in gross State product for  the State of Tennessee over 5 years.   The so-called budget before us was drafted by Republicans for the  sole purpose of repealing the Affordable Care Act and defunding Planned  Parenthood by a simple majority in the Senate. It squanders the  opportunity to start this new Congress working together to address the  concerns and priorities of the American people in a constructive and  bipartisan manner.   The Affordable Care Act is making an incredible difference across my  home State of Kentucky, as in many other places. With our expansion of  Medicaid and the success of our State marketplace, Kynect, more than  half a million Kentuckians in a State of 4 million have gained quality,  affordable coverage. In Louisville alone, the uninsured rate dropped 81  percent.   In a State with tremendous health needs, we are a national model of  ACA success. Even our Republican Senator, Rand Paul, and our Republican  Governor, Matt Bevin, who are vehemently opposed to the law, know we  can't go back to where we were before the ACA. They now acknowledge  that Republicans in Congress should not repeal the Affordable Care Act  without immediately replacing it.   Much of the debate about the ACA focuses on the 20 million newly  insured individuals, but the law has done much more than that. Millions  of seniors on Medicare have saved on prescription drug coverage. For  people on their employer's plan, out-of-pocket costs are capped, and  lifetime limits are gone. If you are one of the 129 million Americans  with a preexisting condition, you currently have the peace of mind of  knowing that you can always get coverage if you lose your job, change  your job, or start your own business.   Let me tell you about Steve Riggert, my constituent who recently  wrote to me. When Steve's daughter Anna was 12, she was diagnosed with  chronic pancreatitis, a rare disease for a child. This is Anna. Over  the next 3 years, she was hospitalized 15 times. Despite their best  efforts and prayers, transplant surgery did not achieve success. She  has struggled with diabetes and complications. At age 22, she has been  hospitalized 26 times for various reasons.   From the beginning, Steve knew that Anna's preexisting condition  would make getting medical coverage difficult. So far, he has been able  to cover her medical bills through his employer plan. When the ACA was  passed, he was immensely relieved that Anna could always get coverage  even though she has had a serious preexisting medical condition.   But the Republican plan to repeal the ACA has now left Steve  feeling--and these are his words--helpless, petrified, and, literally,  losing sleep. At age 64 and recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,  he fears for how much he can support her. To quote his letter: ``Repeal  of all aspects of the Affordable Care Act would place everything I have  worked for and those I care about in jeopardy.''   Mr. Chairman, I am here today to fight for Steve, for Anna, and for  all the Americans across the country who are begging you not to take  away their health care. Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a  replacement will cause chaos. Nearly 30 million people would lose  coverage, including more than 4 million kids. Any consumers left in the  individual market are likely to face higher premiums and fewer choices  as insurers exit the system.   It has been nearly 7 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed  into law, and Republicans still do not have a viable plan to replace  it, period. Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers said  this week that the Republican replacement plan will guarantee ``no one  who has coverage today because of ObamaCare will lose that coverage.''   We are waiting for that plan because none of the bills Republicans  will wave from that podium today meet that standard or has the support  of the majority of their Conference. Democrats offered a number of  amendments to this budget to protect the ACA and make it reflect the  priorities of American families. We owe the millions of people who are  deeply concerned about this process nothing less. Unfortunately,  Republicans refuse to allow a vote on a single one.   Putting American families and our Nation's healthcare system at risk  is irresponsible. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the  Republican budget. The American people deserve better. Anna deserves  better. Her father and her family deserve better.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague for the  shout-out to Kentucky. He neglected to mention that our Governor,  Republican Governor, who was elected in 2015 has done virtually  everything he could over the last year to sabotage the Affordable Care  Act, including dismantling our incredibly successful Kynect exchange,  and that is one of the reasons why some of the enrollments declined,  because he has made it harder for people to enroll.   I would remind my friend, also, that his vote today to repeal the  Affordable Care Act will result in 339,000 people from his State of  Indiana losing their healthcare coverage, 55,000 workers losing their  jobs, and an economic loss of $30.4 billion in gross State product over  5 years in Indiana.   I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) for a  unanimous consent request.   (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the Republican  resolution and support the Democratic resolution. We shouldn't deal  with affordable care without a solution. Just don't repeal. Let's see  what the replacement is so we don't, as Kentucky would say, buy a pig  in a poke.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to S. Con. Res. 3, the FY 2017 Budget  Resolution, the next step in the process of repealing essential  coverage and patient protections established by the Affordable Care  Act.   Moving forward with implementing the GOP's devastating ACA repeal  plan will lead to massive losses of coverage and consumer protections  for people enrolled in insurance and in the Medicaid program.   It will hamper the movement towards value-based payment reforms,  burden seniors with higher out-of-pocket costs on their prescription  drugs, and undermine prevention and wellness initiatives.   Repealing the ACA will leave every state with big increases in the  uninsured rate and higher uncompensated care costs, and threatens  coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.   Charging forward without even agreeing on a replacement plan is a  blatant abdication of the responsibilities we have as representatives  of the American people.   The effects of doing so are not abstract. People are going to get  hurt in very real ways.   The American people deserve to know how Republicans plan to avoid the  devastating consequences of ACA repeal, which include millions losing  coverage, chaos in the insurance markets, hospitals and states losing  billions of dollars and a hit to our economy.   In addition, the FY17 Budget Resolution shamelessly prioritizes  politics over patients by proposing to defund Planned Parenthood.   Denying patients the quality care--including breast exams,  contraception, and preventive and primary care services--will only  exacerbate the pain felt from coverage losses for the 2.5 million  patients who depend on Planned Parenthood each year for care.   The Resolution is bad for patients, budgets, and will upend our  health care system.   It fails the test of sensible policymaking.   The lack of any details on the ACA replacement Republicans say they  will enact fails the test of sensible policymaking: having the key  information before voting.   We should be taking steps to amend, not upend, the law.   I urge my colleagues to abandon this collision course and stop  working against the American people.   We should not be ``Making America Sick Again.''    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), a distinguished member of the Committee on  the Budget.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  reckless budget resolution. Congress had an opportunity to start on a  bipartisan note, to work on creating jobs, building an economy that  works for everyone, and investing in our infrastructure. Instead, House  Republicans are ringing in the new year by repealing the Affordable  Care Act, stripping more than 20 million people of their health  insurance. What is worse, there is still no plan for what comes next,  threatening massive disruption to the entire healthcare system.   I offered a number of amendments to this legislation, none of which  were allowed a vote today. My amendments would have stopped this  dangerous process from moving forward if the Republican budget reduces  access to treatment for those suffering from addiction, reduces access  to health care in rural areas, forces seniors to pay more for care, or  privatizes Medicare. I also cosponsored an amendment by Congresswoman  Lee to protect women's access to reproductive health and family  planning services.                                time  1115    Apparently, the majority is not concerned with these issues. Before  the ACA, the situation was unacceptable. It was a time when people went  bankrupt because they got sick, when individuals with preexisting  medical conditions found it virtually impossible to obtain affordable  coverage.   But now, more than 120 million Americans with preexisting conditions  are no longer denied coverage, and young adults can stay on their  parents' plans until they are 26.   Over 10 million seniors have received help with their prescription  drug payments, and all insurance plans are required to cover  preventative services with no copayments.   Rather than focusing on commonsense reforms to strengthen the ACA,  Republicans want to eliminate vital lifesaving policy with no plan for  what comes next. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chairman, I remind my colleague that his vote today  to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 664,000 people from  his State of Ohio losing their healthcare coverage; 126,000 workers  losing their jobs; and an economic loss of $69.5 billion in gross State  product for the State of Ohio. Ohio's Republican Governor is begging us  not to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Chairman, I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Krishnamoorthi), a distinguished member of the Education and the  Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I remind my colleague that his vote today  to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 250,000 people from  his State of Minnesota losing their healthcare coverage; 53,000 workers  losing their jobs; and an economic loss of $32.9 billion in gross State  product over 5 years.   Mr. Chairman, it now gives me great pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), a distinguished member of the  Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to repeal  of the Affordable Care Act.   For 7 years, all we have heard from the Republicans regarding health  care is repeal and replace.   After 7 years and more than 60 votes, they still have not come up  with the replace. This isn't just a talking point. This is literally a  matter of life and death for people.   Raymond, from Napa in my district, was diagnosed with stage III renal  cancer in 1996. His premiums rose year after year until we passed the  ACA.   Before the ACA, Raymond worried about losing his insurance because of  his preexisting condition. In fact, his cancer returned in 2014, but,  thanks to the ACA, he got the treatment he needed.   What are Republicans going to do for Raymond if they repeal the ACA  and his premiums go up, or his insurance drops him because he had  cancer over 20 years ago, or he hits his lifetime cap on coverage?   Republicans need to ask themselves if they are willing to return  Americans like Raymond to a time when the care they needed was always  beyond their grasp.   I am not saying that it is perfect, but we need to keep it. It also  kills 3 million jobs.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 269,000 people  from his State of Louisiana losing their healthcare coverage; 37,000  workers losing their jobs; and an economic loss of $21.5 billion in  gross State product over 5 years for the State of Louisiana.   Mr. Chairman, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I can tell you  who is happy that the budget resolution will likely pass the House  today, Big Pharma. Pharmaceutical companies are once again escaping any  changes to a system which has repeatedly allowed them to prioritize  profits over people and drive increases in out-of-pocket healthcare  costs.   Companies like Mylan, Turing, and Valeant are jacking up lifesaving  drugs like EpiPen for anaphylactic shock; Daraprim for HIV and cancer  patients; and Nitropress for heart failure overnight without any  accountability.   While the American people increasingly can't afford their medicine,  pharmaceutical companies are the wealthiest they have been in years.   In fact, median healthcare and pharmaceutical executive pay is higher  than any other industry in the United States.   And even though taxpayers fund billions of dollars of basic medical  research used to develop groundbreaking drugs, pharmaceutical companies  often charge Americans many times what the rest of the world pays.   Mr. Chair, Americans can't afford to continue giving pharmaceutical  and health insurance executives a pay raise, and many on both sides of  the aisle agree.   Just this week, President-elect Donald Trump added his voice to that  effort saying: pharma was ``getting away  [[Page H494]]  with murder.'' I agree. They are literally getting away with murder.  Because if a mother can't afford her child's EpiPen, or a cancer  patient can't afford treatment, people die.   So I offered an amendment to this budget resolution seeking to lower  prescription drug costs, but Republicans refuse to even allow debate on  my amendment.   Instead of fighting to make sure Americans have access to lifesaving  medications, Republicans are protecting the ability of pharmaceutical  companies to continue to shake down the American people.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and, instead, address  these healthcare costs and access issues that every American knows too  well.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind the gentlewoman that her  vote today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 552,000  people from her State of North Carolina losing their healthcare  coverage, 76,000 workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of  $39.4 billion in gross State product, over 5 years, for North Carolina.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), a distinguished member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind the gentleman that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 211,000 people  from his State of Wisconsin losing their healthcare coverage, 46,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $25.7 billion in  gross State product, over 5 years, for the State of Wisconsin.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the distinguished gentleman.   Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to this reckless, irresponsible,  heartless, and bare bones Republican budget resolution because it does  nothing to provide jobs for the American workers; it does nothing to  invest in the roads, bridges, ports, cyber networks, and other  infrastructure that is needed to sustain economic growth; it explodes  the deficit and enriches those who are already wealthy at the expense  of middle and working class families.   In particular, this foolish rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act  makes plain for all to see that congressional Republicans are far more  interested in scoring political points with their rightwing base than  they are in protecting the health and economic security of American  families.   Thirty million people will lose their insurance; the insurance market  will be in shambles; and families left behind will have higher  premiums. We will close rural hospitals; and hospitals will lose  billions of dollars and might reduce services and cut jobs. The economy  will lose 2.6 million jobs.   Repeal and replace is just a straw man. It is about real lives, like  Pamela Gross', who suffers from chronic lupus and a number of other  autoimmune disorders that have required her to spend upwards of $5,000.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman.   She writes: ``I asked my doctor recently, `With all that's going on,  would I make it without treatment?' The doctor's answer: `No.'''   In her instance, if the Affordable Care Act goes--if is it repealed-- she could completely lose her eligibility for expanded Medicaid and  simply die. A young man in my district would die as well.  [[Page H495]]    This is a bad bill. Vote against it. Save America's good health.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to S. Con. Res. 3, the  Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2017, which more  appropriately should be known as the ``Make America Sick Again''  Budget.   I stand in opposition to this reckless, irresponsible, heartless, and  bare-bones Republican budget resolution because it does nothing to  provide jobs for American workers; does nothing to invest in the roads,  bridges, ports, cybernetworks, and other infrastructure needed to  sustain economic growth; and explodes the deficit and enriches those  who are already wealthy at the expense of middle and working-class  families.   Let us be very clear about the real objective of our Republican  colleagues: their sole purpose in bringing this resolution to the floor  is to pave the way for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the  defunding of Planned Parenthood by a simple majority vote in the  Senate.   This foolish rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act makes plain for  all to see that congressional Republicans are far more interested in  scoring political points with their right-wing base than they are in  protecting the health and economic security of American families.   Mr. Chair, the Affordable Care Act has been an undisputed success,  making access to quality affordable healthcare available to more than  20 million Americans who previously lived with the dreaded fear that an  unexpected injury or illness to them or a family member would go  untreated or could bankrupt their families.   While House Republicans may pine for a return to those bad old days,  the large majority of Americans do not because they understand that  repeal of the Affordable Care Act will have devastating consequences  for working families, women, and the economy.   Mr. Chair, health care experts, governors, and hospitals warn that  repealing the ACA without a comprehensive plan in its place will cause  chaos and catastrophe, including:   1. Nearly 30 million people would lose health care coverage,  including more than 4 million kids;   2. With the individual insurance market in shambles, families  remaining in what's left of it could face higher premiums and fewer  choices as insurers exit;   3. Hospitals would lose billions of dollars and might reduce services  or cut jobs; and rural hospitals would close.   4. The economy would lose 2.6 million jobs in 2019, with the majority  in non-health sectors.   Additionally, eliminating Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood  would severely restrict women's access to comprehensive care such as  contraception, cancer screenings, and STI tests and treatments.   Mr. Chair, Republicans claim they have a replacement plan for the  Affordable Care Act but the truth is they do not have a plan now nor  have they in the past nor will they in the future.   ``Repeal and Replace'' is an empty slogan and is about as serious as  the President-Elect's promise of ``something terrific.''   Republicans have had seven years to produce and coalesce around an  alternative to the ACA, and they totally failed.   The reason for their failure is they are afflicted with Obama  Derangement Syndrome that blinds them to the ACA's substantial and  positive improvements in people's lives.   Without the ACA, insurance companies could continue to make their own  rules, and deny coverage based on a person's health status or job,  offer lousy benefits, and impose annual and lifetime limits.   Without the ACA, seniors would still face the Part D donut hole and  have to pay more for drugs, and parents would not be able to keep their  kids on their plan until age 26.   Without the ACA, 20 million people would not have gained coverage,  and we would not have the lowest uninsured rate on record.   If Republicans really thought they could match this record of  success, they would have unveiled and campaigned on their alternative  plan in the last election or at least reveal it to the American people  right now.   It is immoral to put families, the health care system, or our economy  at risk by repealing the ACA, hurting the economy, ballooning the  deficit, and giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to  corporations and the wealthy.   Mr. Chair, the constituents of the 18th Congressional District of  Texas, which I am privileged to represent, are not buying the `Repeal  and Replace' bill of goods that Republicans are selling because they  know the Affordable Care Act, which they lovingly call ObamaCare, has  brought peace of mind and security where before there was only worry  and fear.   Here are some of the ways the Affordable Care Act has made a positive  difference to the residents of my congressional district:   1. Coverage for the Previously Uninsured.   Up to 193,000 individuals in the district who lack health insurance  will have access to quality, affordable coverage without fear of  discrimination or higher rates because of a preexisting health  condition.   2. Tax Credits to Make Insurance Affordable.   Under the ACA, tax credits are available to assist individuals and  families purchase the private health insurance they need.   The amount of these tax credits range from $630 to $4,480 for  individuals and from $3,550 to $11,430 for a family of four.   This benefits as many as 446,850 constituents in my congressional  district.   3. Extra Benefits for Seniors.   More than 4,100 seniors in my district receive prescription drug  discounts worth an average of $828 per person.   4. Extended Coverage for Young Adults.   11,400 young adults in the district now have health insurance through  their parents' plan.   5. No Exorbitant Out-of-Pocket Expenses, Deductibles or Co-Pays.   121,000 individuals in my district--including 23,000 children and  50,000 women--now have health insurance that covers preventive services  without any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductible.   6. Premium Rebates.   113,000 individuals in my district are saving money due to ACA  provisions that prevent insurance companies from spending more than 20%  of their premiums on profits and administrative overhead.   7. No Discrimination for Pre-Existing Conditions.   In my district, up to 46,000 children with preexisting health  conditions no longer can be denied coverage by health insurers.   8. No Annual or Lifetime Caps on Coverage.   153,000 individuals in my district now have insurance that cannot  place lifetime limits on their coverage and no long face annual limits  on coverage.   It is said often, Mr. Chair, but is no less true, that the federal  budget is more than a financial document; it is an expression of the  nation's most cherished values.   As the late and great former senator and Vice-President Hubert  Humphrey said:         The moral test of government is how that government treats       those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who       are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are       in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.    It is for this reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget  resolution, it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal  responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the budget must also  pass a ``moral test.''   The Republican budget resolution fails both of these standards.   Because the American people deserve to know exactly what ills  Republicans have in store for them, I strongly oppose S. Con. Res. 3  and urge all Members to join me in voting against the reckless, cruel,  and heartless measure that will do nothing to improve the lives or  well-being of middle and working class families.   Pamela Gross dreads repeal of Medicaid expansion. Still, millions of  people like Gross, could face immediate effects. While her disability  allows her access to Medicare coverage, she also relies on Medi-Cal,  California's Medicaid program, to help pay for costs Medicare doesn't.  Gross says she was insured before Obamacare became law. But her Medi- Cal coverage, which she relies on to pay her monthly premiums and co- pays, hung in the balance each year when she received a Supplemental  Security Income cost of living increase. The minor jump in pay  threatened to push her out of eligibility for the program, which would  leave her without the means to pay for a private insurance policy and  the doctor visits and medications she says her life literally depends  on.   ``I asked my doctor recently, with all that's going on would I make  it without treatment?'' The doctor's answer: ``No,'' Gross says.   Because Obamacare expanded eligibility for Medicaid and increased the  program's income limits, Gross no longer has to be concerned each year  that the cost-of-living increase she receives from her SSI income will  throw her out of coverage. That would change if Medicaid expansion is  eliminated as part of the law's repeal.   ``If they repeal I could completely lose eligibility,'' she says. ``I  would die.''    Mr. Chairman, I will remind the gentleman that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 581,000 people  from his State of Georgia losing their healthcare coverage, 71,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $39.4 billion in  gross State product, over 5 years, for the State of Georgia.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result 234,000 people from  his State of Arkansas losing their healthcare coverage, 28,000 workers  losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $15.8 billion in gross State  product over 5 years for the State of Arkansas.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 1.8 million  people from his State of Texas losing their healthcare coverage,  175,000 workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $107 billion  in gross State product over 5 years for the State of Texas.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen), a  distinguished member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.   Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to  this budget resolution that would begin the process of repealing the  Affordable Care Act without a plan to replace it, and I rise on behalf  of my constituents who are imploring Congress to save the Affordable  Care Act.   Luanne from Coupeville, Washington, wrote to me. She said:         As someone with several serious preexisting conditions, I       could not get insurance coverage in the past. My husband and       I spent an incredible amount of money--including retirement       savings and out-of-pocket dollars--for my care and       prescriptions. There were truly times when we had to choose       food over medication.    And without the ACA, Jennifer from Lynnwood told me that her best  friend ``will be forced to work as many jobs as she can in order to  obtain money due to the costs of her pregnancy that will no longer be  covered. . . . . She needs the Affordable Care Act, as do many  Americans. Please, I beg you, do not get rid of it. . . . The  Republicans in Congress do not understand how much of us low-income  Americans need this.''   These are just two of the hundreds of Washingtonians who have  contacted me over the past 2 weeks.   Mr. Chairman, do not take away these lifesaving benefits from Luanne,  Jennifer's friend, and the rest of my constituents.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result 479,000 people from  his State of Pennsylvania losing their healthcare coverage, 173,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $76.5 billion over 5  years in gross State product for the State of Pennsylvania.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 1.6 million  people from his State of Florida losing their healthcare coverage,  181,000 workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $90.4  billion in gross State product over 5 years in Florida.   I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  distinguished Democratic Whip.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my good friend that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 1.8 million  people from his State of Texas losing their healthcare coverage,  175,000 workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $107 billion  in gross State product, over 5 years, in Texas.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor), who is a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I am compelled to come to the  floor this morning to oppose the Republican attempt to pull the rug out  from under American families.   Why are we going to a repeal bill without a replacement?   It is irresponsible. What you are doing is you are throwing American  families into quicksand. Here is a dirty little secret: this is also a  fiscally irresponsible move because this is likely to balloon the debt  and the deficit.   Now, what I hear from my families back home in Florida is that the  Affordable Care Act has been a godsend to them, and that includes the 9  million families that have private health  [[Page H499]]  insurance. The Affordable Care Act has provided vital consumer  protections to prevent them from being discriminated against for a  preexisting condition or being canceled if they do get sick, and it has  kept premium costs in check.   We also have a lot of Floridians who depend on Medicare; and because  of the ACA, Medicare is stronger. In 2015 alone, the average Medicare  recipient has put about $1,000 back into their pocket because the ACA  closes the doughnut hole.   I urge the House to vote ``no.'' Don't throw American families into  chaos and don't wreak havoc on our economy.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 137,000 people  from his State of Kansas losing their healthcare coverage, 19,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $10.5 billion in  gross State product, over 5 years, for Kansas.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), who is a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 618,000 people  from his State of Michigan losing their healthcare coverage, 101,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $54 billion in gross  State product, over 5 years, for Michigan.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Levin), who is a distinguished member and former chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 327,000 people  from his State of Virginia losing their healthcare coverage, 52,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $31 billion over 5  years in gross State product for Virginia.   Mr. Chairman, how much time remains?   The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 14\3/4\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 14\3/4\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 850,000 people  from his State of Illinois losing their healthcare coverage, 114,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $66 billion in gross  State product over 5 years for Illinois.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Neal), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind the Speaker that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 211,000 people  from his State of Wisconsin losing their healthcare coverage, 46,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $25.7 billion in  gross State product over 5 years in Wisconsin.   It gives me great pleasure now to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Democratic leader and  architect of the Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Chairman, I will remind my colleague that his vote  today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 939,000 people  from his State of New York losing their healthcare coverage, 131,000  workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $89.7 billion in  gross State product over 5 years in New York.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the distinguished ranking member of the  Financial Services Committee.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this  budget, which is designed to repeal--not replace--ObamaCare.   I am adamant about this because of what I have witnessed all of my  life. I am going to share with you--and some of you may have never  heard of these things--that I have watched people die from preventable  diseases.   I have watched, over the years, from the time I was a child, where  people had home remedies. They didn't have any prescription drugs.   I watched as my great-grandmother was in pain, in tears, because of  arthritis and rheumatism. We had to rub her down with something called  liniment.   I have watched men get up and try to go to work with pneumonia. They  tried to heal pneumonia with what was known as hot toddies.   I have watched as children have died. Little children used to walk  around with little bags around their neck with something in it called  asfidity that was supposed to protect them from harm. They had  pneumonia. They had colds. That is all they had. They didn't have a  doctor. They died from preventable diseases.   Now we have 20 million more people who are insured under this  healthcare plan. This is a healthcare plan for all Americans.   The Republicans will tell you that, yes, they are going to give you  something better, but they have been saying this for 8 years. They have  been after what is known as ObamaCare for 8 years. Why don't they have  a remedy? Why don't they have a plan? Why don't they have anything?   They didn't have anything when they started to attack ObamaCare, they  don't have anything today, and they are not going to have anything  better than the ACA.  [[Page H503]]         Mr. Chairman I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the  Education and the Workforce Committee.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  budget resolution and its intent to compromise the health insurance of  all Americans.   Republicans continue to pursue the repeal of the Affordable Care Act,  root and branch, despite the fact that there is no credible plan to  deal with the chaos that this repeal will create.   Thirty million Americans will lose their insurance, the vast majority  being working families. There is no plan to protect the other Americans  who have enjoyed improved consumer protections and benefits.   Although the rates have gone up, they have gone up at half the rate  that they had been going up before ObamaCare, and most of those in the  marketplace don't even have to pay those increased prices because of  increased tax credits.                                time  1245    When Republicans talk about repeal and replace, the only thing  guaranteed is the repeal part. Republicans have shown little interest  in producing an alternative. We have heard lots of complaints, but we  have not seen a plan that will make things any better.   Remember, when Medicare was created, most of the Republicans in  Congress voted ``no.'' Republicans in the House have voted numerous  times, over 60 times, to repeal some or all of the Affordable Care Act  without proposing a credible alternative, and now we have some vague  ideas but no plan to deal with the total chaos that will be created if  ObamaCare is repealed.   I urge my colleagues to save the health and economic security of all  Americans by defeating this resolution.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Appropriations.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  opposition to this sham Republican budget resolution.   After wringing their hands for the last 8 years about debt and  deficits, today's resolution makes clear Republicans care about fiscal  discipline only when it is a Democratic President they are dealing  with. This budget resolution would add $9.5 trillion to the debt  [[Page H504]]  over the next 10 years. It has only one purpose: to provide for the  eventual repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but it would ruin our  fiscal health as well.   Of course, the ACA was fully paid for by Democrats with new revenue  and with cost-containment measures. Nonpartisan budget experts say that  repealing the ACA would actually increase the deficit by $350 billion.  So the hypocrisy of our Republican colleagues on this issue is simply  breathtaking, even by Washington standards.   Of course, repeal of ACA wouldn't just blow a hole in the budget, it  would: destabilize the insurance market and cause premiums to  skyrocket; eliminate insurance coverage for 30 million Americans,  including 4 million children; raise taxes on the middle-class; burden  local and rural hospitals with more uncompensated care; eliminate  Medicaid benefits for millions of vulnerable citizens; and abolish  vital patient protections, including the provision that stopped  insurance companies from discriminating against those with preexisting  condition.   After more than 6 years, moreover, we are still waiting for that  comprehensive Republican plan to replace the ACA. News flash: they  don't have one.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. They simply don't have one. Rather than  work with Democrats to improve the ACA, Republicans continue to put  their own political ideology over the health and well-being of the  Americans we are all pledged to serve.   I urge all Members to forcefully reject this budget resolution.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of the Committee on  the Budget.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of the Committee on  Small Business.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chairman, everybody in this room wants the same thing. We want  the best quality of care available to the most people at the lowest  price. That is what every American wants. That is what Republicans and  Democrats alike want.   We have put our plan to do that on the table. We recognize that there  are ways it could be improved. But the idea that there is a plan  competing on the other side is just hilarious.                                time  1330    Last night, I testified at the Rules Committee before Chairman  Sessions. Chairman Sessions introduced a bill last year. He had one  cosponsor. That gentleman is no longer in the House, so he has no  cosponsors as of now. His plan is called the World's Greatest  Healthcare Act. I like the name, but I don't know how that relates to  any of those other plans. I know that probably some of the elements are  similar.   This is the problem with the exercise we are going through. We are  heading down a road with no final determination or destination. We are  going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, eliminating all the  protections that we have provided for 300 million Americans--expanded  coverage, expanded guarantees, benefits, and quality--and we don't know  what the alternative is.   Waiving around a bunch of papers does not mean there is a plan. It  does not mean that the Republicans can say to the American public:  ``Here is what your health care is going to look like when we get  finished with our repeal and replace.'' They just can't do that.   That is why only 18 percent of the American people, according to a  Kaiser survey, want this course of action, want a repeal without a  replacement.   All I have to say is, if we go down this path, we won't have repeal  and replace. What we will have is repeal and repent because we are  going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that  we have caused.   I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment in the nature of a  substitute.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) and a Member opposed each will control 10  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Chairman, the Republican rush to eliminate the  Affordable Care Act, to take health insurance from 30 million  Americans, introduce chaos into the health insurance market, and give  millionaires and billionaires a giant tax cut is misguided and does not  reflect the values of the American people. On top of that, it can  significantly damage our economy.   Repeal will upend our Nation's healthcare system. Hospitals will see  a spike in uncompensated care, leading to reduced services, job cuts,  or higher prices for every one. It will cost the Nation 2.6 million  jobs in 2019 alone, including 44,000 jobs in Kentucky. The hit to the  economy will be in the trillions of dollars, and it will give  corporations and the wealthy hundreds of billions of dollars of tax  cuts.   Repeal isn't about what is best for the American people. It is solely  about politics and what is in the financial interest of the well-off  and the well-connected. There is absolutely no logic to this.   That said, if Republicans are determined to rush something through  Congress right now using the budget process, we would suggest a totally  different approach. Let's look at areas where this Congress and this  incoming administration can work together to address a pressing  challenge facing the country.   Members of both parties and the President-elect have expressed  support for repairing our Nation's failing infrastructure, investing in  our roads, bridges, ports, and other transportation needs to create  jobs and build a stronger economic future. The substitute I have  offered today provides the budget procedures needed for such a bill to  be considered.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this alternative budget so  we can move our Nation forward together.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, as a mother, a breast cancer  survivor, and a proud Floridian, I rise today in strong opposition to  the majority's irresponsible efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  The facts speak for themselves:   20 million Americans, including more than a million and a half  Floridians, have obtained quality, affordable health care since the ACA  became law.   129 million Americans, who, like me, have preexisting conditions, can  no longer be discriminated against by their health insurance company.   Our Nation's young adults now rest easy that they can stay on their  parents' insurance until they are 26.   Allow me to remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that  we are elected to help Americans, not hurt Americans. Make no mistake,  repealing the ACA will not only rip health care away from millions of  Americans who have ObamaCare, but we owe it to the 155 million  Americans with employer-based coverage to maintain the prohibition  against annual and lifetime limits.   Before the ACA, 105 million Americans, most of them with employer  coverage, had a lifetime limit on their insurance policy. The ACA  prohibits annual and lifetime limits on policies.   We owe it to our seniors to stop the repeal of key new Medicare  benefits. Repeal of these lifesaving provisions would actually increase  prescription drug costs for millions of seniors in the doughnut hole  who are currently saving more than $2,000 on their drugs due to the ACA  by reopening the gap in Medicare part D coverage.   In addition, since enactment of the ACA, the solvency of the Medicare  trust fund has been extended by 11 years. And we owe it to the 129  million Americans like me with preexisting conditions, such as breast  cancer survivors, to stop repeal so they cannot be dropped or denied  coverage or charged an exorbitant premium by their insurance company.   As a cancer survivor, I am also appalled that the Republican plan--or  lack of a plan--would increase out-of-pocket costs for every patient by  requiring them once again to pay for preventative services like cancer  screenings.   Mr. Chairman, the assault on the well-being of our constituents is an  outrage, and we will not take it lying down. We will fight tooth and  nail for the established right of all Americans to have quality,  affordable healthcare coverage and not return to the days when it was  available only as a privilege to those who could afford it or who were  fortunate enough not to have a preexisting condition.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a new member of the Budget  Committee.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting  that after 6 years of the mantra of repeal and replace, here we are.  And we have repeal and maybe replace at some point when we get around  to it; although, that shouldn't be very surprising, considering.   What is ObamaCare?   More than 20 years ago, Senator Bob Dole, then the Republican leader  of the Senate, and a group of his colleagues introduced the Republican  alternative to the then-Democratic plan to expand health insurance to  some 40 million Americans who didn't have it. The Republican plan  hatched at the Heritage Foundation was, instead of expanding Medicare  for all, let's instead create a system of taxes and tax credits where  we pool all the uninsured together and we enable them to buy private  health insurance on a marketplace.   Fast-forward about two decades. Barack Obama comes to the White House  wanting to compromise, wanting to create a system that would disrupt  the existing healthcare system as little as possible, and decides to go  in this direction. Then suddenly, all of those on the other side who  supported that idea for two decades decided it was socialism and could  not possibly be the healthcare law.   So the reason why they don't have an alternative to ObamaCare is  because this is the market solution. This was the more moderate  approach. This actually isn't a Big Government-run plan.   So I am extending a hand to the other side. If they really want to  come up with a way to improve the Affordable Care Act, there are many  of us on this side who genuinely want to work on that. I have already  voted, as a Member only here 2 years, on ways we can improve the  Affordable Care Act and make some modifications, the same way we have  made modifications to Medicare and Medicaid many times since 1965.   Mr. Chairman, if the real intent of the other side is just to strip  away health insurance to 22 million Americans, we will say ``no'' and  continue to fight it.                                time  1345     Mr. Chairman, as I said in my closing to the debate on  the resolution itself, it would be wonderful if the Republicans had a  plan that they could describe to the American people so that American  families would know what would be in their healthcare future. It would  also be nice if they would wait to repeal the Affordable Care Act until  they could do that. I think the American people expect it. The poll I  mentioned from Kaiser, 82 percent of the people preferred to go in that  direction. Let's find out if there is a better way.   I have said many times in public the reason there has been no  Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act is because there  really are only two alternatives: one is to go back to the era in which  insurance companies decided who lived and died, and the other one is to  go to single payer, something like Medicare for everyone. I would love  to discuss that option. I think it would be immensely popular in this  country. But, instead, Republicans come up with ideas that are drifting  in the other direction, again, back to not patient-centered care but  back to insurance company-centered care.   The important thing today is that we have an alternative here through  which we can actually do something constructive for the American  people, something that will help the economy, something that will make  vital investments in our Nation and the future economy instead of  putting the country's healthcare system at risk. That is what this  amendment does. That is why I introduced it, and that is why I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky will be postponed.
