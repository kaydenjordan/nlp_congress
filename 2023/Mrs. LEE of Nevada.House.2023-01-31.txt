 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as some extraordinary  Durango High School students are making news and scientific history.   A team from Nevada's Third District, Durango High School, recently  became one of only 60 teams nationwide to win the NASA TechRise student  challenge. This year the challenge was to design an experiment that  could be tested on a NASA-sponsored balloon flight.   The Durango team won with their entry, Project Nighthawk, which they  will continue to work on for the rest of the school year. This summer,  the project will be tested in a high-altitude balloon flight.   This is a big deal, but I know it is just the start of some amazing  endeavors into STEM that these Durango Trailblazers will make in their  future careers. These students will be mentored by the best and the  brightest researchers and have an invaluable opportunity to learn about  the edge of the Earth's atmosphere.   The ingenuity of these talented Nevadans reminds us that when it  comes to exploration of our final frontier, the best is yet to come. I  have no doubt that we will all benefit from their contributions in  years to come.   Congratulations, Durango High School's Project Nighthawk.                            ____________________
