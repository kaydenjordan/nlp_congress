 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the DiFebo family,  constituents of mine from Upper Mount Bethel Township, Pennsylvania,  who run Harvest Home Farms. They were recently honored with  Pennsylvania's first-ever Leopold Conservation Award, named after the  conservationist Aldo Leopold, for demonstrating excellence in  environmentally sustainable farming practices.   Richard DiFebo; his wife, Lynn; and their sons, Dohl and Dane, work  hard 7 days a week. Their days are long and, as Richard says, it is a  ``family effort'' that only works because everyone pitches in.   In Richard's words: ``It all starts with the health of the soil. Less  runoff means cleaner creeks and rivers, which leads to cleaner air. It  benefits the whole community. You need to protect those resources or  there is not going to be anything left for the next generation.''   Congratulations to the DiFebo family not just for this award, but for  their dedication to being responsible stewards of the Earth and for the  powerful example they are setting.                            ____________________
