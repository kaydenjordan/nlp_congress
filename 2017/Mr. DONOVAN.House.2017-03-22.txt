 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1238) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make the  Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Health Affairs responsible  for coordinating the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security  related to food, agriculture, and veterinary defense against terrorism,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1238         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing our Agriculture and       Food Act''.       SEC. 2. COORDINATION OF FOOD, AGRICULTURE, AND VETERINARY                     DEFENSE AGAINST TERRORISM.         (a) In General.--Title V of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 311 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``SEC. 528. COORDINATION OF DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY                     EFFORTS RELATED TO FOOD, AGRICULTURE, AND                     VETERINARY DEFENSE AGAINST TERRORISM.         ``(a) Program Required.--The Secretary, acting through the       Assistant Secretary for  [[Page H2305]]       Health Affairs, shall carry out a program to coordinate the       Department's efforts related to defending the food,       agriculture, and veterinary systems of the United States       against terrorism and other high-consequence events that pose       a high risk to homeland security.        ``(b) Program Elements.--The coordination program required       by subsection (a) shall include, at a minimum, the following:        ``(1) Providing oversight and management of the       Department's responsibilities pursuant to Homeland Security       Presidential Directive 9-Defense of United States Agriculture       and Food.        ``(2) Providing oversight and integration of the       Department's activities related to veterinary public health,       food defense, and agricultural security.        ``(3) Leading the Department's policy initiatives relating       to food, animal, and agricultural incidents, and the impact       of such incidents on animal and public health.        ``(4) Leading the Department's policy initiatives relating       to overall domestic preparedness for and collective response       to agricultural terrorism.        ``(5) Coordinating with other Department components,       including U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as appropriate,       on activities related to food and agriculture security and       screening procedures for domestic and imported products.        ``(6) Coordinating with appropriate Federal departments and       agencies.        ``(7) Other activities as determined necessary by the       Secretary.        ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed as altering or superseding the authority of the       Secretary of Agriculture relating to food and agriculture.''.

Coordination of Department of Homeland Security efforts                related to food, agriculture, and veterinary defense                against terrorism.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Donovan) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1238, the Securing our Agriculture  and Food Act, introduced by Congressman David Young of Iowa. This bill  seeks to authorize the Department of Homeland Security's food,  agriculture, and veterinary defense program within the Office of Health  Affairs.   Last year, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and  Communications held a hearing to examine the potential devastating  impacts of an intentional attack on, or a natural disruption of, U.S.  agricultural or food production systems.   The food and agriculture sector is critically important to our  Nation's economy. U.S. food and agriculture accounts for roughly one- fifth of the Nation's economic activity, and contributed $835 billion  to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2014, and is responsible for 1  out of every 12 U.S. jobs.   Coming from Iowa and as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Agriculture, Congressman Young of Iowa knows all too well the  importance of protecting this sector, which is vital to the economy and  our way of life. I appreciate him introducing this bill of which I am  pleased to be an original cosponsor.   I thank Chairman Walden of the Energy and Commerce Committee and  Chairman Conaway of the Agriculture Committee for working with us to  advance this bill.   Mr. Speaker, we also look forward to working with our Senate  colleagues, who recently approved companion legislation without  amendment in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee.   This bipartisan legislation passed the House last September by voice  vote, and I urge all Members to join me once again in supporting this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write in regard to H.R. 1238,       Securing our Agriculture and Food Act, which was referred in       addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wanted to       notify you that the Committee will forgo action on the bill       so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Committee on Energy and Commerce takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of       H.R. 1238, the Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation       and will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or       similar legislation moves forward to address any remaining       issues within the Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee       also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and asks that you support any       such request.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 1238 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your       committee's report on the legislation or the Congressional       Record during its consideration on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, March 16, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 1238, the ``Securing our Agriculture and Food Act.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forego       consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at       this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition,       should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would       support a request by the Committee on Energy and Commerce for       conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the report or in       the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on       the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this       matter.            Sincerely,      Michael T. McCaul.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for the opportunity to       review H.R. 1238, ``Securing our Agriculture and Food Act.''       As you are aware, the bill was primarily referred to the       Committee on Homeland Security, while the Agriculture       Committee received an additional referral.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and,       accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 1238 from further       consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with       the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee       on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on       Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of       conferees, if it should become necessary.        I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange of letters       into the Congressional Record during consideration of this       measure on the House floor.        Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look       forward to continued cooperation between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 1238, the ``Securing our Agriculture and Food Act.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Agriculture will forego consideration       of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at       this time, the Committee on Agriculture does not  [[Page H2306]]       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition,       should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would       support a request by the Committee on Agriculture for       conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul.     Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume, and I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1238.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1238,  ``Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act.''   This bipartisan bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make  the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Health Affairs  responsible for coordinating the efforts for the DHS related to food,  agriculture, and veterinary defense against terrorism.   The coordination program under the measure would include:   1. Overseeing and managing DHS's responsibilities under the  presidential directive;   2. Integrating activities related to veterinary public health, food  and agriculture security;   3. Leading the department's policy initiatives relating to food,  animal, and agriculture incidents, as well as domestic preparedness for  and collective response to agricultural terrorism; and   4. Coordinating with other parts of the federal government.   Agro-terrorism is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal  or plant disease for the purpose of generating fear, causing economic  losses, or undermining social stability.   Killing livestock and plants or contaminating food can help  terrorists cause economic crises in the agriculture and food  industries.   Agriculture comprises the largest single sector in U.S. economy,  making agro-terrorism an attractive opportunity for many terrorist  organizations.   Attacks directed against the cattle, pork, or poultry industries or  via the food chain pose the most serious danger for latent, ongoing  effects and general socioeconomic and political disruption.   Food availability becomes a matter of immediate life and death in  such circumstances, and significant national and global resources need  to be dedicated to emergency relief efforts.   Any attacks of agro-terrorism would be particularly devastating for  the citizens of Texas.   In Texas, the largest source of agricultural revenue comes from the  sale of beef cattle.   Texas produces roughly 20 percent of the nation's cattle and ranks  first in the country in the value of cattle raised.   It is crucial that we have preparedness policies in place to quickly  respond to events  [[Page H2307]]  threatening U.S. agriculture or food production systems.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1238.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1365) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require  certain acquisition innovation, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1365         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland       Security Acquisition Innovation Act''.       SEC. 2. ACQUISITION INNOVATION.         (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``SEC. 710. ACQUISITION INNOVATION.         ``The Under Secretary for Management may--        ``(1) designate an individual within the Department to       manage acquisition innovation efforts of the Department;        ``(2) test emerging acquisition best practices to carrying       out acquisitions, consistent with the Federal Acquisition       Regulation and Department acquisition management directives,       as appropriate;        ``(3) develop and distribute best practices and lessons       learned regarding acquisition innovation throughout the       Department;        ``(4) establish metrics to measure the effectiveness of       acquisition innovation efforts with respect to cost,       operational efficiency of the acquisition program (including       timeframe for executing contracts), and collaboration with       the private sector, including small businesses; and        ``(5) determine impacts of acquisition innovation efforts       on the private sector by--        ``(A) engaging with the private sector, including small       businesses, to provide information and obtain feedback on       procurement practices and acquisition innovation efforts of       the Department;        ``(B) obtaining feedback from the private sector on the       impact of acquisition innovation efforts of the Department;       and        ``(C) incorporating such feedback, as appropriate, into       future acquisition innovation efforts of the Department.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 709 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 710. Acquisition innovation.''.        (c) Information.--Not later than 90 days after the date on       which the Secretary of Homeland Security submits the annual       budget justification for the Department of Homeland Security       for each of fiscal years 2018 through 2022, the Secretary       shall, if appropriate, provide information to the Committee       on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate on the activities undertaken in the previous       fiscal year in furtherance of section 710 of the Homeland       Security Act, as added by subsection (a) of this Act, on the       following:        (1) Emerging acquisition best practices that were tested       within the Department during such year.        (2) Efforts to distribute best practices and lessons       learned within the Department, including through web-based       seminars, training, and forums, during such year.        (3) Utilization by components throughout the Department of       best practices distributed by the Under Secretary of       Management pursuant to paragraph (3) of such section 710.        (4) Performance as measured by the metrics established       under paragraph (4) of such section 710.        (5) Outcomes of efforts to distribute best practices and       lessons learned within the Department, including through web-      based seminars, training, and forums.        (6) Any impacts of the utilization of innovative       acquisition mechanisms by the Department on the private       sector, including small businesses.

(8) Recommendations, as necessary, to enhance acquisition       innovation in the Department.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Donovan) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1365, the Department of  Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act.   The bill allows DHS to designate a senior official to manage  acquisition innovation efforts; test, develop, and distribute  acquisition best practices throughout the Department; and establish  performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts.  Republican amendments at the committee markup strengthened the  underlying bill by encouraging DHS to obtain feedback from the private  sector and incorporate this feedback into future efforts.   As we have seen from numerous watchdog reports, the Federal  Government's acquisition and contracting process is broken, cumbersome,  and bureaucratic. DHS must continue to innovate to ensure the private  sector can best support our critical homeland security needs. The  Department has recently taken positive steps in using new contracting  tools and collaborating with industry. This legislation supports those  efforts and encourages their continued use.   I commend Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee Ranking  Member Correa for all of his hard work on this legislation.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 1365, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the cost estimate on  H.R. 1365:                                                     March 22, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1365, the       Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark       Grabowicz.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.                                 H.R. 1365          Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act    As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on                               March 8, 2017         H.R. 1365 would authorize the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) to promote the use of innovation in its       acquisition programs. The legislation would direct DHS to       provide information annually to the Congress on activities       related to innovative acquisition practices. Based on       information from DHS, CBO estimates that implementing H.R.       1365 would cost less than $500,000 annually; such spending       would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.        Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending       or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not       apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1365 would not       increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of       the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 1365 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and       would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal       governments.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz.       The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy       Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 1365, the ``Department of  Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act'' which authorizes the DHS  to expand the use of acquisition innovation.   This bipartisan bill will guarantee new acquisition methods and  practices are considered to ensure taxpayers get the most for their  money.   This bill would permit DHS's undersecretary for management to:   1. Designate an official to manage acquisition innovation;   2. Test and develop best practices that are consistent with  acquisition rules and directives;   3. Measure how innovation in acquisition processes have affected  cost, operational efficiency, the timeframe for executing contracts,  and collaboration with small businesses and other private-sector  companies; and   4. Obtain and incorporate feedback from the private sector.   From fiscal 2018 through 2022, DHS would provide Congress with  information on acquisition innovation activities during the previous  fiscal year, including:   1. Best practices that were tested, used and distributed, including  through web-based seminars, trainings and forums;   2. Effects on the private sector, including small businesses;   3. Criteria to indemnify acquisition programs that would be  appropriate for innovation; and   4. Recommendations for enhancing innovation at DHS.   Innovation is the American way and this bill makes sure the  Department of Homeland Security finds new ways to do its job  effectively and efficiently.   At the Tenth Annual Border Security Expo in Texas, officials from the  Department of Homeland Security observed some of the latest innovations  that can help to protect our border. This included 3D holographic  images, portable biometric testing kits, and underground seismic signal  detectors.   In Texas, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents deter, detect,  and interdict smuggling along the Texas/Mexico border through the  deployment of an integrated network of detection and communication  technologies.   In 2016, the Texas of Department of Public Safety provided direct  assistance to U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the arrest of over  37,000 criminals deemed a high threat risk.   Frontline personnel securing our borders, protecting our airports,  and defending our shores must have the tools to successfully accomplish  their mission.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1365.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1365, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________
