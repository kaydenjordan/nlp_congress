 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, to protect  the right to life for innocent children who are born alive instead of  allowing the State-sponsored murder after birth, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if that is the case, I would ask the  Speaker and the majority leader to immediately bring that bill to the  floor to allow us all to stand up for the sanctity of life.
