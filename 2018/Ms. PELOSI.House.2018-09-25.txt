 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington  State who, from day one, has been a champion for human rights in our  country and throughout the world. I was proud to travel with her to  visit with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, where this issue has been on  the forefront for many years and currently.   I thank Mr. Hultgren for his leadership and for being part of this  legislation, and also Chris Smith and Frank Wolf before him. We have  been working on this for a long time.   On a previous trip, we visited Tibet, and we called Mr. McGovern the  spiritual leader of our trip because everywhere he went in Tibet, and  then also in the rest of China, he brought up this issue of  reciprocity. It has a human rights aspect to it, but it also is a  practical matter that if we want to improve communication and  relationships and the rest, if the Tibetan--it is the Chinese  Government, but in the form of the Tibetan--local government there  wants more people to go to school and visit Tibet and all, as a  practical matter, it would be very important for us to have a  diplomatic presence in Lhasa.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act  as a strong, bipartisan bill. We are very proud of that. It takes an  important step forward to advance the future of freedom, dignity, and  prosperity for the Tibetan people.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate and acknowledge the leadership of  Congressman Jim McGovern, as I mentioned, who is co-chair of the Tom  Lantos Human Rights Commission. Ten years ago, he became the chair of  that commission. He was working on this issue even before then.   His leadership honors the legacy of Tom Lantos, our colleague, and  the responsibility of Congress to defend human rights and dignity  around the world. That has always been not only bipartisan, but  bicameral on this issue.   This bill holds China officials accountable for their repressive  campaign to cut off Tibet from America and the world. It promotes free,  unfettered travel for American diplomats, journalists, and tourists to  Tibet, and fosters strong bonds between our peoples. And it sends a  clear signal that China's meddling in Tibet's affairs is unacceptable  and cannot continue.   For six decades, the Tibetan people have stood defiant in the face of  oppression and brutality from an authoritarian China. The people of  Tibet have courageously spoken out for their freedom, and the rest of  the world has been stirred to action by their clarion call for justice  and dignity. All freedom-loving people must continue to speak out until  every Tibetan can learn, worship, and live free from persecution and  abuse.   I might add, sadly, that we would hope that there would be respect  for the dignity and the faith of the Uighurs in China as well.   In November 2015, I led a congressional delegation--as I mentioned,  the first congressional delegation in a long time to enter Tibet--with  Congressman McGovern in Jokhang Temple, Potala Palace, and Sera  Monastery, and witnessed the strength of the Tibetan people and the  beauty of their culture.   Last year, again, I led another bipartisan delegation to Nepal and  India, where we were blessed to be received by His Holiness the Dalai  Lama, and Congresswoman Jayapal was part of that. We had the  opportunity to see the aspirations of the Tibetan people firsthand, now  living in India, especially in the eyes of the Tibetan schoolchildren  in Dharamshala.  [[Page H8853]]    These people are there, separated from their parents for the most  part, because they are not allowed to practice their faith, speak their  language, or enjoy their culture in Tibet because that is suppressed.   Today, those aspirations remain in peril as China continues to  silence the voices crying out for freedom in Tibet and across the  region. Every day, Tibetans, Uighurs--again, the Uighurs are the  Muslims in the western areas of China--and the people of Hong Kong and  all throughout China are subjected to the threat of oppression and  persecution simply for wishing to practice their faith and pursue a  more democratic future.                                time  2045    Mr. Speaker, if we don't speak out for human rights in China because  of our commercial relationship with them, we lose all moral authority  to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world. As Members of  Congress, we have a responsibility to stand with the Tibetan people as  they fight to be free to practice their faith traditions, speak their  language, and celebrate their cultures. This bill takes a strong step  toward that mission, and I urge my colleagues to join in a strong  bipartisan ``yes'' on this vote.   Again, I want to commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who have for a very long time been such leaders on the issues of human  rights throughout the world, including in China, and for whom this  particular bill has emerged as one manifestation of where we can make a  reasonable, measured difference in our relationship.   So I thank Mr. Hultgren and Mr. McGovern for their leadership in  bringing this forth. I thank the Judiciary Committee and my colleague  who was so important on our trip. So it is really a joy to see the  gentleman on the floor leading this debate. I thank the gentleman for  bringing his eloquence, his compassion, his concern, and his leadership  to this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
