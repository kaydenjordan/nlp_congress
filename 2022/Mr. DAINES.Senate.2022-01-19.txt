 Mr. President, I rise today ahead of the 49th anniversary  of the Supreme Court's tragic decision in Roe v. Wade. You might ask:  What does that have to do with voting rights? It has a lot to do with  voting rights because, after all, you can't have the right to vote  without first having the right to life.   Every year, for nearly five decades, thousands of pro-life Americans  have faithfully gathered here in DC and across this country to mark  this dark day by marching for life and being a voice for the voiceless.   This year's official March for Life comes at a turning point in our  Nation's history. On December 1 of last year, the Supreme Court heard  oral arguments on the landmark 15-week abortion case out of  Mississippi, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.   This is the first case in our generation that presents the Supreme  Court of the United States the best opportunity to right its historic  injustice and finally overturn Roe v. Wade.   The Roe decision has resulted in the deaths of more than 63 million  innocent babies--63 million. In fact, as I stand here and speak today,  2,363  [[Page S324]]  preborn children are being killed in this country--2,363 are killed  every single day.   These precious lives were created by God and intended for this world  but were violently deprived of their lives because they were deemed  unwanted, unfit, or simply inconvenient. And because they are so small,  without voices of their own, far too many, for far too long, have  ignored their desperate cries. Because of Roe, States have virtually  been powerless to stop this tidal wave of bloodshed.   What is more, Roe's extreme abortion regime has made the United  States a global outlier on abortion. We are just one of seven nations,  including China and North Korea, that allow abortions on demand--just  one of seven nations--past the point babies feel pain, all the way up  until the moment of birth. It is barbaric.   Because of science and technology today, it is impossible to ignore  the humanity of that little baby growing in the womb. Thanks to  incredible 4D ultrasound technology, we can watch babies grow. We can  hear their hearts beat. We can watch them yawn, even suck their thumbs.   We have come a long way since 1973. It is time our laws catch up with  the science. Overturning Roe will not--I repeat, will not--ban abortion  nationwide. And I am sad to say that some of my colleagues are not  being truthful on what it might mean if Roe v. Wade is overturned. It  will not ban abortions nationwide. It will return the power to pass  pro-life laws to State and Federal lawmakers.   In fact, according to a recent Marist poll, 80 percent of Americans  are opposed to abortions after the first 3 months of pregnancy. That is  an overwhelming majority of the American people. But because of Roe,  their voices are being silenced. It is time for the Supreme Court to  allow State and Federal lawmakers to rightfully represent their  constituents and protect the most vulnerable among us.   It is time that we as the United States of America--a nation who is  supposed to be the leaders in the world of human rights--recognize what  happens to be the theme of this year's March for Life, which is that  equality begins in the womb.   The Dobbs case before the Supreme Court gives the Court a chance to  finally restore justice and equality of the most vulnerable among us,  in the spirit of this Nation's long history of progress in civil  rights.   In listening to oral arguments in the Dobbs case, I was struck by  something Justice Kavanaugh said.         If you think about some of the most important cases, the       most consequential cases in this court's history, there's a       string of them where the cases overruled precedent.    Justice Kavanaugh cited most notably Brown v. Board of Education in  1954, which outlawed a separate but equal, overturning Plessy v.  Ferguson decided in 1896. It took 58 years for the Court to recognize  the obvious truth that racial segregation was wrong and overturn its  grievous error in Plessy. Justice John Marshall Harlan showed  tremendous courage as the lone dissenter from the Court decision in  Plessy.    Now, it has taken 49 years for the Court to consider the obvious  truth that all life must be protected. It has taken 49 years since Roe  v. Wade for the Court to reconsider this wrongly decided case.   In the spirit of Justice Harlan, who dissented in Plessy, I would  like to share a quote from another great dissenter proved right in the  course of history, and that is Justice Byron White. Justice White, with  his 1973 dissent, joined by Justice Rehnquist, in Doe v. Bolton, the  companion case to Roe v. Wade wrote as follows:         With all due respect, I dissent. I find nothing in the       language or history of the Constitution to support the       Court's judgment.        The Court simply fashions and announces a new       constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely       any reason or authority for its action, invests that right in       sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion       statutes.        The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the       50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the       relative importance of the continued existence and       development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum       of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand.        As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has       authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its       judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the       power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to       this Court.        The Court apparently values the convenience of the pregnant       mother more than the continued existence and development of       the life or potential life that she carries. Whether or not I       might agree with that marshaling of values, I can in no event       join the Court's judgment because I find no constitutional       warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the       people and legislatures of the States. In a sensitive area       such as this, involving as it does issues over which       reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ, I cannot       accept the Court's exercise of its clear power of choice by       interposing a constitutional barrier to state efforts to       protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with       the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it. This       issue, for the most part, should be left with the people and       to the political processes the people have devised to govern       their affairs.    Justice White was correct. I share that belief. The Court's decision  in Roe was a travesty of constitutional law and human rights, one that  should follow Plessy v. Ferguson to the ash heap of history.   In the Dobbs case, I pray that we see the Supreme Court do precisely  this: correct this historic injustice and uphold Mississippi's 15-week  abortion law.   For the pro-life movement, overturning Roe is not the end; it is just  the beginning. States across the country stand ready to protect life  and provide support for pregnant moms facing crisis pregnancies.   I pray this year's March for Life marks the final anniversary of Roe  v. Wade and heralds the dawn of a new day, where every life is  protected.   I want to thank the thousands of Americans across the country who  will be joining this year's March for Life. I would also like to thank  the hundreds of Montanans who joined me just last week in Helena for  last week's March for Life. I stand with you, and we will continue to  fight to protect all life.                                  H.R. 5746    Mr. President, last year we saw Democrats like Stacey Abrams and  President Biden mislead the American people about Georgia's new voting  law. In fact, the Washington Post fact checker wrote:         Biden falsely claims the new Georgia law ends voting hours       early.    That was given four Pinocchios by the Washington Post.   However, today, in this Chamber, we have seen several Senate  Democrats challenge Montana's commonsense election integrity laws  championed by the Montana Legislature; the secretary of state of  Montana, Christi Jacobsen; and the Montana Governor, Greg Gianforte.   I want to set the record straight. Montana put in place some  commonsense reforms that enjoy the strong support of Montanans, like  strengthening voter ID laws and preventing paid ballot harvesting.   There have been some things said here on the floor that are, frankly,  not true. Ballot harvesting is still OK in Montana; you just can't pay  people to do it.   In fact, there were statements made that somehow student IDs are not  allowed anymore to vote, that somehow that is going to be the end of  democracy. Well, listen, under current law--first of all, most students  have a valid driver's license in Montana, but if you didn't, the  requirement is this--and I take this chapter and verse off of the  secretary of state's site--you can still use a student ID to vote in  Montana; you just have to have a secondary identification. That can be  a ski pass, a gym membership, so long as both identification types are  presented.   First of all, most students have valid driver's licenses. If you  don't, you can still use a student ID. You just have to have a  secondary identification type presented, like a ski pass, gym  membership, or even a transcript. That does not seem unreasonable, and  the vast majority of Montanans believe that just makes sense.   Furthermore, we have seen questions--in fact, Senator Schumer made  some accusation about Montana shortening the hours for elections. I  found that a bit hilarious, frankly, because here is what we did in  Montana. All voter registration activities are allowed now up until the  night before the election. Up until the day of the election, you are  allowed to register to vote, unlike New York, which ends voter  registration 25 days before the  [[Page S325]]  election. I don't think that is going to be the end of democracy when  Montana has far easier, far better laws here to make it easier to vote  in Montana than they do in New York.   In fact, regarding New York, the voters last November rejected same- day voter registration and rejected universal absentee voting. States  across this country have been working hard to ensure that we are making  it easier to vote but making it more difficult to cheat.   I am grateful for what has been happening in the State of Montana. It  is a no-brainer to most Montanans that you need a valid ID, a driver's  license, to get a hunting or fishing license, to rent a car, to get  onto an airplane, not to mention the fact that in many liberal-run  cities now across our country, the Democrats are now enforcing ID  checks to get into a coffee shop or sit down for dinner.   So it is no wonder we are left a little confused here by how  President Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Senate Democrats want to override  the will of Montanans and undermine our State voter ID laws when it  comes to maintaining something as foundational as our democracy and  maintaining integrity in our elections.   If there is one thing Montanans are about, it is common sense. The  fearmongering, the falsehoods, and the misleading statements from the  Democrats don't make a whole lot of sense, and Montanans know it.   I yield the floor.
