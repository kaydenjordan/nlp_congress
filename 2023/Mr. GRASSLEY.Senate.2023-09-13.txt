 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in June, Congress passed a bipartisan  bill to increase the debt limit and impose meaningful fiscal controls.  That law was appropriately titled the ``Fiscal Responsibility Act.''  Its passage marked a long-overdue step toward fiscal sanity. I assume  you have to go back about a dozen years until Congress had taken such a  fiscally responsible step.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, as we call it  here in town, projects the Fiscal Responsibility Act could save  Americans $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. I say ``could save''  because for this to hold true, Congress must adhere to the spending  caps that it has imposed. The CBO's latest long-term budget outlook  shows that in 30 years, our national debt will be $11 trillion lower  than previously projected. This is, in large part, thanks to this bill  passed this year, the Fiscal Responsibility Act.   While $11 trillion is certainly a large sum, it is a drop in the  bucket compared to the $118 trillion in debt that the United States is  expected to chalk up over those same 30 years. So, of course, the  fiscal path we are on is not sustainable.   If you take debt held by the public, today public debt is about as  large as the annual U.S. economic outlook. Within 6 years, public debt  will reach a historically high 107 percent of GDP. The previous record  was set in the wake of World War II. Once that dismal record is broken,  public debt will grow faster than the economy with no end in sight, as  you can see from the chart on display here.   When the public holds large amounts of debt, well, it naturally slows  the economy; it naturally reduces national income; and it naturally  increases inflation. It also leads to ballooning interest costs, which  are already at a 22-year high.   Based on the current trajectory, here is a snapshot of the years  ahead. So pay attention to the chart, please. Within 5 years, the  United States will spend more on interest than on national defense.  Within 8 years, interest payments will surpass our spending on  nondefense discretionary programs. Over the next 10 years, interest on  our debt will cost taxpayers more than $10.4 trillion. That is $10.4  trillion that could be used to improve the lives of Americans. Now,  instead, it will pad the pockets of our Nation's creditors, even  including foreign adversaries like China, which considers investment in  the national debt of the United States to be a good investment.   Finally, within 30 years, interest payments will reach over $5  trillion a year. That would make interest the single largest annual  government expenditure, surpassing both Social Security and Medicare.  [[Page S4423]]    Now, everybody listening and everybody not listening knows that we  can't keep swiping our Nation's maxed-out credit card while we cross  our fingers for prepandemic interest rates to return.   Families, farmers, and small businesses make tradeoffs every day to  stay on budget. They have to balance their checkbooks besides staying  on budget. Congress, of course, needs to do the same. Enacting spending  caps in the Fiscal Responsibility Act was the very, very easy part. So  the real challenge will be walking that walk and sticking to those  caps. To do this, Congress must renew its focus on two things: fiscal  responsibility and good governance.   Now, recently, you know Fitch downgraded the United States' credit  rating just last month. It named both fiscal responsibility and good  governance as factors in its decision.   Congress has the responsibility and the duty to demonstrate fiscal  responsibility and good governance and to do it now, as we work to fund  Federal Agencies and programs for this upcoming fiscal year.   Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told Congress in the 1980s:         Cutting spending may appear to be the most painful part of       the job, but I'm convinced that the pain for all of us will       be ultimately much greater if it is not accomplished.    Paul Volcker's advice is even more apt today than ever because our  national spending and our national debt are much greater than in Paul  Volcker's time.   We need to stop governing from crisis to crisis and return to regular  order, like we are today on the appropriations bills before the U.S.  Senate. That means restoring a key component of Senate procedures: real  and robust debate on spending decisions.   The Senate has only debated one or more appropriations bills seven  times--just seven times--since 2008. The last time we did it was 5  years ago: 2018. Otherwise, between 2018 and last year, we operated  under this Omnibus appropriations bill process where we didn't give  proper attention to each segment of our government. We didn't have much  chance for debate and probably no chance for amendment.   Last year, as one of those years, not a single funding bill was  reported out of committee. Congress didn't complete its appropriations  until December 23. We must do better this year, and we need to applaud  Chairman Murray and Ranking Member Collins. They have both done their  part by shepherding all 12 regular funding bills through the Senate  Appropriations Committee.   Now it is the full Senate's turn. So let's get to work and get the  job done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
