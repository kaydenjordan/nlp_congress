 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend,  Representative Hanabusa for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of my bill, H.R. 4851,  the Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site Act. I also thank my  colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee for their very prompt  consideration of this bill, including Chairman Bishop and Ranking  Member Grijalva.   H.R. 4851 is a bipartisan and bicameral bill with the full support of  the entire congressional delegation, including my good friend and  colleague Congresswoman Susan Brooks; including my mentor, one of my  heroes, Representative  John Lewis; and my buddy, Representative Joe  Kennedy. I thank them for joining the delegation of original cosponsors  of Hoosiers.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced the Kennedy-King National Commemorative  Site Act at the request of my constituents to provide formal National  Park Service recognition to the site where Senator Robert F. Kennedy  gave an extraordinary speech in Indianapolis in the spring of 1968.   This recognition, as well as addition to the African American Civil  Rights  [[Page H1676]]  Network, will help this location--set on a community board over there-- remain visible and accessible for the inspiration of present and future  generations.   Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues may have heard the story, as it  was previously mentioned by my other colleague, that Robert Kennedy had  a scheduled speech in the great Hoosier State in the city of  Indianapolis during his campaign for the Presidency. However, just  before he was to give those remarks, Mr. Speaker, he was told of the  assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.   Before the news became widely known, his advisers said he shouldn't  speak at all. They suggested he should stand back. But Robert F.  Kennedy wanted to speak. Despite the risks of outbursts or  interruptions, he had something important to say in person and face-to- face for all who were gathered.   He changed his planned remarks on the fly and broke the news of Dr.  King's assassination to the large crowd assembled in the park. He  called for a nonviolent response to Dr. King's death. Robert Kennedy's  speech has been described as one of the greatest addresses of the 20th  century, as a call for unity and nonviolence in a time of great unrest.   Mr. Speaker, I include the text of the speech in today's Record.    Full Text of Robert F. Kennedy's Speech: Indianapolis, April 4, 1968         Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm only going to talk to you just       for a minute or so this evening, because I have some very sad       news for all of you. Could you lower those signs, please? I       have some very sad news for all of you, and, I think, sad       news for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love       peace all over the world; and that is that Martin Luther King       was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.        Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to       justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of       that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time       for the United States, it's perhaps well to ask what kind of       a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.        For those of you who are black considering the evidence       evidently is that there were white people who were       responsible you can be filled with bitterness, and with       hatred, and a desire for revenge.        We can move in that direction as a country, in greater       polarization black people amongst blacks, and white amongst       whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make       an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand, and to       comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of       bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to       understand, compassion, and love.        For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with       hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against       all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my       own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my       family killed, but he was killed by a white man.        But we have to make an effort in the United States. We have       to make an effort to understand, to get beyond, or go beyond       these rather difficult times.        My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote:       Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget      falls drop by drop upon the heart,      until, in our own despair,      against our will,      comes wisdom      through the awful grace of God.         What we need in the United States is not division; what we       need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the       United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love,       and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling       of justice toward those who still suffer within our country,       whether they be white or whether they be black.        So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for       the family of Martin Luther King yeah, ifs true but more       importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of       us love a prayer for understanding and that compassion of       which I spoke.        We can do well in this country. We will have difficult       times. We've had difficult times in the past, but we and we       will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of       violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it's not the       end of disorder.        But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority       of black people in this country want to live together, want       to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all       human beings that abide in our land.        And let's dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so       many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle       the life of this world. Let us dedicate ourselves to that,       and say a prayer for our country and for our people.        Thank you very much.     Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 50th  anniversary of RFK's speech, it becomes very clear that America needs  this national treasure to be preserved and promoted beyond the  residents of Indianapolis. This powerful message of nonviolence in  response to violence is more timely and important than ever.   The Smithsonian has described 1968 as ``the year that shattered  America.'' It was a time when divisions were sharp and the morale of  this country was low. Many stirred up hatred and fear with venomous  rhetoric, which drove people long left out of America's bounty to the  limits of their very humanity. Many cities erupted in flames and  violent riots.   When other cities expressed their justified pain, anger, and  disenfranchisement with destruction, Robert Kennedy's calm voice of  reason changed the hearts and minds of people who were feeling so much  pain. Indianapolis was the only major city in America that did not burn  in that season of pain and violent disruption.   JFK was assassinated. Martin Luther King was assassinated. And just 2  months after RFK's emotional speech in Indianapolis, he, too, was  assassinated. But in his youth and his ability to feel the pain of  others, RFK called on those who were hurting to turn away from violence  and hate and practice what MLK practiced.   This message and this special place needs to be shared with all  Americans across the country today and into the future. The amendment  approved by the committee will add the Kennedy-King site to a new civil  rights network, Mr. Speaker, and it will designate the location as a  commemorative site.   This is a timely first step, and I look forward to seeing the bill  signed into law this year. And after this step, our constituents and I  will continue to count on congressional support for our efforts to  establish the Kennedy-King National Historic Site as a unit of the  National Park system in Indianapolis, Indiana.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank my good friend, Congresswoman Susan  Brooks, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this great bill.
