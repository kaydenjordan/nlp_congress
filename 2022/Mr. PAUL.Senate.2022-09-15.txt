 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Heartland Chia of Franklin, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Chris Kummer's small business was founded on an idea that virtually  no one thought possible: successful chia crops planted and harvested in  the United States. But as a fifth-generation farmer, Mr. Kummer is no  stranger to the challenges posed by mother nature. Thus, with decades  of farming experience under his belt and a tireless dedication to his  crops, Mr. Kummer has turned this once crazy idea into a thriving  business. Founded in 2012, Heartland Chia develops and markets locally  grown chia to buyers across the country. Chris's wife, Jill Kummer,  joins her husband at the helm of their business, handling most of the  marketing and administrative duties while her husband works with the  crop directly in the field. Together, the Kummers are proud to be the  only chia seed growers in the U.S.A., a tremendous feat that adds to  the biodiversity of Kentucky's burgeoning agricultural industry.       Mr. Kummer will be the first to tell you that his business would not  be possible had it not been for the visionary researchers at the  University of Kentucky College of Food, Agriculture, and Environment.  Since his great-grandfather planted his first crop on their family farm  in 1889, the Kummers have grown crops traditional to the Midwestern  U.S., such as soy, wheat, and corn. It never occurred to them to plant  chia as the plant requires a very  [[Page S4637]]  long summer in order to grow and produce seed, meaning that most of the  world's chia plants are grown in regions near the equator, such as  Central America. Farmers everywhere took it for granted that this plant  could not be grown north of the U.S.-Mexico border, but the breeding  program over at the University Kentucky sought to change that. Over a  period spanning 6 to 8 years, researchers Dr. David Hildebrand and Dr.  Tim Phillips, both plant and soil scientists, used decades old breeding  methods to create a new strain of chia that would flower earlier in the  year, allowing the crop to survive in less temperate climates than  those near the equator. Once the scientists created a product they were  confident in, they were careful in selecting a steward for their new  ``Early Flowering'' chia seed. Dr. Hildebrand knew Chris Kummer from  his days as a student at UK and knew of his farming background;  therefore he immediately came to mind.   In 2011, Dr. Phillips and Dr. Hildebrand gave Mr. Kummer half the  world's seed supply of this new strain of chia. In the first year of  planting, the Kummers lost most of their chia crops, as they and the  researchers over at University of Kentucky were still learning best  practices for growing this new crop. But through the persistence  instilled in him from his farmer forebears, Chris and his wife absorbed  as much knowledge as they could from this first planting season and put  it to the test the next year. By the end of their second planting  season, the Kummers had already entered into commercial production. The  success of this second season led UK to purchase a patent for the seed,  ensuring that it only be used for benefit of American farmers, domestic  food manufacturers, and domestic consumers.   Today, Heartland Chia works with several farmers across four  different States that all use the Kummer's chia for manufacturing  processes. By producing this previously ungrowable plant in the U.S.,  the Kummers have not only added to the biodiversity of the State, they  have created a reliable source of what is now widely considered ``a  superfood.'' In a recent publication, the Mayo Clinic listed chia as  one of the few foods truly deserving the distinction of ``superfood''  due its long list of health and nutritional benefits. Given this growth  in consumer demand, it was only natural that Mr. Kummer would embark on  this experimental journey with the support of his family, University of  Kentucky scientists, as well as food manufacturers seeking top-quality  chia.   Chris has been celebrated for his innovative spirit as several food  companies encouraged him to pursue this unlikely feat of growing chia  on American soil. Chris has fulfilled a need within the U.S. market as  many food suppliers lacked a reliable source for top quality chia  seeds. After overcoming the odds, the Kummers continue to grow and  produce their own chia and market their products direct to consumers  and to food suppliers alike. Not only are they doing a great service to  the economy and ecology of Kentucky, they are spreading the good word  about an unlikely food that greatly bolsters our body's health. Through  persistence and dedication, the Kummers have made their dream a  reality, to the great benefit of Kentucky and beyond. Congratulations  to Chris and Jill Kummer, along with the entire team at Heartland Chia.  I thank you for your innovative outlook and entrepreneurial spirit, and  I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
