[[Page S125]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. That  was an Executive order of President Obama's which provided temporary  legal status to immigrant students and young people if they registered  with the government, paid a fee, and passed a criminal and national  security background check. It was for 2 years and renewable.   Young people who are protected by DACA are known by some as Dreamers.  They came to the United States as children. They grew up singing the  ``Star Spangled Banner'' and pledging allegiance to our flag. They  believed that they were Americans, but legally, they are not. The  average DACA recipient came to the United States at the age of 6 and  has been here for approximately 20 years.   It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama. I was  joined in that letter, incidentally, by Senator Dick Lugar, a  Republican from Indiana. In that letter, I asked President Obama: Can  you find a way to protect these young people?  [[Page S134]]    We passed the Dream Act on the floor of the House. We passed it on  the floor of the Senate. We have never managed to pass it in both  Chambers in the same year. And the President created the DACA Program.   The DACA Program has been a success. Approximately 800,000 Dreamers  have come forward and received DACA protection. Let's allow them to be  part of America as teachers, as nurses, as engineers, as first  responders, and even serving in the U.S. military.   But on September 5 of this last year, 2017, Attorney General Jeff  Sessions announced that the Trump administration was setting out to  repeal DACA, to put an end to it. That same day, President Trump called  on Congress to come up with a solution to legalize DACA. He challenged  us. He said to the U.S. Senate and House: Pass a law. If this is a good  idea, pass a law.   It has been more than 4 months since the President issued that  challenge. The Republican leadership of Congress has not proposed any  legislation to legalize DACA as the President asked.   The deportation clock is ticking for these young people who are  protected. Already, 15,000 have lost their DACA status. Beginning on  March 5--the deadline that initially was imposed by President Trump-- every day for the next 2 years, 1,000 DACA young people will lose their  ability to work legally in the United States and will be subject to  being deported from this country.   Who are they? Some 20,000 of them are teachers in our schools who  would lose the right to work legally and have to leave their  classrooms. Nurses would leave their patients. First responders would  leave their posts. And 900 soldiers would lose their ability to  volunteer to risk their lives for America's future.   This isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis; it is an economic  crisis. More than 91 percent of DACA Dreamers are gainfully employed  and paying taxes. Many of them are students; yet they are still  gainfully employed because they don't qualify for Federal assistance  for higher education, so they have to work jobs, sometimes many jobs.   The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports  that DACA-eligible individuals contribute an estimated $2 billion a  year in State and local taxes. The Cato Institute, a conservative  operation in Washington, estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA  recipients will cost the economy $60 billion and result in a $280  billion reduction in economic growth over the next decade.   Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for the  Dreamers. FOX News found that 79 percent of Americans support a path to  citizenship for Dreamers, including 63 percent of Trump voters.   The answer is clear. It was 16 years ago that I first introduced the  DREAM Act--bipartisan legislation to give these young people a path to  citizenship. In July of last year, I introduced the most recent version  with my colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. We need to  pass the Dream Act, and we need to do it now, before January 19.   Over the years, I have come to the floor to tell the story of the  Dreamers. I can give a pretty nice speech here, but these stories tell  the story of this issue more than anything I can add to them. These  stories show what is at stake when we consider the fate of DACA and the  Dream Act.   Today, I want to tell you about this young lady. Her name is Evelyn  Valdez-Ward. This is the 107th Dreamer story I have told on the floor.  Evelyn was 6 months old when her family brought her from Mexico to  Houston, TX. She was quite a good student. She graduated 11th in her  high school class of 650. She took all advanced placement classes and  was a member of the National Honor Society. She was a member of the  color guard in the marching band and regularly volunteered at homeless  shelters and animal shelters.   It wasn't until she began to apply for college that she finally  learned her immigration status. She wasn't like the other students with  whom she had grown up and shared classrooms and experiences. Evelyn is  undocumented, but it didn't stop her--she was going to pursue college.   One of her teachers believed in her because she was such a bright  student and wrote her a letter of recommendation to go to college. She  was accepted into the University of Houston. She received multiple  awards while in college, including the Excellence in SI Leadership and  Mentoring Award, the American Society of Plant Biology Award for  Outstanding Research, and the Outstanding Biology Leadership Award.   The summer after her freshman year, she was offered a great research  opportunity through the National Science Foundation. Because of DACA,  she was allowed to work legally in the United States, and she was able  to pursue this important research. That opportunity was in plant water  transport research in California. This is where Evelyn fell in love  with ecology and plants.   She graduated magna cum laude in 2016 with a bachelor of science in  biology. Today, she is a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of  California, Irvine, in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary  Biology. She is researching the effects of climate change on the  interactions between plants and soil. Evelyn's dream is to continue her  research as a scientist and to become an advocate for strategies to  mitigate climate change.   In September, the American Association for the Advancement of Science  wrote a letter opposing the White House decision to rescind DACA. Here  is what they said:         Many DACA students make significant contributions to the       scientific and engineering enterprise in the United States .       . . high-achieving young people in DACA contribute in many       ways to our nation. Many are studying to become scientists,       engineers, medical doctors and entrepreneurs. Given the       administration's decision, we urge Congress to craft       legislation that provides long-term protection for these       young people who seek to continue their education and       contribute to society. . . . Our nation needs an immigration       policy that advances U.S. innovation and prosperity, and       stays true to foundational American goals that seek       contributions to society from all.    The Presiding Officer and I had a unique invitation yesterday. I  would just say that as a Member of the House and of the Senate, I have  never been invited to a meeting quite like the one we had yesterday  with the President in the Cabinet Room of the White House. It was the  President's idea. I don't know if it was a spur-of-the-moment idea, but  it is one that came together very quickly in a few days.   I think there were almost 26 of us--Democrats, Republicans, House and  Senate Members--who were called together by President Trump. I was kind  of surprised, but there I was sitting right next to the President of  the United States. It was only the third time we had ever spoken. The  other two times, incidentally, were about DACA and the Dream Act, as  you can probably guess. He invited me to sit next to him as we talked  about this issue.   Then he did something that was really unusual. I have been to some  meetings with the President in the Cabinet Room with President Obama  and President George W. Bush. Usually, what happens is, the cameras  come in, the President says a few words, then the staff tells them to  leave, and they reluctantly pull out and leave. Yesterday was quite  different. The President told the press they could stay, and they did,  for almost an hour. The conversations between the President of the  United States and Members of Congress were shared with the American  people. I had never seen anything quite like it.   I kind of liked it, to be honest with you. I think there was a lot of  candor in the room. People were expressing their points of view, and  there were many different points of view, but I think I came away from  that meeting with more hope than ever that we can do something about  DACA and the Dream Act. The President told us he would like to see it  done. He added, though, there were things he wanted to be a part of it.  One of them dealt with border security, which has been a priority for  all of us from the beginning.   We want to establish--both political parties want to establish that  we are committed to border security, and we are. How you define it,  what it costs, and how it is implemented--some of these things we can  define in our agreement; others will be left to future efforts by  Congress and the President.   Then he talked about the family unification, and that is an issue  that is very delicate. It is one that, as my colleagues can imagine,  really hits home.  [[Page S135]]  It is very personal as to whether a member of a family can bring  someone they love--some relative in their family--to the United States.  Even if they decide to bring them--incidentally, they may be waiting 30  years, in the case of those who are seeking entry into the United  States through family visas; 80 years, from China; 160 years from  Mexico. Some of these things are unrealistic and will never happen, but  to talk about family unification really strikes home with a lot of  families.   I want to hear the President's point of view, but I want to deal with  this in the most sensitive and sincere way. We don't want to flood the  United States with people who are any danger to us, No. 1, or  nonproductive citizens, but we certainly want to see families unified.   There is a question about diversity visas. I will not go into it  because it is a long story--the creation of this program, where it is  today, and where it might be in the future.   Here is what I do believe after yesterday's meeting. I believe  President Donald Trump called for that meeting because he wanted to let  the American people know he was serious. He wanted to show them he  could be a President presiding over a table with 24, 25 Members of  Congress from both political parties and tackle a sensitive, delicate,  challenging issue. He wants to show the American people he can lead. I  want to help him lead if the goal is to make sure DACA and the Dreamers  ultimately have their chance to be part of America's future.   I am willing to work in good faith with the President to compromise,  whatever it takes, to bring this forward. There are so many lives  hanging in the balance, and this is one of them--this wonderful,  brilliant young woman who wants to make not only the world a better  place but America a better place. She simply wants the chance to be  here and be part of America's future. We can give her no less.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
