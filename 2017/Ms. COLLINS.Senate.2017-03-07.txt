 Mr. President, today I wish to support the Protecting  Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act of 2017. I commend Senator  Feinstein for her leadership on this bill and for shining a spotlight  on the atrocious crimes perpetrated against young American athletes.   Sexual abuse is a heinous crime that must be eradicated in every  corner of our society. I have long worked to prevent sexual assault and  ensure that survivors have access to the resources and support they  need. Last year, the Indianapolis Star reported on allegations of  sexual abuse and misconduct made against coaches, gym owners, and other  adults affiliated with USA Gymnastics over several decades. These very  serious allegations included sexual abuse against young athletes.  Predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a  lax system of oversight. The investigation also revealed that officials  at USA Gymnastics, one of America's most prominent Olympic  organizations, failed to alert police to many incidents of sexual abuse  that occurred on their watch.   These crimes have hurt hundreds of victims across various sports.  This Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Assault Act would require  amateur athletic governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics and other  U.S. Olympic organizations, to promptly report every allegation of  sexual abuse to the proper authorities. This legislation would help  survivors receive justice and protect more people from becoming  victims.   In addition, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Assault Act  would require these national governing bodies to develop robust  policies and procedures for mandatory reporting to law enforcement and  to develop training and oversight practices to prevent abuse. This bill  would also bolster Masha's Law, the law that lets minors bring civil  suits against sexual predators and extends the statute of limitations  for such cases.   The young athletes who train to represent our country at the top  levels of competition and those at all levels who aspire to compete  should not have to fear victimization by trusted coaches and sports  officials. I want to again thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership  on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.                            ____________________
