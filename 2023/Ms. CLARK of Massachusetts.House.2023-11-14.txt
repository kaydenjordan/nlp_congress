 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman  from Connecticut, The Nutmeg State, The Constitution State, for all her  work and for yielding this time.   Mr. Chair, a budget is a reflection of our values, and what a low  value the majority places on women and children in these bills.   In the 2 minutes allotted to me, 40 Americans will be physically  abused by a partner, but instead of standing with those survivors, MAGA  Republicans are defunding the Violence Against Women Act and they are  taking away survivors' access to legal counsel. Those are the GOP's  values.   MAGA ideology is about controlling people--their health, their lives,  their bodies, and in these bills, they are continuing their march  toward a national abortion ban, defunding family planning programs,  banning providers from talking to patients about abortion care, and  banning medical students from even learning how to provide safe  abortions. Those are their values.   Millions of parents sent their kids to school today not knowing if  they will come home safe. The Republicans' response? Unleash more guns  onto the streets, including untraceable ghost guns. Those are their  values.   In these bills, they are gutting public education and childcare. They  are even defunding programs for missing and exploited children.   We see the extreme values of the GOP in these bills. These values are  not shared by the American people. We are here to serve people. These  bills work against them.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
