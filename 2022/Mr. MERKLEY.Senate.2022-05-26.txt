 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee held a hearing examining the current negotiations  around restoring the JCPOA and our Nation's Iran policy. However,  because I contracted COVID-19 and am following CDC guidance to isolate,  I was not able to attend this important hearing. But I do want to  state, for the record, that I believe preventing a nuclear-armed Iran  through hard-nosed diplomacy is of the utmost importance to our Nation.   I am under no illusions that the deal currently being negotiated by  the Biden administration would be perfect or that Iran is a good-faith  negotiating partner. But when it comes to preventing a nuclear-armed  Iran and creating a monitoring and verification regime that ensures  Iran is sticking to its commitments, it is the only option.   Maximum pressure didn't work; more sanctions only led to Iran  reconstituting its weapons program and growing its nuclear stockpile  and more nefarious behavior in the region. A military response would be  even worse; Iran would undoubtedly retaliate and be incentivized to  ratchet up its nuclear program as it has done when its nuclear  facilities and officials have been attacked in the past. Neither option  achieves our goal of preventing a nuclear-armed Iran.   The only viable option is to continue negotiations on a nuclear deal.  Doing so doesn't mean foregoing all of our other concerns with Iran.  The U.S. never should and never will acquiesce in Iran's violations of  international law and human rights and should continue to use all of  our tools to combat its malign actions. But it would be a grave mistake  to effectively green light an Iranian bomb if we are unable to convince  Iran's leadership to renounce all of Iran's other bad behavior as well.   A nuclear-armed Iran would be catastrophic for the region and the  world by emboldening a belligerent nation, setting off an arms race,  and undermining the broader nuclear order. I urge my colleagues to join  me in giving the administration the space and flexibility it needs to  restore a deal that prevents such an outcome.                            ____________________
