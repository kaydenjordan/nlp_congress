 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor The Seeing Eye and  Seeing Eye dogs for being named the State dog of New Jersey.   Seeing Eye dogs are New Jersey's cutest export. But that alone does  not capture the inspiring and important work behind an organization  that has partnered more than 17,000 service dogs in North America.   The Seeing Eye is the world's oldest guide dog school, dedicated to  enhancing the independence, dignity, and self-confidence of people who  are blind.   Headquartered in Morristown, they breed, raise, and train service  dogs, and work with blind individuals to handle and care for their  dogs.   They conduct research on canine health and development, and they  helped to lead the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.   I have seen the care the organization puts into pairing each  individual with the right dog, fundamentally transforming their owners'  lives.   I would like to thank The Seeing Eye for 91 years of leadership and  State Senator Tony Bucco and the late Senator Anthony M. Bucco for  their work to make the Seeing Eye dog New Jersey's State dog.                            ____________________
