 Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome you to tonight's  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour that will examine the  negative impact of President-elect Trump's nominations for the position  of U.S. Attorney General, Secretary of Education, and Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  [[Page H221]]    Let's be honest here, the 2016 Presidential election showed us both  the worst and the best of American politics. The most disturbing  development of the election season, of course, was the President- elect's campaign that was an ``us versus them'' type of campaign that  really divided the Nation. It was really sad for people to see that on  display.   On November 9, after winning the Presidency, the President-elect  tweeted: ``Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man  and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as  never before.''   But will he keep his promise of doing all that he can to repair our  divided nation? So far he has been very disappointing. And when you  look at the nominations of Senator Sessions, Betsy DeVos, and Tom Price  to key positions in his administration, it seems like he has forgotten,  that he has forgotten and ignored our Nation's dark history of  oppression, particularly to the African American community.                                time  1930    The President-elect's nominees represent everything that the  Congressional Black Caucus has vehemently fought against. As a caucus,  we fought to ensure that the African American community is empowered  with the tools it needs to achieve the American Dream. Mr. Trump's  Cabinet nominations are set to push the dream back so far out of reach  for millions and millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, we have a list of Members that would like to speak  tonight.   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the dean of the  United States House of Representatives.
