 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, I am looking forward to a hearing that we will have tomorrow  at 10 o'clock in the morning, at the request of Dr. Ford, that will  give all of us an opportunity to provide a fair chance to her and for  her to have her say. It is important that we do this because, during  the last 10 days, it has felt like a series of small earthquakes.  Actions taken and blunders committed by our Democratic colleagues have  destabilized the normal confirmation process and timeline.   All of this stems from the fact that the allegations made by Dr. Ford  were made to the ranking member and kept by her from other members of  the committee as well as from the background investigators, who,  normally, when allegations come up like this, protect the  confidentiality and anonymity of both the accuser and the accused until  they can be properly vetted. Yet that all went by the wayside when our  friend from California, Senator Feinstein, sat on this letter, this  accusation. So we are where we are.   As a result of the unfairness to both the accuser and the accused  because of the secrets the Democrats kept, because of the way these  were leaked to the press and the pledges of confidentiality were  violated, we know the nominee, Judge Kavanaugh, who has had six FBI  background checks in the course of his professional career, has been  subjected to multiple accusations that could and should have been  brought up much earlier.   As I say, if it had been handled during the normal, conventional  process, it would have protected Dr. Ford, and it would have protected  the nominee from this circuslike atmosphere, and we could have gotten  to the bottom of the allegation. We could have, hopefully, ascertained  where the truth lies. Yet, under this approach, under this current  situation--again, created by this failure to release the information so  it could not be investigated until after the hearing--everybody loses.  I think we all recognize the basic unfairness of this process both to  Dr. Ford and to Judge Kavanaugh and that it did not have to be this  way.   The process, as I say, has been patently unfair. That is why my  colleagues and I have been insisting on a better way forward by  returning to the process that is fair to all concerned. In the  dictionary definition, ``fairness'' is defined as the ``quality of  treating people equally or in a way that is right or reasonable.''  Another definition is ``impartial and just treatment of behavior  without favoritism or discrimination.''   How are we to handle this accusation and this challenging difference  of position on Dr. Ford's part, who said this attempted sexual assault  occurred 36 years ago, and Judge Kavanaugh, who has stated under oath  that no such thing happened? How do we get to the bottom of this?   The biggest challenge we have is time because I defy any one of us to  try to reconstruct what we were doing on a given day at a given time 35  or 36 years ago. It is just impossible to reconstruct with complete  fidelity and accuracy.   What we really need to be thinking about, I believe, is a fair  process. We have tried to provide a fair process for Dr. Ford, under  these unfortunate circumstances, to tell her story, but we also need to  provide a fair process for the nominee. This should not be a precedent  for how future nominations will be handled. We should learn from this  terrible experience and commit to doing better. One way to do better  would be to return to our basic values and principles in our government  and in our country, under our Constitution, which guarantee the rights  of a person who is accused of a crime.   I know the minority leader--my friend from New York, Senator  Schumer--has said to Judge Kavanaugh that this is not a court, that  this is a nomination, which, I presume from that, means, well, anything  goes and that there are no rules. He has been accused of a crime-- attempted sexual assault--and has testified under oath, under penalty  of perjury, that no such thing happened. This is a very serious matter,  and we need to take it seriously and not create a new framework out of  thin air, which says, somehow, if somebody makes an accusation that  cannot be corroborated by anybody else 36 years later, that that  somehow satisfies our notions of due process and of protecting the  rights of people who are accused of crimes.   Fundamentally, this is about fairness. People who have been accused  of grave misconduct have a right to due process under our Constitution.  They have a right to know who their accusers are as well as the nature  of the charges being brought against them and the evidence that will be  presented against them. Those are basic, constitutional, American  rights that are consistent with our idea of what the government's  burden should be when the government is trying to deny us our right to  liberty or property or even to our lives.   We also know these rights include a right to speedy proceedings  without unnecessary delays. Unfortunately, there have been plenty of  delays for Judge Kavanaugh. Last week, we saw Chairman Grassley  patiently wait and wait and wait some more while the legal team and  political operatives who represent Dr. Ford strung the committee along.  I am sure Judge  [[Page S6319]]  Kavanaugh was wondering: What in the heck is going on here?   As we all heard during a televised interview on Monday night, he,  unequivocally, denies the claims that have been made against him.  Again, that is a serious statement because he does so under penalty of  perjury. He said: ``I know what is the truth, and the truth is I have  never sexually assaulted anyone in high school or otherwise.'' Those  are strong words and direct words, and they remind us of something  important. It is the truth that the Judiciary Committee and the entire  country should be after--the truth. But for the truth to be our goal  this week, some of my colleagues need to dial down the rhetoric and  quit presuming guilt based on an accusation and nothing else.    At a minimum, a fair process requires a partial and open mind on the  part of those charged with determining a person's professional fate. My  fellow Senators need to remain open to receiving and evaluating  credible evidence presented at the hearing. Unfortunately for our  Democratic colleagues, that ship has sailed.   Long before Dr. Ford's allegations were leaked to the press and made  public, contrary to her wishes, all of our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle on the Senate Judiciary Committee had said that they would  vote against this nomination, so Judge Kavanaugh hardly has an open and  impartial tribunal deciding his professional fate and deciding whether  this accusation will remain a stain on his professional career and  reputation for the rest of his life.   Then, as I said, there is also the presumption of innocence. The  Supreme Court has said: ``The law presumes that persons . . . are  innocent until they are proven, by competent evidence, to be guilty.''  This is a fundamental bedrock of our constitutional system. It is  nonnegotiable. It cannot be conveniently brushed away by our colleagues  across the aisle. It is not one of several options; rather, it is  guaranteed under our Constitution. The burden of proof is always on the  party alleging wrongdoing, not the other way around.   We have the logical conundrum, as well, beyond the constitutional  one, where Dr. Ford has testified--at least in the letter--to an event  occurring. Judge Kavanaugh said it didn't happen. He said: I didn't do  that; I wasn't there. So unless the burden is on the person making the  accusation, how in the world could the person defending possibly prove  a negative when he says that it didn't happen and he wasn't there? It  is impossible. That would be a presumption of guilt, not a presumption  of innocence. That would turn our Constitution on its head.   That is why it is so important for us to hear from Dr. Ford, to  evaluate the strength of not just the allegations but what  corroboration, what other evidence, there is in order to find the  truth.   We have learned from media reports that attorneys for Dr. Ford have  affidavits of additional people who know the accuser personally, but  according to USA Today, these simply indicate that these are things  that Dr. Ford told her friends 20 or 30 years later, not witnesses of  the event that she claims occurred 35 or 36 years ago.   Let's also remember that three other eyewitnesses Ms. Ford identified  have said that they have absolutely no recollection of the events that  she says took place--none whatsoever. These are people Dr. Ford  identified as witnesses to the assault that she claims Judge Kavanaugh  perpetrated. Yet the witnesses she identified said that they have no  knowledge of such an event.   We also need to remember the context in which all of this is  occurring. Sixty-five women who went to high school with Judge  Kavanaugh have written a letter saying that he has always behaved  honorably toward them and treated them with respect. That doesn't mean  Dr. Ford is not entitled to be heard--quite the contrary.   She has a story to tell. As the father of two daughters, I want to  hear that story. I want to compare it to Judge Kavanaugh's unequivocal  denial and judge for myself the reliability of each. As a former judge  for 13 years and an attorney general for 4, I feel that doing anything  less would be shirking my duty.   We owe Dr. Ford our time, our attention, and our best efforts at  discerning the truth. That means her claims will be tested, examined,  and new information, perhaps, will be brought to light. At least that  is my hope. That is the way it should be.   We are trying to clean up the mess created by an unconventional  process of leaking allegations to members of the press after the  background test was completed and after the hearing occurred rather  than handling it the way that, as I said, it should be. We should have  started with that process, not end it here.   What the majority leader described yesterday as a disturbing pattern  should never have taken place over the last few weeks. Our colleagues  across the aisle, catching wind of an allegation, refused to share it  with the majority and, instead, waited and then made sure that it was  leaked to the press at the most politically opportune time, when it was  likely to cause the maximum disruption and embarrassment to both Dr.  Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. That is no way for the U.S. Senate to do its  business.   A search for the truth--if that, in fact, is what we are involved  with, and I hope it is--should not involve delays and the withholding  of documents. It should not involve orchestrated personal attacks on  Members either. It should not involve a mob rule like what we saw at  the first Kavanaugh hearing. It should not involve people sending coat  hangers to offices or forcing committee members to leave restaurants,  harassing them when they are trying to have dinner with their family.    People who hold a genuine concern for Dr. Ford would have honored  requests for anonymity and privacy. That is what Dr. Ford specifically  requested. They would have passed those allegations to the Judiciary  Committee so that an investigation could have been conducted in a more  timely and confidential fashion, and then they could be addressed  during the hearing, if necessary, that we had earlier this month. That  standard procedure would have treated Ms. Ford as a real person, not as  a political pawn, and it would have left the Democratic operatives who  have now been hired to dig up dirt out of the mix.   I want to say that throughout all of this, Chairman Grassley has been  exceedingly generous toward Dr. Ford, as we would all want him to be,  even when his patience has been tested. I want to commend him, once  again, because he has had a very difficult job of trying to run the  Judiciary Committee, trying to be fair to the nominee and the accuser  alike when this wrench, thrown into the spokes of the committee  operation, has created more of a circuslike atmosphere than a  deliberative process and search for the truth, testing the background  of a nominee, which is something all nominees deserve. No nominee  deserves to be dragged through the mud like this.   Chairman Grassley has been patient because he knows how important  this is and how much is on the line, not only for the Supreme Court but  also for women across this country who see a little bit of themselves  in Dr. Ford and want to make sure that their voices, like hers, are  always heard.   Over the last year, we have been in the middle of an important  national conversation on the topic of sexual assault and the way men  have treated women. As I said, I have two daughters. As I mentioned  earlier, every American has a mother. Some are lucky and have a sister  or a spouse or a daughter, and I think all of us would want to make  sure that all of those women in our lives would be treated with dignity  and respect, were they in the same position that Dr. Ford now finds  herself in.   Yet it is also important to remember that every person has a father.  Many are fortunate to have brothers or sons or husbands, and we would  want to make sure that all of those men are also treated fairly and  with respect. We would no more rather have a women's truthful claim be  ignored than an uncorroborated accusation against a man be honored.  That is fairness.   As we know, Dr. Ford is a real person, and so is Judge Kavanaugh-- flesh and blood. Each of them should be treated with fairness, with  dignity, and with respect. It is not just one or the other, which is  the false choice that many of our colleagues have suggested. We can't  pick one and dismiss the other outright and claim any fairness  [[Page S6320]]  or allegiance to our constitutional system and due process of law if we  do otherwise.   As Michael Gerson, the columnist for the Washington Post, reminded us  earlier this week, somewhere along the way this process devolved into  one that is no longer about just winning arguments but about demonizing  and destroying other people. It is not about winning arguments. It is  not about winning elections. It is not about winning votes here in the  Senate. This process has devolved into character assassination and  destroying the reputation and lives of real people. It is not too late  to change that.   This all calls to mind that famous line by Joseph Welch, a lawyer  during the McCarthy hearings. He said: ``Have [we] no sense of decency  . . . at long last?''   Well, I think we still do, and I hope Republicans and Democrats will  prove we have a sense of decency and fairness as we approach Thursday's  hearing.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3504         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

TITLE II--MARITIME SAFETY       SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.         This title may be cited as the ``Hamm Alert Maritime Safety       Act of 2018''.       SEC. 202. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On September 29, 2015, the SS El Faro cargo vessel left       Jacksonville, Florida bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico,       carrying 391 shipping containers, 294 trailers and cars, and       a crew of 33 people, including 28 Americans.        (2) On the morning of October 1, the El Faro sent its final       communication reporting that the engines were disabled and       the ship was listing, leaving the ship directly in the path       of Hurricane Joaquin and resulting in the sinking of the       vessel and the loss of all 33 lives.        (3) The National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast       Guard made recommendations to address safety issues, such as       improving weather information and training, improving       planning and response to severe weather, reviewing the Coast       Guard's program delegating vessel inspections to third-party       organizations to assess the effectiveness of the program, and       improving alerts and equipment on the vessels, among other       recommendations.        (4) Safety issues are not limited to the El Faro. For 2017,       over 21,000 deficiencies were issued to United States       commercial vessels and more than 2,500 U.S. vessels were       issued ``no-sail'' requirements.        (5) The maritime industry, particularly the men and women       of the United States merchant marine, play a vital and       important  [[Page S6344]]       role to the national security and economy of our country, and       a strong safety regime is necessary to ensure the vitality of       the industry and the protection of current and future       mariners, and to honor lost mariners.       SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.         In this title:        (1) Commandant.--The term ``Commandant'' means the       Commandant of the Coast Guard.
