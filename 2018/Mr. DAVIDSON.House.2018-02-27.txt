 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for H.R.  4296 and for the bipartisan work of our committee, the work our  chairman has helped lead; and I am encouraged that this bill will  establish clear guardrails for operational risk capital requirements  and improve U.S. capital framework as a whole.   This legislation is another example of ensuring regulators work in  the best interest of the U.S. economy rather than abiding by  international standards that hold American businesses back rather than  move them forward.   In fact, the very premise of this legislation reminds me of a song. I  remember when Bill Clinton was running, he  [[Page H1313]]  had a song about: ``Don't stop thinking about tomorrow. Yesterday is  gone; yesterday is gone.'' It is all about the future.   Well, this piece of legislation that is in place today, established  by the Basel Committee in 2006, is thinking about tomorrow, is thinking  about yesterday. What happened in the past is constraining what could  happen in the future.   So banks are reserving against past losses in an era that holds them  from being able to adopt the business plans that maybe even under new  leadership, new board members, and a whole new set of governance  requirements that will get the company moving forward at a better  growth rate. This is better for not just the company, not just the  executives or the board members, but the consumers that would be served  by this market.   Take, for instance, historic losses being reserved against. That  capital is sitting there not actively employed in the market. Even the  Basel Committee saw how ridiculous this rule is; so they updated their  guidance, in 2016, to include historical loss experience as a relevant  indicator instead of as the sole factor.   It is time that we move forward in the best interests of our country  and make rules that help American businesses instead of hold them back.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation.
