 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, many Members on both sides of the aisle have worked  hard to understand and address the issues related to per- and  polyfluorinated compounds. While I oppose H.R. 535 for both policy and  practical reasons, I commend all of my colleagues who have been engaged  on this issue.   Before I go into some of the more concerning aspects of this  legislation, I think it is instructive to highlight a few facts.   PFAS is not just one or two chemicals. According to the EPA, this  class of chemicals includes more than 5,000 different substances with  different properties, applications, and risks. In fact, EPA's master  list of PFAS on its website includes 7,866 derivations.   EPA does not have health effects data on the vast majority of PFAS.  In fact, EPA recently announced scientifically valid methods--that  means you are able to test to determine what it is--for just 29 of  these 7,866. We don't have the capability even to understand if it is  present because we don't have the capability even to identify them.   EPA has actively engaged in a PFAS action program involving many  disciplines across the agency. I recently talked to the Administrator  to urge him to move as quickly as possible with multiple action items  and timelines.   Now, enter this bill, H.R. 535. This legislation requires aggressive  regulatory responses to this diverse class of man-made chemicals  without regard to science or risk. This is an unprecedented way of  conducting science and flies in the face of decades of U.S.  environmental policy. In fact, we have  [[Page H118]]  never legislatively banned a chemical in all the years since the  Superfund, back in 1980.   To my colleagues who love to preach science on climate change, I hear  you, but you cannot walk away from the science debate when it doesn't  support your policy position. Let me say that again. For my Democratic  friends who love to preach science, you can't walk away from the  science debate on this and walk away from the fact that we need a  scientific study of this. They are trying to have it both ways.   I know many of my Democratic colleagues think this bill is essential  because they don't trust the EPA run by this President. I understand  that is your call. But I would also ask you to think about the mandates  you are placing on the Environmental Protection Agency, which will far  outlast this administration. They will legally hamstring future ones  from facing issues other than PFAS, whether it is lead or climate.   I mentioned that science-based decisions that have supported EPA's  work for years are being jettisoned, but that is just one feature. The  more long-range trouble includes the automatic designation of PFOS and  PFOA as hazardous substances under the Superfund, which is called the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,  CERCLA.   This designation may be warranted, but under this bill, it would come  without knowledge of who is responsible, where PFAS contamination is,  how serious it is, and without any public comment.   In fact, my colleagues think that putting it in the Superfund is  going to solve this problem and that they are going to be able to clean  it up right away. Well, I have a list here of Superfund sites. The  Superfund was set up in 1980. We have a site here that is still a  Superfund site back to 1983.   So those of you who think, put it in the Superfund, and it is all  going to be cleaned up, good luck. If you have dealt with this issue,  it is not going to happen, probably, in your lifetime.   Don't get me started on the perverse strict, joint and several, and  retroactive liability to releases of hazardous substances, a trial  lawyer's bonanza.   We know the majority understands this is an issue because the rule  executed provisions relieving airports from Superfund liability. Plus,  the bill requires EPA to review all 7,864 PFAS in 5 years to determine  without public comment whether they present a substantial danger.   We can't do 29 in 20 years. How are we going to do 7,866 chemicals in  5 years? It just can't be done.   While a Superfund designation for just PFOS and PFOA may seem  reasonable, the reality is section 15 of H.R. 535 deems all PFAS as  hazardous air pollutants under Clean Air Act section 112(b). This  automatically makes the entire PFAS class hazardous under the Superfund  law.   As I mentioned, innocent parties like drinking water utilities that  just treated what they got from their source water are hostage to  endless liability for cleanup, regardless of their personal  contribution. In fact, I would argue they didn't make any contribution.  Why not exclude the water districts from Superfund liability if they  are just passthroughs? No, we are taking care of the airports, but we  are not protecting municipal water systems, co-op water systems, and  other sources of drinking water, and we are going to put additional  mandates and costs on them.   I know communities with PFAS pollution want it cleaned up quickly,  but nothing, as I said before, with CERCLA is fast. It is always more  expensive than you think, and the stigma of the designation scars a  community's economy and dampens its future prospects.   Other significant problems with this legislation include section 4,  which places a commercial moratorium on new PFAS chemicals for 5 years,  even though Federal law already prevents any unsafe chemical from  entering the market until EPA scientifically reviews it and determines  its safety. This delays cleaner, greener, and safer chemicals from  coming on the market.   Let me repeat this. Existing law bans and bars any new chemical or  new use of an existing chemical from going to the market unless EPA  signs off on that and it meets a tough safety standard. This bill  places an arbitrary ban on top of that review. Next-generation heart  valves, car brakes, solar panels, and military equipment all will be  stopped from coming to market because of this.                                time  1830    Section 3 creates an unrealistic mandate on EPA to require all  manufacturers and processor testing of PFAS. This requirement overlaps  one that companies send all their existing PFAS information to the EPA  by 2023.   Regardless, why even bother doing real science when you have already  made a decision based on political science? More practically, does EPA  even have the resources to keep up with such a demand? We could have  asked them had they been invited to testify on this legislation.   These are not minor concerns. They sparked opposition, especially in  the Senate, and are the reason why these items were not included in the  National Defense Authorization Act. If this process is making good law  instead of messaging, I would urge my colleagues to keep that in mind  when voting. We can do better.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the ranking member of the full committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), a cardiothoracic surgeon.    Will the gentleman yield for purposes of colloquy?    Just to clarify: one is that we are exempting airports  from Superfund liability, but we are not exempting medical devices that  are FDA approved in infants' bodies?  [[Page H120]]         And that device that you have is a per- or  polyfluorinated compound; is that correct?    And it is FDA approved?    And if it is toxic, which means it would be defined as  harmful to a baby, why are we using it in a baby to fix the heart?    Mr. Chair, I thank the cardiothoracic surgeon for  yielding.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1 minute to respond.   Mr. Chair, if all this whole class of 7,866 chemicals is so  dangerous, why does FDA allow us to implant them in the hearts of  infant children?   If this is so dangerous--there may be a couple that are bad, we are  not disputing that, but the entire class?   If it is so bad, why does the FDA say it is okay for food packaging?   If it is so bad, why didn't my friends in the Obama administration,  in that EPA ban it? Because they want to do the scientific analysis.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, on my time, I have a question for the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz). I have great respect for the doctor and his  medical knowledge--just two questions.   One, if the medical device has been made, right, and then there is a  defect, so they throw it away, and if we have labeled that as a toxic  chemical, then that chemical in the municipal waste now becomes a  Superfund site; right?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    The answer is, under current law, H.R. 535, not amended,  the answer is yes.   So why would they make it?    No, I understand the physiology. I got that. I am just  telling you the problem with this bill.   But the question is, the device, labeled as toxic, thrown in a  municipal waste field would then become a Superfund site under current  law.   And then I guess the other question I would ask the doctor is: There  are 7,866 permutations of per- and polyfluorinated compounds. I would  ask the doctor, which one is he referring to?   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, just a couple of points. Obviously, we have numerous  problems with all of the sections of this bill.   The one that is also troubling is the 5-year ban, because under TSCA,  which we worked on, passed in a bipartisan manner, no new chemicals can  come to the market unless it is safe.   So what this bill does, is already label a per- or polyfluorinated  compound that could be very lifesaving and helpful, it puts a scarlet  letter on them beforehand and it doesn't allow it. Chemistry is the  future, cleaner, greener, and it is the future for an EV world, super  computing, you name it.  [[Page H122]]    But we are banning per- and polyfluorinated compounds. Now remember,  there are 7,866 different permutations of this. So where we accept the  premise that there may be some that are terrible, we are not accepting  the premise that they are all bad, and that is what this bill does.   I also want to highlight that Superfund designation is not salvation.  Eielson Air Force base in Fairbanks, Alaska, went on the Superfund site  November 21, 1989. It is still there after 30 years. So just think  about the community now that has been stigmatized under a Superfund  designation, and they are not going to be able to redevelop, retrain,  rebuild, and grow the economy.   I have a whole list of these things from 30 years, 32 years, 30, 35  years ago. Most of us have dealt with Superfund sites in our district.  I have. They are no fun and they are not helpful, and it takes forever.   Talking about forever chemicals, we are talking about forever  Superfund sites, and that is what you are signing up for in this  debate.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we went through the TSCA debate, one thing I learned was exposure  over time of the hazard equals the risk.                                time  1915    Sometimes, we conflate a bad chemical as risk unless you can protect  it from exposure. That is why I have been focusing on the 7,866  chemicals. That is why I am talking about the PFAS that might be in a  hockey puck but not in the bloodstream.   But this bill says that everything is going to be labeled as a  hazardous waste and followed up on Superfund. The contrary argument is:  Great, put it in the Superfund. When will that get cleaned up?   If it is in Ellison Air Force Base, Alaska, 30 years, and it is still  not cleaned up. Williams Air Force Base, Chandler, Arizona, 30 years,  and it is still not cleaned up. Castle Air Force Base, Merced,  California, 32 years, and it is still not cleaned up. Dover Air Force  Base, 30 years, and it is still not cleaned up. Central Landfill in  Johnston, Rhode Island, 33 years, and it is still not cleaned up. Walsh  Landfill, Honey Brook Township, Pennsylvania, Superfund site, 35 years,  and it is still not cleaned up. Colbert, what we have is 35 years of  litigation.   I like that red map that they are touting out here on this bill. That  red map indicates trial lawyer action in all those States because most  of the Superfund money goes to litigation.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I also want to highlight what we have  done. I think some people have alluded to it, that nothing was done,  but a lot was done in the National Defense Authorization Act. A little  bit more was done in the end-of-year spending bill. This Safe Drinking  Water Act provision could have been in, and we all know it. That could  have been in law today. But it wasn't, as leverage for this bill that  we are talking about today.   In the NDAA, we require EPA to mandate that drinking water systems  monitor for unregulated PFAS. That is law. In the NDAA, it is now law  that we provide grants to communities to address emerging contaminants  in drinking water, including PFAS.   Currently, in law, we require new reporting for PFAS under the Toxics  Release Inventory program. Currently, under law, it is required that  manufacturers and processors of PFAS submit health and safety  information. It is now law.   Current law restricts new uses of long-chain PFAS. Now, what do I  mean by long chain? That is when there are 7,866 different per- and  polyfluorinated compounds. You have long-chain ones, and you have  short-chain ones. We are banning the long chain, and again, we need  scientific research, but this bans them all, whether or not they are  safe.   EPA law now is guidance for appropriate destruction. Now currently  under law, it requires the Federal Government to work expeditiously  with States to enter in a binding cooperative agreement concerning  cleanup.   Mr. Chairman, that is in respect to your State of Michigan. Michigan  established its standard. The Department of Defense was hiding behind  the fact that it couldn't negotiate. You guys were successful. Former  Chairman Upton was part of that fight. I applaud the State of Michigan  for having that done, and now that is current law.   In the appropriations bill, which provided $2 billion for the Clean  Water and Drinking State Revolving Fund, $20 million will go to State- level PFOS cleanup.   So as we hear this debate and as we go to the amendments, we are  going to hear doom and gloom and that we are negligent, that EPA is not  doing anything, and that we are terrible people. In fact, at the end of  last year, great strides were made, in a bipartisan manner. I applaud  the NDAA. I applaud the end-of-year spending bill. And this, too, shall  end.   I do want to highlight the fact that to ban 7,866 forms of per- and  polyfluorinated compounds without doing science, that has never been  done in the history of this Chamber and this body. It is more political  science versus science.   We get it. We will move through this process. We will have our votes,  and then this will be a fight for the next Congress because the Senate  has said it is not going to support this bill. It is not going to bring  it up. The President has already issued a veto threat.   It is a good exercise. I get to practice speaking on the floor with  my friends in debate, which I look forward to as we bring up the  amendments.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I, too, rise in support of this amendment.   It is my understanding this amends section 18 to ensure the FAA,  State and local building code inspectors, and fire marshals are at the  guidance-making table. I understand the officers believe this will  result in a broader collaborative dialogue that includes the risks  posed by the use of foam suppression systems in aviation hangars. That  would be helpful. I understand that, in aircraft hangars, foam systems  are not being used by first responders pursuant to Federal regulations.   I have one question for the sponsor of the amendment about his intent  with regard to one item. Is this amendment intended to open a dialogue  about human health impacts or standards, or personal protective  equipment requirements, responses, protocols, or anything like that?    I thank my colleague for the explanation.   I also would highlight that under this bill, airports are exempt from  the Superfund liability. It does pose a question of who cleans up the  composed contamination on airports if we are going to protect airports  from the liability. I guess airports went out; other communities do  not.    Madam Chair, my colleague, Mr. Hudson, has led the  committee's efforts to address GenX on behalf of his constituents in  North Carolina. He has pressed EPA to complete its human health  toxicity assessment on GenX using science.   This amendment takes the next step to focus EPA on ways to keep  people's drinking water safe under GenX. This is a prudent step to  harness the technical expertise of the EPA to identify ways to reduce  contamination of the substance, which will be useful in connection with  EPA's other work and will aim to stop future problems like those in  Cape Fear River. I applaud my colleague and friend for his work.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This amendment makes it illegal for an industrial facility to  introduce PFAS into a sewage treatment system without first disclosing  information about that substance. This amendment effectively would  create an entirely new and duplicative regulatory program under the  Clean Water Act.   This amendment is an ad hoc attempt at regulating PFAS without any  consideration of whether or how these requirements would duplicate or  mesh with the implementation of the EPA PFAS Action Plan or similar,  already existing regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act.   The committee of jurisdiction for this provision is the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and they have held no  hearings and conducted no stakeholder or scientific community  engagement or consultation on this issue. As a result, this amendment  is nothing more than an automatic reaction to regulate in a vacuum  without risk information and without an understanding of its  consequences.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, this amendment expands EPA's Safer Choice program to  include carpets, rugs, clothing, and upholstered furniture that do not  contain PFAS.   The Safer Choice program was not meant to cover products like this,  and it will be extremely expensive and time-consuming to do so.  Revisions to the program of this type are not consistent with the  intent of the program and would require significant changes to the  program to implement it effectively.   To establish this standard, EPA would have to hold listening sessions  and propose and finalize changes to the Safer Choice standard. Public  involvement would have to be substantial.   Most importantly, for consumers' information, labeling indicating the  absence of PFAS does not necessarily mean a safer product, which  undermines the purpose of the EPA program.   In addition, when bisphenol A, commonly known as BPA, was used in  baby bottles, companies and retailers who made bottles with other  substances had no problem labeling their products as BPA-free.   In some ways, this is a taxpayer-funded advertising campaign for  corporations that can cut commercials for their products themselves.   In some ways, the Federal Government needs to get into this area. A  better way would be to have a collaborative among the EPA, the Consumer  [[Page H134]]  Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Food  and Drug Administration to make recommendations on how to convey any  risk from these products.   This is not the right way to address this issue.   Madam Chair, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate my friend and colleague from  [[Page H135]]  Michigan. He has been very active on this issue for many years now, and  I respect his intensity and his efforts. A couple of things, because a  lot of the debate was initially just on the overall bill.   It is the Senate that caused us not to enact all these provisions in  the NDAA. That is why they are on record as not going to move this  bill.   We did have a chance for the Safe Drinking Water Act to be included  in the final piece of legislation. That was blocked by someone, and  now, here we are.   The President has threatened to veto the act. You are correct about  that.   Mr. Kildee also raised the benefits of what we did do, and I listed  them earlier, from the EPA to mandate that drinking water systems  monitor for unregulated PFAS, provide grants to communities, require  new reporting of PFAS under the Toxics Release Inventory program,  require manufacturers and processors of PFAS to submit health and  safety information--these are all law today--restrictions on new uses  of long-change PFAS, guidance for appropriate destruction of per- or  polyfluorinated compounds, require the Federal Government to work  expeditiously with States to enter into binding cooperative agreements.  That is particularly important for the gentleman's State, which was a  success. Of course, I have many more.   I would also like to highlight the appropriations bill, which  included $2.8 billion for the Clean Water and Drinking Water State  Revolving Fund, with that $20 million going for this issue.   You do adequately highlight the success that we made at the end of  last year on these two programs. We don't want to diminish the success.  I know it is not as far as a lot of people wanted to go, but there was  some success.   To your amendment, it is a federalism debate. Water wells in States  are regulated, controlled, and tested by the States, not the EPA.   Under this amendment, the Federal Government would have to collect  and manage information about individuals and their property. This  amendment, both broad and vague at the same time, would be an enormous  expansion of the Federal Government into an area that has been governed  by States.   If these wells in the gentleman's State are not being tested, they  are not being tested by his State, and I know his State is very  aggressive.    I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Reclaiming my time, so you are saying your State is not  capable of doing it themselves? I mean, your State health department  can't do the research?   You are also talking about private wells on private property,  bringing the Feds in to list the water systems for that. Obviously,  under the system of Federal Government, we are raising some concerns on  that amendment.   Let me continue. If I have some time, we can go on.   In addition to State departments of health that certify the  laboratories--it is your department of health that certifies the  laboratories that test the water, not EPA, as this legislation implies.   It would place a lot of burdens on EPA to carry out a program that  States and local governments could more easily and appropriately  handle. It would also likely take more than a year to establish this  program, which is all the bill provides in this statutory language.   I believe this amendment also places serious unfunded mandates on  States.   Finally, I have questions about whether the information being  collected and disseminated under this amendment can be done in a way  that meets the proper risk communication strategies called for in the  Brown amendment.   That is why we have problems with this amendment.    I yield to the gentleman, my friend.    I wish I could debate longer, but my time has expired.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, while I will not oppose this amendment, this  section, in particular, is objectionable. But putting Agency decisions  on their website sounds like a reasonable proposal.   I am concerned about the timing of 60 days--that would be something  that the Agency can do without a problem--and would have preferred that  the Agency was invited to testify on sweeping an antiscience bill and  its implications.  [[Page H136]]    I do not intend to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Pallone for supporting the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will use the time that I have available.   This amendment provides reimbursement funding for treatment  technologies that were purchased up to 5 years ago. The program for  which this amendment is offered is supposed to aid communities that  have demonstrated problems and are economically disadvantaged and  cannot afford the new technology because of the expense. That is why we  have the program.   This amendment suggests that community water systems that had the  means and no expectation of Federal funding to pay for them get money  for past work. It does not seem a fair use and diversion of taxpayer  resources considering the expense of the technology that can currently  meet the criteria of an eligible technology and the unknown nature of  the communities that might need it.   According to the EPA, there are few, if any, reverse osmosis  treatment options that are economically viable on a mass scale that  would remove all detectable amounts of PFAS.   I understand the intent of the legislation, but our grant and loan  programs are designed for communities that can't afford the expense.  What my colleague is asking is that those communities that could and  did make the investment, that they then be reimbursed, thus depriving  communities that can't afford to do it an opportunity to obtain it.   Mr. Chair, that is why we object to the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I do not oppose it.   The Acting CHAIR (Miss Rice of New York). Without objection, the  gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we support the amendment because we think  it is important to have a national risk communication strategy.   We get troubled and we get confused in this debate when we are going  to declare 7,866 chemicals toxic without doing the basic science.  Hopefully, as we move this forward, I believe we are going to find some  of the 7,866 that are safe, so when we do a risk advisory, we are going  to be able to say: These are bad; these are okay.   What the bill does is just say they are all bad, and we don't have  any science to prove that. I think we are close on PFOA, and we are  close to that on PFOS.   Again, we could have moved in a bipartisan manner to address those.  We didn't do that. But we would like, as the EPA considers this and  informing the public, that they look at hazard identification, exposure  assessment, and a risk characterization.   So risk is a combination of time and exposure over a period of time.  You can talk to toxicologists. That is what they do. That was the glue  that held the TSCA bill together was the focus on using science.   Again, as you have heard tonight and you will hear tomorrow, our  problem is that we are rushing legislation before we are allowing the  science to truly evaluate this, and we are classifying, currently, all  7,866 as hazardous, which I don't believe they are.   We have never, in the history of this Republic, under the Superfund  Act, legislatively banned a chemical. We have always allowed scientific  process.   So I think the amendment is helpful in that it helps us be able to  clarify when we do the scientific analysis what is safe, what is not.   Informing the public is good. Transparency is great. We support the  amendment. We appreciate the gentleman bringing it forward.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2045     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I understand this reflects an effort to improve this  proposal from when we considered it under the National Defense  Authorization Act, but I don't know what has changed or what it means  since there has been no hearing or a markup record for me to consult to  better appreciate this proposal or its impacts.   There are 7,866 per- and polyfluorinated compounds listed on EPA's  PFAS master list, an uninformed policy could carry massive unintended  consequences on the liability and regulatory forms.   As I read it, this amendment continues an antiscience mindset that  seeks to regulate first, without adequate knowledge or understanding of  the per- and polyfluorinated compound situation and then say, okay, we  will figure it out later.   This amendment covers PFAS substances that may not necessarily be  what chemicals the industry is currently using, and simultaneously  mandates creating new standards for every measurable PFAS chemical  substance. This means EPA will be forced to divert resources to chase  those PFAS that are no longer in use and may not be necessary.   The amendment requires EPA to regulate PFAS compounds through the  Clean Water Act without validated analytical methods for detention in  wastewater; without established science or human and environmental  impacts to determine appropriate and  [[Page H139]]  legally, scientifically defensible standards; and without an  understanding of how best to treat and remove pollutants from  wastewater, even if there was a validated method for detection.   The deadline in this amendment will likely make EPA's work to  implement it vulnerable to a legal challenge, delaying any real benefit  that the proponents want from it, and enriching the trial bar in the  process.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, we all support the territories having funding to address  their drinking water needs. The biggest concern is, the territories  really operate from a different system because they don't have the loan  program. They don't really have the money to pay back the loan program.  So there is a system by which grant funding is awarded to the  territories to make up this need.   So the concern is that the amendment may disenfranchise the States  from taking from the revolving fund program, when the territories,  historically, because they don't use that, they get more grant money.  So that is why we oppose it. We think it is going to impact the States'  ability to apply for these funds, and we think that the territories  have a different method of grant funding to meet their qualities and  needs.   I request a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good attempt to try to bring some  sense to this bill, and I appreciate my colleague's attempt.   What the amendment does is it really creates unachievable  expectations. There are a lot of problems with the amendment, but one  is that you are asking for a final rule within 100 days, especially if  it is not proposed, which is going to set up a deadline suit.   I have dealt with deadline suits. You got a deadline, and they can't  meet it, then the agency gets sued.   Why do we pay utilities to hold nuclear waste? Because they have  enacted a deadline suit because we say we are going to take their  waste, the Federal Government. We didn't take their waste, and now we  have to pay the utilities to hold the waste that we were supposed to  take.   That is one issue that I have a concern.   Mr. Chairman, 7,866 compounds, Clean Air Act aspects, and you are  going to have, as I used numerous times during the National Defense  Authorization Act debate, as I have used on the rule debate, these  7,866 different aspects of PFAS we are coming to the floor not using  science, not using due diligence, but using political science to say  ban it.   Our argument has always been to let's do the science. The problem is,  science takes a long time, and the political emotion of this debate  just can't wait.   We have addressed a lot of these concerns everybody raised throughout  the night through the enacted National Defense Authorization Act and by  the omnibus bill. But if you look at the F-16 and the component parts,  and we could have an automobile in the new electric vehicle era, new  battery technology, medical devices, they are all going to have some  type of per- or polyfluorinated compounds.   This amendment with the bill really is a de facto ban on the use of  all per- and polyfluorinated compounds, or it is going to scare the  producers of this, that they don't want to get caught in a litigation  trap, so they are just not going to produce it.   We have talked about firefighting foam quite a bit tonight. It is  really a great debate because we do think there is some bipartisan  nature that we can get to on that chemical.   If you are in a nuclear sub underneath the Arctic icecap and a fire  happens on the sub, do you want the second-best firefighting foam? I  mean, really, do you? The second-best means it takes more time, and it  takes more water. I don't think you do. But this is where we stand.   The amendment creates both an unrealistic burden and a litigation  problem, and the EPA cannot possibly fulfill our requirement to review  all PFAS for inclusion in the clean air policy in 5 years. We only have  29 methods of determining per- and polyfluorinated compounds right now,  just 29. There are 7,866, and the amendment says to do it in 5 years.   I wish it could be done. I have been here a long time. Government  moves slowly. When we throw all these sites into the Superfund, people  are going to be hollering about it for 40 years. I read the list  earlier of all these Superfund sites that haven't been remediated. Now,  we are just going to expand that. Pull up the map of the country and  all those red States, either that is going to be where all the  Superfund sites are or that is where all the class action lawsuits are  going to be filed in those States to take down those companies that are  providing either safe medical devices or equipment for our career and  best airplanes and technologies.   Again, I want to applaud my colleague. I think this is something we  could have done. We actually were talking about this in a compromise  provision. We couldn't get there because of other issues. It is a  valiant attempt. My friend is in the majority, and it is going to pass.  Unfortunately, the Senate is not going to take up this bill, and the  President already has a veto message on the bill. So it will be teed up  for the next Congress, and I wish the gentleman luck.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but  I do not plan to object to it.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, there is no objection to having EPA obtaining technical  input on technologies that are effective in removing PFAS from drinking  water. I am concerned how formal a process the amendment seeks to  impose. I was going to ask questions of Mr. Kim or Mr. Pallone. They  are not here, and that is fine.   The amendment only calls for public comment, but a full-blown notice  and opportunity for public comment is an enormously expensive and time- consuming process for any agency, including the EPA. If the focus of  the bill is to meet the timelines it imposes and not hold up  grantmaking for a public comment process to play out, I think this  amendment needs to be rethought a bit to get at the author's intent  without tripping up EPA from executing the program.   I will not oppose this amendment because I know there are larger  problems with this bill that will prevent it from becoming law, but I  want to highlight that this is an acceptable amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman from Maine's problem with  the airports. Fortunately, we have exempted airports from Superfund  liability, and there is not going to be an ability for the gentleman's  sites to get cleaned up.   Other than that, based upon this amendment, we think the basic  amendment is unnecessary. There is no objection to having EPA report  annually on firefighter foam guidance. This amendment, though, does not  have an end to annual reporting, and firefighting foam with fluorine is  supposed to be phased out in 3 years under the military specs. Maybe  moving forward, there could be a deadline.   In addition, the amendment asks for recommendations to Congress to  reduce exposure to PFAS and firefighting foam. This assumes that any  remaining foam is hazardous, and meaningful safe is not examined, only  exposure, a very nonscientific way to address the problem.   Plus, I would prefer that there be some discussion, considering who  is writing the report. The foam effect in this is discussed. Let's not  add incomplete reporting. An underlying bill places enough unnecessary  burdens on the public.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague. I rose in  opposition, just so she understands that I will be speaking in  opposition to the amendment. I appreciate the kind words.   Mr. Chair, I wish she would have been here when the Rice amendment  was on the floor, which has been passed and added to the bill, which  would now allow the rich communities that have already paid for their  modifications at great expense to be able to dip back into these funds  at the expense of rural communities. That was an amendment we passed  earlier.   Mr. Chair, under this legislation, EPA is supposed to issue a  national primary drinking water standard for PFAS, but PFOA and PFOS at  a minimum. Once this is done, communities that are disadvantaged--and I  am from rural Illinois, 33 counties--one, assistance for installing  technology are eligible for the drinking water State-revolving loan  programs.   This amendment creates a double-dipping opportunity for communities  when the main focus of the Safe Drinking Water Act State revolving fund  is to help struggling systems meet the mandate it imposes to protect  public health.   More practically, because of budget allocations that the House  appropriators are supposed to operate under, increased capitalization  grants will suffer. Money, to the tune of $75 million, will be diverted  to this particular PFAS grant program at the expense of the State  revolving fund.   Communities, especially rural communities, not only with PFAS but  other compliance and health problems as well, could and will likely be  a loser, so that is why I rise in opposition to the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
