 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support of the  Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill I'm proud to have voted for in the  previous Congress.   Today, women make up the majority of the college-educated workforce,  yet only earn approximately 82 percent of what men earn. For women of  color, the pay gap is even worse.   This legislation is critical because it makes significant progress in  eliminating pay discrimination against women by providing them the  necessary protections and tools to combat sex-based pay discrimination.   Simply put, ensuring that one half of the workforce is paid as much  for the same job as the other half is a matter of basic rights and  fairness. Women deserve better, and I look forward to voting for this  bill once again.                                time  1400
