 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for yielding  and for the good work she is doing on this and so many other bills.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   In today's world, when technology allows us to constantly be logged  into the workplace, it is understandable that Americans often find  themselves seeking more convenient meals outside of the home.   But dining out should not be about sacrificing nutrition. I believe  Americans should have all the tools necessary to make informed choices  about what they eat and what they feed their families.   Why wouldn't we want that? Why wouldn't we let the consumer decide?  Why would we try to rob some tools and take things away from them?   Menu labeling gives Americans those tools, and we have been making  progress towards more transparent labeling for consumers. It is a good  thing.   This bill, H.R. 772, would undo that process. It delays much-needed  transparency and will cause confusion for both consumers and  businesses, many of which have already started implementing existing  menu labeling requirements.   So let's not turn back the clock. Menu labeling is both a vital  public health tool and an important consumer protection. People are  smart enough to make their own choices. If you want to make it  impossible for them to know everything, then you are not allowing the  consumer to make the final choice in an informed way. I don't see why  we would want to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                                time  1315
