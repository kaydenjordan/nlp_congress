 Madam Speaker, on H.R. 2116, the Creating a  Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2021, I am not  currently recorded as a cosponsor. It was my intention to serve as a  cosponsor of this legislation, but because the bill has now been  reported by the appropriate Committees and placed on the Union  Calendar, I am not able to do so.
