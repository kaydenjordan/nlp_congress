 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about something  miraculously happening in California.   For the first time in decades, we are on the verge of building new  infrastructure for our water. We have been waiting since 1979 to  actually build something new.   Last Friday, with the signing, Shasta, a big improvement raising the  spillway 630,000 new acre feet of water, and now, next week, passing  the WRDA bill, which is actually the New WATER Act financing for Los  Vaqueros, Sites, and Temperance Flat, it is time to build things in  California and save our number one industry, agriculture.   These are real solutions and real dollars. We are going to get it  built.                            ____________________
