 Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor our men and  women in law enforcement. As Members of Congress and their staffs head  home this holiday season, we must remember the sacrifice of those who  make our communities safe, those who make our safety possible.   This year, across the United States, 143 law enforcement officers  have paid the ultimate price.   In Colorado, we honor three fallen officers. We honor Deputy Sheriff  Heath McDonald Gumm, whose final act was to bravely pursue an armed  suspect. We will never forget the courage and bravery of his action. We  honor Deputy Sheriff Micah Lee Flick, who was killed in the line of  duty in February of this year after serving in the El Paso County  Sheriff's Office for 11 years. We also honor the memory of Sergeant  Matthew Moreno, who was killed in the line of duty in Las Animas County  just last week. He was responding to reports of domestic violence when  his cruiser and that of another officer's crashed into a civilian's  vehicle that was headed in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, the  occupants of the other vehicle, including a 1-year-old child, also lost  their lives.   The pain of losing loved ones this close to the holidays is  unimaginable.   Sergeant Moreno ends his watch after having served honorably for 5  years. He is survived by his loving family, including his three  beautiful children, Summer, Morgan, and Jared. He has been described as  being a superhero to his kids. It seems very fitting given the bravery  that he showed throughout his career. He is also remembered for his  sense of humor and his love for hunting and fishing--something all  Coloradans can relate to. Our prayers are certainly with Sergeant  Moreno's family and with the families of those in the other vehicle. I  also offer my sincere condolences to the entire Las Animas County  Sheriff's Department. The officers have not just lost a fellow officer  but a brother.   All of the officers whom we lost this year were neighbors, beloved  family members, and extraordinary Coloradans who gave their lives to  protect their communities. Although the need is great, so few of us are  blessed with the level of bravery and courage shown each and every day  by the men and women in law enforcement.   As we all enjoy the warmth of this holiday season, law enforcement  officers around the country will stand guard in cold and uncertain  streets. This includes the selfless men and women who serve right here  in the U.S. Capitol, who work through the holidays to ensure that every  American who visits the Nation's Capitol can do so safely. It is  important that we keep them in our thoughts as we gather with family  and friends this holiday season to celebrate.   I would also like to take a moment to thank the families of these  brave men and women whose sacrifices must not be forgotten. They endure  time apart from their loved ones so that families, like millions across  this country, will know peace and security during their holiday  celebrations.   When thinking about the brave men and women who defend that thin blue  line, I am always reminded of the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who said,  ``American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheepdog--always  standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.'' It is my hope  that the thoughts and prayers we all offer to those who wear the blue  uniform will bring them comfort as they carry out this solemn duty. I  am thankful for their service and thankful to their families for their  continued sacrifice.   I am also reminded of the words of Joe Rice, a former State  legislator in Colorado, with whom I served. He served multiple tours in  Iraq and Afghanistan and wrote how he prays for his fellow soldiers and  their safety each and every day by saying and praying:         For all of those around the world in harm's way, we pray       with you. Please God, just not today.    Each and every day, we echo that same prayer.   Thank you to the men and women in blue.   I also thank my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, for  allowing me to speak out of turn. I greatly appreciate it.   I thank the Presiding Officer for taking the Chair.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 2736.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 2736) entitled       ``An act to develop a long-term strategic vision and a       comprehensive, multifaceted, and principled United States       policy for the Indo-Pacific region, and for other       purposes.'', do pass with an amendment.                               Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment,  and I ask unanimous consent that the motion be agreed to and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I rise to celebrate a momentous  bipartisan achievement--this bill that we just passed for our Nation's  foreign policy.   Shortly, we will send this legislation, now--after its passage--to  the President's desk: Gardner-Markey, also known as the Asia  Reassurance Initiative Act.   I first want to thank an incredible partner throughout this entire  effort,  [[Page S7866]]  Senator Markey and his staff, for their incredibly hard work on this  bill and their efforts to get this bill over the finish line. I believe  we have set a strong example of how major foreign policy can be  accomplished in a very thorough and bipartisan fashion, and I look  forward to our next effort together.   I also want to thank Senators Cardin and Rubio and their staffs, as  well, for early and consistent support on this effort.   Thanks go to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Senator  Corker, the ranking member, Bob Menendez, and their staffs for helping  to shepherd this effort through the Foreign Relations Committee, where  ARIA passed unanimously on September 26, 2018.   I want to thank and extend my gratitude to the majority leader, Kevin  McCarthy, and his staff for their hard work to pass this bill through  the House of Representatives with only minimal changes, by voice vote,  last week.   Leader McConnell and his staff took an early interest in this effort,  and it could not have been done without their support.   I am grateful to Leader Steny Hoyer, the chairman and ranking member  of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, and  Representative Illeana Ros-Lehtinen for their support.   Nearly 2 years in the making, the Gardner-Markey ARIA Initiative will  establish a generational, multifaceted, and principled U.S. policy in  the Indo-Pacific region, a region that is vital for U.S. national  security and economic interests. ARIA is important because the Indo- Pacific is home to half of the world's population, half of the world's  GDP, the world's largest standing armies, and six U.S. defense treaty  allies.   The security and economic future of the United States depends on  having the right policies to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Therefore, the Gardner-Markey ARIA establishes and provides new  resources for a long-term strategy to enhance security cooperation with  our allies and establishes the Asia-Pacific security initiative.   It promotes American businesses through trade opportunities, projects  American values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law  throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is a bill designed to drive U.S.  leadership as other powers turn to economic colonialism.   Starting in June 2017, Senator Markey and I have held over five  hearings at the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee to inform this  legislation. The hearings examined a range of national security,  economic, and rule of law challenges in the Indo-Pacific and culminated  in a final hearing with State Department and Department of Defense  officials to allow the administration to express its views on ARIA.   We introduced ARIA on April 24 of this year with a bipartisan group  that included Senators Rubio, Cardin, and Young. On June 21, we  received a letter signed by Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis  formally endorsing ARIA. The letter states:         [We] value the ARIA legislation's reaffirmation of the       United States' security commitments to our Indo-Pacific       allies and partners. Furthermore, ARIA's focus on promoting       stronger regional economic engagement--and its support for       democracy, the rule of law, and the development of civil       society--is especially welcome as part of a diplomatically-      led whole-of-government approach to the Indo-Pacific region.    The Gardner-Markey ARIA passed the Foreign Relations Committee  unanimously on September 26. It passed unanimously on the floor of the  Senate on December 4, and the House passed ARIA by voice vote, as I  mentioned, December 12.    This bill is a rare piece of bipartisan legislation that enjoys broad  support in the Congress and the White House but is also strongly  supported by the business community and policy experts.   On June 4, the Wall Street Journal editorial board endorsed ARIA,  stating:         Congress is trying to help with the bipartisan Asia       Reassurance Initiative Act. . . . The Senate bill affirms       core American alliances with Australia, Japan, and South       Korea, while calling for deeper military and economic ties       with India and Taiwan. It notably encourages regular weapons       sales to Taipei.    The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also endorsed ARIA, stating:         The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the ``Asia       Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018'' and thanks Senator       Gardner [and Markey] for [their] efforts to strengthen U.S.       strategic and economic relationships across the Indo-Pacific       region.        Particularly with regard to the legislation's economic       goals, we appreciate the bill's focus on closer trade ties,       stronger protections for intellectual property, and a renewed       focus on trade facilitation.    The Heritage Foundation wrote on December 6:         Don't look now, but a sweeping bill with bipartisan support       in Congress and the backing of the Trump administration is       one step closer to becoming reality. The Asia Reassurance       Initiative Act, introduced by Sen. Cory Gardner . . . along       with key cosponsors Ed Markey . . . and Marco Rubio . . .       passed the Senate on Wednesday. This was a welcome display of       leadership.    In these partisan times, the bill has garnered support from both  current and former administration officials and experts across the  political spectrum. As the Singapore-based Straits Times wrote on  December 13:         Under the Obama administration, there was a big rhetorical       commitment to the Asia Pacific or Indo-Pacific region, but       the US ``just flat out did not readjust our resources in a       way that actually backed that up,'' said Dr. Lindsey Ford,       Director of Political-Security Affairs for the Asia Society       Policy Institute.        The ARIA marks an important start to rectifying that, she       said.        ``The ARIA . . . if passed, would be probably one of the       most consequential pieces of funding legislation that has to       do with Asia, that US Congress would have passed in years,''       Dr. Ford told Straits Times.    When you have the Heritage Foundation and former Obama administration  officials on the same page, you know we have done something right.   So again, I want to congratulate this body--truly the world's most  deliberative Chamber, as this bill has proved--for this bipartisan  victory, and I hope the President will sign this important bill into  law shortly.   Again, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Markey, for his  tremendous leadership on this.   I yield the floor to Senator Markey.    Mr. President, as my colleague from Utah knows, we  offered the chance to vote on those two words tonight. The two words  that he is asking for tonight we offered a chance to vote on.    Let me talk about this because I am pretty doggone upset  because the people of Colorado tonight--who are worried about whether  they can protect themselves from fire--lost the Wildfire Technology Act  in this bill. That was in this bill--a bill that our committee heard,  that our committee voted on, that it voted on with bipartisan support,  probably unanimously. That was in this bill to protect our communities  from wildfire and to protect our firefighters from injury--in this  bill.   The other thing in this bill is Minturn, CO, which has a water system  [[Page S7902]]  over a wilderness area and which for years has been trying to fix it.  They can't because it is in a wilderness area. So we have to have an  act of Congress to allow the city to fix their water system. Rejected  tonight because we weren't allowed to vote on it tonight.    And you bet the permanent Land and Water Conservation  Fund is in here tonight because, guess what, it has the majority  support of this body. If we had a vote on it tonight, it would have  passed. Republicans and Democrats would have voted yes. It would have  passed.   Not only that, we have boundary adjustments in here because people  died, and they wanted to give it to the national monument. That is not  controversial. Somebody wanted to do the right thing, and doggone it,  we can't even vote on it here.   I give compliments to the chairman of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee who struck a deal. Yes, it was yesterday. We got  the bill as fast as we could. And so many of these doggone pieces of  legislation we have already heard. We had committee hearings on them,  and we voted them out unanimously. Bipartisan support. We offered deal  after deal after deal to try to get a deal arranged and made so that we  could have a vote tonight.   Go tell the people of Minturn, CO, that they don't have a water  system that they can fix because Congress has decided we are not going  to allow that to come to a vote. Sportsmen back home--tell them we are  not going to have a sportsmen's package because we decided not to bring  a bipartisan bill to the floor for a vote.   When we come back to this body next year, we have an agreement--I  believe that is correct; and I will defer to the chairman of the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee--that this will be one of the first  actions this Chamber addresses. When that happens, there will be a  chance to file cloture, there will be a chance for open debate, and we  will have that vote. We will have it next year. There will be different  leadership in the Senate, so different negotiations will have to take  place, but I have no doubt that we will get this done.   It is frustrating to me that some of these bills have languished for  year after year after year after year that received unanimous support  out of committee.   I remember coming to this floor a year ago offering a unanimous  consent agreement. It was objected to because somebody didn't get what  they wanted, somebody else didn't get what they wanted, and somebody  else didn't get what they wanted, so everything was objected to. It  created a whole domino effect, so they said just wait for the lands  package.   So here we are waiting for the lands package. We had a chance to do  it. And we tried and tried and tried to make offer after offer to get  something agreed to.   I have great respect for my colleague from Utah. We are a public  lands State too. Yes, our agencies need to make better decisions about  how they conserve that public land. The people of Colorado have great  support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Great support. They  would like to see it made permanent. I would like to see it made  permanent. My guess is, next year, it will be made permanent.   Why can't we have a vote tonight? Why can't we have people who don't  like it vote no and people who do like it vote yes? There is plenty of  opportunity to do that tonight.   The people of Colorado expect this place to get its work done. The  bills we have had have been through, negotiated in the House and  Senate, many out of the committee with bipartisan support, if not  unanimous. I guess the folks in Minturn will just have to wait one more  Congress to get their water system fixed because this body couldn't  agree to allow a vote. We wonder why people are sick of this place. It  is because of that.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that Sean McClintock, a  congressional fellow in Senator Cotton's office, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the 115th Congress.
