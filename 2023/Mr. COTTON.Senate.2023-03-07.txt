 I yield the floor.    Madam President, there is one foreign leader for whom the  Democratic Party seems to reserve special scorn. Leading Democrats have  called him a reactionary, a racist, an ethnonationalist. They have  accused him of committing war crimes and of leading an apartheid state.  President Biden has called him extreme and has said they don't agree on  a damn thing. Strong words.   Who is this monster, you may ask. Were the Democrats talking about  Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping or, perhaps, Ayatollah Khamenei? No. They  were referring to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving Prime  Minister and one of America's best friends.   Once again, these Democrats have proven their party's tendency to  coddle our enemies and condemn our friends. But the Democrats don't  stop at mere words. They are working right now to undermine Bibi and  his government.   Yesterday, the Washington Free Beacon reported that the State  Department is funneling your tax dollars to Netanyahu's domestic  opponents. Since 2020, the State has sent more than $38,000 to  something known as the Movement for Quality Government, for so-called  democracy education.   So what is the Movement for Quality Government, and how good is this  democracy education?   This movement is an activist group that is fomenting unrest against  the Israeli Government and demanding Netanyahu's resignation. In recent  days, leftwing demonstrators associated with this group have protested  the government's proposed judicial reforms. Last week, hundreds of  protesters harassed Netanyahu's wife, forcing police to intervene and  escort her to safety.   Far from staying neutral in Israel's domestic affairs, Secretary of  State Tony Blinken lectured Netanyahu about the judicial reforms to his  face, tacitly siding with the demonstrators. Some Democratic Senators  have also condemned the reform proposals, which is awfully rich coming  from Democrats who have voted to shred this Senate's ancient rules to  pack our Supreme Court and to rewrite our founding documents. I guess,  when American liberals want to change the courts, it is the only way to  save democracy; but when Israeli conservatives want to, it is a threat  to democracy. Go figure.   The State Department doesn't even deny it is funneling money to these  leftwing activities, by the way, which is troubling because it is a  clear violation of the usual State Department policy against funding  foreign partisan organizations.   Not only is this U.S.-funded organization subverting a foreign  government, it is subverting the government of one of our closest  allies. Secretary Blinken should immediately apologize to the Prime  Minister of Israel, demand your money back, and open an investigation  into how this happened. But then again, I suspect we already know how  this happened. After all, the Democratic Party has been meddling in  Israeli democracy to undermine Benjamin Netanyahu for more than a  quarter century.   By his own admission, President Bill Clinton intervened in the 1996  Israeli election to support Netanyahu's opponent, Shimon Peres. Clinton  met with Peres; dispatched his own campaign advisers; dangled policy  shifts to Israel--all to get Peres across the finish line. Netanyahu  prevailed nevertheless.   Team Clinton intervened, yet again, in 1999. The Clinton White House  reportedly urged Democratic donors to give money to Netanyahu's next  opponent, Ehud Barak.   And it didn't stop there. Clinton's political advisers again  campaigned against Bibi while the Clinton State Department allegedly  spread falsehoods about the Israeli Government and Netanyahu himself.   Netanyahu lost this time around; though, he was more of a victim of  his own success against Palestinian terrorism than Barak and Clinton's  campaign against him. But Bibi returned to the Knesset just 3 years  later and became Prime Minister again in 2009.   The Obama State Department was, if anything, worse than Clinton's in  its funneling of hundreds of thousands of your tax dollars to a group  called the OneVoice Movement. Not coincidentally, OneVoice partnered  with an organization running anti-Netanyahu ads that was advised by-- you guessed it--a top Obama campaign operative.   Of course, the Democrats will insist they are innocent of these  charges and aren't meddling in Israel's democracy, but Israelis know  the truth. Obama's meddling was so pervasive that an astounding 62  percent of Israelis thought he was interfering. Indeed, one Foreign  Policy magazine headline read ``Obama is Pursuing Regime Change in  Israel''--not in Iran--our mortal enemy--but in Israel, mind you.   Now Joe Biden is simply following in Obama's footsteps by trying to  sabotage Netanyahu. In 2021, the Biden administration reportedly  pressured the United Arab Emirates to cancel an Abraham Accords  Summit--all to deprive Netanyahu of a diplomatic victory ahead of that  year's election. Then, after Netanyahu won the 2022 election, the Biden  administration immediately sought to undermine his coalition government  by trying to veto key Cabinet appointments.   This most recent scandal is not an aberration, therefore. It has been  the de facto policy of the Democratic Party for a quarter century to  beat Netanyahu, though he keeps beating the Democrats. Though, it does  provide more evidence, yet again, for the old saw that while it is  dangerous to be America's enemy, it can be fatal to be America's  friend--at least when the Democrats are in charge.   Instead of trying to topple the democratically elected Government of  Israel, I would suggest we should support it. Israelis are more than  capable of managing their domestic affairs without Democratic meddling,  but they need our help to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb; they  need our help to achieve peace with their neighbors; and they need our  help to defeat the terrorists who are threatening both of our nations.   They don't get that from the Biden administration either. Iran is  racing toward a nuclear breakout while the President dithers. His  administration can barely utter the words ``Abraham Accords,'' and  President Biden is  [[Page S672]]  breaking U.S. law to subsidize the Palestinian Authority's support for  terrorism.   A few years back, Congress passed the Taylor Force Act, which  prohibits nonhumanitarian aid to the Palestinian Authority until it  ends its so-called martyr payments--a euphemism for bounties given to  Palestinian terrorists or their families for maiming and killing Jews.  So the administration has, instead, funneled tens of millions of your  tax dollars to nongovernmental organizations to build roads, sidewalks,  parking lots, and other infrastructure projects on behalf of the  Palestinian Authority. As a result, since money is fungible, the  Palestinian Authority can ignore these basic responsibilities of  government and, instead, keep pouring more money into its pay-for-slay  program.   The contrast couldn't be starker. If the Palestinian Authority wants  to bankroll terrorists and their families, the Biden administration  will contort the law beyond recognition to fund the Palestinians; but  if a center-right government gets elected once again in Israel, the  Biden administration will work overtime to undermine it. This is  exactly backward. We should demand the Palestinian Authority stop  subsidizing terrorism before it gets another penny of your tax dollars.   While we are at it, we should pass the Taylor Force Martyr Payment  Prevention Act, which I am reintroducing this week, to sanction foreign  banks that process these so-called martyr payments for the Palestinian  Authority.   Meanwhile, President Biden and his administration should quit  treating Prime Minister Netanyahu like he is a rival or even an  adversary and start treating him as he is--a war hero, a courageous  patriot, a towering figure of modern Israel, and most importantly for  us, a great friend of America.                            ____________________     Madam President, there is one foreign leader for whom the  Democratic Party seems to reserve special scorn.
