 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) for  their great leadership. But let me thank the gentlewoman from New York  again for her overall leadership as chair of the Appropriations  Committee, and her ranking member as well.   These are the tools of female genital mutilation. Around the world,  there are young girls and women who are facing this kind of brutal  attack. My amendment, which makes a good bill even better, provides $1  million more to help combat the draconian practice of female genital  mutilation, cutting, FGM/C, abroad.   Female genital mutilation comprises all procedures that involve  partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other  injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical purposes.   This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to  other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as  child marriage, recognized internationally as a violation of the human  rights of women and girls.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been victims already of FGM/C, female genital  mutilation, with girls 14 and younger representing 44 million of those  who have been cut.   For example, around the world, at least five girls are mutilated,  cut. More than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk.   The impacts of this on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during  childbirth, and death.   I ask my colleagues to think about their children, their girls.   According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the  world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and  Asia.   So I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.   I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole of the  Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Rogers for their hard  work in bringing Division D, the State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs portion of this omnibus appropriations legislative package, to  the floor.   I thank them all for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment, which makes a good bill even better by providing $1 million  more to help combat the draconian practice of Female Genital  Mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) abroad.   I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long  while, even working with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York to  introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this  ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.   Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures  that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia,  or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.   This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to  other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as  child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the  human rights of women and girls.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger  representing 44 million of those who have been cut.  [[Page H4642]]    For example, consider that:   1. Around the world, at least five girls are mutilated/cut every  hour.   2. More than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk of FGM/C  annually.   3. The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during  childbirth and death.   Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C  include the high concentration in specific regions associated with  several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.   According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the  world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and  Asia.   Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S.  bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of  combatting FGM/C abroad.   The United Nations adopted a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals  for 2030 that includes a target to eliminate FGM/C and recognizing the  abandonment of this harmful practice can be achieved because of a  comprehensive movement that involves all public and private  stakeholders in society.   With these provisions in place and my amendment increasing the  funding for foreign assistance we can ensure Female Genital Mutilation/ Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally recognized violation of the human  rights of girls and women comes to an end.   Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a report in 2016  estimating that 513,000 women and girls in the United States were at  risk or may have been subjected to FGM/C.   The presence of FGM/C in the United States brings a sobering truth to  light, that we still have much work to do here at home to stop our  young women and girls from suffering at the hands of this archaic and  utterly unnecessary practice.   I am reminded of the story of Hadiatu Jalloh, a 7-year-old from  Sierra Leone, who with her mother fled to Houston to seek a life saving  operation to rectify complications from the practice of FGM/C from  which she suffered for more than a year.   Due to complications from the FGM procedure, little Hadiatu could not  stop bleeding, she then underwent two additional non-medical procedures  to repair the damage she suffered.   However, the bleeding continued and after the second procedure to  stop the bleeding, Hadiatu could not properly urinate and suffered  terrible pain.   In her desperate quest for help, Hadiatu's mother Umu took her  daughter across the border to Sierra Leone, but still could not find a  doctor to treat Hadiatu.   Dr. Hardwick-Smith a world-renowned board certified OBGYN--along with  a team led by Houston pediatric urologist Dr. Eric Jones--solved  Hadiatu's problem by removing scar tissue during the successful  surgery.   Stories such like this remind me of the importance of this work, and  how can we cannot afford to ignore any instance of FGM/C.   And that is why earlier we celebrated the International Day of Zero  Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, a multinational effort to  bring this practice to an end.   That is why my amendment reprograms funding that will be used by the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for elimination of  FGM/C.   It also directs the U.S. Department of State to emphasize the need to  raise awareness among communities at the grassroots level, through  diplomatic and multilateral engagement and within humanitarian settings  to address the practice of FGM/C.   In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment increases funding to protect  young women and girls from mutilation at the most intimate level.   The amount of funds dedicated to these programs reflects the  commitment by the international community to the goals of protecting  women and girls and truly addressing this problem.   The harmful practice of female genital mutilation undermines the  human rights of women and girls by damaging their health, limiting  their economic opportunities and girls' access to education, and  increases the likelihood of early and forced marriage.   The Jackson Lee Amendment increases funding to expedite the complete  and total elimination of FGM/C.   I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am reminded of the story of Hadiatu  Jalloh, a 7-year-old from Sierra Leone who, with her mother, fled to  Houston to seek a lifesaving operation to rectify complications from  the practice of female genital mutilation, from which she suffered for  more than a year.   This story reads: ``The Woman's Hospital of Texas Saves an African  Girl's Life. Dr. Susan Hardwick-Smith and Dr. Eric Jones Provide  Lifesaving Care to 7-year-old Affected by Female Genital Mutilation,''  only one of 200 million girls.   This amendment will focus and provide an extra focus and extra  resources to have us be reminded to help these young women, girls,  across and around the world. Let us give them a lifesaving hand up.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, lifesaving,  so that more girls do not have to get this singular help from a  singular hospital, but they can be helped at home because this  dastardly act will be stopped.   Mr. Chair, I include a statement in the Record from USAID, and I ask  for support of my amendment.                  [From the Department of State and USAID]    The U.S. Government Working Together for the Abandonment of Female                         Genital Mutilation/Cutting         Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a traditional       practice that ranges from nicking to total removal of the       external female genitalia. UNICEF estimates that at least 120       million girls and women have experienced FGM/C in the 29       countries in Africa and the Middle East where the practice is       concentrated. Given present trends, as many as 30 million       girls under the age of 15 may still be at risk. However, the       data show that FGM/C is becoming less prevalent overall, and       the younger generation is less vulnerable to the practice.       Though no religion mandates the procedure, FGM/C is practiced       across cultures, religions and continents. It is practiced in       sub-Saharan Africa, northern Iraq, Malaysia and Indonesia,       and new evidence is showing prevalence in other Middle       Eastern countries, including Yemen, Iran, Syria, Oman and       Saudi Arabia, and parts of South Asia. The practice also can       be found in Europe, the United States, Australia and other       countries in the West where immigrants bring their cultural       traditions with them.        The reasons given for conducting FGM/C, which is generally       carried out between infancy and the teen years, encompass       beliefs about health, hygiene, women's sexuality, rites of       passage to adulthood and community initiation rites. Research       has shown that all forms of the practice harm women's health,       causing serious pain, trauma and frequently severe physical       complications, such as bleeding, infections or even death.       Long-term complications may include recurrent infections,       infertility, (1) and difficult or dangerous childbirth that       can result in the death of the mother and infant. (2)        The U.S. Government has supported FGM/C abandonment efforts       since the early 1990s, considering the practice not only a       public health concern but also a human rights issue that       violates a woman's right to bodily integrity. In September       2000, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)       officially incorporated elimination of FGM/C into its       development agenda, issuing an official policy and strategy       that underscored FGM/C was a serious health and human rights       issue. The U.S. Department of State emphasizes the need to       raise awareness among communities at the grassroots level,       through diplomatic and multilateral engagement and within       humanitarian settings to address the practice of FGM/C.        In August 2012, the United States released its first-ever       Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence       Globally, along with an accompanying Presidential Executive       Order directing its implementation. The strategy marshals the       United States' capacity and expertise to establish a       coordinated, government-wide approach to preventing and       responding to gender-based violence (GBV) and includes       harmful traditional practices such as FGM/C.        The United States also pursues regional, national and local       coordination among international donors, governments and       community leaders. U.S. Government agencies are actively       engaged with internationally based working groups to address       FGM/C, including the Donors Working Group (DWG) on FGM/C,(3)       which is composed of key international governmental and       intergovernmental organizations and foundations committed to       supporting the abandonment of the practice. USAID was a co-      founder of the DWG and is  [[Page H4643]]       dedicated to expanding and strengthening partnerships and       increasing resources for abandonment of this harmful       traditional practice. The group has collaboratively issued a       Platform for Action that summarizes the collective       programmatic approach that focuses on the community approach       to social change.                           U.S. Government Efforts         The State Department's Secretary's Office of Global Women's       Issues (S/GWI) funded community-based approaches involving       men, boys and all members of society in public awareness and       education campaigns. The campaigns emphasized the detrimental       consequences of FGM/C on the physical and mental health of       girls, their families and the overall community in order to       promote long-lasting solutions. S/GWI also worked with the       Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) to       strengthen the reporting of this issue in the Annual Country       Reports on Human Rights Practices. In addition to describing       whether FGM/C occurred and the type and category of FGM/C       most common, we are seeking information on international and       governmental efforts being taken to prevent and address FGM/C       (especially through educational programs, but also by means       of shelters, hotlines and police training).        The Office of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM)       largely supports efforts in humanitarian settings and among       refugees with programs designed to prevent and respond to       GBV, which includes FGM/C. These organizations rely on U.S.       Government assistance to provide humanitarian assistance to       refugees, survivors of conflict, internally displaced persons       and stateless persons worldwide. This encompasses a wide       variety of assistance, including the provision of protection,       shelter, health care, water and sanitation, as well as the       prevention of and assistance to survivors of GBV and FGM/C.       PRM also supports targeted activities to prevent FGM/C in       Somali and Sudanese refugee populations.        USAID supports implementing partners, both from Washington       and at the country level, to provide communitybased programs       in key countries where the practice is prevalent. The       Agency's projects have supported targeted programs in Burkina       Faso, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali and       Nigeria, among others that consider cultural sensitivities       and are integrated with health, economic, social or democracy       and governance programs. USAID programs are community based,       involving community and religious leaders as well as women's       groups, men and youth to advance the quality and       effectiveness of abandonment efforts and to improve       conditions that will lead to FGM/C abandonment.                             Projects In-Country         Egypt--S/GWI supported a project working in the community       of Al Darb Al Ahmar in Cairo called Creating Attitudes       Favorable to the Elimination of the Practice of FGM/C.       Through the dissemination of appropriate and relevant       information, coupled with education initiatives and public       awareness campaigns, S/GWI supported the Aga Khan Foundation       to address and prevent violence against women and girls,       including FGM/C, in select Cairo communities. Additionally,       the project provided training and capacity building in victim       advocacy and mental health for health care providers,       community leaders and volunteers.        In 2008, the USAID mission in Egypt incorporated FGM/C into       an existing community-level health program, reinforced by       select national-level messaging and educational messaging.       The program furthered Egypt's ongoing efforts to bring about       abandonment of FGM/C, as it involved training staff at both       the Ministry of Health and nongovernmental organizations       (NGOs) to broaden the reach and coordinate with the       government's National Council of Childhood and Motherhood to       create a coherent national strategy.        Sudan--The Office of the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan and       South Sudan is funding a program in West Nile State to       strengthen the capacity of community leaders and local       organizations to effectively and sustainably address FGM/C.       The project mobilizes children, women and men in the       community to support collective declarations of abandonment       of FGM/C. Through intensive trainings, community leaders draw       upon preexisting social structures to engage with the wider       community and build community ownership to end FGM/C       sustainably.        Iraq--In coordination with the DRL, S/GWI is funding a       multidimensional program in northern Iraq composed of       integrated victim services and a successful educational       campaign for village residents and political and religious       leaders, leading to the first-of-its-kind declarations of       villages being ``Female Genital Mutilation Free.''        Kenya--PRM provides resources to NGO partners to promote       awareness and prevention of FGM/C through community-based       institutions and civil society, including men's groups, youth       groups, women's groups and religious leaders. Other projects       promote social and economic empowerment of women and girls to       reduce the risk of exposure to GBV, including FGM/C, while       educating participants on the impact of harmful traditional       practices, including FGM/C.        USAID conducted studies to better understand the practice       of FGM/C among the Somalis in northeastern Kenya to inform       the design and implementation of interventions and to clarify       the correct Islamic understanding of FGM/C. The research       provided crucial evidence that FGM/C is neither a religious       practice nor one sanctioned by Islam, which clearly       stipulates provisions for the protection of basic human       rights, upholds the sanctity of the human body and prohibits       any practice that violates these rights or causes harm to the       body without justification. The conclusions called on       religious scholars to collaborate with medical doctors to       make verdicts based on scientific facts and to work with       their communities to help delink FGM/C from Islam.        USAID is supporting the launch of the Kenya Centre of       Excellence for FGM/C, which will be based at Nairobi       University, to create a pan-African center for learning and       developing innovative research approaches. The center will       also train leaders and champions for working toward the       abandonment of FGM/C and welcomes support from the       international community and others to join in this effort.        Ethiopia--In northern Ethiopia, the U.S. Government       supports an FGM/C awareness-raising program for women and       girls living in Shimelba and My'Ayni refugee camps. Specific       efforts include coffee discussions with girls, women, boys       and men on GBV-related topics and services and a Girls'       Wellness Week, which promotes adolescent girls' health       through a coming-of-age ceremony without FGM/C.        USAID supported collaboration with the Ministry of Health       and the National Committee on Traditional Practices to       educate communities on the harmful effects of FGM/C. The       program helped women and community leaders to understand the       motives of ``FGM/C demanders,'' respond to their concerns and       provide them with information on the negative impact of the       practice. More than 2,250 people participated in FGM/C       abandonment activities; a national Anti-FGM/C Women's Leaders       Team was established, and a member of that team drafted a law       against FGM/C that the Ethiopian parliament passed in July       2004.        Mali--USAID helped the Ministry of Health develop and pilot       a national training curriculum for primary medical providers       to increase their capacity to identify, treat or refer FGM/C       complications and educate and counsel clients and community       members on the negative aspects of the practice. A network of       trained providers was created consisting of extension workers       from NGOs and community and religious leaders. As a result of       their work, the percentage of men and women who said they       were in favor of abandoning FGM/C increased from 15 to 62       percent, and the percentage who intended to have FGM/C       performed on their daughters decreased from 81 to 33 percent.        Senegal--USAID has supported The Grandmother's Project       (GMP), which incorporates FGM/C into a broader girls' and       women's health and family planning program to bring about       positive changes in community traditions. The approach       involves grandmothers and elderly women, a once marginalized       group, in social change. The project encourages learning and       communal decision-making through open discussions about       problems confronting the community. The aim for GMP is to       have community members identify their problems and reach       consensus on possible solutions that best suit their needs,       leading to long-term and lasting change.        West Africa--USAID has supported Tostan, a participatory       education program that works village by village to       incorporate democracy, problem solving, basic mathematics,       literacy and essential health education, including       information about FGM/C, into the learning experiences that       ultimately empower the entire community. As a result of this       multidimensional approach, thousands of villages in West       Africa have publicly abandoned FGM/C and other harmful       traditional practices upon completion of the Tostan program.        n the United States, in 2012, at the first-ever Zero       Tolerance Day event that was held at the U.S. Department of       State, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke       passionately about creating conditions for ending FGM/C, so       all girls can realize their full potential. At that event,       organized by USAID and the State Department, a spark was lit       among the communities that have worked tirelessly for years       toward the abandonment of FGM/C. The event became a catalyst       for raising government and donor awareness and was repeated       in 2013 when it was hosted by former Ambassador-at-Large for       Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer. Ambassador Verveer led       a panel discussion that included Amina Salum Ali, Ambassador       of the African Union to the United States; Dr. Nawal Nour, a       Sudanese-American from Brigham and Women's Hospital in       Boston; Bacary Tamba from Tostan, an NGO in Senegal; and       Jessie Hexpoor from Hivos, an NGO based in the Netherlands.       They each have made, and are continuing to make,       extraordinary contributions toward putting an end to FGM/C,       and the Ambassador noted, ``are a testament to why community-      driven, holistic approach is essential to achieving       sustainable progress.'' The event brought together activists       from the NGO community, diplomatic corps and policymakers in       the U.S. Government to address ways various stakeholders can       work together toward zero tolerance for FGM/C. The event also       attracted 1,648 online participants from 30 countries in an       interactive virtual discussion.        USAID has commissioned a desk review of interventions,       evaluations and reports published since 2000 on ending FGM/C.       Based on  [[Page H4644]]       this review, as well as key informant interviews with       experts, USAID is drafting a report called Ending Female       Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Lessons from Ten Years of       Progress. The report will review lessons learned, promising       approaches and recommendations for the future. By looking       back, policymakers and advocates will be better able to move       forward decisively to create societies that allow women and       girls around the world to achieve their full potential.        Our vision of the way forward has been sharpened by all the       work that went on before this decade.        First, the centrality of ``social norms''--what communities       believe and how they act and expect the members of that       community to act--must be addressed.        Second, a wide range of actors play pivotal roles in the       abandonment of FGM/C: men; women; grandmothers; boys; girls;       and community, health, religious and political leaders.        Third, and perhaps most important, the focus must be on       holistic, integrated, multisectoral approaches that bring       together the advocacy, policy-level work and community-level       transformation of social norms.   Ms. JACKSON Lee. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this is a very important amendment in the  cycle of life, protecting endangered species, which give the joy of  life and understanding to the world, to the coexistence of humans and  these wonderful species that have given us so much knowledge.   My amendment makes a good bill better by providing a $1 million focus  to combat the transportation of the remains of endangered species, to  bring down the desire to go after these endangered species.   So many of us remember, a few years ago, the brutal killing of Cecil  the lion. At that time, I introduced and sought the support of my  colleagues as original cosponsors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion  Endangered and Threatened Species Act of 2015. This bill sought to  strengthen partner countries' capacity in countering wildlife  trafficking and designating major wildlife countries for protection.   The amendment now is offered in the same spirit: to prohibit the  taking and transportation of any endangered and threatened species as a  trophy to the United States.   Currently, the Endangered Species Act does not protect the majority  of wildlife animals killed. At this point, we can choose to make wise  decisions that will sustain the global population, or we can ignore the  warning signs.   Climate change is not the only threat facing our world. There is also  massive extinction of microscopic organisms to more complex insects and  animals. More than 90 percent of all organisms that have ever lived on  Earth are extinct.   So I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole  of the Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Rogers for their hard  work in bringing Division D, the State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs portion of this omnibus appropriations legislative package, to  the floor.   I thank them all for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment, which makes a good bill even better by providing $1 million  combat the transportation of the remains of endangered species.   A few years ago, in light of the brutal killing of Cecil the Lion, I  introduced and sought the support of my colleagues as original co- sponsors of my legislation entitled, Cecil the Lion Endangered and  Threatened Species Act of 2015.   That bill sought to strengthen partner countries' capacity in  countering wildlife trafficking and designating major wildlife  countries for protection.   This Jackson Lee Amendment is offered in the same spirit--to prohibit  the taking and transportation of any endangered or threatened species  as a trophy into the United States.   This amendment provides $1 million to focus efforts on poaching of  endangered species on protected preserves.   Hunting endangered species that are on protected preserves should  come with an element of greater risk to those who engage in this  practice.   The amendment provides additional resources to ensure better  coordination and monitoring of incidents like the killing of Cecil the  Lion, with a goal of holding people accountable.   Currently, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) does not protect the  clear majority of wild animals killed and imported.   Because of this loophole, tens of thousands of wild animals are  killed every year by trophy hunters and transported into the United  States.   The conservation of endangered and threatened species is critically  important to the sustainability of our biodiversity, ecosystem and the  beauty of wildlife as we know it.   Biodiversity and ecosystem balance are essential to sustaining life  as we know it on planet earth.   The rate that species are disappearing globally can easily be  compared to other mass extension events in our earth's history.   Human life requires a health global biodiversity and ecosystem.   At this point we can choose to make wise decisions that will sustain  the global population or we can ignore the warning signs.   Climate change is not the only threat facing our world--it is also  massive extinction from microscopic organisms to more complex insects  and animals.   More than 90 percent of all organisms that have ever lived on Earth  are extinct.   As new species evolve to fit ever changing ecological niches, older  species fade away.   But the rate of extinction is far from constant or natural.   At least a handful of times in the last 500 million years, 50 to more  than 90 percent of all species on Earth have disappeared in a  geological blink of the eye.   Another threat to endangered species are terrorist organizations that  pose a threat to our environment and natural wildlife, utilizing the  funds from their illicit activity of wildlife poaching to fund their  terroristic activities.   Vulnerable species are at the mercy of transnational terrorists  groups whose actions place these natural inhabitants of the earth in  danger of extinction.   For example, the population of African elephants has decreased from  1.3 million to 400,000, with 22,000 poached in 2012.   Only 3,200 tigers remain in the wild, and these tigers remain in  danger of being poached for their skins, bones and body parts.   This supports the efforts of the State Department under the  Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program to dismantle the wildlife  trafficking syndicates in the global south from Africa to Asia.   I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this amendment that in  a significant way makes a difference for the safety and security of  endangered species.   The food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe relies  upon biodiversity and balance in ecosystems.   Scientist warn that our planet is now during its sixth mass  extinction of plants and animals.   Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural  ``background'' rate of about one to five species per year.   Scientists estimate we're now losing species at up to 1,000 times the  background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day.   It could be a scary future indeed, with as many as 30 to 50 percent  of all species possibly heading toward extinction by the year 2050.   I ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee Amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her support  of my original amendment on female genital mutilation, and I thank her  for her support of this amendment.   I just offer to my colleagues a list of the vulnerable endangered  species: Giant panda, giant tortoise, giant white shark, greater one- horned rhino, hippopotamus, leatherback turtle, loggerhead turtle,  marine iguana, olive ridley turtle, polar bear, savanna elephant, snow  leopard, sea turtle--all of these, among many others. The jaguar is now  threatened. The white rhino is threatened.

I believe we can do better, and I would ask my  colleagues to do better by supporting the Jackson Lee amendment.   For example, the population of African elephants has decreased from  1.3 million to 400,000, with 22,000 poached in 2012. Working with my  amendment, working with this legislation, we can have a greater focus  on ensuring the protection of endangered species.   Mr. Chair, I ask support for the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
