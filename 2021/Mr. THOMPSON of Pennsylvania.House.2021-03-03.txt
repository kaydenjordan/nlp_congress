 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the Venango Museum of Art, Science and Industry in Oil City,  Pennsylvania.   The museum plays a big role in maintaining the culture and history of  the region with educational programming and rotating exhibits.   Recently, the executive director of the museum, Betsy Kellner,  reached out to my office to let us know of an exciting project the  museum was able to complete thanks to funding provided by the  Pennsylvania Humanities Council and the National Endowment for the  Humanities through the CARES Act.   The museum is the proud owner of a 1928 Wurlitzer pipe organ, which  was previously held in the historic Latonia Theater in Oil City. The  museum was able to refurbish the organ, a feat that took thousands of  volunteer hours and more than 600 different pipes.   After the organ was successfully refurbished, the Venango Museum of  Art, Science and Industry hosted a virtual concert for residents to  enjoy. The concert can also be viewed online at venangomuseum.org.   I would like to thank Betsy and the museum team for providing this  enriching cultural experience for the residents of Venango County  during the pandemic.                            ____________________
