 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my deep  appreciation for the inclusion of the community project funding request  for Indiana's First Congressional District in the fiscal year 2024  appropriations measure.   I am grateful that a transparent process was established for all  Members to include projects in these measures, and I believe that this  process is an essential component to our ability to advocate for our  districts.   Notably, I am proud that the funding is included to attract new jobs  and economic activity in northwest Indiana through improvements to the  Gary/Chicago International Airport, road construction for Central  Avenue in Portage, and water infrastructure in the City of La Porte.   I also appreciate the action to support public safety and members of  our law enforcement, including specific funds for the police  departments of Gary, Hammond, Munster, and Michigan City.   I look forward to working with like-minded colleagues to move these  measures forward and to complete this constitutional responsibility as  soon as possible.                            ____________________
