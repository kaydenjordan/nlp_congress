 Mr. President, I have found so much of what I have heard  that I can agree with. I certainly agree that we ought to be able to  pass our annual appropriations bills. I certainly  [[Page S7404]]  agree that we should prevent Federal Government shutdowns, which waste  billions upon billions upon billions of dollars' worth of taxpayers'  money, plus all of the burdens they put on American families, Federal  employees, and so forth. But I am afraid that my good friends on the  other side of the aisle are letting rhetoric get ahead of reality.   The reality is that the majority in the Senate controls the calendar  in the Senate. All of these appropriations bills could have been  brought up in June or July or September. We could have voted on them,  piece by piece, up and down, and had amendments. Everybody would have  had plenty of time to have read every line of them, to have amendments  to strike things or add things they wanted. I mention this because it  can be done. The House of Representatives, under Democratic control--I  don't mean that to be partisan but to show the difference--they  actually passed all of their appropriations bills and its COVID bill,  the so-called Heroes Act, in May.   In the Appropriations Committee, we have been working very hard.  Senator Shelby's staff has, and mine has too. We have given up a lot of  time with my colleagues--and for all good reasons. Many of us stayed  here working on those appropriations bills, but we couldn't bring the  bills up.   Now, the Republican leader, the majority leader, could have brought  up any one of these bills at any time he had wanted. We could have done  it, allowing a 1-hour time agreement for amendments. After all, the  Republicans in the majority have nothing to fear about that. If they  don't like an amendment, they can vote it down. This would give the  Senator from Utah and everybody else a chance to read each one of these  bills. If they don't like it, bring up an amendment to strike it. That  could have been done; it was not.   One of the reasons it was not done was because we had to take up  Senate time, day after day after day, to put through nominees--mostly  backed by special interest groups--on the Federal bench and elsewhere.  We had to vote on those. Why? We can vote on those, but also take the  time to vote on these things. Bring up the appropriations bills, and  vote on them one by one. Amend them if you want; vote them down if you  want.   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, You have the  majority. You can vote them all down or vote them all up. But what  happens when you enact an automatic CR, which I would oppose, it means  you don't work out the parts of full-year appropriations bills. There  would be no incentive for Members to negotiate full-year appropriations  bills. We were not elected to put the government on autopilot. We were  elected to make careful choices.   I would argue the reason we are here is that people were afraid to  actually stand up and vote up or down on appropriations bills earlier  this year when they had the chance. It is easy to say: Golly gee, let's  have an automatic continuing resolution. Sounds good. What it says is  that we can take all of our weekends off. We can have the government  fly us home. We can pay for all of these things, but we don't do our  work.   What I am saying is we should have stayed here over a few weekends. I  would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, the Republican  side, allow the bills to come up one by one and vote them up or down.  If you don't like parts of it, vote to take it out. Vote it up or down.  Again, you have the majority, if you don't like what is in there. Full- year appropriations bills give Congress the opportunity to address the  needs of today rather than continue the priorities of the past.   I have been here long enough to know that things that looked great 2  or 3 years ago are not the priorities today because things change.  Certainly, under COVID, we have seen, in many ways, a 15-year change in  society, education, business, industries, and more in 15 weeks.   So each year in the annual appropriations bills, Congress adjusts  spending levels to deal with emerging issues facing the American  people. We can eliminate funding for projects that have been completed  or no longer needed. We can direct funding to higher priority programs.  It is detailed, exacting work. It is nice to talk in slogans and  generalities, but I invite those Senators to sit down and go through,  day by day, the kind of work the Senators and the superb staff, both  Republican and Democratic, do in putting together this legislation. It  is detailed, exacting work, but it is what the American people expect.  That is what we all thought was a smart decision about how to invest  their hard-earned tax dollars.   If you operate under an automatic CR, none of these adjustments can  be made. Automatic CRs lock in the status quo, and we can say: Bye-bye.  We are heading home for the holidays. Oh, an emergency in COVID came  up? Well, it is not in the automatic CR, so tough. We didn't have time  to do anything about it. Oh, there is flooding in Florida or Nebraska  or fires in the West or anything else. Well, the automatic CR didn't  cover it because we didn't have money for it a year before.   No, that is not the way to do it. The Congress and the White House  have a responsibility to work together to enact funding bills to keep  the government open. Automatic CRs might save face and time and allow  us to do other things that we might like to do back home, but in doing  so, they relieve us of our obligations to the Constitution and to the  American taxpayer. We shouldn't be relieved of these obligations.   I know the last time we had a government shutdown, it was over a bill  where the President felt that it didn't give him enough for a wall  along the border between the United States and Mexico, a wall that is  being built at great expense and accomplishing very little. That is why  it was stopped.   So for a month and a half, we sat there, parts of the government  closed down, our States, our people, our Federal Government losing  billions upon billions upon billions of dollars. You know how that  finally got reopened? We started off a series of meetings on a Monday.  The House was in session; the Senate was in session. It was a good time  to begin. We began in Senator Shelby's office, and we continued it in  my office here in the Capitol.   We had two the chair and ranking member of the House Appropriations  Committee. We had two Senators: my good friend--and he is a good and  close friend--Dick Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, and myself as the vice chairman. And the four of us sat  there for 3 or 4 hours. We talked about everything from photography to  travel and then went in line by line of the bills, and we came to an  agreement. And we were able to explain our agreement to the House and  the Senate, and it was voted through, and the government reopened.   Incidentally, the President praised it. He said that he had gone  through it, and it was so good. And I thank him for doing that because  it gave him a lot less money for the wall than the bill that he vetoed  had given him.   But the government reopened.   I mention this because it seems that those billions of dollars were  spent more as a political stunt than something that benefits hard- earned taxpayer dollars.   So instead of rhetoric that ignores reality, let's get to the  reality. Let's pledge--whoever is in the majority in the end--we will  bring up each of the appropriations bills, vote them up or down or  amend them. We could have done this in June or July. If we had done  that, we wouldn't be where we are now. It was a missed opportunity.   If we say let's have an automatic CR no matter what happens, whether  we have earthquakes, floods, fires, COVID, attacks on the United  States, anything else, we can just sit back and relax, not have to do  all of the weekends and holidays and late-night work that many of us in  both parties do on appropriations because we have got an automatic CR.   When I came to the Senate, both the Republican and Democratic leaders  told me--and I was the most junior Member of the Senate at the time-- that we should be the conscience of the Nation. It meant doing your  work.   I never expected to be the dean of the Senate, but I have seen both  Republicans and Democrats do that work. At times, it has been into late  Friday night or early Saturday morning, but we have done it and passed  it.   Where did those days go? Where did those days go?   So when Senator Shelby became chair and I became vice chair, we  passed a series of appropriations bills.  [[Page S7405]]  And I think we got 80, 90, 95, and sometimes 100 Senators to vote for  those bills. We usually can't get a vote with that many to say the Sun  rises in the East. The majority gave us time to bring those votes up,  debate them, and vote them up or down.   I will have more comments to make. I don't question the good  intentions of any Senator here, but what I am saying is, we could have  done this in June; we could have done it in July; we could have done it  in August; we could have done it in September; we could have done it in  November. And to now complain--well, up to the last few days, we have  got to change everything. Instead, let's pledge that we will follow  regular order in the coming days.   I yield the floor.    Will the Senator yield for a question    Should we be able to represent our constituents? Of  course. He and I agree, and he and I have agreed on a lot of different  things, especially constitutional issues, in this body. And I share his  concern of suddenly being handed a piece of legislation like this, and  we are going to vote on it in 10 minutes or an hour or so.   Would he agree with me that if the leader said that Tuesday of next  week--say this was done earlier in the year--Tuesday of next week, we  will bring up this part of the appropriations bill from the committee,  the committee having voted on it, Republicans and Democrats--I think it  is close to a third of the U.S. Senate that is on that committee-- having voted on it, and it will be open to amendments. Then after we  finish that one, we will bring up the next one.   Would that cover many of the problems that the Senator from Utah has?    Mr. President, when Lamar Alexander came to the Senate in  2002, he brought with him a wealth of experience and years of service  to the State of Tennessee. As a Senator, he has remained a strong  advocate for his State and its citizens, and as a colleague, he has  shown a willingness to work across the aisle for the good of his  constituents, of the Senate, and of the Nation. Our partnership is one  that I will miss when he leaves the Senate.   Throughout his career--as Governor of Tennessee, as president of the  University of Tennessee, and as the Secretary of Education for  President George H.W. Bush, and as a U.S. Senator--Lamar has dedicated  himself to improving education quality and access for Tennesseans and  all Americans alike. He has continued and advanced that work as the  chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee. Senator Alexander has a proven record of working across the  aisle to develop solutions to our country's most pressing healthcare  and education challenge, and we know there are many.   I have had the privilege of working with Senator Alexander for many  years on the Appropriations Committee. Senator Alexander has been a  trusted partner on the committee, striving to reach bipartisan  compromise, which I believe has long been the hallmark of the  Appropriations Committee. His work as the current chairman of the  Energy and Water Subcommittee has helped make investments in clean and  renewable energy initiatives, which in turn have brought about economic  development and investment. I have long appreciated the work he has  done to support agencies, programs, and initiatives that improve the  lives of all Americans.   In a body as divisive as the Senate has come to be in recent times,  Lamar has become more than a fellow Senator; he has become a friend.  Lamar, Honey, and their children and grandchildren deserve all the best  that the coming years have in store for them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one factor that helps make someone a strong  representative of their constituents is the body of experience they  bring to their job. Mike Enzi has spent his life representing his  constituents, first as a mayor, then in the Wyoming Senate, and  ultimately in the U.S. Senate, a post to which the people of Wyoming  have elected and reelected him four times.   While our States are quite different geographically, Wyoming, like  Vermont, is State of close-knit communities, and it is easy to see how  deeply Senator Enzi cares for his fellow Wyomingites and how firmly he  prioritizes his constituents. As a Senator, he has worked to expand  resources for vocational and technical education programs nationwide,  and he has worked to protect and create jobs in Wyoming and across the  United States as a strong advocate for domestic energy production from  a diverse array of sources.   Mike has been a longtime member and top Republican of the Senate  Budget Committee and, before that, of the  [[Page S7417]]  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Although we certainly  have not agreed on many policy issues and priorities over the years, I  have greatly appreciated working alongside Senator Enzi to fund and  define many other legislative priorities to meet the needs of the  American people.   I will miss my fellow Italian-Irish friend. We were a proud caucus of  the only two Irish-Italian American Senators. Upon his retirement from  the Senate, I would like to thank Senator Enzi for his service, and  Marcelle and I wish Mike and his wife Diana all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. Pesident, there are some for whom public service  simply isn't a choice; it runs through their veins as a calling and a  force that draws them to answer an undeniable call. Tom Udall is one of  those people, and when the curtain closes on this 116th Congress and on  Tom's service in the Senate, it will bookend a career in Congress in  which the Udalls, a family steeped in public service, can take great  pride. The Udall legacy will live on in its benefits for generations of  Americans to come.   First as a Representative to the U.S. House and later as a U.S.  Senator, Tom has consistently fought for the interests of New Mexico  and his State's people. He has been instrumental in the passage of  legislation that has not only brought important resources to the people  of New Mexico, but has protected and preserved our environment. For his  constituents at home, this has meant more conservation of public lands  and significant expansions of access to education, healthcare, and land  tenure rights for Native Americans in New Mexico and across the United  States.   Tom fought hard to protect the environment and invest in a more  sustainable future. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  and as the ranking member of the Interior and Environment Subcommittee,  he advocated strongly for continued financial assistance for Federal,  State, and local programs that focus on environmental conservation and  work to address climate change and its effects. Critically, he fought  against draconian budget cuts to such entities as the Environmental  Protection Agency and fought to protect our clean air and clean  drinking water laws. Working with Tom on the Appropriations Committee,  it has been easy to see his clear dedication to his constituents, and  his devoted service to country.   I was saddened when Tom announced his retirement, but I believe Tom  will never close the door on his public service. Marcelle and I wish  Tom and his wife Jill, and the rest of their family, all the best in  the coming years. It was a privilege to be on the floor of the Senate  when Tom gave his farewell address. Such honesty, patriotism, wisdom of  how we can and must restore the workings of the Senate--all current  Senators and future Senators should listen.                            ____________________
