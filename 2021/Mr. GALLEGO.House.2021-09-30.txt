 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and say goodbye to  my friend and my brother, Sergeant Major Dan Altieri. We served  together in Iraq.   I have one minute to speak about a man who gave thousands of marines  years of their life back, one minute to speak about a marine, a  patriot, a brother, a legend, who loved us, unconditionally, both on  the battlefield and off.   In this magic minute, I must tell you about a marine that is  timeless, one who will not be forgotten by his men. He laughed with us  in the good times. He mourned with us in the bad times. He was always  ready to be there and say: ``Hey, brother, how are you doing?'' And  like a father that many of us never had, he would always say: ``I am  proud of you.''   My minute is up, my Sergeant Major is gone, but his legend will live  on.   Semper fi, Sergeant Major Altieri.                            ____________________
