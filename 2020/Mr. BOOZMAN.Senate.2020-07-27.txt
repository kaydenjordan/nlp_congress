 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Nate  Smith, whose expert medical guidance and strong leadership will be  deeply missed following his departure from the Arkansas Department of  Health.   Dr. Smith launched his career with the Arkansas Department of Health  in 2009. His extensive medical background and dedication to the  department's mission allowed him quick advancement through the agency  ranks. He initially served as State epidemiologist and subsequently  served as branch chief for infectious diseases and deputy director for  Public Health Programs. However, Dr. Smith's more recent and notable  appointments to director and State health officer in 2013 and secretary  of health in 2019 presented him with even greater responsibility in  maintaining and protecting public health in the State of Arkansas. As a  member of Governor Asa Hutchinson's cabinet, Dr. Smith crafted and  implemented the State's response to the COVID-19 emergency. He has  worked diligently alongside the Governor's team to provide medical and  scientific reasoning for pandemic-related decisions. Dr. Smith's  commitment to the health and well-being of Arkansans has always been  evident. We are especially grateful for that commitment as he navigated  unprecedented times on behalf of our State.   Dr. Smith's distinguished career with the Arkansas Department of  Health comes after years of education and preparation, including over a  decade of comprehensive medical schooling, four degrees, and two board  certifications. After graduating from Rice University in 1986, Dr.  Smith claimed home to Texas and its classrooms for the next 10 years.  By 1991, Dr. Smith had earned two more degrees: a doctor of medicine  from Baylor College of Medicine and a master of arts from Dallas  Theological Seminary. In 1996, Dr. Smith earned a master of public  health from the University of Texas School of Public Health, focusing  on disease control. He completed two infectious disease fellowships at  Baylor College of Medicine before pursuing a degree in tropical  medicine and hygiene from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and  Hygiene in England.   What emerged as an area of interest for Dr. Smith in medical school  led to an expansive, acclaimed career in infectious disease medicine.  After years of education and training, Dr. Smith took his knowledge to  Africa at the height of the AIDS epidemic. While simultaneously serving  as a medical missionary with his wife, Dr. Smith worked at Kijabe  Hospital in Kenya in the roles as chief of internal medicine, medical  intern program director, and infectious disease consultant. He found  himself back in Kenya in 2006 under the direction of the University of  Maryland School of Medicine, this time working with the Kenya Institute  of Human Virology as a senior medical technical adviser and country  medical director.   His expertise in infectious disease is well-respected and has led to  his participation and leadership in several medical advisory groups.  Dr. Smith served as chairman of the infection control committee for the  Arkansas Department of Health, chairman of the Arkansas AIDS Drug  Assistance Program Formulary Advisory Committee, and chairman of the  Infectious Disease Policy Committee for the Association of State and  Territorial Health Officials, ASTHO. He sat on the National Vaccine  Advisory Committee for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  for several years before an appointment to the CDC Advisory Committee  on Immunization Practices. Further, Dr. Smith has published more  [[Page S4504]]  than 25 scientific papers with the majority citing infectious disease  studies.   It is clear that Dr. Smith's passion for service and selfless  dedication to public health has brought tremendous value to Arkansas,  its institutions, and, most importantly, its 3 million citizens. The  University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences is one such institution  that will undoubtedly feel Dr. Smith's absence, as he has held several  academic appointments alongside his career at the Arkansas Department  of Health. What began as a voluntary position in 2009 became a mainstay  endeavor for Dr. Smith. He has since held several professorships at the  university in the division of infectious diseases and the epidemiology  department. When Dr. Smith is not teaching, working or spending time  with his family of five, he can be found donating his time and service  to St. Andrew's Anglican Church in Little Rock, where he works with the  leadership team and missions team. His robust professional and  community impact have earned him the following awards: the Arkansas  AIDS Foundation's Compassion Award, the Arkansas Public Health  Association's Director's Award for Science, and the Living and Affected  Corporation's Distinguished Service Award.   I want to graciously thank Dr. Smith for his tireless commitment to  improving the health and wellness of Arkansans. I appreciate his  friendship and example for us all as a true public servant. His  transition to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is  bittersweet, and we are full of gratitude and pride for Dr. Smith and  his dedication to our State over the past two decades.                            ____________________
