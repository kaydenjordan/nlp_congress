 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of one of  my constituents, an Anaheim resident, Specialist Daniel Delgado Torres,  who suddenly passed away on February 16 in an automobile accident.   The son of immigrants, I recently had the opportunity to meet with  his mother and father, who told me a story. They said from the early  days that they could remember, Daniel dreamed of being an American  soldier. In 2016, he had the opportunity when he joined the United  States Army, and he became the first of his family to join the  military.   He was deployed to Afghanistan and was awarded the Army Achievement  Medal for helping save the lives of seven of his fellow soldiers.   Daniel was just 22 when he passed away. He is survived by his  parents, Teresa and Aurielo; his sister, Yasiry; his girlfriend,  Noelia; and their young son, Joaquin.   Madam Speaker, I thank Daniel for his service to our country.                            ____________________
