 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Capito and I be allowed to speak briefly just before the amendment.   Senator Capito.    Mr. President, I want to join my voice with that of  Ranking Member Senator Capito and say I rise in support of the  amendment offered by Senator Lummis, Senator Cornyn, Senator Kelly to  direct the U.S. Department of Transportation to conduct a highway user  cost allocation study, that we are going to vote on here in just a  minute or two.   A cost allocation study helps determine the costs in terms of road  use and damage that are attributable to the different types of vehicles  that use our roads. This study will evaluate vehicle weights and miles  that are traveled in each class to determine the use and damage done to  roads, and then compare them to the amount paid in user fees to the  Highway Trust Fund.   My colleagues know the Highway Trust Fund has been spending more than  it collects for nearly two decades, and as we look to equitably address  this growing shortfall, this study will help us better understand the  extent to which different roadway users benefit from roads and how they  should fairly contribute to the upkeep of those roads, highways, and  bridges.   This cost allocation will help Congress ensure that our vehicles pay  their fair share. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this very  worthy amendment.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendment be called up to the substitute and be reported by number: No.  1, Lee No. 2255, substitute; further, that following the vote on  amendment 2181, the Senate vote in relation to the Lee amendment with  no amendments in order to the amendment prior to a vote in relation to  the amendment, with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption, and 5  minutes for Senator Lee and 1 minute for myself for debate prior to the  vote.    As a result of this agreement, there will be two rollcall  votes at 11:45 a.m. The first vote would be on the Lummis-Kelly  amendment No. 2181. The second vote would be on the Lee amendment No.  2255. We continue to work on scheduling additional votes following the  caucus lunches.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2181     Madam President, I, too, rise in opposition to Senator  Lee's amendment.   This amendment does not reform the Federal-aid highway system as we  know it; it dismantles it. It eliminates the Federal funding that each  of our States relies on to build, repair, and to maintain our Federal  highways. It would strike the entire surface reauthorization in this  bill before us and replace it with an interstate highway-only bill with  top-line funding of less than $20 billion over 5 years.   At a time when we already have some 45,000 structurally deficient  bridges in our Nation, this amendment would leave American travelers at  risk due to serious disinvestment.   Senators have come together, Democrats and Republicans, to bring this  infrastructure bill to the floor because we recognize that States are  in need of serious investment to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.   This is not a partisan issue. On the Environment and Public Works  Committee, where Senator Capito and I lead, we voted unanimously to  advance a highway bill out of committee on a unanimous vote--20 to  nothing. That bill increases the top-line funding for our highway  Federal programs by 34 percent to a little over $300 billion--the  highest amount of highway funding ever authorized by this Congress--and  it is much needed.   Senator Lee's amendment would go in the exact opposite direction,  unfortunately. It would reduce the funding in our bill to less than $20  billion. That is a cut of about 95 percent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that the  [[Page S5694]]  following amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported by  number: 1, Duckworth, No. 2140; 2, Cruz-Warnock, No. 2300; further, I  ask unanimous consent that at 3:45 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to  the amendments with no amendments in order to the amendments prior to a  vote in relation to the amendments, with 60 affirmative votes required  for adoption, and 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the  votes.    Madam President, unless someone else wishes to speak at  this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in support of the Duckworth amendment.    Madam President, I rise in support of Senator Duckworth's  amendment. This amendment will ensure that recipients of funding to  make systems more accessible have a plan in place to comply with the  Americans with Disabilities Act.   Individuals with disabilities rely on public transit to get where  they need to go, whether that is to go to work or to go to school or  simply go about their daily lives. It is past time to upgrade all of  our transit stations to provide access to everyone who needs a ride.   I support this amendment by Senator Duckworth. I urge all of our  colleagues to join me in voting yes.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2140     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Could I have the attention of our colleagues. In addition  to the meritorious points that have been made by the sponsors of this  legislation and the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works  Committee--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate  out of order.    Mr. President, anytime these two Members get together and  offer legislation, how could any of us say no? Maybe we could get a  voice vote; I don't know. We will see.   Thanks very much. Congratulations. You bring joy to this place.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a voice vote. Does the  gentleman from Texas mind getting a voice vote?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  60-vote hurdle.    There we go.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2300     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported by number:  No. 1, Van Hollen, No. 2354; and the second is Johnson, No. 2245;  further, that at 7:30 p.m. today the Senate vote in relation to the Van  Hollen amendment, and at 11 a.m. tomorrow morning the Senate vote in  relation to Johnson, No. 2245, with no amendments in order to the  amendments prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with 60  affirmative votes required for adoption of the amendments and 2 minutes  for debate equally divided prior to the votes.    With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a  quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by my old friend, the Senator from Maryland--my neighbor,  Senator Van Hollen--and also my young friend, Senator Ernst, and maybe  one or two others that I am not aware of.   The amendment offered by our colleagues requires public-private  partnership projects that receive loans from USDOT to obtain something  called surety bonds. Surety bonds are a proven tool for ensuring that a  loan recipient has appropriate payment and performance protections in  place.   By requiring these bonds, this amendment would protect workers, would  protect suppliers, and guarantee that any subcontractors, suppliers,  and workers would receive the payment they deserve for their work on  the project, even if the borrower were to default.   The legislation is based on bipartisan, bicameral legislation that is  supported by a dozen organizations, including associations that  represent the interests of minority-owned and woman-owned small  businesses.   I urge my colleagues to support it.   I yield to my colleague, the ranking member of the EPW Committee. I  just want to say how pleased I am with the progress we have made today.  A lot of amendments were offered and considered. We had the opportunity  to vote on them, accept some, some not accepted. But the spirit was  good. There is a good spirit in here. And I think if most people around  the country who think we never can work together and get anything done  had a chance to see the way this place worked today, they would feel  better about this democracy.
