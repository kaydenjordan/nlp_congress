 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Representative Costa, who I am very proud to serve with on  the board of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. We look forward to  recognizing and accepting a full delegation to the NATO Parliamentary  Assembly from both Finland and Sweden.   Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked war of aggression against  Ukraine and the inhumane assault on innocent civilians, thinking that  he would be able to divide the NATO alliance. He was mistaken.   Instead, Finland and Sweden responded by dropping their policies of  military neutrality and applying for NATO membership.   As NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg put it, Vladimir Putin  wanted less NATO, and now he is getting more NATO on his borders.  Finland and Sweden will both be significant security providers for  NATO.   This bipartisan resolution supports ratifying the accession of Sweden  and Finland to NATO.   Having served as the president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I  understand the fundamental role this organization plays in defending  democracies and supporting freedom.   Finland and Sweden's strategic location in northern Europe, advanced  militaries, and decades of fighting alongside the U.S. and NATO mean  that their accession will immediately strengthen transatlantic  security. Finland and Sweden have well-trained armed forces,  sophisticated modern weapons systems, and have committed to allocating  2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense spending.   Both militaries are highly interoperable with NATO forces, having  participated in numerous NATO-led operations from Afghanistan, Iraq,  Bosnia and Herzegovina to Kosovo. Meanwhile, Finland has finalized its  purchase of F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. in a $12 billion deal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution, which calls on all members of NATO to ratify Sweden and  Finland's protocols of accession swiftly.   Finally, for the alliance to be credible, every nation must do its  fair share. The resolution also urges members of NATO to meet their 2  percent defense spending pledge. President Trump successfully pushed  our NATO allies to spend more on defense. Putin's invasion has been  another motivation to convince our allies who had not been living up to  their military commitments to NATO to increase their defense spending  and make concrete plans to reach the 2 percent requirement.   A strong, united NATO is in the United States' interest. With Sweden  and Finland as members, the balance of power in Europe will be tipped  against Putin.   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   I thank Representative Keating and Representative Costa for their  work on this resolution. I also thank Majority Leader Hoyer for his  comments in support of NATO and in support of Ukraine. Certainly, the  crisis that is occurring there is an impetus, I think, for our moving  quickly and in support of this resolution.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider the accession  protocols for these two countries in the next week. This vote is an  opportunity for the House of Representatives to demonstrate their  support for Finland's and Sweden's NATO membership. This support should  be overwhelming.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this  resolution. In the face of Vladimir Putin's aggression, it is critical  that the United States Congress speak with one voice on strengthening  NATO.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
