 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will celebrate 7 years since  the President signed the Affordable Care Act into law. The following  day my colleagues across the aisle will vote to eradicate the  undeniable progress it has made.   On Thursday, when the House votes on the American Health Care Act, we  will vote to take away health insurance from millions of Americans; we  will vote to raise premiums on seniors; we will vote to damage women's  healthcare programs; and we will vote to reduce access to care for  LGBTQ people.   Policies that were once derided as socialist are now mainstream,  considering so many of the popular parts of ACA are retained in the  Republican replacement.   The majority of the country does not want to repeal ACA but to  improve it in a bipartisan way. The only way to create a meaningful  change for the American people is to work together across the aisle.   As Lincoln said: ``We cannot escape history. We . . . will be  remembered in spite of ourselves.'' A vote to repeal ACA will be a  stain on that legacy.                            ____________________
