 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a decorated  American war hero, Sergeant Dan McBride, Jr., of Silver City, New  Mexico.   Dan passed away at the age of 97 on February 16, 2022, and was among  the prestigious members of New Mexico's and our Nation's Greatest  Generation.   In 1942, during World War II, Dan enlisted as a paratrooper in the  U.S. Army's 101st Airborne, also known as the Screaming Eagles.   He was one of the first American servicemembers on the ground in  Normandy during D-day and was one of our longest-living World War II  heroes.   Dan was an exceptional marksman, which served him well as a sniper  and a machine gunner. He endured unspeakable challenges and overcame  tremendous adversity during his time at war. He fought German forces  during record low subzero temperatures at the Battle of the Bulge. He  took heavy fire, was wounded in action, and had limited access to food  and resources behind enemy lines.   His heroic actions did not go unnoticed. After honorably serving our  country, Dan returned home with three Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star  because of his courageous service.   He was also featured in the book ``Three of the Last WWII Screaming  Eagles'' along with his fellow paratroopers, Dick Klein and James  Martin. That book has now been made into a documentary film called ``A  Rendezvous with Destiny,'' which premiered at the National Veterans  Museum and Memorial in Columbus, Ohio. I can't think of a better way to  honor his legacy than by immortalizing his story on film.   We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our World War II veterans, of  whom we are now one fewer. Dan will be missed dearly but will never be  forgotten.   It was abundantly clear to everyone who met him that he loved this  country and enjoyed life with a passionate American spirit.   Dan was laid to rest at the Fort Bayard National Cemetery with full  military honors. He is survived by his three children: Danny McBride,  Pat McBride; and John Carr.   Thank you, Dan, for your bravery, for being a true representative of  the Greatest Generation, and for making the world a safer place.   We know that freedom isn't free. Today, we enjoy the benefit of  living in a Nation of freedom because of Dan's sacrifice and the  sacrifice of so many others.   Dan, you possessed the courage of David; the patience of Job; and,  like Paul, the willingness to stand for your convictions and for what  you believed in. Everyone who had the privilege to meet you was  immediately drawn to your stories, your strength, and your heart, so  full of joy and pride. You have impacted more lives than you will ever  know. And even in death, your legacy will live on.   Dan, today, the United States House of Representatives thanks you for  your service and a life well lived. I am confident that on February 16,  you were welcomed into God's loving arms, and you heard him say: ``Well  done, my good and faithful servant.''   Rest in peace, Sergeant Dan McBride, Jr.                            ____________________
