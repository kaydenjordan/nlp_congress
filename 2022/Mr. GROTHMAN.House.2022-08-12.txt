 Mr. Speaker, the 87,000 figure is entirely reasonable,  given we have an $80 billion increase. Now, is it exact? It might be  86,500. I don't know. It is a big number.   First of all, it is that many more people monitoring Americans.  Anybody that wants a free society should be afraid of that.   Secondly, with 86,500 people poking around small business, it means  that much more accountant time that has to be paid for by the small  businesses. It means that many more lawyers hired by the small  businesses. It is really an accountant and legal make-work program.  Auditing on this scale will really change the amount of time you have  to deal with this.   Other things, you are getting rid of--I am very disappointed--the  good provision you had with regard to carried interest. You are finally  going after some of the billionaires of this country, and I wish you  wouldn't have caved into the Senate and removed that provision. That  was a very good thing.   Next, you have way too much corporate welfare in here. $134 billion  in tax credits for so-called favored green industries. What is it? It  is that many more businesses depending upon government, and their way  to make money is not by providing something the American citizen wants.  They are making money because of tax credits they have been given by  Congress.   Otherwise, the bill is full of other big spending, as well. There is  a 22 percent increase in Bureau of Indian Affairs, 22 percent at a time  when we are choking on inflation because of excessive government  spending. That is one more spending program to put in here.
