 Mr. President, yesterday I announced that the Senate's  regularly scheduled August recess will not occur this year. Members  will be able to meet with our constituents during a standard 1-week  State work period at the beginning of the month, and then we will come  right back here and get back to work.   The reason is simple: We have too much left to do for the American  people.   Sixteen months into the Trump administration, Senate Democrats  persist in their unprecedented campaign to obstruct the President's  nominees for a wide array of executive and judicial positions.   It is time for a little historic perspective.   During President Obama's first 2 years, the Senate needed only 12  cloture votes on nominations. In President George W. Bush's first 2  years, there were four cloture votes on nominations and for President  Clinton, just eight. But less than a year and a half into this  administration, the Democratic minority has stalled progress through-- listen to this--101 cloture votes, and counting, on nominations--101  cloture votes.   This used to be a rare tool of last resort, used only in a tiny  handful of cases. Well, not these days. In many cases, the nominees in  question are completely without controversy. Not a single Senator in  either party voted against confirming Robert Wier or Fernando Rodriguez  to serve as district court judges just yesterday. They were both  confirmed unanimously. So were Walter Counts and Karen Scholer, two  more district judges we considered back in January. But Senate  Democrats forced us to invoke cloture on each of these nominees and  then made sure they soaked up Senate floor time, even though literally  no Senator opposed them.   This isn't due diligence. It certainly isn't good government. It is  what happens when our friends across the aisle put political slogans  about ``the resistance'' ahead of the country's needs.   We have gotten a great deal done this Congress. We have bolstered our  economy with historic tax reform and regulatory reform. We have  delivered critical resources to communities afflicted by the opioid  crisis, with more on the way. We have undone harmful spending caps to  fully equip our military. We have taken action to combat human  trafficking and school violence. We have repealed ObamaCare's  individual mandate tax and its Independent Payment Advisory Board and  delayed several other healthcare taxes.   Republicans are still working to do more. We need to confirm more of  the President's team and judicial nominees. We need to take up regular  appropriations bills. We need to tackle legislative priorities like the  water infrastructure bill, the farm bill, the Defense bill, and many  others.   So the Senate will remain in session in August. We will work on  legislation. We will confirm more nominees.   We will keep delivering on the agenda that has already done so much  to make America stronger, safer, and more prosperous.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 442,  H.R. 5515.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to proceed be agreed to.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk on  the motion to proceed.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

I know of no further debate on the bills en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, June 7; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session for  the consideration of the Marcus nomination, under the previous order,  with the time until 12:30 p.m. equally divided between the two leaders  or their designees; finally, that at 12:30 p.m., all debate time on the  nomination be expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Marcus  nomination with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Tillis,  Brown, and Portman.
