 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Allentown  Police Detective and Community Liaison Officer James Stanko, a man who  dedicated his life's work to bridging the divide between police  officers and the community they serve.   Officer Stanko died on Monday, a huge loss for our community, but his  legacy lives on through the countless lives he touched.   Officer Stanko wasn't known for sitting idly at a desk. His passions  lay out in the community where he was known for mentoring our kids,  whether it was through coaching basketball, talking at schools, or  offering life lessons at the children's clinic.   As someone who worked closely with him put it, ``Our kids called him  family.'' He was a calming, yet dependable force that everyone,  especially our youth, could turn to for guidance and support.   Officer Stanko never stopped trying to achieve his ultimate goal of  connecting the police department to the people that it serves.   Working as an Allentown police officer for 13 years, Stanko never  wavered in his values of honesty, integrity, and, most notably, respect  for others. I was inspired by his sincere love for public service, as  well as his passion for our community that he was proud to call home.  He will be deeply missed.                            ____________________
