 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res.  363, a resolution memorializing law enforcement officers killed in the  line of duty.   Before leaving their homes, our public safety officers put on their  uniforms and say goodbye to their family every day, as they knowingly  put their lives on the line to serve their communities and make our  country a better place.   In 1962, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy signed into law a  proclamation that made May 15 of every year ``Peace Officers Memorial  Day'' in honor of the Federal, State, and local officers who have been  killed, disabled, or otherwise injured in the line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I rise to recognize the  life of John Joseph Donohue, a Sergeant in the Fairfax County Police  Department who gave his life to serving his community.   Sergeant Donohue served the people of Virginia's 11th District for 18  and a half years, assigned to the Fair Oaks District, answering the  call time and time again from constituents in need.   Before his long service to Fairfax County, Sergeant Donohue  previously served as an auxiliary police officer with the Dumon Police  Department in New Jersey.   I join the entirety of Virginia's 11th District in sending our  deepest condolences to his wife, family, and fellow officers at the  Fair Oaks District Station and with Fairfax County Police Department.
