 Mr. Speaker, I come to report significant progress on  D.C. statehood and to thank my colleagues for passing my bill to make  the District the 51st State. I especially thank Senator Gary Peters for  holding a Senate hearing on the bill in June, only the second hearing  in Senate history.   I particularly appreciate the work of Senator Tom Carper, the lead  Senate sponsor, for a record 45 Senate cosponsors.   These efforts in the House and Senate have resulted in 54 percent of  the American people now supporting D.C. statehood.   D.C. is more than ready--indeed is overqualified--for statehood.  Residents pay more Federal taxes per capita than any State, more taxes  than 21 States, and has a larger gross domestic product than 17 States.   The District of Columbia is well on its way to becoming our 51st  State.                            ____________________
