 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Tribute to Emily Enderle     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Tribute to Emily Enderle     Mr. President, may I bid a public farewell to Emily  Enderle, who is here with me and who has served as the lead on my very  active and busy environment unit for quite some time now. She is going  on to another role in Washington and will continue to serve our cause.  She has done an amazing job, and I want to be sure to say that on what  will be her last appearance on the floor with me for one of our ``Time  to Wake Up'' speeches.                                Climate Change    Mr. President, I have spoken before, as you know, about the fossil  fuel industry's persistent effort to undermine public understanding of  climate change and to confuse people about the actual effects of carbon  pollution on our atmosphere and oceans.   I have mentioned Drexel University Professor Robert Brulles' follow- the-money analysis, which reveals the complex network of organizations  and funding--what we have called the web of denial--that is designed to  obscure the fossil fuel industry's fingerprints and to perpetuate the  fossil fuel industry's climate denial.   Dr. Brulle calls this ``a deliberate and organized effort to  misdirect the public discussion and distort the public's understanding  of climate.'' That is what this industry is up to.   One front group for that industry is called the Heartland Institute.  It is a nice name, but they are not very nice people. For decades, the  Heartland Institute has played a prominent role disseminating  alternative facts and fake science at the behest of its industry  funders. They have a long history of doing the bidding of industry  funders. In the 1990s, it was teamed up with Philip Morris to challenge  the facts about the health risks of tobacco. Using the same tactics-- along with funding from the Koch Family Foundations, ExxonMobil, and  other fossil fuel interests--it undermines public confidence in the  established scientific consensus about climate change. Heartland is  quite shameless in its methods, once sponsoring a billboard comparing  those who accept the science of global warming to the Unabomber.   For my 180th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I would like to explore the  Heartland Institute's latest gambit, which is to airdrop climate denial  propaganda directly into children's classrooms.   This spring, Heartland delivered packages to hundreds of thousands of  K-12 and college-level science teachers across the country. These  materials were designed to have a veneer of credibility. Each one was  stamped with the headline ``Study: Science Teachers Giving Unbalanced  Education on Climate Change.'' This intriguing story was attributed to  something called Environment & Climate News.  [[Page S6170]]    Inside the package, the teachers found a report titled ``Why  Scientists Disagree About Global Warming.'' It was issued by something  called the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change. As a  bonus, each teacher also received a DVD copy of the ``History of  Climate Change in Greenland,'' produced by Idea Channel.   A cover letter from Heartland's Center for Transforming Education-- transforming education into propaganda, I assume is how that sentence  gets finished--asks teachers to ``consider the possibility'' the  science of climate change isn't settled.   That is the package they got. Let's look behind that veneer. When you  do, the smell gets pretty rotten. It turns out that the Environment &  Climate News is not actually news. It is not a news outlet. It is the  monthly newsletter of, guess who, the Heartland Institute. They are  citing themselves, masquerading their newsletter as a news outlet. The  foolishness goes on.    Their featured article, ``Study: Science Teachers Giving Unbalanced  Education on Climate Change'' was written by a person named Bonner  Cohen, who is a featured expert--guess where--with the Heartland  Institute, who previously held senior positions in--believe it or not-- Philip Morris front groups.   Their Nongovernmental International Panel On Climate Change sounds  like a well-known actual authority: The Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change. The actual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is  a United Nations-sanctioned, Nobel Prize-winning scientific body that  reports the findings of thousands of climate scientists from hundreds  of countries. The Heartland group--this so-called Nongovernmental  International Panel on Climate Change--is a misleading decoy designed  to mimic the real entity.   The three experts who wrote the Nongovernmental International Panel  on Climate Change report Heartland pushed out do not have degrees in  climate change modeling, do not having degrees in climate science. All  are paid by Heartland. All their claims have been repeatedly debunked  by real science.   There is one faint hint of accuracy in this propaganda publication  Heartland put out. There actually is a PBS series called Idea Channel.  However, the Idea Channel DVD in the Heartland packet has nothing to do  with that series. It was actually produced by something called the Free  To Choose Network, whose funding, like Heartland's, is linked to the  fossil fuel industry. It is another masquerade designed to mislead.   One of the tricks of Heartland's little scheme was to dupe legitimate  scientists into participating. One of the experts interviewed, Rie  Oldenberg, the curator at Greenland's Narsaq Museum, was told she was  participating in a video on Norse history for the Discovery Channel.  When she found out what she had been duped into, she said: ``I am  somewhat horrified.''   Other participants are frequent fliers in the climate denial circus,  like Willie Soon, who received over a million dollars in funding since  2001 from the Koch brothers, the American Petroleum Institute,  ExxonMobil, and other fossil fuel interests. The year the video was  released, Willie Soon received nearly $20,000 from Free To Choose.   The Heartland cover letter asked teachers to ``consider the  possibility'' the science of climate change isn't settled. Even that is  not new. This echoes the infamous Big Tobacco declaration, ``Doubt is  our product.'' The heart of the fossil fuel industry's scheme is to  undermine legitimate science with false doubts. Because of the  financial stakes behind industry science denial and because of the  communications advantages propaganda has over real science--you don't  need to waste a lot of time in peer review, for instance, you go  straight to the networks--this scheme is a real problem for  institutions like our schools that cherish and support real science.   All this masquerade and subterfuge by Heartland Institute looked a  lot like fraud. Senators Schatz, Warren, Markey, and I wrote to  Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to ask whether DeVos and her staff  at the Department of Education helped or coordinated with the Heartland  Institute on this scheme to pollute our classrooms with phony science.   That simple request drew quite the response from our friends at the  Heartland Institute. ``Your letter is a monumental misuse of your  office and a betrayal of the trust of your constituents,'' wrote  Heartland CEO Joseph Bast. He called our letter ``defamatory'' and  ``despicable.'' ``Shame, shame, shame,'' he proclaimed in bold font-- this, unironically, from that same classy group that put up the  billboard comparing anyone who accepts climate science to the  Unabomber, just to give you an idea of their level of shame.   Even that little outburst is considerably nicer than in 2015 when  Bast called some of us ``fascists'' and ``ethically challenged . . .  mental midgets.''   Why is the Heartland Institute so very touchy? We obviously hit a  nerve. The lesson is, poke an imposter and the imposter gets very  agitated. Fortunately, teachers are smart people who follow real  science. Imposters like Heartland that pretend their stuff is coming  through an Idea Channel that it isn't, that mimic the name of real  organizations to try to fool people, that pretend their newsletter is  real news and package the whole thing up as if it is intended to be  helpful to teachers face an uphill battle against informed educators.   One example, Nebraska recently approved new State standards requiring  climate change to be taught in schools. According to the Omaha World- Herald, Nebraska's new standards ``challenge kids to think and act like  scientists,'' which is exactly what our science classrooms ought to do.   One Omaha resident encouraged the school board to ``do the ethical  thing and tell the next generation what's going on with climate.'' A  science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln said the  standards represented ``good solid science, good solid science  education.''   This is what we need in science education--real-life scientists from  real institutions of higher learning engaging and helping our children  learn. What we don't need are fossil fuel front groups pumping out more  phony science to pollute public education, just like they pollute our  oceans and atmosphere.   I have been pretty heartened to hear about this from teachers working  in classrooms in my home State of Rhode Island. Holly Emery teaches  science to seventh and eighth graders at Exeter-West Greenwich Junior  High School. Her students focus on solutions to climate change-- something we could use a bit more of around here. They examined  Germany's plan to significantly reduce its carbon emissions. Students  were so motivated by what they heard, they requested to share their  projects with other grades in the school. One of Miss Emery's students  said: ``This is important and the other kids need to know.''   Students in Jane Ramos's eighth grade science class at Gallagher  Middle School in Smithfield learn about climates around the world. They  read, research, and make slides about the human contributions to  climate change, including the carbon cycle, burning fossil fuels and  the greenhouse effect, deforestation, livestock practices, and the  production of methane. They discuss the effects of warmer oceans,  expansion of water, melting ice, and rising seawater levels. These are  important issues for Rhode Island, the Ocean State.   Science students from Brenda Dillmann's class at South Kingstown High  School planted grass on the Narrow River salt marsh as part of a major  unit on climate. During the lessons, the students learned about the  role that salt marshes play as carbon sinks--absorbent carbon from the  atmosphere. They went out and got dirty and planted by hand some 35,000  seedlings of 3 different types of salt marsh grasses.    Since 2007, more than 500 students have become climate experts in  Kara Ratigan and Renee Hadfield's fourth grade class at James H.  Eldredge Elementary School in East Greenwich. Ratigan and Hadfield have  developed a curriculum that integrates climate change across all  subject areas. For the kids, the year begins with a visit to a local  assisted living facility, where students pair up with a senior buddy.  The students interview their senior buddies, asking how the climate has  [[Page S6171]]  changed over time and looking for lessons that can be applied today.   In their math class, students learn how to read charts and graphs and  how to frame a convincing argument through data. In social studies, the  students learn about the regions of the United States, about their  differing climates, and about how each is affected by climate change.  In science, the students learn about erosion and weather patterns and  the effects of human activity on rock, soils, and sediments. Students  make observations about climate change all around them and delve into  society's responses to the harms of climate change.   This past spring, the Norman Bird Sanctuary, in Middletown, hosted  seventh graders for a beach ecology lesson at nearby Third Beach. The  director of education, Rachel Holbert, and her staff led a discussion  with the students about the greenhouse effect associated with burning  fossil fuels. They explained how the excess heat trapped in the  atmosphere puts stress on the oceans, undermining the oceans' ability  to stabilize the global climate and, of course, leading, as we have  seen, to a higher frequency and strength of extreme weather events,  such as powerful hurricanes. The kids' lesson ended with a focus on  solutions. If the oceans are the heart and lungs of the climate, what  can prevent future damage?   Teachers like them play such an important and formative role in  helping the next generation understand the world we live in. They teach  our children to make observations, collect information, and use  evidence to formulate conclusions. They are honest and they are decent.   The fossil fuel industry, on the other hand, is neither honest nor  decent. The filthy hand of the fossil fuel industry has, regrettably, a  firm grip on this Congress. There is a reason that we never do anything  about climate change, and it does not involve the merits of the issue.  It involves the politics of the industry. We have, perhaps, not yet  plumbed the bottom of how low they are willing to go, but, surely, this  is a new low to reach with their game of phony science, masquerade, and  subterfuge into our children's classrooms, like Ms. Emery's, Ms.  Ramos's, Ms. Dillmann's, Ms. Ratigan's, and Ms. Hadfield's. These  honorable, decent teachers help their students gain a fact-based  understanding of the changing world around them and the issues facing  our society. Unfortunately, these Heartland Institute materials may  require those teachers to teach about politics and propaganda as well.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Caroline  Normile, an AAAS fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for  the remainder of this Congress.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
