 Madam President, I want all my colleagues and everyone  listening right now to be very clear about what Republican leadership  is planning for today. Faced with defeat after defeat on their plans to  rip apart our healthcare system--``no'' on a bill that would spike  families' premiums, gut Medicaid, and deny 22 million people  healthcare; ``no'' on a bill that would cause chaos and healthcare  costs to skyrocket and deny 32 million people healthcare--it appears  the Republican leader has a last-ditch plan waiting in the wings.   As soon as they have an official score from the CBO--which could be  hours from now--in the dead of night, Senator McConnell will bring  forward legislation that Democrats, patients, families, and even many  Senate Republicans have not seen, and try to pass it before anyone can  so much as blink.   Now, we have heard rumors about what could be in this bill, and based  on what we know, Democrats took it upon ourselves to do the best we  could to figure out what its impact will be. The CBO scored our best  guess at what Republicans are talking about doing, and here is what  they found: Sixteen million people will lose their healthcare coverage  in the next 10 years under this bill; premiums will increase by 20  percent every single year for the next 10 years; your premiums will  increase 20 percent every single year in the next 10 years, all while  special interests in the healthcare industry are going to get a massive  tax break.   Republicans could still play games with the language as they  negotiate in secret somewhere to try to get a bit ``better'' than this,  but no matter what they do here, if they jam it through, they will be  held accountable for the millions of people who lose care and the  millions and millions more who will see their premiums go up.   I hope, when my Senate Republican colleagues began their process,  they were not planning to pass a bill in the dark of night to deny  millions of people healthcare and hand special interests billions in  tax breaks, but, right now, that is the path they are careening down-- even as more and more people are speaking up about what the impact of  this legislation would have.   In fact, just yesterday, a bipartisan group of 10 Governors wrote a  letter urging Senate Republicans to reject this secret bill, saying it  would--I am quoting 10 bipartisan Governors--``accelerate health plans  leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer  Americans having access to coverage.''   I hope every single Senate Republican read that letter.   I also hope they understand that if they pass this bill tonight, it  will only get worse from here. If this secret bill--the lowest common  denominator--goes through and a conference starts with the House, then  every Senate Republican who voted for it has just bought TrumpCare a  trip to the White House. The Senate Republicans who so loudly made  clear they hated the TrumpCare bill when it passed the House could now  very well find themselves being held responsible for sending that same  bill straight to President Trump's desk because, let's be honest,  extreme conservatives aren't going to rest until they have a bill on  the way to the White House that would spike premiums and out-of-pocket  costs, gut protections for preexisting conditions, end Medicaid as we  know it, defund Planned Parenthood, and kick tens of millions of people  off their coverage--a bill that would, in other words, shatter the  promises of more responsible Republicans who I know are deeply  concerned about ways these outcomes would impact the people they serve.   So, to put it simply, a bill in conference is no excuse to kick  people off coverage, spike premiums by 20 percent for everyone, and  give a massive tax break to the wealthy, especially because it will  simply be an opportunity to hand the keys over to the House Freedom  Caucus.   I want to remind any Senate Republican who doesn't want to have  TrumpCare on their hands--who truly does want to make our healthcare  system work better for patients and families--there is a better path.  As Senator McCain said so powerfully earlier this week, we shouldn't  let the ``bombastic loudmouths'' drive our work. We should get back to  regular order, and we still can.   I am saying to every Senate Republican every chance I get: Drop this  partisan, sham floor process. Drop it. Start over with an open,  transparent process in which both sides, patients, and families across  the country have a voice.   I hope that as big as our differences are, many of my Republican  colleagues would prefer that bipartisan voice and route. They have said  as much. Their votes to reject the partisan TrumpCare and full repeal  bills this week made it even clearer.   So let's have hearings like Chairman Alexander has proposed to do in  our HELP Committee. Let's have a public  [[Page S4363]]  debate. Let's focus on policies that lower costs, that expand coverage,  and improve quality.   Democrats are ready. We are at the table. I hope Senate Republicans  who are ready to work on real solutions will join us, but, first, for  that to happen, Senate Republicans need to step away from this sham  process we are on today. Say no. Vote no. Return us to a process we are  all involved in.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.                             Separation of Powers     Mr. President, I move to commit H.R. 1628 to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with instructions  to report the same back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any  day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that are within  the jurisdiction of such committee.   Mr. President, after months of secret negotiations and backroom deals  and shutting out patients and families and women and Democrats and even  many Republicans from the process, Republican leaders continue to say  they are planning to force a vote on this latest TrumpCare bill  tonight--a bill even Republicans admit would throw our markets into  turmoil. It is going to kick millions of people off of care, it is  going to raise premiums for millions of families, it will eliminate  healthcare for women across the country, and so much more--none of it  good.   It does not have to be this way. In fact, Republicans can still  reverse this course. They can drop this once and for all and join with  Democrats to get to work to actually improve healthcare, to reduce  costs, to increase access, and to improve quality. We can start over  with an open, transparent process, in which both sides--Democrats and  Republicans--have a voice and one in which patients and families can  make sure their priorities are being addressed.   Now, I know many of our Republican colleagues prefer this bipartisan  route. We have heard them say it. They have said it over and over in  their votes to reject the partisan TrumpCare bill and  [[Page S4401]]  full repeal bills this week, in their discussions of hearings we should  be holding, and in their comments even over the past few hours, laying  out how devastating this bill would be for patients and healthcare  markets and making it clear they do not trust the House to not simply  pass whatever moves through the Senate.   So I call on Republicans now to join us. Let's do what my colleague,  the senior Senator from Arizona, and so many others have bravely called  for. With this motion, we will send it back to the committee, where we  can debate it, where we can work together, where we can do what is  right for the people we represent.   I urge my colleagues to support this motion to commit in the way that  Republicans and Democrats have been talking about. I can personally  assure every one of you that I will work with you--and I know other  Democrats will as well--if we reject this process and send it back with  this motion to commit to do it the right way, the respectful way.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.    Mr. President, may I respectfully ask the chairman a  question?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a question?    It is, and I just----   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a question?    Regarding time, I just have a question so that Members  can know how to manage their time between now and the 45 minutes when  we have the vote.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 46 minutes remaining; the  Democrats have zero.    If I could just respectfully ask the chairman, since we  have only had this bill for an hour, we have, as you can see, a number  of Senators who want to speak. I would just respectfully ask if there  is any time we will have between now and the vote to make any comments,  since we have just had, for a very short amount of time, the bill that  we will be voting on, which will obviously impact millions of  Americans.    Mr. Chairman, I----    Mr. Chairman, I----    Mr. Chairman, I----    Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a parliamentary  inquiry?
