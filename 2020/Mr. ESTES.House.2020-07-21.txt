 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th birthday  of my hometown, Wichita, Kansas.   Our history began as a trading post at the confluence of the Arkansas  and Little Arkansas Rivers.   Around 1930, a booming oil industry and the flat planes of Kansas  fostered the formation of aircraft manufacturers like Cessna, Stearman,  and Beechcraft, creating a rich aviation history in the Air Capital of  the World.   Pizza Hut, Coleman, and Freddie's Frozen Custard can also claim  Wichita as their founding city. And notable Americans like Secretary of  State Mike Pompeo, Emmy Award winner Kirstie Alley, famed lawman Wyatt  Earp, Olympic athlete Jim Ryun, and Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel are  all part of Wichita's unique and influential story.   Our strong work ethic, Native American heritage, Kansas values, and  deep agribusiness and manufacturing roots make Wichita the perfect  American city to live, work, and play.   I am looking forward to Wichita's next 150 years.                            ____________________
