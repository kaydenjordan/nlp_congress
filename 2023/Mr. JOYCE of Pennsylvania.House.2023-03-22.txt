 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address an issue  that impacts nearly 200,000 women each year. Triple-negative breast  cancer, or TNBC, makes up 15 percent of invasive breast cancer cases in  the United States. Unfortunately, this deadly disease often fails to  show up on scans or even in biopsies.   This form of breast cancer can spread quickly. Sadly, because of the  nature of the cancer cells involved, there are fewer treatment options  available compared to the other forms of cancer that many patients  face.   Studies have shown a geographic link to contracting TNBC, and 3 out  of every 1,000 women in Pennsylvania will contract this form of breast  cancer each year. That is why it is so critical that we raise awareness  for this disease and encourage women to be screened, as catching this  disease early can significantly improve patient outcomes.   Even if you are feeling well, talk with your doctor about being  screened for cancer. These procedures are often noninvasive and can  make the difference in your family and in your life.   Together, we can raise awareness and fight against deadly diseases  like triple-negative breast cancer that claim far too many American  lives.                     Celebrating National Agriculture Day     Mr. Speaker, as we Celebrate National  Agriculture Day, we recognize the farmers, growers, and producers that  work to feed our families and provide our children with nutrient-rich  foods that they so desperately need.   Dairy farmers in central Pennsylvania work hard to provide dairy  products like milk, cheese, and yogurt that are essential to childhood  and adolescent development. Bones, muscle, brain, and vital organs all  rely on products like whole milk for healthy development--the whole  milk that cannot be replicated by inadequate limitations that are found  in plants and nuts.   Our students deserve better than these fraudulent products, and we  cannot allow almonds or soy to be passed off as dairy to American  families.   It is time to ensure that whole milk is once again available in every  school cafeteria. It is time to pass legislation like the DAIRY PRIDE  Act and the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act that will support families,  support the growth of students, and support our dairy farmers.                            ____________________
