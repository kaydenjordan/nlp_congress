 Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 18, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   For nearly half a century, Republicans and Democrats shared a  bipartisan position that we should not use taxpayer dollars to fund  abortions. Unfortunately, Democrats have now changed their mind.   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we codify the Hyde amendment,  which protects the conscience rights of all Americans. We must also  continue working across the aisle on solutions for low-income mothers  and children, including housing, childcare, and healthcare to ensure  every child is given equal opportunities, no matter the circumstances  of their conception or birth.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
