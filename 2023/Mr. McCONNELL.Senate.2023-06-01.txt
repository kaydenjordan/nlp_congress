 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The Republican leader is recognized.                          Fiscal Responsibility Act     Madam President, last night, an overwhelming majority  of our House colleagues voted to pass the agreement Speaker McCarthy  reached with President Biden. In doing so, they took an urgent and  important step in the right direction for the health of our economy and  the future of our country.   The Fiscal Responsibility Act avoids the catastrophic consequences of  a default on our Nation's debt, and just as importantly, it makes the  most serious headway in years toward curbing Washington Democrats'  reckless spending addiction. The bill that the House just passed has  the potential to cut Federal spending by $1.5 trillion. Now the Senate  has the chance to make that important progress a reality.   Madam President, remember where we were just a few months ago. After  2 years of reckless spending and painful, runaway inflation, the  American people elected a Republican House majority to serve as a check  on Washington Democrats' power. It was clear from the outset that  preserving the full faith and credit of the United States was going to  come down to an agreement that could pass both the people's House and  earn the President's signature--in other words, direct negotiations  between Speaker McCarthy and President Biden just like I have said for  months--for months.   So, back in February, Speaker McCarthy got right to work. He made it  clear to the President he was ready to take serious steps, not only to  avoid crisis in the near term but to put government spending on a more  sustainable path for the long term.   Unfortunately, it took President Biden months to accept this basic  reality, but when the President finally came to the table, House  Republicans worked hard to secure as many serious spending reforms as  possible, considering that we were in a divided government, and they  produced a deal that moves every key Republican priority in the right  direction.   The Speaker's agreement cuts domestic discretionary spending while  increasing support for veterans and the Armed Forces. It locks in  promising reforms to infrastructure permitting. It claws back unspent  COVID emergency funds. It slashes bloated spending at the IRS. It ties  future executive branch regulations to new spending cuts.   The deal the House passed last night is a promising step toward  fiscal sanity. Ah, but make no mistake, there is much more work to be  done. The fight to reel in wasteful spending is far from over.   Our obligation to provide for the common defense is especially  urgent. For years, Republicans have led significant investments in  improving the readiness of our Armed Forces and modernizing their  capabilities to face down emerging threats, but since President Biden  took office, Republicans have had to fight year after year to ensure we  meet the needs of our military.   Fortunately, we have secured bipartisan recognition that President  Biden's budget requests have underfunded our national defense. This was  especially true last year when Republicans secured a substantial, real- dollar increase to defense funding and ended Democrats' artificial  demands for parity with nondefense discretionary spending. This bought  our military valuable time, but it was hardly a silver bullet.   As I said yesterday, President Biden's refusal to let the defense  portion of this agreement exceed his insufficient budget request is  certainly disappointing.   So while the coming votes are an important step in the right  direction, we cannot--cannot--neglect our fundamental obligation to  address the Nation's most pressing national security challenges.  Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine continues. Iran's state  sponsorship of terrorism against Americans and our partners continues.  North Korea's destabilizing nuclear proliferation continues. China's  growing challenge to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific continues  as well.   So the Senate cannot afford to neglect its obligation to America's  men and women in uniform. Our urgent work to help them defend our  Nation, support our allies, and safeguard our interests remains  unfinished, and so does our work to bring more of Washington Democrats'  reckless liberal spending to heel.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
