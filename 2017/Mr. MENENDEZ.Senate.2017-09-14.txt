 Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent for  rollcall vote No. 197, the motion to invoke cloture on McCain-Reed  amendment No. 1003, as modified, the substitute to H.R. 2810, the  National Defense Authorization Act for 2018. Had I been present, I  would have voted yea.                            ____________________
