 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4760, the  Securing America's Future Act, vital legislation to the State of  Arizona. My constituents back home know all too well how desperately we  need our borders secured. I signed on as a cosponsor of this bill  because it will fund a wall and other protective infrastructure, close  the gaping loopholes in our immigration laws, and finally secure our  southern border, ending this problem once and for all.   It is disappointing that with all of the rhetoric coming from my  colleagues across the aisle, they still refuse to come to the  negotiating table and work toward a legislative solution.   Our broken immigration system cannot continue to be ignored. I want  to thank Chairman McCaul and Chairman Goodlatte for their work on this  much-needed legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support  this bill.
