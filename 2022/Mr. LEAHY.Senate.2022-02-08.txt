 Mr. President, it is appropriate to take a moment here in  the Senate to recognize David Ferriero, the 10th Archivist of the  United States. Mr. Ferriero has held the top position at the National  Archives since 2009, overseeing the maintenance and preservation of  critical documents like the Constitution and the Declaration of  Independence, along with 10 million maps, 13 million pages of text, and  tens of millions of photographs. On January 13, 2022, Mr. Ferriero  announced his intention to retire in April.   Prior to his nomination and confirmation to be Archivist of the  United States, David Ferriero spent decades as a librarian and library  administrator for some of the largest research institutions and public  library networks. After service in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam  war, Mr. Ferriero worked as a librarian at the Massachusetts Institute  of Technology for over three decades. In 1996, he moved to North  Carolina, where he served as the vice provost for library affairs at  Duke University, where he helped to develop the Triangle Research  Library Network to facilitate greater access to research materials and  collaboration across universities. Later, Mr. Ferriero was appointed  the Andrew W. Mellon director and chief executive of the research  libraries of the New York Public Library system.   David Ferriero was nominated by President Obama and confirmed to be  Archivist of the United States by the Senate in November 2009.  Throughout his tenure as the leader of the National Archives, Mr.  Ferriero made it his goal to bring the Archives and its vast range of  historical records into the 21st century. He focused on digitizing the  Archives' materials and improving availability of these materials  online so that more Americans could access and benefit from these  primary source records. Under his leadership, the National Archives  also embraced social media and worked hard to bring more Americans into  the creation, organization, and maintenance of our Nation's history and  records.   The documents and records maintained by the National Archives reflect  the foundation and continuing story of our democracy and our Nation.  They outline and define the evolution of the United States, documented  throughout the pages of history, and preserved at the Archives as  original source material. At this critical juncture in our endless  march toward a more perfect union, our history becomes even more  instructive.   Mr. Ferriero's commitment to making our Nation's archives more open  and more available to all of us is to be commended and will be a  hallmark of his tenure as the Archivist of the United States. I wish  Mr. Ferriero and his wife, Gail, all the best in the next chapter of  their lives.   I ask unanimous consent that a profile of Mr. Ferriero, appearing in  The Washington Post on January 13, 2022, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 13, 2022]       David S. Ferriero, Archivist of the United States, Is Retiring                           (By Michael E. Ruane)         David S. Ferriero, who has been the archivist of the United       States for more than a decade under three presidents, is       planning to retire in April.        Ferriero, 76, has been head of the National Archives and       Records Administration since he was appointed by President       Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2009.        ``It has been the honor of a lifetime,'' Ferriero wrote in       a note to his staff Wednesday. ``My time here has been filled       with opportunities, challenges, and awesome responsibilities.       . . . I am humbled and awestruck and so deeply grateful--      grateful to all of you.''        In addition to housing national treasures such as the       Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of       Rights, the National Archives holds 13 billion pages of text,       10 million maps, charts and drawings, as well as tens of       millions of photographs, films and other records.        The archives is also responsible for the nation's 13 brick-      and-mortar presidential libraries.        Before coming to the agency, Ferriero was director of the       New York Public Libraries and served in top positions at the       libraries of the Massachusetts Institution of Technology and       Duke University. A native of Beverly, Mass., he served as a       Navy hospital corpsman during the Vietnam War.        A self-described introvert, he is reserved and has a dry       sense of humor. On his watch in 2014, the National Archives       held its first sleepover.        He has pushed the digitization of the archives, and he       embraced social media. In November, he noted in a blog post,       ``We know that not everyone can come to our facilities [for       research] and providing these records online democratizes       access.''        He has also promoted the role of ``citizen archivists'' who       volunteer to transcribe and review historic documents online.        ``I have met or known half of all Archivists of the United       States . . . and none has done better'' than Ferriero,       historian Michael Beschloss tweeted.        One of the items framed in Ferriero's office is a copy of a       letter he wrote to President John F. Kennedy when he was in       high school. The letter had been found at the Kennedy       Presidential Library in Boston.        The future archivist asked about the Peace Corps and       requested a photo of JFK.        Later, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library found       two letters Ferriero had written to President Eisenhower as a       youngster, and the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library       found one he had written to President Johnson. Ferriero had       them framed in his office, too.        In 2020, the National Archives faced criticism when it       posted in its headquarters building an exhibit with a picture       that had been altered to blur out words suggesting criticism       of President Donald Trump.        The large color photograph, designed to celebrate the       centennial of women's suffrage, showed a massive protest       crowd on Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women's March on Jan.       21, 2017, the day after Trump's inauguration. The original       photo had been altered to obscure some words on signs held by       marchers.        A placard that proclaimed ``God Hates Trump'' had ``Trump''       blotted out so that it read ``God Hates.'' A sign that read       ``Trump & GOP--Hands Off Women'' had the word ``Trump''       blurred out.        Less than 24 hours after Washington Post reporter Joe Heim       pointed out the alterations, the National Archives       apologized.        ``We made a mistake,'' it said in a statement. ``As the       National Archives of the United States, we are and have       always been completely committed to preserving our archival       holdings, without alteration.        ``We were wrong to alter the image,'' it said. ``We       apologize, and will immediately start a thorough review of       our exhibit policies and procedures so that this does not       happen again.''        The altered picture was removed and replaced with an       unaltered one.        ``Our credibility, so important to our mission,       understandably has been questioned.'' Ferriero wrote on his       blog. ``I take full responsibility for this decision and the       broader concerns it has raised . . . [and] pledge to restore       public confidence in this great institution.''        The National Archives is headquartered in a massive 84-      year-old granite and limestone landmark on Pennsylvania       Avenue in Washington's Federal Triangle. A ``temple to       American history.'' Ferriero called it.        The agency also has a large, more modern complex in College       Park, Md.        Deputy Archivist Debra Steidel Wall will serve as acting       archivist until the president nominates and the Senate       confirms a successor.        ``It is not easy to leave you with our important work       continuing, especially initiatives to foster equity and       enhance the employee and customer experiences,'' Ferriero       told his staff. ``However, our profession is one of       stewardship, where despite our enduring responsibilities, we       are here for what amounts to a brief period of time.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the holiday season having just passed is a  wonderful reminder that the products of many small, local businesses  often make the best gifts. I would like to take some time today to  highlight Maple Landmark Woodcraft, a  [[Page S569]]  Vermont business that I have turned to year after year for gifts for  our children, grandchildren, other relatives and friends.   Today, Maple Landmark is one of the most prominent handmade wooden  toy manufacturers in the United States. However, like many businesses,  it started small, in Mike Rainville's family woodshop in rural Vermont  in the 1980s. Mike's business began with building and selling mostly  cribbage boards and tic-tac-toe games, but quickly grew to encompass a  wide range of toys, games, puzzles, and home decorations. Among Maple  Landmark's most famous products are the wooden letter train sets that  have graced the bedrooms of millions of children across the country.  They are also in the Leahy homes.   Over the past 40 years, due to its beautiful craftsmanship and joyful  products, Maple Landmark has been able to expand its sales operation to  toy stores and distributors throughout the United States and abroad.  All the while, it has maintained all manufacturing and sourcing  operations in Vermont, at their facility in Middlebury. Mike and his  team's devotion to their craft has allowed for the development of a  strong homegrown business in Vermont that has helped to show the world  all that our State has to offer.   In March 2020, as much of the world shut down and many families and  children began learning, working, and spending more time at home, the  popularity of Maple Landmark's toys and games exploded. Facing an  unprecedented increase in orders from across the United States, Maple  Landmark has been firing on all cylinders. This past holiday season was  its busiest yet.   Unfortunately, Landmark Maple has not been immune to the labor  shortages that continue to strain businesses nationwide. While labor  shortages are nothing new for many businesses across rural communities  in Vermont, those brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have been  particularly challenging. The inability to find a sustainable workforce  coupled with the greater effort necessary to recruit and train new  workers has made it more difficult for Landmark Maple to take advantage  of rising demand that would otherwise be a boon for the business.   The story of Landmark Maple is far from unique, and it reaffirms that  we need to do all we can to control the pandemic, vaccinate the  population, and fully restore the economy. Everyone who can get  vaccinated must get vaccinated. Everyone who is eligible for a booster  shot, must get their booster shot. If we make these responsible choices  and continue to prioritize the collective health and safety of our  families and communities, more Americans will be willing and able to  enter, reenter, and remain in the workforce. In doing so, we will be  able to ensure that businesses like Maple Landmark Woodcraft can  continue to operate and contribute to their communities for years to  come.   Maple Landmark was profiled in a November 10, 2021, article published  in the Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent that the article  titled, ``Ho, ho, no: For maker of wooden toys, the struggle ahead of  Christmas is not finding supplies, but finding workers'' be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Nov. 10, 2021]   Ho, Ho, No; For Maker of Wooden Toys, the Struggle Ahead of Christmas                Is Not Finding Supplies, But Finding Workers                             (By Jeanne Whalen)         With eight weeks to go until Christmas, tensions were       running high at one of Vermont's oldest toymakers. As hammers       fell on hardwood and machine tools cut train engines,       managers gathered around a table to confront a daunting list       of unfilled orders.        ``We need 32 sets of chess pieces. I don't have 32 sets,''       assembly supervisor Anne Cummings told half a dozen       colleagues, sparking a quick discussion of when the items       might appear.        ``Umm, hobby horses? We'll want at least three to get       finished by tomorrow at the latest,'' process engineer Adam       Rainville told the workshop foreman.        Unlike much of the toy industry, Maple Landmark isn't       suffering from a lack of imported materials as global supply       lines buckle. The maker of wooden toys gets nearly all its       lumber from nearby mills and has little trouble buying       lacquer, paint and sandpaper from its Vermont suppliers.        As it fields an unprecedented crush of orders, the main       factor holding it back is a shortage of workers.        ``We're just really, really busy and hiring workforce is a       challenge,'' said Mike Rainville, who founded the business 40       years ago. ``We could use more in assembly. We can use more       in the shop. I mean, really, any production position we can       probably use help in.        Rainville has been trying for weeks to hire three or four       workers to add to his crew of 46, but competition is fierce.       The cheese factory up the road has eight open positions. The       cidery next door and the teddy bear factory on Route 7 have       large ``Help Wanted'' signs outside. Maple Landmark has       raised its average wage rate by more than 7 percent over the       last year, Rainville said--the average production worker       earns over $15 an hour--but some local companies with deeper       pockets are offering signing bonuses, a perk Rainville said       he can't afford to match.        With an unemployment rate of only 2.9 percent, Vermont is       an extreme example of a problem plaguing employers across the       country. In some regions, a shortage of workers is more       challenging to Christmas preparations than the global       scarcity of semiconductors or the cargo deluge overwhelming       ports.        A nationwide shopping spree is exacerbating the strain on       companies like Maple Landmark. Flush with cash from nearly       two years of forgoing restaurant meals and travel, Americans       are bingeing on products--electronics, clothes, gifts and       anything else they can click into an online shopping cart.        In September, household spending on goods was 14 percent       higher than it was as the pandemic was beginning in February       2020, according to David Wilcox, an economist with the       Peterson Institute for International Economics. If normal       pre-pandemic trends had continued, demand for goods would be       only 5 percent higher now, he said.        Maple Landmark felt the surge as soon as it began. In early       2020, Rainville was grumbling to his staff about the surplus       of Chinese checkers sets gathering dust in inventory. But by       April and May, as Americans were trapped indoors under       lockdown, ``we sold hundreds of them,'' he said.        A rush of online orders last year nearly made up for the       collapse in Maple Landmark's sales to shuttered retailers.       Now, with many shops having reopened, ``we're getting hit       from all sides,'' Rainville said. ``Every week we are falling       further behind our incoming orders.''        Recently, the company stopped taking Christmas orders from       new retailers so it could focus on its existing retail       clients.        Maple Landmark has searched for workers the conventional       way--with posts on the employment website Indeed.com--and the       quirky Vermont way, with a sign near its kindling pile behind       the shop.        The company leaves wood scraps there for anyone to take.       This summer, Rainville tacked a piece of paper to the shed:       ``Help Wanted. Employees get dibs on scrap wood! Apply       inside.''        That brought in a few candidates, leading to one hire. But       other interviews led nowhere, perhaps because workers have so       many choices, Rainville said.        ``People come in thinking that, gosh, making toys, that       sounds like fun,'' he said. ``Once they take a tour through       the shop or something, they say, `Okay, this is work.' And       then, maybe if we had interest, we'd call them in for a       second interview and they don't respond.''        It's also hard to find people good at working with their       hands, Rainville said, a phenomenon he attributes to the       decline in farming life, which taught people to fix and build       things.        Vermont demographics--an aging population and a shrinking       workforce--were already working against employers before the       pandemic. With the new consumption surge, competition for       workers has become extreme.        A few months ago, Rainville found himself vying with the       local school bus company for one employee.        ``We almost came close to getting her on full-time in the       summer, and then the bus company called her up and said, `We       need you in the fall and we're going to pay you anything to       have you.' ''        Signs of the problem are everywhere. In nearby Burlington,       several long shelves at a CVS Pharmacy were bare, including       large sections missing school supplies and ibuprofen. An       employee said the pharmacy couldn't find enough workers to       stock the shelves, while a sign on the door said the store       was trimming its opening hours due to staffing shortages.        Shopping at the CVS was Devlin Cahill-Garcia, a 20-year-old       community college student who earns $13 an hour working at a       shop on the other side of town. ``I do have a job at the       moment, but I'm trying to find a better one, which is easier       than ever now,'' he said.        When covid hit, some of Cahill-Garcia's friends at the       University of Vermont quit their part-time jobs in       Burlington. Many haven't returned, possibly because their       parents can support them, he said. ``After being unemployed       so long, I don't think a lot of people want to go back to       work,'' he said        Down the road, Lake Champlain Chocolates has asked its       administrative staff, including marketing director Allyson       Myers, to take shifts in the factory to keep up with holiday       demand that is 20 percent higher than in 2019.        ``This has been a kind of organization-wide call of, `Okay,       administrative team, we need you to step up and help us       because we are  [[Page S570]]       short,' '' said Myers, who has pitched in bagging Hanukkah       gelt and peppermint patties.        The family-owned company also held its first job fair this       month to try to fill about 20 openings and has raised its       manufacturing starting wage by about 10 percent since last       year, said Myers, who called the labor shortage a bigger       problem than supply-chain issues.        Matt Parker, head of sales at Danforth Pewter, a workshop       and retail business that sells ornaments and home decor,       agreed with that assessment. The company has had no trouble       getting pewter from its Rhode Island supplier but has       struggled to fill about eight openings in production,       customer service and retail, Parker said.        The company has raised wages this year--by 5 to 10 percent,       he estimated--and is offering bonuses to new and existing       employees. Parker said he doesn't know why it has been so       hard to hire, but guessed that the pandemic ``obviously threw       a lot of people off entering the workforce'' and made them       worry about getting infected.        At Maple Landmark, soaring demand and a lack of workers       this summer stripped the company of its inventory, leaving it       with little to fill the holiday rush. As a result, the       woodworkers are making things to order as purchases roll in.        One of the company's biggest sellers is the ``name       train''--a chain of brightly colored letters on wheels that       spell a child's name, between an engine and a caboose.       Letters are everywhere in the workshop--an automated machine       cutting a tray of O's, a worker putting wheels on a carton of       red H's.        At the morning meeting, Cummings raised an urgent problem:       They had run out of the letter E.        ``Yellow E,'' clarified Rainville's mother, Pat Rainville,       who works in production. The customer has specifically       requested that color for that letter, so more would have to       be made.        At her station downstairs, Pat Rainville motioned toward a       wall of shelves that should have been stuffed with boxes       holding every letter in a variety of hues. But many of the       shelves were empty.        Things got so bad over one recent weekend that even the       letter Q was in short supply, Mike Rainville said. ``We know       we're low when even Q's run out.''                            ____________________
