 Madam President, I have just come on the floor and have  to chuckle about my friend from Texas in his deciding that it is the  minority in the Senate that is holding up legislation that needs to be  brought up when we have been coming to the floor every day after  Senator McConnell has indicated he is probably the Grim Reaper and  after we have indicated very clearly that he has turned this into a  legislative graveyard. So I have to smile when I hear the words from my  friend.   Let me set the record straight before I talk about what I came to the  floor to talk about.   Amazingly, the House of Representatives, even with the challenge that  it has in front of it--that it didn't ask for, that it didn't welcome,  that was brought to it by the continued abuse of power and other  actions of the President of the United States--is fulfilling its  constitutional responsibilities. It has passed over 300 different  pieces of legislation and has sent them over to the U.S. Senate. It is  my understanding that 250 of those bills are bipartisan bills; yet we  can't get any of them to be taken up on the floor of the Senate.   We come to the floor every week. I am involved in efforts every week  to say: Let's pass the bill that will protect people's pensions. People  who have worked their whole lives and are close to retirement or are  already retired in my State who have put money in pensions are getting  50, 60, 70 percent cuts in their pensions because they got caught in  the financial crisis. When Wall Street collapsed, the big banks were  bailed out, but when it came time to bail out the pensions that were  invested in those big banks--or the IRAs or 401(k)s--somehow, we  couldn't get the Republican support to do that. I  [[Page S6847]]  would love to see that brought up. It could be brought up any day. It  could be brought up today, and--bingo--we would pass it.   The other thing that we could be doing is passing legislation the  House sent us months ago. There is legislation on preexisting  conditions. Everybody says we don't want people to lose their  preexisting conditions coverage on their healthcare. Great. Let's pass  the legislation that came over from the House in order to protect that.  Let's make sure that it happens.   There is the Violence Against Women Act, which has been waiting for  over 200 days, and there are the efforts on gun safety--things we all  agree to. There are issues on gun safety and background checks, and  well over 90 percent of the American public agrees with it. This  legislation came over from the House months ago, but we can't get any  action on the Senate floor. There is legislation that deals with carbon  pollution and the climate crisis. It goes on and on and on.   There are over 300 different pieces of legislation that have been  passed by the House while it is also having to address what is clearly  a constitutional challenge that is very serious for our country. We  have not had that in front of us, so we could have easily been bringing  bills forward every week that would make a difference in people's  lives. We could have been lowering their healthcare costs, lowering  their prescription drug costs, making sure people's pensions are  protected, focusing on jobs and education and safety for their children  while they are in school.   We welcome it. Let's do it today and tomorrow. Let's go. We have over  300 bills that the House has sent to the Senate on which there has been  no action.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me speak more specifically about  healthcare.   I come to the floor every week and say the same thing, which is that  healthcare is personal, not political, for each one of us. That is  really true in our own families. We want whatever it takes to make sure  our children have what they need, that our moms and dads and grandpas  and grandmas have what they need, and that we have what we need with  healthcare. It is pretty basic. It is a common, human need that we all  share. Unfortunately, this has become a political issue here in DC.  Nowhere else is it a political issue. It is personal for people in  Michigan and around the country.   If a senior can't afford the medication she needs for a chronic  condition, that is personal. If parents don't have trusted doctors to  call when their children wake up with coughs and high fevers and they  don't know what is happening, that is personal. If a woman is charged  more for healthcare coverage than she needs to be just because she is a  woman and has detected cancer or if she wants to have it detected early  but doesn't have the healthcare with which to do that, that is very  personal.   Healthcare for each one of us is something very personal.  Unfortunately, the law that helps seniors afford their medications,  that provides families health insurance, that covers lifesaving  preventive care, and that protects people with preexisting conditions  is under political attack over and over.   From the very beginning, the Trump administration has been  undermining the healthcare of millions and millions of Americans. It is  now open enrollment season, and, unfortunately, the administration is  at it again--what it couldn't do here in this body when we voted no. We  would not repeal the Affordable Care Act. We would not rip apart the  healthcare system. This is what happened right here. It couldn't  achieve this through Congress--the legislative body, the people's  body--so it is now, through the backdoor, trying to find ways to  unravel and rip apart the healthcare system and have costs go up so it  can say: See? Look, costs are going up--because of what they are doing  behind the scenes to unravel everything.   So here we are. It is open enrollment to sign up for an Affordable  Care Act plan, and the administration is at it again. The Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services is using taxpayer funding to promote  third-party insurance brokers. I would encourage people to go to the  website healthcare.gov. You have until December 15 to do it. There used  to be a longer signup time. One of the things the administration has  done is to cut back the signup time, but you have until December 15.   When you go there now, though, it is a little tricky, a little  confusing. You have healthcare.gov, and then, depending on what button  you click, it takes you outside of healthcare.gov, the government  system, to private insurance brokers. The insurance brokers are allowed  to enroll people in quality, comprehensive plans, which are what the  Affordable Care Act provides, and you know what essential services are  covered. If they do that, they get paid, but if they sign you up  through an insurance company for what we call a junk plan, which  doesn't cover anything, then they get paid up to four times more. So  they get paid more if you get less coverage.   The problem is it is going to look good because it will probably cost  less for many folks, and you will not know what it covers until you get  sick. I don't know how many times it was before the Affordable Care Act  was passed that someone would call me and say: I have paid into my  insurance plan all my life, and I have never been sick. I got sick.  What do you mean it only covers 1 day in the hospital? What do you mean  it doesn't cover the ambulance? What do you mean I only get two  treatments?   That is what we mean by a junk plan--a plan that does not cover what  you would expect it to cover in terms of your care. So it is very  important that you go to healthcare.gov if this is something that you  are interested in, if you need insurance, or if you want to change your  plan. It is important that you go into the system, in fact, in which  you are going to be given quotes on comprehensive care and in which  there is accountability for the coverage.   Late last month, I released a report that outlined the many ways the  Trump administration has been undermining healthcare. It has nearly  eliminated the funding for what is called healthcare navigators, who  are people who can help you sign up for health insurance coverage. It  doesn't matter what it is or if you have a lot of questions, as it is  complicated; having somebody who can get on the phone to answer your  questions and walk you through it is important. Yet the funding for the  folks to do that--to help you, to answer your questions--has basically  been eliminated.   The administration has slashed the budget for advertising so that  people don't know it is open enrollment now. They don't know where they  can go to sign up or how many days they have in which to do that and  how to do it online.   As I mentioned before, the administration has cut the time in half  that you have to sign up.   The worst thing is, any day now, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,  which is backed by the Trump administration, could announce a ruling  that overturns the entire Affordable Care Act. This would take away  what we call Healthy Michigan, which is our Medicaid expansion. It  would take away the ability for your children to stay on your insurance  until they reach the age of 26. It would take away protections for  people with preexisting conditions. It would put back into place or  allow insurance companies to put back into place caps on the number of  treatments you can receive. It would also put back into place all of  the other restrictions that insurance companies had on care but that  had been eliminated with the Affordable Care Act.   I have to say, recently, when we looked at how this would impact  people with the possibility of eliminating the Affordable Care Act in  this court decision, we also realized that not only would it take away  healthcare for millions of Americans, but it would have the perverted  result of actually providing a tax cut to the wealthiest individuals  and to prescription drug companies and insurance companies that each  chip in to help pay for the tax cuts that average citizens have used in  order to get lower cost care.   It seems as though it doesn't matter what it is that our Republican  colleagues or this President supports, for it always ends up as another  tax cut for the wealthy. Unfortunately, with the  [[Page S6848]]  repeal of health insurance and all it would do to average families in  taking away their capacity to get care and the confidence that they can  get care for their families, it, too, would provide another tax  giveaway to the wealthy.   The court case and all it would do in repealing the Affordable Care  Act would have life-changing consequences for millions of people in  Michigan, including someone I would like to tell you about.   Henry is an outgoing 9-year-old who lives in Grosse Pointe, MI. Henry  loves people. He greets everyone he meets with a big hug. He also loves  performing. His favorite activity is dance class, and he enjoys singing  karaoke at home.   Henry, we have something in common. I like to sing too.   Henry is also living with a number of preexisting conditions,  including Down syndrome, autism, and severe reflux.   Henry's mom explains why comprehensive health insurance is so  important for her family. Henry was hospitalized at 8 months for an  infection that nearly took his life. Saving his life cost over $1  million. She added this: If we didn't have access to affordable  healthcare coverage, we would have been bankrupt before Henry was 1  year old.   No family should go bankrupt because a child was born with a genetic  condition or hospitalized with a serious illness. I want to remind my  colleagues that this could happen to any of us at any time.   Almost 4 years ago, my nephew and his wonderful wife, Mac and Allie,  had their firstborn girl, and she was born with only half a heart and  spent most of the first year of her life in the children's hospital at  the University of Michigan. She had incredible care. She is now almost  4 years old. Little Leighton is our miracle baby, but she came out with  a whole laundry list of preexisting conditions, ongoing challenges, and  a huge healthcare bill that I know, if we hadn't had healthcare  coverage, if they weren't able to get coverage, they would have done  anything--anything--including losing their home, in order to keep  Leighton alive and thriving. That is what we do for our kids. That is  what we do for our families. Too many people have been put in that  position.   That is one of the reasons the Affordable Care Act was put in place,  to give some options so that you wouldn't have to focus on losing  everything in order to protect your child's life. So that is what is at  stake right now.   Unfortunately, this administration is trying to turn the clock back  to a time when filing for bankruptcy or not being able to get your  child the lifesaving medical care they need was all too common. All  people with preexisting conditions deserve to know that their health  insurance will be there when they need it, just like Henry's was.   Half of the people in Michigan have preexisting conditions, and they  want to know that they are going to be OK, that their healthcare  coverage is not going to be ripped away. I want that for them too. I  want that for all of us.   Healthcare isn't political; it is personal. It is time to stop  playing politics with people's health and work to protect Henry and his  family and all of our families.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
