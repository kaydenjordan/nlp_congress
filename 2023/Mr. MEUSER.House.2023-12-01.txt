 Madam Speaker, will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 32,  which would repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB)  1071 rule, which mandates burdensome personal data collection from  small businesses when they apply for loans from financial institutions.   I very much thank Mr. Williams, the chairman of the Small Business  Committee, for introducing a similar resolution here in the House for  which I am a cosponsor.   Madam Speaker, we are hearing some information that should be of  great interest to us all, that there is no need for small businesses to  comply with the 1071 rule if, in fact, what we just heard is accurate.   I will take it a little bit further here. It is clear in Dodd-Frank  at section  [[Page H6058]]  1071 that any applicant for credit may refuse to provide any  information requested pursuant to subsection B in connection with any  application for credit.   However, the CFPB 1071 rule says a low response rate to this rule may  indicate a failure to comply. Therefore, the CFPB gets the statute  wrong, and this is another example of their overreach. If the statute  is clear that any applicant may refuse, then how can refusal somehow be  a sign that a lender is not complying with the statute? Lenders know  and are rightfully concerned that failing to get a high response rate  will likely result in running afoul of the CFPB or being publicly named  and shamed by progressive activists. Regulating to generate fear among  law-abiding businesses is terrible public policy, Madam Speaker.   I urge us to be real here, to deal with the real world, to actually  engage small businesses as the CFPB should do along with consumers,  along with homeowners, along with small businesses.   We need to support this resolution, and I urge all Members of this  House, as well as President Biden, to stand with small businesses.
