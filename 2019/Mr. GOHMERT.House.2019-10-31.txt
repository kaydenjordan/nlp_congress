 Madam Speaker, we had a vote today. Some would say it  was very important, but actually, it didn't do so much. In fact, it  revoked some of our history, some of our precedent, some of our rules  to take an unusual step toward supposed impeachment.   I still continue to be of the opinion that we will not end up having  a vote in this Chamber on whether or not to actually impeach President  Trump because if that happens, it goes to the Senate. It gets slam- dunked down in the Senate, both on the basis of a massive failure of  due process as well as no direct evidence of any wrongdoing, unless we  are talking about someone who is a Democrat and has held the second- highest office before. But this is not due process.   By the way, of course, once it gets to the Senate, they vote it down,  and then it ensures a repeat of 1996, where the current President is  reelected. I am sure my friends across the aisle don't want to do that.   I am still of the opinion that I don't think we will end up with a  vote to actually impeach or not impeach President Trump. We will see  how that plays out. But it is worth looking at precedent, as an old  history major who has never quit studying history.   If we look at the impeachment committee authorizations in 1974 and  1998, back then, when there was bipartisan concern about due process,  not just one-sided concern, the authorization by the House directed the  Committee on the Judiciary to investigate if there were sufficient  grounds for impeachment.   Currently, though, the Speaker directed six different committees,  with the House Intelligence Committee at the forefront, to continue  their ongoing investigations as part of what was called an impeachment  inquiry.   Regarding the subpoena power in 1974 and 1998, what was authorized in  the resolution back in the days when there was concern about due  process and fairness and ensuring justice would be done, the resolution  authorized both the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee on  the Judiciary to issue subpoenas acting jointly or unilaterally.                                time  1300    If either the chairman or the ranking member declined to act, then  the other had the right to refer the decision to the full committee.   Currently, under what we voted on today, it authorized the chair of  the Intelligence Committee, Chairman Schiff, and Judiciary Committee to  issue subpoenas, but the authorization to the ranking member only is  with the consent or approval of the chairman. It is incredible.   I mean, basically, our friends have said, well, it is like a grand  jury. Well, I have been a prosecutor in front of grand juries. I have  been a judge who impaneled grand juries, answered their questions, and  dealt with issues that arose over grand juries. I am quite familiar  with them.   With a grand jury, every single person on the grand jury who is going  to get a vote gets to hear every witness, gets to ask any question they  wish, and they could even send the prosecutor out of the grand jury if  they wish. He is only there as an adviser.   But what we have had not only was a sham impeachment inquiry, but  they actually had armed guards outside of the Sensitive Compartmented  Information Facility, the SCIF. They had armed guards with guns to try  to keep us out, people like me, on the Judiciary Committee, who is  fully authorized, under the current rules, to sit in on any impeachment  inquiry, participate, because the rules, through precedent, have made  clear it is the Judiciary Committee that does that.   The Speaker can't just stand up and say: ``I am changing all the  rules unilaterally''--except for the fact that, in this case, that is  exactly what happened. ``Forget the rules. I am decreeing these are the  committees that will do an investigation.''   And I didn't realize until we went into the SCIF, which I am  authorized to do and which, under the rules, Judiciary having  jurisdiction, I should have a right to hear each one of those  witnesses.   I didn't know until we got in there, it turns out, Chairman Schiff,  each time a witness was about to begin to speak to the Intelligence  Committee, the committees, he would instruct, now, this is  unclassified, so if a question is asked that you think might end up  revealing something classified, then you can just say you can't answer,  it might reveal classified information.   It sounds to me like that was instruction, when the Republicans ask  you a question you don't want to answer, just say, well, it may reveal  classified information, and you don't have to answer their questions.   Except that then we find out that, in the more recent depositions,  the witnesses were actually instructed not to answer questions.   Well, this metaphor of a grand jury totally breaks down. It doesn't  apply. There has never been a grand jury where one grand juror could  tell the witness you don't have to answer these other grand jurors'  questions, and we are going to put armed guards where people that are  on the grand jury can't get in to hear the testimony if we don't want  to hear the testimony.   Sure, they will have to vote at some point, but we are going to put  armed guards to keep the biggest part of the grand jury out of being  able to see the witnesses, to see their countenance as they answered  questions.   It is why in military courts martial that I participated in, in  Federal trials, in State trials we have an aversion to  [[Page H8710]]  having depositions. Yes, you have a lot of depositions in civil trials.   But in criminal trials, something as important as liberty--and I  would submit, a President being thrown out that was duly elected is  just as important. In such a case, you get to ask the questions, see  the questions; you get to hear the answers; and you get to observe the  witnesses. It is important.   Yet, under orders of the Speaker and Chairman Schiff, this so-called  comparative grand jury kept the huge majority out of those hearings  where we could hear and see for ourselves.   Now we find out, through the vote today, that, yes, the Judiciary  Committee is ultimately going to get this from the Intelligence  Committee. But never in the history of this country have we had such  gross unfairness that one party would put armed guards with guns to  prevent the duly authorized people from being able to hear the  witnesses and see them for themselves.   Then, oh, we hear from this resolution today, we are going to send  you the depositions after we get through doctoring and looking at and  editing the transcripts. We will send you those so you have the  evidence you need.   That is not the kind of evidence that a coup should be based on. If  we are going to have what they are trying to legalize as a coup, we  ought to have a right to see each of those witnesses. And the only  potential use for the depositions should be impeachment of those  witnesses, nothing else, not for anything substantive.   The President's attorneys, unlike in 1974 and 1998, were not allowed  to be there or even see and hear the witnesses. So the references to  this being a Star Chamber are not inappropriate. It is outrageous what  has been going on for people who truly care about due process.   Regarding the procedures now, the Judiciary Committee must operate  pursuant to the procedures imposed by the chairman of the Rules  Committee.   Well, previously, one of the oldest committees in the House of  Representatives, the Judiciary Committee, in prior impeachments made  the rules for the impeachment hearing. We didn't have it dictated by  the Rules Committee, no, because this is the Judiciary Committee. These  are people who are supposed to have expertise in constitutional issues.   So when you have the committee that has more expertise in  constitutional issues, what did the majority do? We don't want the  committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing with  these constitutional issues. We want to put armed guards outside a  hearing and have it in a Secret Compartmented Information Facility.   And we are not going to let the other side call their own witnesses  so we get a fair picture of what actually went on, and we are not even  going to let them ask questions we don't want them to ask. We will  instruct the witnesses not to answer because, you see, they want it to  be a one-sided, non-due process, sham court.    It is about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get  their wishes. And if there is one thing I don't want to see in my  lifetime, I don't want to ever have participation in, it is a civil  war.   Some historian--I don't remember who--said guns are only involved in  the last phase of a civil war. What is going on here has not protected  the Constitution. It has not protected the institutions. It has not  protected this little experiment in self-government. No.   What it has done is put it all at risk because what some people in  this body don't seem to understand is, when you set a precedent as  dangerous as what we have been watching for the last 3 years, it won't  be me, but there will be Republicans, if this isn't stopped, there will  be Republicans who will take the precedent of what the Democrats have  done here and use it against a Democratic President, try to set him up  and create a coup.   Like I say, it won't be me, but that is the way history works. When  somebody sets a precedent, then eventually somebody also not concerned  about due process is going to try to mimic that and go one further.   In 1974 and 1998, the committee procedures during the Nixon and  Clinton impeachment processes, they included the ability of the  President's counsel to attend all hearings, including those in  executive session; question any and all witnesses called before the  committee; submit written questions for additional testimony; provide  summaries of what he would propose to show; and respond to evidence  received and testimony presented, either orally or in writing, as  determined by the committee. The President's counsel could also review  all evidence obtained in the course of the impeachment inquiry.   Not only has the President's counsel not been allowed to do any of  those things that have been done in the past to ensure due process and  fairness, even the rest of this voting body that will have to vote on  an impeachment were not allowed to see the witnesses, to hear the  witnesses, to review the transcript until after they are through  working with the transcripts.   This resolution today, it bifurcates the impeachment, only allows the  President's counsel to participate in Judiciary Committee proceedings.  It provides no ability to participate in the ongoing Intelligence  Committee investigation.   If we presume that the procedures the Rules Committee has dictated to  us on high allow the President's counsel to participate in Judiciary  Committee proceedings at all, they will only have access to documents  transmitted to the Judiciary Committee and not all the material  obtained in the course of the Intelligence Committee's hearings.   I just happen to have H. Res. 803 from 1974 that involved--well, it  was from Chairman--Democratic Chairman Rodino, from the Committee on  the Judiciary.   See, that is the way it is supposed to be done. That is the way it  has been done in the past, 1974, 1998.   Under the rules that the Democrats passed earlier this year, in  January, the rules say, if a rule is not specific about a matter, then  precedence is the rule. That is the rule, and it has been ignored  repeatedly.   So we voted today basically rubberstamping the secret Star Chamber  hearings, the one-sided questioning of the witnesses. Oh, we did hear  today Republicans have equal time to the Democrats. It is just that  Democrats could ask whatever they wanted and get answers, and  Republicans couldn't.   Impeachment in the past, when we have impeached Federal judges  before, came through our Judiciary Committee, very bipartisan, because,  even as recent as the last 10, 12 years, even Adam Schiff realized,  when you are going to remove a Federal officer from a position he is  duly placed in, you have got to make sure you provide due process, and  you allow buy-in on both sides.   There was no buy-in today because, even though there are some  Republicans who are not big fans of the President, to put it mildly,  they realize this process is an outrage, and it is a threat to our  little experiment in self-government.                                time  1315    So an article comes out yesterday by Paul Sperry, entitled: ``The  Beltway's `Whistleblower' Furor Obsesses Over One Name.''   To my knowledge, I have not ever talked to this Paul Sperry with  RealClearInvestigations, but he brings out a name that has been bandied  about on the internet. A lot of people are speculating this guy was the  whistleblower.   Regardless of whether this guy is the whistleblower or not, it is  important to look at what has been going on with him. Just forget about  the claim he is a whistleblower; look at what he has been doing.   The more you find out, the more you realize, wow, President Trump  should have revoked clearances for prior potential conspirators long  before he did.   But then, in the article, it mentions a 33-year-old--we already knew  he was a male, that he worked for Vice President Biden, this guy. He  was held over from the Obama White House.   And one of the things that President Obama was able to do so much  better than President Trump was make sure that the people who worked in  the White House, in the CIA, in the DOJ, the FBI, but especially in the  White House, in the Old Executive Office Building for the Vice  President, they made much better certainty that everybody there was  going to be loyal to President Obama and Vice President Biden. They did  a magnificent job of that.  [[Page H8711]]    So anybody who is held over--in fact, I understand H. R. McMaster,  great Obama Democrat loyalist that was working, continuing to work in  the Trump administration, made clear that he didn't want to hear any of  his people ever say again that someone was an Obama holdover. I guess  he didn't want people outed in front of people loyal to the President  as being loyal to President Obama.   But McMaster also was a boss of this guy. He did work for Biden. He  worked for CIA Director John Brennan.    Brennan, as the article said, was ``a vocal critic of Trump who  helped initiate the Russia `collusion' investigation of the Trump  campaign during the 2016 election.''   Further, this guy ``left his National Security Council posting in the  White House's West Wing in mid-2017. . . .''   This guy was working in the White House; Loved Brennan, loved  McMaster, and he is in President Trump's White House and part of the  National Security Council. They get to see everything that concerns  anything on foreign policy and our own national security.   But there were ``concerns about negative leaks to the media. He has  since returned to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.''   The article says: `` `He was accused of working against Trump and  leaking against Trump,' said a former NSC official, speaking on  condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.''   Alas, this guy ``huddled for `guidance' with the staff of House  Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, including former  colleagues also held over from the Obama era whom Schiff's office had  recently recruited from the National Security Council.''   This guy ``worked with a Democratic National Committee operative who  dug up the dirt on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,  inviting her into the White House for meetings, former White House  colleagues said. The operative, Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American  who supported Hillary Clinton, led an effort to link the Republican  campaign to the Russian Government. `He knows her. He had her in the  White House,' said one former coworker. . . .''   ``Documents confirm the DNC opposition researcher attended at least  one White House meeting with'' this guy ``in November 2015. She visited  the White House with a number of Ukrainian officials lobbying the Obama  administration for aid to Ukraine.''   And that is the aid we know we have seen, heard former Vice President  Biden bragging: Hey, I am leaving in 6 hours, and if they want this $1  billion, then they are going to have to fire the prosecutor, who just  happened to be investigating the gas company that was giving millions  of dollars to his son.   The article says: `` `Everyone knows who he' ''--the whistleblower-- `` `is. CNN knows. The Washington Post knows. The New York Times knows.  Congress knows. The White House knows. Even the President knows who he  is,' said Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst and National Security  Advisor to Trump, who has fielded dozens of calls from the media.   ``Yet a rare hush swept across the Potomac.''   You know, normally, The New York Times and The Washington Post, they  can't wait to out a whistleblower, can't wait, don't mind seeing them  destroyed. But you look at a real whistleblower, not a fake one like we  have here, a real whistleblower with direct information like Adam  Lovinger, who, working in the Defense Department--I didn't know that  this scheme went that far.   But Lovinger is supposed to investigate improper payments by the  Defense Department, and he saw hundreds of thousands of dollars being  paid at different times to a guy named Stefan Halper, who is a  professor, and he couldn't see anything in return for all the money.   Then we have this investigation about President Trump and find out  that, actually, Halper was getting paid by the Defense Department to  help set up Trump campaign people so they could use that information to  go before a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court and get a  warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.   Phenomenal. The Defense Department is paying a guy to help set up the  Trump campaign before President Trump was ever elected so they could  get warrants to spy on the campaign.   It is incredible. The article says, ``Trump supporters blame the  conspiracy of silence on a `corrupt' and `biased' media trying to  protect the whistleblower from due scrutiny about his political  motives. They also complain Democrats have falsely claimed that  exposing his identity would violate whistleblower protections, even  though the relevant statute provides limited, not blanket, anonymity,  and doesn't cover press disclosures.   ``His Democrat attorneys meanwhile have warned that outing him would  put him and his family `at risk of harm,' although the government  security personnel have been assigned to protect him.''   And I come back to the facts. There are lots of people that have  testified adversely to President Donald J. Trump. As far as I know,  they are all still living, breathing, and saying nasty things about  him. Their health is not put in jeopardy in any way. Their personal  safety is not a problem.   Now, that is not true of some other people that have been in high  positions in this town where people end up dead in the morgue. I am not  saying they caused it. I am just saying, if you are worried about  outing some incident, somebody, President Trump is not the one you need  to worry about.   Fleitz said, ``They're hiding him. They're hiding him because of his  political bias. A CIA officer specializing in Russia and Ukraine,''  this person, ``was detailed over to the National Security Council from  the agency,'' meaning CIA, ``in the summer of 2015, working under Susan  Rice, President Obama's national security adviser. He also worked  closely with the former vice president.''   That is the same Susan Rice--according to a book a few years after-- according to that book it reported that Secretary Clinton called her  husband and said, they are wanting me to go out there and say this  attack in Benghazi was all about a video. And the advice was, you know,  you can't be the one that goes on the Sunday shows because nobody is  going to buy that.   So Susan Rice was picked to go out and tell people the attack in  Benghazi was based on a video, when most everybody, maybe not Susan  Rice, but most people who had looked into it at all knew it was not  about a video at all. And the Obama administration had been warned  repeatedly of the threat that was coming and didn't give them the  security they needed, nor did they allow anyone to go lift a finger to  help the people at Benghazi.   And I love hearing people on the other side say, oh, you investigated  Benghazi for so long and you had nothing. Yes, that is because the  Obama administration wouldn't produce anything that we asked for, the  important things we asked for. They covered things up. Same on Fast and  Furious, and we didn't have a Speaker on the Republican side that would  allow us to go to court and get those things released.   So the more important things that got released were a result of  Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton's folks going to court and getting the court  order to get things produced, but still there was so much that was not  produced we don't know all the facts about what happened.   By the way, I do know that Intelligence people lied to the Republican  chairman of Intelligence back then and he never would wake up and  realize it. Because he reported to our Republican conference after  Benghazi about 6 months after, well, guys, some of you have asked me,  isn't there somebody at Walter Reed that was injured? We keep hearing  rumors. And Mike said, no, I can tell you, there is no one who was  injured at Benghazi that is at Walter Reed.   I couldn't sit still anymore. It was in one of my trips to Walter  Reed I met such a person. He was on the roof with Tyrone Woods and the  other heroes. He had much of his leg blown off. And I had met him, and  I honored his request for anonymity being out there.   But I couldn't sit there and listen to the Republican chairman of  Intelligence perpetrating what he thought was true but was not, and I  knew it wasn't. I said, That is not true. He got red faced and said,  That is true. I said, No, I had lunch with the one yesterday. He said,  That is not true.  [[Page H8712]]    And he told me later after the meeting, I have talked to our  intelligence people, and they tell me that the guy you must have seen,  he is not at Walter Reed, he comes there for physical therapy. And I  said, No, I can tell you the building number and where his apartment  is, and it adjoins the physical therapy. It is right there on Walter  Reed.                                time  1330    Anyway, he didn't believe it.   I had emailed this great hero and didn't hear from him for a couple  of weeks. He later emailed back that: Gee, the strangest thing  happened. I had the most painful surgery on my leg.   He had numerous surgeries, but this was the most painful since half  of it got blown off on that rooftop in Benghazi. He said: They  medicated me because of all the pain. That night, in the middle of the  night, these guys show up at our apartment there, and they moved my  wife, my kids, all of us immediately off the hospital property. It  doesn't make sense.   Well, it made sense to me because we had intelligence people that  were covering up the lie that they had told the chairman of the  Intelligence Committee because he was a Republican chair. I bet they  don't lie like that to Adam Schiff.   Anyway, Federal records, according to the article, show that Biden's  office invited this guy ``to an October 2016 state luncheon the Vice  President hosted for Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Other invited  guests included Brennan, as well as then-FBI Director James Comey and  then-National Intelligence Director James Clapper.''   Several U.S. officials told RealClearInvestigations that the  invitation that was extended to this guy, who was a relatively low- level GS-13 Federal employee, ``was unusual and signaled he was  politically connected inside the Obama White House.''   Former White House officials said this guy ``worked on Ukrainian  policy issues for Biden in 2015 and 2016, when the Vice President was  President Obama's `point man' for Ukraine.'' He is a Yale graduate,  speaks Russian, Ukrainian, as well as Arabic.   ``He had been assigned to the NSC by Brennan. He was held over into  the Trump administration and headed the Ukraine desk at the NSC,''  under President Trump, ``eventually transitioning into the West Wing,  until June 2017. `He was moved over to the front office,' to  temporarily fill a vacancy, said a former White House official, where  he `saw everything, read everything.'''   The official added that it soon became clear among NSC staff that  this guy ``opposed the new Republican President's foreign policies. `My  recollection . . . is that he was very smart and very passionate,  particularly about Ukraine and Russia. That was his thing, Ukraine,' he  said. `He didn't exactly hide his passion with respect to what he  thought was the right thing to do with Ukraine and Russia, and his  views were at odds with the President's policies.'''   In May 2017, this guy went `` `outside his chain of command,'  according to a former NSC coworker, to send an email alerting another  agency that Trump happened to hold a meeting with Russian diplomats in  the Oval Office the day after firing Comey, who led the Trump-Russia  investigation. The email also noted that Russian President Vladimir  Putin had phoned the President a week earlier. Contents of the email  appeared to have ended up in the media, which reported Trump boasted to  the Russian officials about firing Comey, whom he allegedly called  `crazy, a real nut job.'''   In effect, this guy ``helped generate the `Putin fired Comey'  narrative, according to the research dossier making the rounds in  Congress.''   Anyway, it is a mess.   Now, one of the things about whistleblower protections, though, is if  you were to be prosecuted for committing a crime, then the  whistleblower status could be used to help hold off potential  prosecution. It is my understanding that it would not likely win the  day, but it could delay a prosecution.   Say, hypothetically, you worked for somebody like Brennan, or say,  hypothetically, you worked for somebody like McMaster and Brennan, and  you helped come up with a conspiracy to oust a duly-elected sitting  President by alleging some conspiracy with Russia, and you found out  that the Attorney General and the U.S. attorney assigned to investigate  the origins of the Russia hoax were closing in on participants of your  conspiracy.   Well, if you had a really smart lawyer, he might just tell you, if  you could get whistleblower status, if they start closing in on you,  then we can start filing motions to keep you out of that prosecution  because if you are a whistleblower, you are in a protected status. It  shouldn't prevent the ultimate prosecution, but it could delay things  for a while.   So it could make sense, if you are a coconspirator and trying to  bring down a duly-elected President, that you might want that  whistleblower status.   The problem with that is--and this is a problem for a tainted  inspector general who would protect such a whistleblower--if you are  complaining, it has to be, to get that status, somebody in your chain  of command. The President, we were told, is not in the whistleblower's  chain of command because that is outside, the CIA.   It has to be within that leadership ladder, and the President is  outside of that. So he wasn't a real whistleblower. Plus, a  whistleblower has to have direct evidence.   What we have seen with this march of the gossipmongers, as it is best  described, that have been paraded into the secret Star Chamber with the  armed guards outside of it so that other members of this grand jury  can't get to see and hear the witnesses, it really appears to be a  march of those who don't like President Trump and are willing to sully  in some cases valiant military service, a great career. They are  willing to have that tarnished and sullied by becoming gossipmongers.   For example, one person who apparently had a great career in the  Army, William Taylor, I understand he was in the infantry for 6 years.  I was at Fort Benning for 4 years, and I can tell you, anybody who was  a commander in the infantry didn't last any time at all if he allowed  gossipmongers, like he has become, to come before him and say: Captain,  Captain, I heard that somebody else heard something that was said.   He would throw him out of the office: I am not going to be running a  gossip column here. If somebody knows something directly, send them to  me, but don't you come in here being a gossipmonger.    Well, now he has become the gossipmonger. ``Well, I heard that  somebody else heard that they heard the President say. . . .''   I just come back to this, as someone who had to sit and listen and  evaluate evidence and make life and death decisions in a courtroom, you  analyze what kind of person this is before me as a witness. If you have  a witness before you that is willing to try to destroy and remove a  President from office who was duly elected under our Constitution, and  they are now willing to use secondhand, thirdhand, fourth-hand gossip,  it tells you they are not the great person that they once were. They  are not the patriot they once were. They are nothing but gossipmongers.   If you are going to be a fair arbiter of truth and justice, it should  dramatically diminish your evaluation and analysis of what they have to  say. This is not a classy person. This is a gossipmonger.   That is what William Taylor became for the Intelligence Committee,  and that is what Vindman became.   Some have said: Oh, gee, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, he is the  ultimate American. He even came in uniform.   Well, I was trained that if you are going to say bad things about  someone in your chain of command, including the Commander in Chief-- because a lot of us were not happy with President Carter when I was at  Fort Benning, but we all knew you can't say anything negative about  President Carter, especially not in uniform. It doesn't matter if it is  true. You can't do it.   He comes parading in, in his uniform, to try to take down a sitting  President, and he uses gossip to do that.   We also have to wonder, okay, so whistleblower number one, this great  patriot, we are told--who he is not. He is a gossipmonger. Where did he  get that information since he didn't get it  [[Page H8713]]  firsthand? He was not allowed to receive information about those  telephone calls the President made to the leader of another country, so  somebody violated the law by telling him. We don't know who that was.  Whoever it was, Vindman or anybody else, there is a good chance they  committed a crime.   That crime and all the surrounding information about their crime  should be admissible in helping impeach and analyze that witness's  testimony. You ought to be able to pursue it, but we are told, when  Republicans were asking Colonel Vindman who he told about this, who did  he transfer information to, they were shut down by the chairman.   That tells you the chairman must know what the answers were, and he  didn't want the Republicans to have them. It sounds to me like there is  a chance he committed a crime, and that was being covered up.  Otherwise, if you want due process, if you want a fair process, if you  want justice, then we have to hear the good, the bad, the ugly, so we  can make a fair determination.   Every person elected as a Member of Congress is going to have a right  to vote on that impeachment, if it ever comes up, and we have a right  to hear the witnesses. Anything else is a sham.   By the way, this Colonel Vindman, it turns out, it has been  published, he went to the stenographers. We had heard previously from  the President there were four stenographers who take down everything.   Well, I have used court reporters my whole adult life, and they miss  a word from time to time. I have had to fix transcripts where they have  missed something. We have that problem here. They are amazing. These  stenographers are absolutely incredible, but they miss a word from time  to time.   But they have four. Apparently, we are told, the reason is that they  don't want to tape it so that no foreign leader has to worry about ever  hearing his own voice say things that he said in a private conversation  with the President of the United States. So they have four  stenographers so that they make sure they get exactly what was said.   And this guy Vindman goes to the stenographers and tells them: I want  to get these words inserted in the transcript, Burisma--the name of the  gas company they are trying to go after President Trump and say he  demanded information on them.   Apparently, none of the stenographers heard that. It sounds like not  only is he a potential criminal for leaking information to people who  weren't supposed to get it, but there is also potential there that this  is part--when you go to prove a conspiracy in Federal court, you have  to prove not only that you plotted but that there was an overt act. His  overt act of going to stenographers and trying to get words embedded  into the transcript that the President didn't say could potentially be  such an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.                                time  1345    There is a lot we don't know here, but this process has the  possibility to bring this Nation's constitutional Republic to the brink  of the end on our watch.   This ought to be a bipartisan thing. You can hate a President; you  can disagree with him; but let's make sure that we have due process so  we don't get drug into a third world status.   We know no country lasts forever, no country ever will. If we are  going to perpetuate this any further, we have got to have some  bipartisan concern for justice, for due process, for making sure that  all of the protections to protect against a Star Chamber-type thing are  not what we use here. Unfortunately, that is what we have been seeing  for nearly 3 years.   One of the things I was taught in law school is what separates us is  that we don't just take somebody and try to find a crime. That is  unconstitutional. You have a crime that you find was committed, and  then you try to find out who probably committed it. When you get  probable cause, you can get them indicted, then you can have a trial.   What we have seen clearly is that, over 3 years ago, some people in  Justice, FBI, Intelligence, maybe Defense, maybe somebody in the White  House, decided: Here is Donald J. Trump. Let's find a crime, whether he  committed it or not, that we can wrap around his throat.   That is what we have been watching happen. They found somebody. Now  let's find a crime that we can allege.   The problem with this one about the quid pro quo, demanding  something, they are going to have to prosecute Vice President Joe  Biden. They are going to have to prosecute some U.S. Senators who have  sent letters that have said: Gee, if you don't do this or that, we are  going to cut off funding to you.   Whoa, Joe Biden bragged about it: I told him that, if you want this  billion dollars, you better fire that prosecutor.   They are going to have to prosecute all of those people before they  go after President Trump, and he didn't do anything nearly like he was  accused of.   There is nothing wrong with a President saying to a foreign leader:  Your country apparently was involved in a conspiracy to affect our  election. Could you help us out by giving us information about what  happened? We just need to know.   There is nothing wrong with it.   And you look at the transcript not amended by somebody who was trying  to set up the President, but by four stenographers who were intent on  having everything in there that was said, and you see there was nothing  wrong with this phone call. What was wrong was the process of trying to  commit a coup d'etat and take out a duly elected President.   It is time we wake up and we do what is right for this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
