 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, my legislation,  which will be on this House floor tomorrow.   Madam Speaker, for years, VAWA has been instrumental in safeguarding  women and children from abuse, anguish, and violence, and has resulted  in the saving of millions of lives.   Madam Speaker, in my own district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, A  Woman's Place has served as a lifesaving resource for over 40 years;  and NOVA, the Network of Victim Assistance, has helped over 3,600  victims--neither of which would be able to do their work without the  help of VAWA and the reauthorization.   Madam Speaker, in August of 2018, 7-year-old Kayden Mancuso of Bucks  County was murdered by her father after being awarded partial,  unsupervised custody, despite a documented history of violence. She was  a beautiful young girl whose life was taken from us.   Kayden's Law is included in this bill and takes steps to improve our  response to the failures of State courts to protect children in custody  proceedings.   Madam Speaker, VAWA is lifesaving legislation, and I implore my  colleagues and all of my friends who we have built relationships with  on both sides of the aisle to join me tomorrow in supporting this  legislation.                            ____________________
