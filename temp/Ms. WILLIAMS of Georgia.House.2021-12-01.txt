 Madam Speaker, Maya Angelou said that when  people show you who they are, believe them the first time. Mississippi  showed us.   The State made its intent clear today before the Supreme Court to  overturn Roe v. Wade, despite 50 years of constitutional precedent that  clearly upholds it. This is about politicians controlling people's  bodies and decisions.   In my 10 years working for Planned Parenthood in the South, I saw  exactly who is hurt the most by harmful abortion bans: Black,  indigenous, and people of color, LGBTQI-plus communities, people  struggling to make ends meet. Without Roe, the threat to abortion is  real and far-reaching. Half of U.S. States are poised to ban abortion  entirely, including my home State of Georgia.   Abortion is essential. We must ensure that everyone, no matter their  ZIP Code has the freedom to make decisions about their health and their  families.   In the House, we did our part by passing the Women's Health  Protection Act. It is time for the Senate to do its job so that we can  rightfully keep abortion safe, legal, and accessible.                            ____________________
