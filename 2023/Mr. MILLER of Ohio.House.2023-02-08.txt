 Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of a great  Ohioan, Maini Wood, who recently passed away at her York Township  homestead.   Maini lived an incredible life. She was born in Finland in 1930 and  survived the Russo-Finnish War of 1939 and 1940.   As a young girl, she actually had to ski to school, wearing white  robes to hide from the Russian bombers that flew overhead.   Maini immigrated to the United States in her early 20s, but she met  her husband, Dee, aboard a ship during a visit to her native Finland.  The couple eventually settled in York Township where they raised their  children in what they described as--and I happen to agree with them--a  beautiful, idyllic rural community.   We learned so much from Maini about survival, about taking chances,  and about finding joy in life's simple pleasures.   Ohio and America are less with her loss.   My thoughts and prayers are with Maini's family as they grieve the  loss of this amazing woman.                            ____________________
