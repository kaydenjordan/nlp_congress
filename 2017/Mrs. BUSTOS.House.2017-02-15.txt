 Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our country, I was relieved  that General Michael Flynn resigned from his post as National Security  Adviser. Not only did he mislead the Vice President and the public on  his secret conversations with the Russian government, he may have also  violated Federal law.   But what is just as concerning is that the Trump administration was  aware of General Flynn's misconduct weeks ago and did nothing about it.  The American people deserve to know what President Trump knew, and when  he knew it.   And let me be clear: General Flynn's resignation is not the end of  the Trump administration's shady ties to Russia. We still don't know  President Trump's financial interests in Russia because he refuses to  release his tax returns.   We still don't know the extent of Russia's disturbing interference in  our election because our calls for an investigation have been  stonewalled.   And we just learned that the Trump campaign was in regular  conversation with Russian intelligence officials.   President Trump's coziness with Vladimir Putin is an urgent matter of  national security.   It is time that the Trump administration truly put America first,  rather than the Kremlin.                            ____________________
