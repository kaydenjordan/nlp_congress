 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today we begin debate on a position in our  government that impacts the daily lives of every single American. If  you use a telephone, connect to the internet, watch television, and pay  a big cable company to do all of those things, then you need to know  who Ajit Pai is.   President Trump nominated Ajit Pai to be the Chairman of the Federal  Communications Commission. While Ajit Pai has devoted many years to  public service, I cannot support his nomination. Under Mr. Pai's short  tenure, he has made the FCC stand for ``forgetting consumers and  competition.''   Let's take a look at who is getting a piece of the FCC pie under  Chairman Pai. It is American consumers on the one hand versus big  corporations on the other hand. Let's take a piece of this pie and  determine who is getting that first slice of what is going on at the  Federal Communications Commission.   Let's look at net neutrality. Net neutrality is the basic principle  that says that all internet traffic is treated equal. Net neutrality  ensures that internet service providers like AT&T, Charter, Verizon,  and Comcast do not block, slow down, censor, or prioritize internet  traffic.   If Ajit Pai gets his way, a handful of big broadband companies will  serve as gatekeepers to the internet. Fewer voices, less choice, no  competition, but more profits for the big broadband companies--that is  Pai's formula. Yet it is today's net neutrality rules that ensure that  those with the best ideas, not merely the best funded ideas, can thrive  in the 21st-century economy. It is net neutrality that has been the  internet's chief governing principle since its inception.   Consider that today essentially every company is an internet  company. In 2016, almost half of the venture capital funds invested in  this country went toward internet-specific and software companies. That  is $25 billion of investment. Half of all venture capital in America  went toward internet-specific and software companies--half of all  venture capital.    To meet America's insatiable demand for broadband internet, the U.S.  broadband and telecommunications industry invested more than $87  billion in capital expenditures in 2015. That is the highest rate of  annual investment in the last 10 years.   So we have hit a sweet spot. Investment in broadband and wireless  technologies is very high. Job creation is very high. Venture capital  investment in online startups is very high. That is why more than 22  million Americans wrote to the Federal Communications Commission to  make their voices heard about net neutrality. They do not want it  repealed. Yet Chairman Pai's proposal would decimate the FCC's open  internet order.   Chairman Pai has said: ``We need to fire up the weed whacker'' to net  neutrality rules. Do we really want a leader at the Federal  Communications Commission who, ultimately, is going to implement the  agenda of the big broadband companies, which want to crush competition,  reduce choice, and then make consumers pay more?   So the first slice of this pie of killing net neutrality goes to the  big corporations, and the losers are the consumers.   Let's go to the next slice of the FCC pie. Let's see where that goes  as these decisions are being made. The next issue is, in fact,  broadband privacy.  [[Page S6200]]    Chairman Pai has actively supported efforts to allow broadband  providers to use, share, and sell your sensitive information without  consumer consent. In 2016, Chairman Pai voted against commonsense  broadband privacy protections that gave consumers meaningful control  over their sensitive information. When he assumed the FCC chairmanship,  Ajit Pai stopped the implementation of data security protections, which  would have ensured that broadband providers better protect the  information they collect about their users. Can you imagine that?  Chairman Pai stopped protections that would improve data security.   I have 143 million reasons as to why that was a bad idea. Just this  month, Equifax was subjected to a cyber attack that compromised the  personally identifiable information of 143 million consumers. The  American public wants more protection, not less. Yet what does Chairman  Pai do? He effectively eliminates the very data security protections  that consumers need to protect their sensitive information. That is  just plain wrong.   Just a few weeks later, Mr. Pai supported congressional Republicans'  efforts to rescind the Federal Communications Commission's broadband  privacy protections. Now your broadband provider can relentlessly  collect and sell your sensitive web browsing history without your  consent.   You may wonder why Chairman Pai would actively support efforts to  undermine the privacy of American consumers. The answer is simple. He  wants that slice of the pie to go to the biggest corporations. How do  they use it? They take that data--your personal data, the information  you put online--and just sell it without your permission in order to  make money for the big corporations. Once again, rather than consumers,  the big corporations get the benefit of that decision at the Federal  Communications Commission.   Let's take a look at the next issue. The next issue goes to the  question of mergers, the mergers of big telecommunications companies.   The Sinclair deal has led to a proposal to merge with Tribune Media,  granting one company an unprecedented market power of over 200  broadcast stations around the country. In order to help Sinclair, Ajit  Pai reinstated what most consider to be an antiquated rule, the UHF  discount, to pave the way for the merger. The UHF discount makes the  FCC count only half of the stations on certain frequencies toward  companies' ownership percentages. This merger would allow Sinclair to  reach into 72 percent of American households, but with the discount,  the FCC counts it as only 45 percent. Putting this discount back on the  books is Chairman Pai's first step to helping Sinclair stay within the  national ownership cap of 39 percent.   What will be the impact of this massive telecommunications mega- merger? Less local news, sports, and weather that millions of Americans  count on today. It will lead to the continued squeezing out of  independent programmers, and it will mean higher prices for consumers.  What signal does approving this merger reveal? It reveals that the FCC  and Ajit Pai have put out the welcome mat for the consolidation of  other communications companies.   So this third slice, once again, goes to corporations and not to  consumers. They are left out in the cold.   Let's look at the fourth slice and see what happens with that at the  Federal Communications Commission under the approval of Ajit Pai's  nomination on the floor of the Senate. The next slice is one that deals  with the education rate, or the E-rate.   The E-rate has proven to be exceptional in linking up schools and  libraries to the internet. We went from a country in 1996 in which only  14 percent of K-12 classrooms had internet access to a near ubiquitous  deployment today. The E-rate has ensured that students from working- class neighborhoods can connect just like students from more affluent  communities. The E-rate democratizes access to the opportunities and  technologies that lead to bright futures. Over $44 billion to date has  been committed nationwide.   Again, Ajit Pai does not take that perspective. At his confirmation  hearing in July, I explicitly asked him whether he would commit to  preserving the success of this bipartisan program and protecting the  funding level or whether he would make programmatic changes that could  undermine or weaken the E-rate. He would not make this commitment to  maintain current funding for E-rate.   Students and library users around the country will not be able to  afford this slice of the pie. Once again, consumers will lose and  corporations will win.   Now we go to the final slice of that communications pie at the FCC.   Telecommunication is the great equalizer, but a household with no  access to basic telecommunications services could lose educational and  employment opportunities as well as emergency services. That is why the  FCC's Lifeline Program is truly a lifeline for millions of Americans  who are able to connect to the world. In Massachusetts alone, more than  180,000 low-income Bay Staters rely on the Lifeline Program to access  voice and internet service.   The value of this universal service has always been a bedrock of our  telecommunications policy. Yet one of Ajit Pai's first actions as FCC  Chairman was to undermine Lifeline and make it more difficult for low- income people to access affordable broadband. I was dismayed by his  decision to abruptly revoke the recognition of nine additional  companies as Lifeline broadband providers just weeks after they were  approved. Mr. Pai's action did nothing but unfairly punish low-income  consumers by limiting choice.   So the final slice, again, goes to the Federal Communications  Commission's supporting corporations and not supporting consumers.   That is the pie--the FCC pie--as it is put together on net  neutrality, on privacy, on mergers, on E-rate, and on Lifeline. It is  all the same. The FCC winds up standing for forgetting consumers and  competition. That is the era that we are now in, and it will only  intensify as each day, week, and month goes by. That is why I am  recommending a ``no'' vote on Ajit Pai as the Chairman of the Federal  Communications Commission.   Which side are we going to be on--that of the consumers or  corporations? Are we going to side with innovators? Are we going to  side with those who are trying to continue to take these platforms of  dynamic change in our society for consumers, for entrepreneurs or are  we going to allow for a closing of this revolution?   This is the era in which we live in the 21st century. This is the  choice that people must make. In which direction are we going?   I urge a ``no'' vote by my colleagues on Ajit Pai's nomination. Of  all of the things that we are going to do this year, this is very near  the top of the list. In many ways, this telecommunications revolution  is the organizing principle of our lives here in the United States and  around the planet, and we have to make sure that we are heading in the  right direction--more openness, more competition, more consumer  protection, more privacy protection, and more access in libraries and  schools to these technologies, not fewer and fewer and fewer and fewer.  It is just the wrong direction to head in. I urge a ``no'' vote.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Massachusetts Walking Tour. Founded in 2010 in Webster, MA, the Walking  Tour recognizes and celebrates local arts and culture throughout  Massachusetts by featuring a nonprofit concert tour across the  Commonwealth. Every concert is unique as it pairs the traveling  musicians with local artists and outdoor recreation enthusiasts and is  free for the whole community. These memorable events include diverse  artistic and musical performances and even discussions about public  land use with outdoor educators and trail managers. Since its founding,  the Walking Tour has visited 90 towns in Massachusetts, playing 101  free community concerts. I thank founders Mark Mandeville and Raianne  Richards, as well as all of the performers, artists, educators, and  nature enthusiasts who have made Walking Tour such a success across  Massachusetts.                            ____________________
