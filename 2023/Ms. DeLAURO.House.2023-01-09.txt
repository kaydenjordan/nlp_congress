 Mr. Speaker, when we conclude this rules debate, I will  offer a motion to commit to add the expanded child tax credit.   In the face of the Republican majority's draconian agenda, we want to  provide a tax cut, yes, to children and families to make ends meet. The  child tax credit is the most effective tool we have in the fight  against rising costs, an antidote to inflation. It is about financial  stability for families.   Nothing in this rules package helps American families. Make no  mistake, a vote against a motion to commit means Republicans are  willing to raise taxes on working families.   The expanded child tax credit was the largest tax cut for working  families in generations, a lifeline to the middle class. It drove the  largest decrease in child poverty in history. People could pay their  electric bills, fill their gas tanks, pay for childcare. It reached  more than 61 million children, lifted 4 million out of poverty, and led  to a 26 percent decline in hunger in families with children. There has  never been a Federal program that has had such a profound impact in  such a short amount of time.    Do the right thing. Vote ``yes'' on the motion to commit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    (During the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
