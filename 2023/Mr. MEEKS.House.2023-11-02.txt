 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this measure.   First, let the record be clear: There is no question that we all  support Israel. The fact of the matter is, Chairman  [[Page H5305]]  McCaul and I worked very hard together to make sure that there was one  voice on the very first vote once the Speaker was selected to say that  we all support Israel, bringing us together.   There are some decisive votes that we take as Members of Congress  that will stick with us, and one of those votes is this one, H.R. 6126.  Congress has a proud bipartisan tradition of acting rapidly to pass  emergency funding for critical national security needs. This  legislation breaks that long and important tradition.   Once we set the precedent of conditioning assistance to partners and  allies in essential fights with poison pills, it is hard to go back. We  can't unring that bell.   We have stood in a bipartisan way to prevent conditioning aid to  Israel. Yet, here we are, considering a bill today that does exactly  that.   Disappointingly, this bill doesn't include the $9.15 billion the  administration had requested to address global humanitarian needs,  including Gaza, undermining our values and the Biden administration's  careful diplomacy and bipartisan support for Israel.   We are a nation that aims to use its powerful good in this world.  That has been our guiding principle drawn from the lessons learned when  we look away. Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to look the other way as  Ukraine faces a vital moment and critical munitions shortfalls. We  can't afford to look the other way as countries in the Indo-Pacific are  looking to the United States for leadership as we engage in strategic  competition with China. Are we prepared to signal to the world that we  are looking away?   Mr. Speaker, let's reject this bill, which trades our long-term  national security for a fleeting political advantage. Let's get back to  work.
