 Mr. Speaker, the right to vote in our Nation is  fundamental to our democracy, and that right to vote continues to come  under assault.   States with a history of denying and blocking the right to vote, like  my home State of Texas, are no longer held in check by the preclearance  requirement of the Voting Rights Act. Worried that changing  demographics erode their political power, Texas leaders continue to  make voting more difficult for Latinos and other communities of color.   For example, since the Shelby case, the Texas secretary of state  attempted to purge nearly 100,000 foreign-born U.S. citizens from voter  rolls; the Texas Legislature restricted mobile voting sites designed to  make voting more convenient; at least 750 polling locations have been  closed, more than any other State; a voter ID law went into effect that  a Federal judge later ruled was enacted to intentionally discriminate  against Black and Latino voters.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is important to protect every  American's right to vote, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
