 Mr. Speaker, we know that oil and water don't mix. Right  now, there is a dirty pipeline called Line 5 running through the most  critical part of the Great Lakes. It is operated by a company called  Enbridge, which has a disturbing history of faulty infrastructure and  environmental destruction.   A Line 5 spill would be devastating for the Great Lakes region and  the entire country. The Great Lakes hold 21 percent of the world's  fresh surface water and are home to precious ecosystems and wildlife.  Tens of millions of people rely on them for water, jobs, and  recreation.   We cannot allow the water we rely on to live, the water that helps  make Michigan such a special place for so many, to be sacrificed for  corporate greed.   The good news is that President Biden could end this threat today by  revoking Line 5's Presidential permit and committing to the truth that  water is life.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon the Biden administration to stand with the  people of the Great Lakes and shut down Line 5 once and for all.                            ____________________
