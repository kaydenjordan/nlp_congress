 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5746) to amend title 51, United States Code, to extend the  authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to enter  into leases of non-excess property of the Administration, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5746         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``NASA Enhanced Use Leasing       Extension Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress find the following:        (1) NASA uses enhanced use leasing to enter into agreements       with private sector entities, State and local governments,       academic institutions, and other Federal agencies for lease       of non-excess, underutilized NASA properties and facilities.        (2) NASA uses enhanced use leasing authority to support       responsible management of its real property, including to       improve the use of underutilized property for activities that       are compatible with NASA's mission and to reduce facility       operating and maintenance costs.        (3) In fiscal year 2019, under its enhanced use lease       authority, NASA leased 65 real properties.        (4) In fiscal year 2019, NASA's use of enhanced use leasing       resulted in the collection of $10,843,025.77 in net revenue.        (5) In fiscal year 2019, NASA used a portion of its       enhanced use leasing revenues for repairs of facility control       systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air       conditioning.        (6) NASA's use of enhanced use leasing authority can       contribute to reducing the rate of increase of the Agency's       overall deferred maintenance cost.  [[Page H7471]]            SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO LEASES OF NON-                    EXCESS PROPERTY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND                     SPACE ADMINISTRATION.         Section 20145(g) of title 51, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``December 31, 2021'' and inserting       ``December 31, 2031''.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5746, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support passage of the bipartisan NASA  Enhanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2021, H.R. 5746.   I want to thank my colleagues, Ranking Member Brian Babin of the  Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Representative Troy Carter, and  Representative Young Kim, for being original cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill that would enable public- and  private-sector entities the opportunity to benefit from NASA property  that is not fully used, while helping NASA manage its vast facilities  and maintenance challenges.   The act would extend NASA'S authority to enter into leases for  underutilized, non-excess real property, including office space,  testing and launch facilities, and hangars, to other Federal, State,  and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private- sector entities.   NASA's existing enhanced use lease authority, or EUL, expires on the  last day of this month, December 31, 2021.   While several short-term extensions have previously been enacted,  this act provides a clean, 10-year extension that will create more  certainty for NASA and the many EUL partners who benefit from the  authority. According to the July 2021 NASA testimony to the  Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, that I chair and Dr. Babin is  the ranking member of, the agency has 70 ongoing leases at six NASA  centers.   The authority also allows NASA to retain lease revenue and apply it  toward maintenance, capital revitalization, and improvement of NASA's  real property assets.   That is important because with the majority of NASA's facilities  dating back to the Apollo era and over 80 percent beyond their design  life, maintenance is an ongoing challenge. NASA currently manages a  deferred maintenance backlog of $2.6 billion. The revenue NASA receives  from enhanced use leases, $10.8 million in fiscal year 2019, can help  avoid further increases to that backlog.   EUL authority also benefits the private entities, the Federal, State,  and local government agencies, and the academic institutions that enter  into lease agreements to use specialized facilities and properties,  such as launch infrastructure, while also providing the valuable  service to NASA of maintaining the properties.   In addition, co-locating other Federal, State, and local government  agencies, private-sector entities, and other institutions on NASA  properties creates a vibrancy and community at NASA centers that  benefits NASA and its workforce, including through partnerships with  those institutions.   Mr. Speaker, NASA's leadership and success in expanding our knowledge  through groundbreaking scientific discoveries and extending human  presence deeper into space inspires our youth, advances our  technological capacity, and strengthens our economy.   Enabling such an inspiring mission requires unique infrastructure and  extensive property and facilities. We need to ensure that NASA has the  tools and flexibilities to continue its successes for decades to come.  Those tools include the ability to manage property that may no longer  be actively or fully used by NASA, at least at this time.   The bipartisan NASA Enhanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2021  ensures the benefits of EUL authority will continue for the next  decade, and in so doing, provides stability to NASA and its EUL  partners.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is good for NASA, good for the  entities that benefit from EUL authority, and good for the taxpayer.   We cannot afford to let this important authority lapse and risk  delays and disruption to the many new leases currently being processed  by NASA.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and support passage of H.R. 5746  so that the Senate can swiftly pass it and send it to the President's  desk for signature and enactment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time to speak  on this bill, and I am prepared to close when necessary.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I concur with my friend Dr. Babin that we are  very fortunate to be led by Eddie Bernice Johnson, our chair, and Frank  Lucas, our ranking member. It is a joy to work on this committee, and  we actually work together in a good way. I would like to thank the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Carter), and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim) for  cosponsoring this and helping put this together, and our wonderful  Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee staff, who actually took the time to  put the title of this bill in iambic pentameter, the NASA Enhanced Use  Leasing Extension Act of 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this good  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
