 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H. Res. 90) demanding that the Government of the People's  Republic of China and the Communist Party of China immediately release  Mark Swidan, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H. Res. 90         Whereas Mark Swidan is being unjustly and arbitrarily       detained by the Government of the People's Republic of China,       according to the United States Government and the United       Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Working Group on       Arbitrary Detention;        Whereas, Mark Swidan is a United States citizen from       Luling, Texas, and is a resident of Houston, Texas;        Whereas, on November 13, 2012, Mark Swidan was abducted by       officers of the Public Security Bureau while on a business       trip to the People's Republic of China, and on December 21,       2012, Swidan was formally arrested following an indictment       issued by the Public Prosecutions Office of the People's       Procuratorate of Jiangmen City alleging that Swidan was part       of a criminal conspiracy with 11 other individuals to       manufacture and traffic drugs;        Whereas, on April 30, 2019, a PRC court sentenced Swidan to       death, which he has appealed;        Whereas PRC security officials repeatedly attempted to       coerce Swidan into signing a confession, but Swidan refused       to sign a confession pleaded not guilty;        Whereas, according to evidence evaluated by the UNHRC       Working Group on Arbitrary Detention--        (1) no drugs were found on Swidan or in his hotel room;        (2) the prosecution did not produce any forensic evidence       of the alleged offenses;        (3) records in Swidan's passport indicate he was not in the       People's Republic of China during the time of the offenses;       and        (4) the 11 other individuals indicted in relation to the       alleged conspiracy could not identify Swidan;        Whereas PRC officials have maliciously and systematically       denied Swidan's mother Katherine Swidan, a resident of Texas,       and other members of his family the ability to contact him;        Whereas the PRC have denied and continue to deny United       States diplomats full consular access to Swidan, in violation       of international norms;        Whereas Swidan's detention has been and continues to be       inhumane, and includes exposure to extreme weather       conditions, sleep deprivation, and physical and psychological       abuse;        Whereas Swidan's health has precipitously deteriorated and       PRC security officials continue to deny independent or       competent medical care and evaluation to Swidan;        Whereas humanitarian organizations of the United States,       including the Dui Hua Foundation, which helped put this case       before the Working Group, and the Global Liberty Alliance,       which has asked the Sister Cities programs to sever       relationships with Jiangmen until Swidan is released, have       sought to highlight the injustice and conditions of Swidan's       detention;        Whereas the UNHRC Working Group on Arbitrary Detention--        (1) found that Swidan is being held in violation of       customary international law;        (2) emphasized the nonconformity by the PRC with       international norms, including the Universal Declaration of       Human Rights; and        (3) stressed that ``the appropriate remedy would be to       release Swidan immediately and accord him an enforceable       right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance       with international law'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) demands that the Government of the People's Republic of       China and the Chinese Communist Party immediately release       Mark Swidan;        (2) condemns the Government of the People's Republic of       China and the Chinese Communist Party for refusing to provide       Swidan with--        (A) regular communication with his family;        (B) access to United States diplomats; and        (C) independent and competent medical care and evaluation;       and        (3) calls on the United States Government to deepen and       prioritize efforts to secure the release of Swidan, including       by--        (A) urging PRC counterparts at every level of engagement to       release Swidan; and        (B) using the voice and vote of United States diplomats in       international forums to highlight Swidan's case.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Mark Swidan is an American, a Texan, and has been a  hostage of the Chinese Communist Party for more than a decade. We stand  together to demand his release and an end to his torture by CCP  officials.   In 2012, Mark was wrongfully detained in China for a crime he clearly  did not commit. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has found  that it was impossible for him to have committed any of the crimes he  is charged with. In fact, Mr. Speaker, he was not even in China at the  time the CCP says that these false crimes were committed.   Since his abduction in 2012, Mark has been grossly abused in Chinese  custody. He has been held for more than a decade in temporary detention  facilities intended for brief custody. He remains caged in a small,  crowded cell that is freezing in the winter and sweltering in the  summer. The toilet is a hole in the ground; the lights are never turned  off; and he has no regular access to sunlight, a bed, or hot water.   Chinese officials have denied him proper medical care. Guards have  broken his hands several times, and he has suffered a dislocated knee.  Mark has lost almost 100 pounds. He suffers from tooth and gum disease,  and his mouth bleeds every day. Mark has only been allowed to speak  with his family a handful of times. His ordeal has taken a terrible  toll on his physical and mental health.   Just last week, the People's Republic of China denied Mark's appeal  and upheld the death penalty with a 2-year suspended death sentence.  Threatening an American citizen with death for a crime that he could  not have possibly committed is a brazen human rights violation and a  disgusting example of CCP's hostage diplomacy.   Protecting Americans abroad is a priority mission of the State  Department, yet State has failed to secure Mark's release or hold the  CCP accountable for its gross violation of his basic human rights.  Instead, the Biden administration continues to prioritize engagement  with the PRC over all else, even the safety of American citizens.   This bipartisan resolution before us today unanimously passed the  Foreign Affairs Committee in February. It condemns the CCP for their  violation of international law and demands the immediate release of Mr.  Swidan. Furthermore, it urges the Biden administration to hold the CCP  accountable for its blatant violation of human rights and international  law.   I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud), my good friend, for  introducing this resolution which deserves our unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, if we are seen as a weak nation, we will be treated as  such. Appeasement only invites aggression. The U.S. must not tolerate  these brazen acts of hostage diplomacy. I wish that Mark Swidan could  somehow hear us in this Chamber today to know that he is not forgotten.  However, I know that his tireless advocate, his mother, Katherine, is  listening; and I know that his CCP captors and abusers are listening,  too.   Our unified bipartisan message to them is simple: Free Mark Swidan  now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H. Res. 311) encouraging the expansion and strengthening of the  Abraham Accords to urge other nations to normalize relations with  Israel and ensure that existing agreements reap tangible security and  economic benefits for the citizens of those countries and all peoples  in the region.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                H. Res. 311         Whereas May 14, 2023, marks the 75th anniversary of the       establishment of the State of Israel;        Whereas, on May 14, 1948, the United States officially       recognized Israel as a State;        Whereas Israel has been designated by the United States       Government as a major non-NATO ally;        Whereas, in 2014, Congress designated Israel as a ``major       strategic partner'';        Whereas the United States and Israel have a close and       robust bilateral relationship marked by strong people-to-      people ties and close cooperation on a wide range of issues       including defense, diplomacy, energy, cybersecurity,       agriculture, science, and space;        Whereas the United States and Israel have signed three 10-      year memoranda of understanding, in which the United States       committed to provide $26,700,000,000 between fiscal year 1999       and fiscal year 2008, $30,000,000,000 between fiscal year       2009 and fiscal year 2018, and $38,000,000,000 between fiscal       year 2019 and fiscal year 2028;        Whereas Congress has appropriated amounts in accordance       with such memoranda of understanding, reflecting the two       countries' shared priorities in the region;        Whereas, in late 2020 and early 2021, Israel reached       agreements, known collectively as the Abraham Accords, to       improve or normalize its relations with the United Arab       Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan; and        Whereas these agreements build upon the decades-long       leadership of the United States and other governments in       supporting efforts to broker peace treaties between Israel       and Egypt and Israel and Jordan: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) encourages the United States and Israel to continue to       deepen and expand bilateral cooperation across the full       spectrum of economic, security, and civilian issues;        (2) encourages the expansion and strengthening of the       Abraham Accords to urge other nations to normalize relations       with Israel and ensure that existing agreements reap tangible       security and economic benefits for the citizens of those       countries and all peoples in the region;        (3) expresses continued support for security assistance to       Israel as outlined in the United States-Israel Memorandum of       Understanding to ensure that Israel can defend itself by       itself; and        (4) supports Israel's robust involvement as an active       member of the community of nations to benefit Israel and the       United States as partners who share common values and a       commitment to democracy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this week we are marking an incredible milestone, 75  years since the establishment of the State of Israel.   Since the day Israel was founded, it faced numerous existential  threats, and yet today, Israel is a thriving democracy with a robust  economy and one of the world's most capable militaries. Most  importantly, the United States and Israel have stood shoulder to  shoulder together since day one.   Over seven-and-a-half decades, we have worked as friends and  partners, and we will continue to work together to overcome shared  challenges and reach new triumphs.   The United States has long supported Israel's right and ability to  defend herself against threats. Our long-term commitment to Israel's  security includes the $3.3 billion per year in foreign military  financing assistance and support for defense technology development.  One of the great successes of this support is the Iron Dome air defense  system.                                time  1645    In May of 2021 when Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched more  than 4,000 rockets toward Israel, it was the Iron Dome that shot those  weapons out of the sky, greatly limiting the number of casualties in  this terrifying conflict.   After this escalation, Congress voted overwhelmingly to resupply the  Iron Dome to help Israel keep its citizens safe.   The United States will always stand with Israel in its fight against  terrorism. Our close partner is also vital to combating the global  threat posed by Iran's nuclear program, ballistic missile arsenal,  armed UAV attacks, as well as Iran's support for international  terrorism, hostage-taking, and human rights abuses.   Simply put, a nuclear Iran is unacceptable, both for the United  States, our ally Israel, and for the world.   We are also in full agreement that the IRGC is a foreign terrorist  organization, and this designation should remain in place.   We are seeing Iran's malign influence spread well beyond the Middle  East. Iran is orchestrating terror plots against Americans on U.S.  soil.   Iran continues to supply Russia with lethal drones and other forms of  support for its war of aggression in Ukraine.   Moreover, Iran is deepening its cooperation with Communist China who  continues to threaten the global balance of power through their malign  activities around the globe and hostility toward Taiwan.   Responding to Iran's global threat and its unholy alliance with  Russia and China will be a generational challenge, but the United  States and Israel are prepared to respond.   It is clear that others have taken note of how much the United States  and Israel accomplish when we work together.   That is why in 2020, President Trump and his team succeeded in  brokering the first normalization agreements between Israel and its  neighbors in over 25 years.   The Abraham Accords are transformational for the Middle East. I was  proud to be at the White House for the signing ceremony of these  historic agreements. Now the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco join Egypt and  Jordan in having full diplomatic relations with Israel.   The accords open the door to important cooperation, including to  address the shared threat posed by Iran that is making the Middle East  and North Africa safer and more prosperous.   These countries are working together on free trade, energy, water,  and, of course, defense cooperation, like the Middle East Air Defense  Alliance, now that Israel is a part of Central Command.   This is a generational shift in the Middle East and one that promotes  peace and prosperity in the region. That is why we need to invest in  the positive progress of growing and deepening the Abraham Accords as  this resolution outlines.   We need to put our diplomatic might into trying to achieve the kinds  of big breakthroughs that created the Abraham Accords almost 3 years  ago.   I was pleased to see Oman and Saudi Arabia begin allowing overflights  of  [[Page H1930]]  Israeli planes. It is a huge step forward, but we need to keep thinking  bigger until we get to the game changer that would be full diplomatic  relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.   On behalf of the American people, I congratulate our Israeli friends  on everything they have accomplished in their first 75 years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the author of  this resolution, who made it just in the nick of time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank Ms. Manning, Mr. Schneider, and Mrs. Wagner for leading on  this important resolution. On a personal note, I have to thank my own  father who fought in World War II and was a bombardier on a B-17 who  bombed the Nazis. He participated in 32 bombing missions, including  Operation Overlord.   My father's generation liberated Europe from the threats and the  horrors of the Nazis and fascism. They liberated the Jewish people from  the horrors surrounding the Holocaust, which is unimaginable. That  generation brought the State of Israel into existence, and that is our  pact with Israel.   Since 1948, Israel has been our best friend and our strongest ally in  the Middle East. Israel has also been a true beacon of hope and  democracy in the Middle East.   I look forward to a day, as I know they envisioned at the time of its  creation in 1948, that even though these forces still exist today of  anti-Semitism in Iran and other nations, that one day we will achieve  true peace in the Middle East. I look forward to the day that Israel  can coexist peacefully with its surrounding neighbors in the region and  with the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
