 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the chairman from Bowling Green, Ohio, home  of the Harvard of the Midwest, Bowling Green State University, and  Ranking Member Schakowsky for including the language, as she said, for  the HOT CARS Act.   We lose about 37 children a year who accidentally get left in the  backseat of a car when a parent or grandparent accidentally forgets  that they are there, they change their routine, and 37 kids a year pass  away. It is one of the most tragic circumstances we have to deal with  in this country. Ms. Schakowsky and I, along with Peter King from New  York, have championed this bill. I just want to say thank you for  including it in here.   These cars get hot fast, up to 125 degrees. This allows the companies  now to put sensors in there. When we leave our keys in the car or when  we leave our lights on, we get a ding or a bell. Now we will know if  someone is in the backseat. There will be an alert that the car  companies will put into the cars to allow us to recognize and prevent  37 deaths a year.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for working in a bipartisan way,  and thank Ranking Member Schakowsky for her leadership. She has been  championing this a long time, and I appreciate it.
