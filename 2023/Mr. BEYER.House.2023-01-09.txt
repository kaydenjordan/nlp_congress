 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this absurd  legislation. The bill before us will cut the necessary investments to  make the IRS more responsive to regular people, improve customer  service, and work through the IRS backlog.   In exchange for making the IRS less responsive to the people, the  bill is going to add $114 billion to the deficit, according to the CBO.   Why?   My Republican friends want us to believe that a horde of 87,000 armed  Federal agents are ready to kick in your doors for tax enforcement.   This is total nonsense, a fantasy, a fabrication that has been fact- checked over and over again and always found false.   The real reason they are passing this bill is to protect wealthy tax  cheats like the former President from having their tax returns  scrutinized.   The richest 1 percent avoid paying $100 billion every year because we  don't fund the IRS.   Republicans' first priority is to help the very rich tax evaders at  the expense of their own regular American constituents.   I urge Members to vote against this misguided legislation.
