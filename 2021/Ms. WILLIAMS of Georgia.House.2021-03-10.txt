 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021. This common-sense  legislation would save lives in every state, every congressional  district, and every community, by preventing guns from being sold to  people who are dangers to themselves or others.   If this is truly ``The People's House'' then we MUST pass H.R. 8 for  the safety and protection of all people. Enough is enough. Too many  times innocent lives have been lost to guns in the hands of people  wishing to do harm. That's why 93 percent of Americans support  requiring universal background checks on all gun sales. The people  know: background checks work.   By preventing guns from falling into the hands of people with mental  illness or criminal history. Last year was a particularly tragic year  for the Fifth District, with 177 lives ended at the barrel of a gun. My  heart breaks knowing there have already been 25 gun-related deaths in  my District this year. As I speak today, I am remembering Kennedy  Maxie. A sweet, seven-year-old Black girl shot and killed in Atlanta  while Christmas shopping with her family last December. She was an  innocent victim, killed by someone who had no business with a gun.   The tragedies are too many, and the gun violence too frequent. It's  past time we did something.
