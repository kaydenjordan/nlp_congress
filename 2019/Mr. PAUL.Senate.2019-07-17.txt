 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it has long  been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in this  country. We have a $22 trillion debt. We are adding debt at about $1  trillion a year. Therefore, any new spending that we are approaching,  any new program that is going to have the longevity of 70 or 80 years  should be offset by cutting spending that is less valuable. At the very  least, we need to have this debate.   I will be offering up an amendment if this bill should come to the  floor, but until then, I will object.
