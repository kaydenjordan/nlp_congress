 Mr. Speaker, choosing whether to become a parent is  one of the most important decisions a person will make in their  lifetime. It is a decision we should be able to make for ourselves. But  over the past decade, extremist anti-abortion politicians have passed  more than 450 laws that undermine the freedom to make that decision.   Our laws should protect our rights, like the right to abortion, not  control and dehumanize us. We aren't truly free unless we can control  our own bodies, lives, and future.   As a nurse, I know that when people have access to a full range of  healthcare services, including the full spectrum of reproductive health  and maternity care, they are healthier and their families thrive.   Because abortion is healthcare.   The legislation that House Democrats passed today will protect access  to healthcare and reproductive rights for all Americans. It ensures  that, going forward, we all have the freedom to control our own bodies,  safely care for our families, and live with dignity.   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take it up immediately and send  it to President Biden's desk.                            ____________________
