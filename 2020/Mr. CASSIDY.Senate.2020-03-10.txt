 Madam President, today, I would like to recognize  Capt. Joseph Victor Sheldon III, command chaplain, 4th Marine Division,  for his 32 years of service in the U.S. Navy as he approaches his  retirement ceremony. Captain Sheldon will be dearly missed by those who  served with him, and our country thanks him for his dedicated service.   Captain Sheldon served in a unique and critically important role as a  chaplain in the U.S. Navy. His recognition of the importance of this  role allowed him to effectively serve the soldiers he served with, as  well as their families and civilian military workers. Military  chaplains are also charged with forging relationships with their  counterparts around the world when they serve abroad. Captain Sheldon  took this responsibility in stride and provided a blueprint on how  military chaplains should build relationships with their religious  counterparts.   His service included time in the Middle East following 9/11, Germany,  the Pentagon, as well as serving as the Director of Religious Affairs  of the Combined Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa, CJTF-HOA.  Louisiana and the entire Nation are grateful for Captain Sheldon's life  of service to our great country.                            ____________________
