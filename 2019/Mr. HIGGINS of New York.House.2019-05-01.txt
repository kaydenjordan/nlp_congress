 Mr. Speaker, a $50 million Federal  investment to create a parkway opened access to Buffalo's outer harbor  waterfront 10 years ago. That parkway was the catalyst for new  development that started with Gallagher Beach; a new State park,  Wilkeson Pointe; and new parkland on the former NFTA property from  terminal A and B to the Seaway Pier and beyond.   This Thursday, the Canal Corporation will announce more than $100  million in new investments to open up 180 acres and improve access to  the outer harbor lakefront of Buffalo. More Buffalo waterfront  development is coming, development to move Buffalo forward with a new,  exciting waterfront of possibilities.                            ____________________
