 Madam Speaker, this week we are considering critical  legislation to invest in America and Minnesotans. We are investing in  childcare, education, healthcare, housing, and so many other basics  that my district so desperately needs.   In the Fifth District alone, we secured over $46 million in  transportation and community project funding. That includes the skills  training for clean energy careers, funding for updated sprinkler  systems, a new healthcare clinic on Lake Street, a new park in Brooklyn  Center, and so much more.   How we choose to invest our resources is a reflection of our  priorities, and we, as House Democrats, are making our priorities  clear: American jobs, opportunity, and working families.                            ____________________
