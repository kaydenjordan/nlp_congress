 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York for  her leadership. I also thank Mr. Frelinghuysen for his leadership, and  I wish him well in the next chapter of his career.   While this combination of a CR and a minibus is a half-measure by  definition, I certainly urge its adoption in  [[Page H9046]]  order to avert what would be the third government shutdown just this  year. As a representative of northern Virginia, I do not share the  President's idea that there is ever such a thing as a good government  shutdown.   I look forward to working with the committee to complete the rest of  the appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 in order to address  pressing issues, especially providing our hardworking Federal employees  with a raise.   Again, I thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member Visclosky for  including in the defense appropriations bill an authorization for the  Secretary of Defense in the event of a government shutdown to make  military death gratuity payments to families of fallen servicemembers.  I have made this a cause of mine for a number of Congresses now. I am  so glad this is finally going to be enshrined in law, and I thank the  Appropriations Subcommittee and full committee for their cooperation in  including this provision.   I commend the committee for including this overdue provision, and I  know the families of the fallen appreciate it. It was shameful that  Congress would ever allow the government to shut down and allow  grieving military families who made the ultimate sacrifice to go  without this small, but very important, measure of the country's  gratitude and recognition of their loved one's ultimate sacrifice.    Again, I thank the leadership of the committee, the subcommittee, and  their staffs for providing this bipartisan bill. I certainly urge its  passage and look forward to supporting it.
