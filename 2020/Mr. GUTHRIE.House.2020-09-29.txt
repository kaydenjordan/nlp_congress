 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8128, the  AI for Consumer Product Safety Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by my  colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representatives  McNerney and Burgess.   Emerging technologies can be a useful tool to help prevent fraud and  to protect consumers. This bipartisan package of bills will help us  learn more about AI technology to better protect Americans.   I want to thank Representatives McNerney and Burgess for including my  legislation, the Blockchain Innovation Act, which I introduced with  Representative Soto and Representative Matsui.   This legislation will help us harness blockchain technology for the  betterment of our consumers and our economy.   I urge my colleagues to support the AI for Consumer Product Safety  Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8132, the  American COMPETE Act.   This bipartisan package includes two of my bills, the Advancing  Blockchain Act, which would continue our important work in blockchain,  and the Countering Online Harms Act, to protect Americans from  misinformation and dangerous content.   Along with my legislation, the COMPETE Act includes several  bipartisan bills from my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues, all  aimed at maintaining American dominance in emerging technology. The  United States has always been a leader in technology, and we need to  keep it that way.   I thank Representative McMorris Rodgers and Representative Rush for  their leadership on this important issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  package.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding.   I am here tonight to honor Mr. Shimkus. I call him Mr. Shimkus  because that is how a junior West Point cadet refers to a senior West  Point cadet.   One of the most insulting things I get here in Washington, people ask  me often: ``Were you at West Point with   John Shimkus?''   I always say: ``Do I look like I could have been at West Point when    John Shimkus was there?''                                time  2130    We are not that far apart, the Class of '80 and the Class '87. But he  is passionate about his country.   I serve on the NATO committee with him. I am going to tell one quick  story. It is really more about passion for his family.   One year, we were visiting our allies. We were visiting in Holland,  and John went on a mission to find some kind of horn. I forget the name  of the horn, but it is a Dutch horn. He went to a village. He went to  somebody's home. This thing wasn't easy to find, but he said: I have to  find it because my wife wants it. My wife always wants a unique musical  instrument from some country that I visit.   It wasn't like, ``I have to get this for my wife.'' He was passionate  about getting it. This thing was as big as half of this table, and he  had to carry it back.   When he started telling people why he was doing it, you could just  see the passion in his face. He goes: My wife--who is here with us  tonight--my wife, she teaches music, and when she teaches this kind of  music, this history, she gets these instruments out that I collect. She  goes through them, and she teaches the history of the country where  this music is from.   So it is combined. You could see John's passion for history, his  wife's passion for music, and his passion for his family.   Then, finally, he may not remember this, but I was standing with him  one of the preopening nights of the Bible Museum, and I remember being  with him when he saw Martin Luther's Bible that is there. He just  looked at it. I could see him just speechless because of, the great  Lutheran that he is, his love of the Word of God and the love of his  God.   It shows a common theme tonight. John is passionate about his  country, through West Point and his service to the Army and the NATO  committee, and passionate about his family.   It is just unmistakable. It is just there. It is in his face. His  face shows everything he is thinking. When he talks about his wife, you  can certainly see it.   When I was standing there with him, he was passionate about his God.  Duty, honor, country is learned at West Point, but country, family, and  God, that is so important.   Thank you, John, for your service. We are going to miss you.
