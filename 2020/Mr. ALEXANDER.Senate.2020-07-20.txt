 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, our great country has developed a  dangerous habit when it comes to pandemics. Public health experts call  it panic, neglect, panic.   In 2007, after the emergence of the Asian flu, former Utah Governor  Mike Leavitt, who was then the Secretary of Health and Human Services,  put it this way:         Everything we do before a pandemic seems alarmist.       Everything we do after a pandemic will seem inadequate. This       is the dilemma we face, but it should not stop us from doing       what we can to prepare.    That was Governor Mike Leavitt.   Fifteen years ago, then-majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Dr. Bill  Frist, told me and told our committee--he made 20 speeches predicting  this--that a viral pandemic was no longer a question of if but a  question of  [[Page S4268]]  when. Now, this is in the 2005-2006 era, 15 years ago.   He recommended then, Dr. Frist did, what he called a six-point public  health prescription to minimize the blow: communication, surveillance,  antivirals, vaccines, research, stockpile/surge capacity.   Four Presidents of the United States and several Congresses have done  some of what needed to be done to prepare for pandemics but not enough  of it. There is substantial agreement on all sides about what to do.  There is even more agreement that, if we wait until this pandemic is  over to do it, we will fall into the familiar cycle of panic, neglect,  panic.   So the obvious thing for this Congress to do now, this month, while  we are in the middle of a pandemic, while we have our eye on the ball,  before we lose our focus, while we are spending $4 trillion or more  mostly to repair the damage caused by this pandemic, is that we should  authorize and spend the few billions that it takes to be prepared for  the next pandemic.   That is why I am introducing today the Preparing for the Next  Pandemic Act, and that would take three of the most obvious steps about  which there is near universal agreement: One, make certain that we have  and maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity within the United States  to produce tests, treatments, and vaccines so that we don't have to  rely on manufacturing plants in China and India or any foreign country.   Now, how difficult is that to decide? Do we really want our vaccines  made in China or India or any other foreign country? So shouldn't we do  something now to make sure that--for the next pandemic as well as this  one--we produce them here?   Two, make sure that Federal and State stockpiles have sufficient  protective equipment--masks, gowns--ventilators, and other absolutely  essential supplies so that we don't run out during this pandemic or the  next one. Now, how controversial could that be? Do we really want to  run out of masks and protective equipment in the next pandemic or in  what remains of this one?   Three, create more authority for the Federal Government to work with  private companies to maintain more supplies and manufacturing capacity  for products that are needed during a public health emergency.   We have the strongest, best, most creative private sector in the  world. Why would we not want our government working with it as much as  it possibly could to save our lives during this pandemic and the next  pandemic?   The act also does the one thing that all of the experts with whom we  have talked say is essential: Make sure there is a steady stream of  money for the next 10 years so there is no lapse in preparedness. I  would propose that we do this with 10 years of advance appropriations;  in other words, that we appropriate this year $15 billion and spend it  over 10 years--that is $1.5 billion a year--so Congress will be able to  continue its oversight and make certain that our manufacturing plants  onshore are kept up to date and that State stockpiles in Alaska,  Tennessee, and every State and the Federal stockpile are not depleted  during tough budget times, which we know will surely come, just as  surely as we know the next pandemic will come.   On June 9, I released a white paper on steps I thought Congress  should take before the end of the year in order to get ready for the  next pandemic. I am not a medical expert. So the main purpose of my  white paper, as chair of the Senate's Health Committee, was to elicit  recommendations to Congress from the experts that we could consider and  act on this year. We asked the experts to get their ideas in by June  26.   I asked for recommendations in five areas:   No. 1, tests, treatments, and vaccines; how do we accelerate research  and development?   No. 2, disease surveillance; expand our ability to detect, identify,  model, and track emerging infectious diseases.   No. 3, stockpiles, distribution, and surges; rebuild and maintain the  Federal and State stockpiles and improve the medical supply surge  capacity and distribution; in other words, make sure we have masks and  gowns and ventilators so the hospitals are ready if something happens.   No. 4, public health capabilities; improve State and local capacity  to respond. Most of our public health is taken care of not here but by  our State and local public health departments.   Finally, who is on the flagpole? That is improving coordination of  Federal agencies during a public health emergency.   Our committee, the Senate's Health Committee, received 350 responses  from leading public health experts around the country. They had many  recommendations for short-term and long-term proposals to address  future pandemics. As my staff and I reviewed these proposals and other  feedback, I asked us to focus on targeted ideas that would generate  broad bipartisan consensus and help address some of the most pressing  issues that we are facing today.   That led us to three strategic areas: One, sustaining onshore  manufacturing--22 responses mentioned that. Two, creating and  sustaining the State stockpiles--23 mentioned that. Improving the  Federal stockpile--24 mentioned that.   These are recommendations from public health experts and bipartisan  leaders who have convened the experts. Some of those from whom we heard  included Dr. Frist; Governor Ridge, who is cochair of the Bipartisan  Commission on Biodefense; former Senator Joe Lieberman, cochair of that  same commission; Dr. Julie Gerberding, former Director for the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention; Andy Slavitt, who during the Obama  administration was the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services. They all said basically the same thing when it  came to these three priorities.   So I introduced today the Preparing for the Next Pandemic Act in  three parts: One, onshore manufacturing, which provides new, sustained  funding--$5 billion over 10 years, half a billion a year--to maintain  sufficient onshore manufacturing for tests, treatments, and vaccines so  that, when a new virus emerges, we have a facility in this country  ready to manufacture these products as quickly as possible.   Two, State stockpiles, which provides new, sustained funding--$10  billion over 10 years; that is $1 billion a year--so States can create  and maintain their own stockpiles of supplies, like masks and  ventilators, with help from the Federal Government.   Now, this would be done with some restrictions because what really  happened before was that a lot of the States and some of the hospitals,  because they had budget shortages, said: Well, we can deplete our  stockpiles and save some money. So they saved some money, but when the  next pandemic arrived, we weren't ready, the stockpile wasn't full, and  people suffered because of that.   Finally, Federal stockpiles. This legislation improves the Federal  Strategic National Stockpile by allowing the Federal Government to work  with private companies to maintain additional supplies and  manufacturing capacity so we are even better prepared for the next  pandemic.   Now, there is more to do to be ready for any future pandemic, but  these are three steps that we ought to do right now, this month, as  part of whatever COVID-19 phase 4 legislation we can agree upon.   In our Senate Health Committee hearing on June 23, this is what  former Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist had to say about the need  for sustained funding to better prepare for the next pandemic:   We do have to keep a revenue stream out there, Dr. Frist said, that  is dependable, that is sustainable, that is long-term, and that is  flexible. What we are really dealing with is a rare but certain event,  said Dr. Frist, and the rarity is hard for Congress to deal with  because of the attention span of Congress, and that is where it is  important to have timelines that are 10 or 15 years out.   Markets tend to look day to day, said Dr. Frist. Therefore, this  means we are going to have to have some sort of public funding that  would guarantee a market over that 10-year or 15-year period when that  certain event, that certain pandemic, will occur.   Now, there is precedent for what I am proposing today. In 2003,  Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire--in fact, he  [[Page S4269]]  used to stand at this desk and make excited and well informed speeches,  and I used to sit right there and listen to him, and he was one of our  best U.S. Senators--was chairman of the same Health Committee that I am  chairman of today. He then recognized, in 2003, the need for a clear,  long-term commitment from the Federal Government to prepare for public  health emergencies like COVID-19.   That year, Congress passed what we called Project Bioshield with the  leadership of Senator Gregg, Congressman Hal Rogers, Senator Cochran of  Mississippi, and others. The legislation provided $5 billion in advance  appropriations to be used over the next 10 years to buy treatments and  vaccines for threats like anthrax and smallpox.   Reflecting on that experience in an editorial earlier this year,  Senator Gregg wrote: ``In this instance, Congress actually anticipated  a serious issue and began addressing it effectively.''   ``Congress actually anticipated a serious issue and began addressing  it effectively.'' Well, why doesn't Congress do that again? If it  worked before, why don't we do it again? Why don't we make sure that  the next time we have a pandemic, our manufacturing plants aren't in  China or India? We can do that with a very modest amount of money,  compared to the trillions of dollars that we are talking about for  other things.   At our June 23 hearing, speaking about Federal efforts to build  manufacturing capacity to respond to a pandemic flu, Governor Leavitt  said: ``What I think we did not do adequately as a country, over the  course of time, is maintain those manufacturing plants in a way that  they were warm and could be stood up quickly.''   In other words, we have had this idea before. We supported building  new manufacturing plants, but we lost interest in it--panic, neglect,  panic. And they weren't warm, said Governor Leavitt, when the time came  that we needed them.   Regarding stockpiles, Dr. Frist said, we need ``not the incremental  improvement of stockpiles and means of distribution, but the creation  of great and secure stores and networks, with every needed building,  laboratory, airplane, truck, and vaccination station, no excuses, no  exceptions, everywhere, and for everyone.'' That is what Dr. Frist said  at our hearing. And he said it 15 years ago.   Former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  Dr. Judy Gerberding, said at our hearing:         In the face of an unprecedented public health crisis like       the coronavirus, we have seen the Strategic National       Stockpile deliver some promising innovations but at the same       time discovered areas where there is room for improvement. .       . . The COVID-19 pandemic provides us an opportunity to make       pragmatic changes; we must act now to avoid becoming       complacent and finding ourselves in the same position when       the next pandemic occurs.    Panic, neglect, panic.   There is also broad agreement about some additional steps Congress  needs to take to prepare for the next pandemic, including disease  surveillance, restoring support for our State and local public health  systems--Governor Leavitt said they have been seriously underfunded for  the last 30 or 40 years--and better coordination of pandemic response.   I don't propose to deal with those three things today, but I do  intend to keep legislation to better prepare for future pandemics on  the top of the congressional to-do list until it is done.   In this internet age, attention spans are short. Even with an event  as significant as COVID-19, memories fade, and attention moves on  quickly to the next crisis. That makes it imperative that Congress act  on needed changes this year in order to better prepare for next  pandemic, which might be in 20 years or might be next year or next  month. The only thing we know for certain is that it will come.   Let us not succumb to the familiar, dangerous habit of panic,  neglect, panic. At least Congress can take these three steps to keep  vaccine manufacturing on our shores and stockpiles supplied now while  the pandemic has our attention, while we have our eye on the ball.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a copy of the summary of responses the Health Committee received in  response to the white paper that I released on June 9   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Summary of Responses to ``Preparing for the Next Pandemic'' White Paper                        (By Senator Lamar Alexander)         On June 9, Chairman Alexander released ``Preparing for the       Next Pandemic,'' a white paper with five recommendations to       address future pandemics based on lessons learned from COVID-      19 and the past 20 years of public health preparedness. The       main purpose of the white paper was to elicit recommendations       and feedback from experts who have studied public health       preparedness that Congress could consider and act on this       year. The Committee received over 350 responses to specific       questions posed by the white paper and more broadly on the       topic of public health and medical preparedness and response.   1. Tests, Treatments, and Vaccines--Accelerate Research and Development         Among those responses focused on accelerating research and       development of tests, treatments, and vaccines, respondents       recommended leveraging public-private partnerships and       tapping into strategic computing reserves, expanding the       capacities of the Biomedical Advanced Research and       Development Authority (BARDA), and sustaining on-shore       manufacturing for high-priority countermeasures, like       vaccines and treatments, and other aspects of pharmaceutical       manufacturing, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients and       fill-finish capacity for bulk drug substances. While the       federal government currently has robust programs in these       areas, commenters recommended that these programs be       bolstered further, better integrated with one another, and       improve coordination of priorities across programs,       particularly between BARDA and the National Institutes of       Health.   2. Disease Surveillance--Expand Ability to Detect, Identify, Model and                     Track Emerging Infectious Diseases         The need for improved emerging infectious disease       surveillance was addressed by several commenters. Many       stakeholders suggested improving the public health       information systems by modernizing current public health data       reporting systems and better integrating such systems.       Commenters specifically mentioned the public health data       systems modernization provisions included in the Lower Health       Care Costs Act as a solution to this problem. In addition,       many responses included suggestions for how to improve       contact tracing capabilities within states. Some experts       mentioned investing in improved disease surveillance and       leveraging technology or private-public partnerships in order       to better detect, identify, and model emerging infectious       diseases.   3. Stockpiles Distribution and Surges--Rebuild and Maintain Federal and      State Stockpiles and Improve Medical Supply Surge Capacity and                                Distribution         Many commenters discussed the need for improved stockpiling       and distribution of medical supplies. General themes covered       by commenters on this subject include improved situational       awareness and streamlined distribution of medical supplies       and countermeasures, such as testing supplies, personal       protective equipment, and an eventual COVID-19 vaccine;       better oversight of the contents of stockpiles; and improved       coordination between federal, state, and local governments.       Some commenters discussed their preference for an enhanced       federal role in stockpiling and distributing supplies.       However, other commenters agreed that increasing stockpiles       at the state and local level and in health care facilities       would provide more efficient access to supplies during a       public health emergency. Commenters who agreed with the       concept of state stockpiles highlighted the need for strong       coordination between the federal government and the states on       stockpile inventories and deployments so that supplies are       used as efficiently as possible. Additionally, some       commenters pointed out that certain products, like       specialized countermeasures for threats like anthrax and       smallpox, would not be appropriate to stockpile at the state       level. Rather, they said that state stockpiles should focus       on products like personal protective equipment and broad-      spectrum antibiotics, which are typically available through       commercial distributors and are useful across responses.     4. Public Health Capabilities--Improve State and Local Capacity to                                  Respond         Many experts and stakeholders addressed the importance of       improving public health infrastructure, and recommended       additional funding to enhance state and local response       capabilities. Specifically, some experts suggested bolstering       testing infrastructure, and investing in greater state       laboratory and biosafety laboratory capacity. They also       highlighted the need for an improved public health workforce       by implementing additional preparedness training for health       care providers and public health workers. Lastly, commenters       suggested making permanent several temporary flexibilities       provided during the COVID-19 public health emergency that       have expanded access to telehealth services, as well as       improving interoperability for electronic health records.  [[Page S4270]]        5. Who is on Flagpole?--Improve Coordination of Federal Agencies During                         a Public Health Emergency         Many commenters also addressed the lack of consistent       coordination between the federal government, states, and the       private sector and uncertainty over federal leadership during       a pandemic. Generally, commenters agreed that the Office of       the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR)       at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is the       right entity to coordinate the day-to-day operational       response to a public health emergency. However, multiple       commenters noted that ASPR does not have sufficient authority       to direct the activities of other departments and agencies,       which is necessary during a whole-of-government response.       Additionally, these commenters noted that White House       involvement, both during a response and when there is no       public health emergency in effect, is necessary to ensuring       coordination among departments and agencies and that public       health preparedness remains a top priority, even after COVID-      19. Some commenters recommended reestablishing an office       within the National Security Council focused on biodefense to       institutionalize this responsibility.                            6. Additional Comments         A theme across all responses was a specific need for       increased and sustained funding for public health       preparedness programs. Over the past several decades, funding       for these programs at the federal, state, and local levels       has experienced inconsistencies. In areas where funding has       occasionally increased, such as for research, development,       and procurement of medical countermeasures, these increases       have been relatively modest and often not consistent year to       year. This variability in funding has led to uncertainty from       the private sector and other levels of government that these       capabilities will be there when the country needs to respond       to a public health threat. Without sustained and reliable       funding for these programs, commenters stated that we will       not be prepared for the next pandemic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, our great country has developed a  dangerous habit when it comes to pandemics.

Former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  Dr. Judy Gerberding, said at our hearing:         In the face of an unprecedented public health crisis like       the coronavirus, we have seen the Strategic National       Stockpile deliver some promising innovations but at the same       time discovered areas where there is room for improvement. .       . . The COVID-19 pandemic provides us an opportunity to make       pragmatic changes; we must act now to avoid becoming       complacent and finding ourselves in the same position when       the next pandemic occurs.    Panic, neglect, panic.   There is also broad agreement about some additional steps Congress  needs to take to prepare for the next pandemic, including disease  surveillance, restoring support for our State and local public health  systems--Governor Leavitt said they have been seriously underfunded for  the last 30 or 40 years--and better coordination of pandemic response.   I don't propose to deal with those three things today, but I do  intend to keep legislation to better prepare for future pandemics on  the top of the congressional to-do list until it is done.   In this internet age, attention spans are short. Even with an event  as significant as COVID-19, memories fade, and attention moves on  quickly to the next crisis. That makes it imperative that Congress act  on needed changes this year in order to better prepare for next  pandemic, which might be in 20 years or might be next year or next  month. The only thing we know for certain is that it will come.   Let us not succumb to the familiar, dangerous habit of panic,  neglect, panic. At least Congress can take these three steps to keep  vaccine manufacturing on our shores and stockpiles supplied now while  the pandemic has our attention, while we have our eye on the ball.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a copy of the summary of responses the Health Committee received in  response to the white paper that I released on June 9   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Summary of Responses to ``Preparing for the Next Pandemic'' White Paper                        (By Senator Lamar Alexander)         On June 9, Chairman Alexander released ``Preparing for the       Next Pandemic,'' a white paper with five recommendations to       address future pandemics based on lessons learned from COVID-      19 and the past 20 years of public health preparedness. The       main purpose of the white paper was to elicit recommendations       and feedback from experts who have studied public health       preparedness that Congress could consider and act on this       year. The Committee received over 350 responses to specific       questions posed by the white paper and more broadly on the       topic of public health and medical preparedness and response.   1. Tests, Treatments, and Vaccines--Accelerate Research and Development         Among those responses focused on accelerating research and       development of tests, treatments, and vaccines, respondents       recommended leveraging public-private partnerships and       tapping into strategic computing reserves, expanding the       capacities of the Biomedical Advanced Research and       Development Authority (BARDA), and sustaining on-shore       manufacturing for high-priority countermeasures, like       vaccines and treatments, and other aspects of pharmaceutical       manufacturing, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients and       fill-finish capacity for bulk drug substances. While the       federal government currently has robust programs in these       areas, commenters recommended that these programs be       bolstered further, better integrated with one another, and       improve coordination of priorities across programs,       particularly between BARDA and the National Institutes of       Health.   2. Disease Surveillance--Expand Ability to Detect, Identify, Model and                     Track Emerging Infectious Diseases         The need for improved emerging infectious disease       surveillance was addressed by several commenters. Many       stakeholders suggested improving the public health       information systems by modernizing current public health data       reporting systems and better integrating such systems.       Commenters specifically mentioned the public health data       systems modernization provisions included in the Lower Health       Care Costs Act as a solution to this problem. In addition,       many responses included suggestions for how to improve       contact tracing capabilities within states. Some experts       mentioned investing in improved disease surveillance and       leveraging technology or private-public partnerships in order       to better detect, identify, and model emerging infectious       diseases.   3. Stockpiles Distribution and Surges--Rebuild and Maintain Federal and      State Stockpiles and Improve Medical Supply Surge Capacity and                                Distribution         Many commenters discussed the need for improved stockpiling       and distribution of medical supplies. General themes covered       by commenters on this subject include improved situational       awareness and streamlined distribution of medical supplies       and countermeasures, such as testing supplies, personal       protective equipment, and an eventual COVID-19 vaccine;       better oversight of the contents of stockpiles; and improved       coordination between federal, state, and local governments.       Some commenters discussed their preference for an enhanced       federal role in stockpiling and distributing supplies.       However, other commenters agreed that increasing stockpiles       at the state and local level and in health care facilities       would provide more efficient access to supplies during a       public health emergency. Commenters who agreed with the       concept of state stockpiles highlighted the need for strong       coordination between the federal government and the states on       stockpile inventories and deployments so that supplies are       used as efficiently as possible. Additionally, some       commenters pointed out that certain products, like       specialized countermeasures for threats like anthrax and       smallpox, would not be appropriate to stockpile at the state       level. Rather, they said that state stockpiles should focus       on products like personal protective equipment and broad-      spectrum antibiotics, which are typically available through       commercial distributors and are useful across responses.     4. Public Health Capabilities--Improve State and Local Capacity to                                  Respond         Many experts and stakeholders addressed the importance of       improving public health infrastructure, and recommended       additional funding to enhance state and local response       capabilities. Specifically, some experts suggested bolstering       testing infrastructure, and investing in greater state       laboratory and biosafety laboratory capacity. They also       highlighted the need for an improved public health workforce       by implementing additional preparedness training for health       care providers and public health workers. Lastly, commenters       suggested making permanent several temporary flexibilities       provided during the COVID-19 public health emergency that       have expanded access to telehealth services, as well as       improving interoperability for electronic health records.  [[Page S4270]]        5. Who is on Flagpole?--Improve Coordination of Federal Agencies During                         a Public Health Emergency         Many commenters also addressed the lack of consistent       coordination between the federal government, states, and the       private sector and uncertainty over federal leadership during       a pandemic. Generally, commenters agreed that the Office of       the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR)       at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is the       right entity to coordinate the day-to-day operational       response to a public health emergency. However, multiple       commenters noted that ASPR does not have sufficient authority       to direct the activities of other departments and agencies,       which is necessary during a whole-of-government response.       Additionally, these commenters noted that White House       involvement, both during a response and when there is no       public health emergency in effect, is necessary to ensuring       coordination among departments and agencies and that public       health preparedness remains a top priority, even after COVID-      19. Some commenters recommended reestablishing an office       within the National Security Council focused on biodefense to       institutionalize this responsibility.                            6. Additional Comments         A theme across all responses was a specific need for       increased and sustained funding for public health       preparedness programs. Over the past several decades, funding       for these programs at the federal, state, and local levels       has experienced inconsistencies. In areas where funding has       occasionally increased, such as for research, development,       and procurement of medical countermeasures, these increases       have been relatively modest and often not consistent year to       year. This variability in funding has led to uncertainty from       the private sector and other levels of government that these       capabilities will be there when the country needs to respond       to a public health threat. Without sustained and reliable       funding for these programs, commenters stated that we will       not be prepared for the next pandemic.                            ____________________
