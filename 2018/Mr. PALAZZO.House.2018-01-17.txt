 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the benefits  that many Americans across the country are already seeing from the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act.   After hearing leaders of the Democratic Party call $1,000 ``crumbs,''  I wanted to make sure my colleagues on  [[Page H456]]  the other side of the aisle understood that our tax reform and relief  plan is more than just crumbs to over 2 million Americans.   Immediately following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we  saw an outpouring of businesses announce they would offer bonuses to  their employees, and some even increased their wages. This money was  instantly invested back into American workers.   I would like to see one of my colleagues from the other side of the  aisle come to Mississippi and see the response they get after they tell  the Levins and the Ladners in Saucier, Mississippi, that $1,000 is only  crumbs. I promise you they would only say it once.   As we go into 2018, I will continue highlighting real stories of  Mississippi businesses that are benefiting from our new Tax Code.                            ____________________
