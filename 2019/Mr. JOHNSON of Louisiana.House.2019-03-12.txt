 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration  of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if the request cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and majority leader to immediately  schedule the Born-Alive bill so we can stand up and protect the  sanctity of human life, and I ask all Members to join in that request.
