 Mr. President, now, with each new day of war in Ukraine,  the brutality and sheer evil of Vladimir Putin's aggression against the  Ukrainian people becomes more apparent. Failing at securing the country  with quick strikes, Russian forces are evidently starting to engage in  siege tactics. Over the past 12 hours, the city of Kharkiv has endured  especially heavy fire. Civilian casualties, tragically, are mounting.   Today, every single Member of the Senate must say once again, without  equivocation, that the United States stands behind the Ukrainian people  and behind all people in all nations who oppose the aggressions of  despotism.   In the weeks to come, the Senate must work on a bipartisan basis--and  in lockstep with the Biden administration--to pass a strong aid package  providing both humanitarian aid and security assistance to Ukraine.   The strongest signal we can send to Vladimir Putin right now is that  the United States stands together--together--with the people of  Ukraine. Twenty years ago, when our own democracy was attacked right  here on our own soil, Americans banded together--Democrat and  Republican--to defend our Nation and our democracy.   Today, as democracy faces its greatest crisis in Europe since the end  of the Cold War, we must likewise band together in support of our  friends in Ukraine. So far, the President has done an excellent job  uniting our Nation and our allies against Putin. This was not an easy  job. The President had to show patience from some who had urged him to  do things that would have torn the relationship apart--the European- American relationship.   Now, because of the President's strong leadership, the Russian  President finds himself more isolated and a greater pariah than at any  other moment in his time in power. When the full weight of  international sanctions takes effect, the consequences will be  catastrophic for Putin and the Russian economy.   On the flip side--on the flip side--divisions within the United  States or amongst our allies will only strengthen Vladimir Putin and  strengthen his resolve that he can win this war, and we must resist him  and his deeply cynical efforts however necessary. We must be  [[Page S846]]  united in this moment, and so far our unity has precisely been our  greatest asset in resisting Putin's aggression: from unity amongst  American people in solidarity with Ukraine to America's unity with our  European allies. So I hope our Republican colleagues in this Chamber  will work with us and the administration to stay unified with a strong  aid package.   We don't know how this crisis will evolve, but one thing that will  not change is the need to maintain a united front so long as Vladimir  Putin continues down his path of violence.   For that reason, the Senate will continue working in the weeks to  come on a strong aid package that will erase any doubt where our  allegiance lies.                          State of the Union Address    Mr. President, now on another subject, tonight, President Biden will  come to the U.S. Capitol and deliver the first State of the Union of  his Presidency. Whenever the Nation takes stock of the state of our  Union, it is important to know where we are today compared to where we  were a single year ago. That, indeed, is a revealing measure of any  President's leadership.   And despite the immense challenges we still have, what a difference  between last year and this year. At the beginning of last year, we were  facing the very worst of the pandemic. Unemployment was over 6 percent.  Most forecasters said it would take years--perhaps more--to make  significant progress in our recovery.   And, of course, as the Trump Presidency came to a bitter and ignoble  end, our country was still in shell shock from the violent assault  waged upon this Capitol and upon democracy itself.   Today, as we continue to face the serious challenges of our time,  just look at how far we have come. The economy has now grown at the  fastest rate in a single year since the 1980s. We have added back the  most jobs in a single year than in any President's term ever--6 million  jobs. Congress passed--and the President signed--the biggest  comprehensive, standalone infrastructure law in generations, which is  now fixing our roads and bridges, supply chains, and putting people to  work across the country with good-paying jobs. Jobs have always been  the No. 1 issue to working families. And on that measure, this first  year has been a very, very large success.   And after years of President Trump currying favor with despots and  autocrats--we all remember what he said about Vladimir Putin over and  over again--the world can now rest assured that the United States is  once again a reliable ally in the defense of democracy and our  alliances like NATO.   And of course, COVID cases are significantly dropping, communities  are reopening, mask mandates are reversing, and over 215 million  Americans--215 million--have now been fully vaccinated.   The road has not been easy, and certainly the work is not yet done.  The pain of inflation is being felt around this country and around the  world, thanks largely to the disruptions of the pandemic.   The two greatest things vexing the American people are completing our  recovery from COVID and getting life back to normal and fighting  increasing costs.   And Democrats in the Senate will keep our laser focus on precisely  those issues: bringing down costs for the American people so we can  reap the full benefits of our historic growth. From relieving shipping  bottlenecks to making insulin more affordable, to lowering the cost of  food, these are some of the things Americans want, and these are the  issues that Democrats right now are working to help solve.   These problems must be handled, and Democrats and the Biden  administration continue to work on them like a laser. Again, full  recovery from COVID and increasing costs are the two biggest remaining  issues on our domestic calendar, and we are focused on them. But even  so, we cannot ignore that we have come far.   And let me say this: The State of the Union is also an important and  rare moment for the American people to see what the party in office  actually stands for.   It is under Democratic leadership that we will continue to work to  lower costs, to fight inflation, give working families ladders of  opportunity to get to the middle class, and thrive there once they are  in the middle class.   Republicans can't say that. Crippled by Trump's cult of personality,  beholden to corporate interests and the ultrarich, the Republican  agenda would trap Americans in a vortex of deep cynicism--issues that  would not solve today's dilemmas--while they pass legislation that  overwhelmingly would benefit the very few wealthy people.   If anyone doubts where the Republican Party stands today, all they  have to do is read the bizarre, truly stunning plan released by the  junior Senator from Florida last week--the head of the Republican  Campaign Committee--which proposed everything from raising taxes on  low-income Americans to naming a useless and ineffective border wall  after Donald Trump.   Imagine, we are talking about getting back to normal and recovering  from COVID and reducing costs, and they are talking about naming a  border wall after Donald Trump. Which party is going to solve America's  problems?   Indeed, an analysis released yesterday by the Tax Policy Center found  that low-income households would pay an average of nearly $1,000 more  in taxes next year under a plan like Senator Scott's and that nearly  all of the new taxes under a plan like his would be paid by those  making less than $100,000 a year--cut the taxes on the wealthy, as they  did when Trump was President and they had the majority, and now  increase taxes on poor people and working-class people. That seems to  be where the Republicans are at.   This is just wrong, especially at a time when American families are  looking for our help in lowering costs. So, tonight, the President will  make clear that while we have a lot of work left to do, we have gotten  a lot of work done already. And the Democratic Senate will continue,  likewise, to focus working on legislation that completes our recovery  from COVID and does everything we can to make sure it doesn't come  back, to lower costs, to strengthen our buoyant economy, and preserve  America's place as a nation of immense opportunity deep into the 21st  century.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the motion  to proceed to H.R. 3076.    Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 p.m.  on Wednesday, March 2, the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 291, S.J. Res. 32. Further, I ask  unanimous consent that the time until 2:30 p.m. be equally divided  between the leaders or their designees on the joint resolution, and  that following the use or yielding back of that time, the joint  resolution be read a third time and the Senate vote on the joint  resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there are three bills  at the desk, and I ask for their first readings en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 639, 409, 411, 693, and 694; that the Senate vote  on the nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate; that any statements related to  the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate resume  legislative session.    Mr. President, now, on something that is very important  to this country, Senator Peters, in a minute, will move to pass the  Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act.   As we all know, protecting America--our government, our businesses,  our utilities, and so many of our entities--from cyber attack has been  very, very important over the last decade. It becomes even more  important now. As the war in Ukraine goes on and as Putin mounts his  illegal, immoral, and unprovoked attack, he is escalating cyber attacks  on democracies around the world. So, as the need to protect this  country from cyber attack is always very, very, very important, it has  assumed even greater importance now with Putin's fighting in Ukraine  and threatening cyber attacks throughout the world.   Today, the Senate is taking an urgently needed step to protect the  American people, American critical infrastructure, and American  Government institutions from the dangerous threat of cyber attacks. The  most important part of this provision will require our companies--our  individual businesses--to report cyber attacks when they occur.   There has been a reluctance on the part of many in the business  community to want to do this because it may expose them to other kinds  of harm, and maybe the public will not want to be involved in these  businesses, but the importance of the reporting is vital. When our  authorities in the government know of the attacks, they can prepare  against future attacks. They will know who is attacking, where they are  attacking, and how they are attacking. That will allow them to  strengthen our defenses against future cyber attacks. So this knowledge  of cyber attacks, caused by foreign entities or domestic entities, is  vital as America seeks to protect itself.   This legislation has been around for a while. For too long, certain  business interests opposed it, but now they have come to see the light,  and, in fact, we have a bipartisan agreement--unanimous in this  Chamber--that this bill move forward. That is very important for  America's security. It is more important than it ever has been. Cyber  warfare is truly one of the dark arts--specialized by Putin and his  authoritarian regime--and this bill will help to protect us from  Putin's attempted cyber attacks against our country.   Last year, I asked Chairman Peters and other relevant committee  chairs to draft legislation to counter the increased threat, and  Senator Peters has done an outstanding job. I want to commend him and  Senator Portman and so many others--Senator Warner among them--for  being heavily involved in this issue.   Tonight, we will pass legislation by unanimous consent. When this  legislation passes and is signed into law, America will be a safer  place from one of the greatest scourges we worry about--cyber attack. I  am glad we are doing this, and I am glad both sides have agreed.   I yield to Senator Peters, who, as I said, as chair of the HSGAC  Committee, has done a terrific job in shepherding this legislation  through the Senate.    Mr. President, just one more point.   As we have always said, we in the Democratic majority want to work  with our Republican colleagues on bipartisan legislation whenever we  can, and this is an example of that.   Obviously, there are times when we can't, and we will move forward.  But the more we can get done and accomplished in a bipartisan way on  important legislation like this, the better.   So, once again, let me salute the bipartisan coalition led by Gary  Peters and Rob Portman and so many others on both sides of the aisle  who contributed to this very important legislation.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate recess until 8:30 p.m. today and proceed as a body to the Hall  of the House of Representatives for the joint session of Congress  provided under the provisions of H. Con. Res. 69; and that upon  dissolution of the joint session, the Senate adjourn until 11 a.m. on  Wednesday, March 2, 2022; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 273,  H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act.    Mr. President, we will gather in the Senate Chamber at  8:20 this evening to proceed as a body to the House for the State of  the Union.   If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that  it recess under the previous order.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:23 p.m., recessed until 8:30 p.m. and  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.                            ____________________
