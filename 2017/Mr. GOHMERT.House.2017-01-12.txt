 Mr. Speaker, it is Thursday evening in the House of  Representatives, and I continue to hear friends, fellow Members of the  House, and reporters in anguish over the issue of a potential wall  between the United States and Mexico; so I thought it was worth looking  at some information about Mexico--our closest neighbor to the south.  The data should be recent.   They have got nearly 120 million people in Mexico. The gross domestic  product is around 2.1 trillion in pesos. They have 2.1 percent growth-- terrible. It is about like the Obama economy. The average income is  around $17,000 per capita. Inflation is 4.0 percent.   Yet, you look at the economics of Mexico in the world, and you think,  wow. You look at their resources--extraordinary resources, just  extraordinary resources. We know they have got hardworking people  because we know, from the people of Mexico who have come to the United  States, that people constantly indicate, gee, they are the best workers  we have, these hardworking folks from Mexico.   So you have got hardworking people in the nation of Mexico, and you  have got incredible natural resources that have never been tapped--or  not adequately tapped. We don't even know the full potential--oil, gas,  copper. There are all of these different minerals that Mexico is  supposed to have. You look at what people have done over the thousands  of years--I mean, advanced civilizations. Why is Mexico not one of the  top 10 or even top five economies in the world? It is listed 62nd in  the world.   They have got plenty of land. I can personally testify that they have  some of the most beautiful terrain in the world--beautiful beaches,  mountains, farming regions; just magnificent land, minerals, and  hardworking people. Why is it 62nd in the world as an economy? That is  an interesting question.   It would seem to be because--from hearing people who have looked at  Mexico and who have either tried to start a business there or who have  looked at it to start a business there, to start manufacturing there-- of course, there are many who have set up manufacturing shops down  there, but they are easily persuaded out of it if they can find a more  suitable place. The reason it is often easy to persuade people to set  up shop somewhere else is because of the drug cartels, the corruption  that the drug cartels bring to Mexico.   What is it the drug cartels are making billions of dollars off of  that allow them to corrupt police departments? city governments? the  Mexican border patrol? the Mexican military?   Obviously, the people in all of the Mexican Government are not  corrupt. I have met too many who want desperately to make the nation of  Mexico one of the greatest in the world, and it is possible that could  happen but not so long as the drug cartels are, potentially, the most  powerful entities in Mexico. I mean, they are right next to the United  States. They really should be one of the top, at least 10--if not the  top five or the top three or four--economies in the world, but they are  nowhere close.   Drug cartels, we have found--and we know--make money, particularly  off shipping illegal drugs into the United States. They have made a  fortune off of it. I have heard from friends of mine in Texas who are  in the drug enforcement business, both Federal and State. When the U.S.  Congress took action to make it more difficult to get SUDAFED, which is  used in the cooking of substances that are put together in order to  create methamphetamine, that meth lab became much more rare, especially  in east Texas, where I live, where we have got lots of trees, woods-- terrain where people can easily hide out, set up a lab, cook some  methamphetamine, especially as developed during my time on the felony  bench, where people in Texas learned how to cook methamphetamine,  create methamphetamine with a cold cooking process that didn't subject  them to quite the danger and didn't create quite the nasty smell that  often got meth labs reported to the authorities.                                time  1945    By drying up so many of the meth labs, we were told it is going to be  a great day for America. We dry up the meth labs by making it tougher  to get Sudafed because you have to ask, give your driver's license, and  you are restricted to a very limited amount of Sudafed. We were told  that is going to dry up drugs. Methamphetamine is going to be a thing  of the past. We will cut it to next to nothing.   Well, it is true. It is not as widespread as it used to be, but I am  told that more pure drugs with much more devastating results and much  more addictive are coming up from Mexico in greater numbers, greater  quantities. It is even worse than it was when methamphetamine was being  cooked because of the purity of the substances and the addictive  nature. Also, as a result of drying up so much in the way of  methamphetamine, we have much more of the heroin epidemic crossing  America.   Additional drugs have come from Mexico across our porous border that  seems to have grown during the Obama administration dramatically. Why?  Because our border has really not particularly been all that enforced.   It turns out that it is not just other drugs that are coming across  our border. Since we have been able to eliminate so many meth labs,  especially in Texas, we see stories like this one from Bob Price,  January 5, ``Feds Seize Nearly $7M in Meth At Texas Border.'' That is a  story about the seizure of methamphetamine at two international border  bridges in south Texas in 1 week. The Customs and Border Protection,  CBP, that was assigned to the World Trade Center International Bridge  in Laredo, this article reports how they had caught two drug  traffickers with 200 pounds of crystal meth in one vehicle, and that  was December 22, 2016.   We also know that the border security under this administration has  become just almost nonexistent. We had an article from January 12,  today, from McAllen, from Fox News, entitled, ``Cartels, Smugglers  Exploit Border Wall Fears Ahead of Trump Presidency.'' So apparently  they are using this time before President Trump is sworn in next week  to scare people into coming now. Bring your drugs now. Come illegally  now into the U.S. before Trump becomes President.  [[Page H466]]    I guess it is a bit akin to Iran. After holding American hostages for  over a year under Commander in Chief Jimmy Carter, became so scared of  a tough, independent-minded Ronald Reagan coming into office, they let  those hostages go on the very day he was sworn in. So they didn't risk  him taking military action against them.   This is another story from Jessica Vaughan, January 2017, that  reports that ``ICE Deportations Hit 10-Year Low.'' This is January  2017. DHS has hit a 10-year low in deportations.   We see stories about how border control is almost nonexistent on our  southern border, stories that expectation of amnesty is attracting  immigrants to our U.S. border.   Here is another story from January 10 by Brittany Hughes, ``Border  Agents Catch Another Wave of Illegal Aliens From Cuba Amid Escalating  Spike.'' I have been told, when I am down there, they are seeing more  and more Cubans coming across the Mexican border of all places.   So the insecurity--not mentally--of the United States, but the actual  insecurity of the United States because of our vulnerability to people  that hate us and drug cartels that want to make billions of dollars by  hooking people on drugs that they will deliver, has reached insane  levels. That is probably part of the reason that Donald Trump was  elected President by an avalanche in the electoral college.   If you look at the counties that voted for Hillary Clinton and you  look at the counties that voted for Donald Trump, it becomes very clear  that the Democratic Party in the United States has basically become a  fringe party. They won the fringes: West Coast, East Coast, part of  Florida, part of the northeast, Chicago, Detroit, some of the northern  cities, the southern valley of Texas. I mean, it is a fringe party.  There are a few exceptions inside the country, but basically the rock- solid interior that the American people make up--in what some refer to  as fly-over country in America--voted rather solidly for Donald Trump.   Here are numbers from the CIA World Factbook on Mexico:   Crude oil exports, a 2015 estimate, had 1.199 million barrels per  day. Country comparison to the world, 13.   Crude oil imports, 11,110 barrels a day. Crude oil, proved reserves,  9.7 billion barrels, and that is just proven reserves.   If you look at natural gas from a 2014 estimate, 44.37 billion cubic  meters. That is supposed to be 19th in the world, but when you consider  how productive they could become once they began fracking, using more  advanced technology, then you find out that, wow, this is a nation--the  nation of Mexico--that really should be one of the top 10 economies in  the world.   What is the excuse that it is not? It has hardworking people, natural  resources that most of the world could only envy. Why is it not one of  the top 10? We keep coming back to the drug cartels and the corruption  that they have brought to Mexico and the billions of dollars that are  generated by the drug cartels.   As we have talked about here in the House, the border patrolmen tell  me--I have been there all night--there is not a single inch of the  U.S.-Mexico border that is not controlled by one of the drug cartels  and that nobody should cross the border unless they have paid the drug  cartels, have the drug cartels' permission.   I have seen firsthand how it works. They will send a group across the  river with coyotes in rafts when they are down on the Rio Grande. That  keeps the Border Patrol busy. At another place, they send people with  drugs.   I have been there and seen their lookouts, climbed up on perches  where they can watch. When the Border Patrol goes by, they know they  won't be back for a while, so they get surprised when I drive by in the  middle of the night.    They are all over the place around our southern border. They are  making billions of dollars. Whoever came up with the business model for  the drug cartels that you could make such massive amounts of money  bringing drugs illegally into the United States, it was really a  business genius. But it would take a business fool in the United States  to allow the kind of model that Mexico has set up for its drug business  to even get a foothold in the United States.   As I have mentioned, one of the Border Patrol told me that the drug  cartels call the Department of Homeland Security their logistics. They  bring their drug dealers. They bring their drug traffickers. They bring  their prostitutes. Unfortunately, girls are being forced, often, into  drug trafficking or human trafficking, and they are going to be used as  prostitutes to make money for the drug cartels. They send them across.   As a border patrolman said, they send them across, and then DHS here  in America becomes their logistics. We ship them wherever they want  them to go in the United States. All they have to do oftentimes is just  have--I have seen them--a Xerox copy of the address where they are  supposed to go, and DHS puts them on the bus--sometimes flies them, but  usually buses--and ships them off to a city where the drug cartels want  them to set up shop.   I have been there in the middle of the night when border patrolmen  will ask how much they paid to be brought in illegally to the U.S. Some  of the Spanish speakers in our Border Patrol are really incredible as  they drill down and get answers to their questions that are not always  on the list that DHS tells them to get.   ``How much money did you pay?'' They would say, ``Well, you didn't  have $6,000, $7,000, $8,000. Where did you get that money?''   ``Well, I was able to get $1,000 from somebody in the U.S., $1,000  from somebody in Mexico or Guatemala.''   ``Well, what about the rest?''   ``They are going to let me pay that out after I am in the United  States.''                                time  2000    It becomes clear very quickly that, once again, this business model  that the drug cartels have includes getting people in rafts where the  Rio Grande River requires a raft, or just getting them across in  unguarded areas, or areas where we need a wall and don't have one,  getting them across, and then getting DHS to send them to the city  where they want to set up shop as drug traffickers, human traffickers.   What a business model. You get the Federal Government of the United  States to help you set up your business machine, your business model in  the United States. They are shipping your employees around the country  to different cities. Yes, it is normally under the guise of: I have a  relative there, here is the relative's address. They are going to take  care of me.   Perhaps you get delayed and have to wait for an immigration judge  that was appointed by Eric Holder to give you a notice to appear for a  hearing 4 years later, a year, 2 years later, and then you can go on to  the city where the drug cartels want you to finish paying off what you  owe them for getting you into the United States.   So to have a business model that requires your workers to pay you is  extraordinary, but that is what drug cartels are able to do when you  have a willing Obama administration here in the United States that will  help you set up your drug cartel mechanism here in the United States.  That is what has been going on.   In the meantime, back in Mexico, you generate so much money by having  your workers pay you to work for you, and getting billions of dollars  from the drugs that are sent into the United States, hooking people  here in America, making them reliant on and addicted to drugs that  destroy their lives. So basically the drug cartels get a two-for. They  destroy the human infrastructure of the United States with poison that  some would say, well, that is another name for illegal drugs. And then,  in the meantime, you have got all of that money coming to you, and you  use that money to buy off police. Thank God there are some stand-up  police in Mexico that can't be bought. But if they go too strongly head  to head with the drug cartels--we have seen the pictures--they can end  up with their head on a pike as a message. We have had chiefs of police  that were killed when they refused to kowtow to the drug cartels, and  so the message becomes pretty clear.   It seems to me that the biggest reason that Mexico--with  extraordinary people and extraordinary natural resources, a beautiful,  fantastic country, a location that is just incredibly advantageous  because they have got shipping that can go out on the West Coast like  we do to the Pacific, shipping on  [[Page H467]]  the East Coast into the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, ready access to  North American markets, ready access to South American market, what an  opportunistic location for Mexico. Yet, they struggle so far behind  most nations, or so many nations in the world. Dozens and dozens, 60 or  so, are before them because drug cartels have such a powerful part in  Mexico itself.   So there are many Americans, especially friends of mine across the  aisle here, who think it is an absolute outrage to talk about building  a wall between the United States and Mexico. There are some Mexican  officials that think it is an outrage to talk about building a wall  between the United States and Mexico.   Now, some of those Mexican officials think it is an outrage because  they haven't thought through the magnificence that may arise in Mexico  once we have secured the border between Mexico and the United States  and we can slow the drug trafficking to a trickle. So the drug cartels  will not be looking at billions of U.S. dollars; they will be looking  at thousands; and if they are extremely powerful, maybe millions. But  if we get that down to thousands, then the Mexican people will be able  to have control without corruption, without massive pockets of  corruption, without a drug cartel that can buy soldiers, buy police,  buy chiefs of police, and buy mayors. Again, thank God it is only a  small part of Mexico, but it keeps Mexico suppressed from the great  economic power that it could be. And the potential is all there.   You build a wall, then you shut down the drug cartels. And when they  only have thousands of dollars to bribe police instead of millions or  billions of dollars, then law and order will prevail and the drug  cartels will not, and we will have the most extraordinary neighbor to  our south all because we followed the example in Mending Wall, and we  had a wall between us that we kept up, we took care of, we shut down,  helped Mexico shut down the drug cartels by being a good neighbor,  enforcing the border, and the standard of living in Mexico spirals  upwards through the sky. The power Mexico would have as a nation in any  international organization will be extraordinary, and the United States  will reach an unparalleled relationship as a neighbor. That is worth  building a wall for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
