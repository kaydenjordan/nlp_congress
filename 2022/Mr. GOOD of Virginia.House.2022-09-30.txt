 Mr. Speaker, the preamble to the Constitution  states that its purpose is, in part, to ``secure the blessings of  liberty to ourselves and our posterity.'' Are we doing that today?   This legislation represents Congress at its worst. We are voting to  let government funding expire on December 16, just days after dozens of  Democrats are fired by the voters on November 8. But before this  Congress adjourns and new courageous conservatives are sworn in,  Congress wants to stick it to the American people one more time.  [[Page H8349]]    The funding for 2023 and beyond should reflect the will of the people  and how they vote on November 8 when they reject the policies under  which they are suffering today.   No Republican in the Senate should have, and no Republican in this  House, and even those on the other side, should give one more cent to a  government that doesn't care about our border but wants to send $12  billion more to secure the border of Ukraine.   We should not fund a government that is allowing an invasion across  our southern border and is giving hundreds of millions of dollars to  the countries that are facilitating that just south of our border.   We should be cutting our spending and not increasing inflation by  more massive spending, as reflected in this package today.   We should support American energy production, not subsidize  unreliable energy and Biden's gas price hike.   We should not be funding the hiring of 87,000 new IRS agents to go  after regular, hardworking Americans.   We should end the vaccine mandate and the COVID China virus emergency  and not fund an administration that wants to fire healthcare workers  because they don't get a vaccine.   All Republicans should oppose this CR, not give one more vote for one  more cent for this tyrannical government that is hurting all Americans.
