 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the  rise of a failed state, Venezuela, and the manmade tragedy President  Maduro has imposed on his citizens.   For 3 months, Venezuelans have taken to the streets in daily  protests. They are speaking out against their country's economic  collapse, against widespread food shortages, the disintegration of  their medical system, against endemic corruption, and against a  government that denies them their human rights and fundamental  freedoms.   Appallingly, President Maduro has responded to the protests by  unleashing his National Guard. As a recent Washington Post article  stated, ``Mr. Maduro and the corrupt clique around him are hanging on  by the brute force of tear gas, water cannons, mass arrests, and  shootings by snipers.''   Since April, Venezuela's increasingly unstable crisis has left over  75 dead, thousands jailed, and thousands more injured. Yet, instead of  listening to his people's legitimate demands and mitigating this  tragedy, President Maduro is attempting to rewrite the Constitution,  despite widespread opposition. Additionally, he declared this week that  ``what couldn't be done with votes would be done with weapons.''   This is our hemisphere. This is a hemisphere that prides itself in  democratic states, and here is the President of Venezuela saying he  doesn't care what the voters say. With Maduro threatening to use arms  against his people, one can only imagine the bloodshed and abuses will  continue unabated.   Despite these threats, protests endure because Venezuelans see no  alternatives. They have no other recourse against standing in lines for  endless hours to scour the empty shelves at their markets. They have no  other way to channel their sorrow over the spike in maternal and infant  mortality rates in hospitals that lack supplies to treat the most basic  diseases. They have no other way to express their outrage at the  military profiting from corruption in food procurement contracts, even  while children increasingly suffer the ravages of malnutrition.   Parallel to the protests, chaos is becoming commonplace. In the past  72 hours, the National Guard troops have stormed the National Assembly  and assaulted opposition legislators. They came into the Parliament and  assaulted the opposition. The supreme court has stripped the attorney  general, Luisa Ortega, of her authorities for her criticism of  President Maduro.   We have seen lootings and the burning of government buildings.  Alarmingly, a rogue police officer commandeered a helicopter and  launched grenades and small arms fire while flying over the supreme  court. These incidents from just the last 3 days should make it clear  to all we are now dealing with a failed state in our own hemisphere.   As this crisis cripples Venezuela, I call on all sides to refrain  from violence. I also want to recognize that the current situation is  the product of 18 years of systematic efforts to dismantle Venezuela's  democratic institutions.   Since coming to power, President Maduro--like Hugo Chavez before  him--has filled the ranks of government with loyalists who have led the  economy to hyperinflation and the brink of default. State oil companies  like PDVSA, the country's only source of revenue, has been purged of  its expertise. In a truly devastating blow to democracy and the rule of  law, the judiciary has been entirely sapped of its independence so it  now functions as a political appendage of the executive branch.   In the 18 months since the opposition coalition won control of the  National Assembly--and I must tell you there was hope when we saw the  voters in Venezuela enacted a new government in their Parliament--the  supreme court has overturned every piece of legislation passed, gave  itself authority to approve the national budget, and in April  temporarily usurped the rest of the legislature's authorities,  completely reversing the will of the people.   Additionally, as Venezuela's civilian and military justice systems  have become accomplices to persecution and torture, the number of  political prisoners has soared. Leopoldo Lopez, Judge Afiuni, Daniel  Ceballos--these are just some of the more well-known names among the  more than 350 political prisoners recognized by Venezuelan human rights  NGO Foro Penal. These are people who are in prison as a result of their  political beliefs.   It is no surprise the decay of judicial independence has led to an  alarming rise in corruption and impunity. It is now a stated fact that  senior officials have syphoned billions out of Venezuela and are  engaged in the illegal drug trade.   In response, the United States has designated a dozen people under  the Kingpin sanctions, including Vice President Tareck El Aissami.  Interior Minister Reverol was indicted in the United States last year  for drug trafficking. Even Maduro's nephews were convicted in the  United States on drug charges.    The sum of these trend lines is truly disturbing. Today, Venezuela is  a failed state, where authoritarian leaders profit from links to  corruption and drug trafficking, while the Venezuelan people are  subject to precarious humanitarian conditions and human rights abuses.  Against this backdrop, we require little explanation why more than  18,000 Venezuelans sought asylum in the United States last year.   We are all concerned about the flight of people at risk. What is  happening in Venezuela directly impacts people trying to seek safety  coming into the United States. If all this wasn't enough, in late 2016,  Venezuelan State oil company PDVSA used its U.S. subsidiary Citgo as  collateral to secure a loan from Rosneft, a company that is controlled  by the Russian Government and is currently under U.S. sanctions. The  result is, the Russian Government holds at least 49.9 percent of  Citgo's mortgage and could come into control of critical U.S. energy  infrastructure, including refineries, terminals, and a large network of  pipelines. This should  [[Page S3842]]  concern every Member of the U.S. Senate.   So the question for the United States and the international community  is, How do we respond? What do we do? We cannot let this circumstance  continue.   Thankfully, supported by a growing diplomatic coalition that includes  Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru, Canada, and the United States, the  Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro,  is marshalling international pressure. Mr. Almagro has called on  President Maduro to heed the demands of his citizens, free political  prisoners, permit the delivery of humanitarian assistance, commit to a  timetable for overdue elections, and restore the authority of the  National Assembly.   However, despite Mr. Almagro's leadership, the results of last week's  meeting of Foreign Ministers was a stunning failure to reach consensus  on a hemisphere response. Appallingly, eight countries refused to vote  their conscience, among them Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El  Salvador, Trinidad, and Suriname. They did not use the power under the  OAS to recognize that Venezuela today is not living up to its charter  commitment to be a democratic state. There is a process at the OAS to  take action. They were unable to do that--a major setback.   As efforts at the OAS continue, all must remain clear that there are  no alternative facts when it comes to Venezuela, there is just a  manmade tragedy that demands collective action.   While providing full support for multilateral diplomacy, the United  States must also lead. In May, I introduced bipartisan legislation to  address the multifaceted crisis in Venezuela. My bill will authorize  humanitarian assistance and require the State Department to coordinate  an international approach to humanitarian challenges. The legislation  will also provide strong congressional backing for OAS efforts, as well  as funding for international election observers and civil society  groups working to defend human rights and democratic values.   Given the rising instability in Venezuela, the bill would codify two  lines of targeted sanctions against Venezuelan officials involved in  corruption and undermining democratic governance--the very authorities  the administration used to rightly sanction members of the Venezuelan  supreme court last month.   Congress should act, as we have done in so many other places where we  show congressional leadership to make it clear that this type of  activity will not be allowed to continue and that Congress will take a  strong position to give appropriate authority to sanction those  individuals who are responsible.   Finally, the bill would require the State Department and U.S.  intelligence community to prepare a report on the role of Venezuelan  officials in corruption and drug trafficking.   As the instability in Venezuela grows, every day we decide not to act  only makes the crisis worse. I urge my colleagues to work with  legislation I have filed. Let's work with the Congress and the  President to make it clear to the Venezuelan people they are not alone,  and we will not tolerate a country in our hemisphere to become a failed  state.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize LGBTQ Pride  Month, a time to openly acknowledge and celebrate the contributions  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning  individuals have made to our Country and the progress they have made  over the years toward equality and civil rights.   Pride, equality, freedom--these values are at the core of Pride Month  for LGBTQ individuals and families in Maryland and across the United  States. Every American deserves the same freedoms, the same  opportunities and the same protections under the law to love whom they  love.   Respect, dignity, hope--LGBTQ Americans have helped drive the  innovation and bold ideas that make America exceptional. They have  stood sentry in our military, made scientific advances, created jobs  from Main Street to Wall Street, made all of America laugh and cry, and  so much more. LGBTQ individuals have enriched our communities and made  us a stronger nation.   Fear, apprehension, caution--those of us who defend civil rights  every day understand that these are discouraging and uncertain times.  It pains me to say the full admission of lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, and queer or questioning individuals into society has yet  to be granted. The open expression of one's sexual orientation and  gender identity has been--and oftentimes still is--wrought with  discrimination and hardship.   Despite the highs of Windsor and Obergefell, the LGBTQ community  feels the pain of the senseless shooting at Pulse nightclub 1 year ago,  blatant discrimination in States like North Carolina, and the  incomprehensible abandonment of transgender students in schools, and  the decades of injustice that reach back far beyond Stonewall. The  results of last year's Presidential election brought an unwanted chill  to the winds of momentum that had swept through the LGBTQ community.  Insensitive language from the current administration adds an ominous  cloud over the potential for future progress.   To all of my lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or  questioning sisters and brothers, I say this: You are not alone. I  support you. I will fight alongside you. We will not allow extremism to  take away the inherent rights afforded to each and every one of us.  Equality and liberty will prevail over any who would use hate and  bigotry to frighten or intimidate others.   I have joined with nearly half of the U.S. Senate as a sponsor of the  Equality Act, S. 1006, historic, comprehensive Federal legislation that  would ensure full Federal nondiscrimination equality for LGBTQ  individuals by adding sexual orientation and gender identity to other  protected classes, such as race or religion, in existing Federal laws.  Despite major advances in equality for LGBTQ Americans, including  nationwide marriage equality, the majority of States still do not have  explicit LGBTQ nondiscrimination protection laws. The Equality Act  would fill in the gap by explicitly banning discrimination in a host of  areas, including employment, housing, public  [[Page S3855]]  accommodations, jury service, access to credit, and Federal funding.   When the White House broke more than a decade of tradition by failing  to recognize June as LGBTQ Pride Month, I joined my colleagues in  picking up the mantle by introducing the first-ever Senate resolution  recognizing June as LGBTQ Pride Month. The resolution notes major  milestones in the fight for equal treatment of LGBTQ Americans and  resolves to continue efforts to achieve full equality for LGBTQ  individuals.   As we build a new future of equality for all, despite the current  headwinds, it is important that we learn from our Nation's past and use  it as a source of strength and a teachable moment for those unaware of  the history the LGBTQ community and what our Nation has been through.  It is my firm hope that we are not seeing a redux of a McCarthy-like  rise in political-driven discrimination.   For this reason, I was taken back a bit at the confirmation hearings  of Rex Tillerson and Nikki Haley, who are now serving as America's top  diplomats, that neither of them would say the phrase ``LGBTQ.''  Following that peculiarity, it has been widely reported that the Trump  administration has scrubbed LGBTQ content from various Federal  Government websites--in some cases changing the agency's official  nondiscrimination policy.   Juxtaposed with the Obama administration that lit up the White House  in rainbow lights during Pride month and backed up those concrete  actions of support, this attempt to erase LGBTQ individuals from  government was disturbing. I was alarmed because I knew that it had  been tried before during the McCarthy era. It had a damaging effect on  U.S. foreign policy back then, and it cannot be repeated.   In what came to be known as the Lavender Scare, according to the  State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, employees were forced  out on the ostensible grounds that their real or perceived sexual  orientation rendered them vulnerable to blackmail, prone to getting  caught in ``honey traps,'' and a general security risk. Many more  individuals were prevented from joining the State Department due to a  screening process that was put in place to prevent those who ``seemed  like they might be gay or lesbian'' from being hired.   David Johnson's ``The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of  Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government,'' University of Chicago  Press, 2006, the definitive academic study of the issue, found that at  least 1,000 people were dismissed from the U.S. Department of State  alone for alleged homosexuality during the 1950s and well into the  1960s before the ``scare'' ran its course.   The Senate bears a special measure of responsibility for the Lavender  Scare, as the State Department's actions were in part in response to  congressional investigations into ``sex perversion of federal  employees,'' reports on the employments of ``moral perverts by  Government Agencies,'' and hearings or pressure placed on the  Department through the appropriations process.   Last year, in my role as ranking member of the Senate Committee on  Foreign Relations, I urged then-Secretary of State John Kerry to shine  a spotlight on this dark period in American diplomatic history by  issuing the first-ever public apology for the Department of State's  targeting due to perceived sexual orientation.   This month, I introduced new legislation called the Lavender Offense  Victim Exoneration Act of 2017, or the LOVE Act. Similar to what was  enacted for the men and women of our military, who also were forced to  hide their real self to the world, the LOVE Act would make amends and  help right the wrongs that were leveled against our U.S. diplomats  during this un-American and unacceptable episode in our history. The  Lavender Scare is a painful but little-known chapter in American  history, and even though times have thankfully changed in so many ways  for the LGBT community, we must have the courage of our conviction to  recognize wrong, apologize, and move forward with common sense and  compassion whenever it is required.   A few have asked me, Why now? Why do we need to relive past  transgressions when there are ``more important things to do''? The  answer is clear: The current administration may work to avoid using the  words lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, but Congress should take  firm action to show LGBTQ Americans that their valuable contributions  to our country--today or 60-plus years ago--are very real and they are  recognized. We cannot and should not turn our backs on the individuals  who sacrificed so much for the benefit of the American people. We  cannot and will not turn back the clock on the hard-fought civil rights  of the LGBTQ community.   The theme of the 2017 Baltimore Pride celebration is ``Pride  Unleashed,'' a commitment to ``work boldly and to live freely.'' I can  think of no better mantra for LGBTQ Marylanders and allies as we fight  side by side to protect civil rights and celebrate the strength of our  diversity.   I implore you and all of our colleagues to join the fight for LGBTQ  equality. The administration also should take firm action to show LGBTQ  Americans that their valuable contributions to our country are  recognized and appreciated. It is the responsibility of each and every  citizen to root out systemic intolerance. Inclusion and diversity are  some of our Nation's greatest strengths; yet these values are now in  peril. We cannot and will not turn back the clock on hard-fought civil  rights for the LGBTQ community.                            ____________________
