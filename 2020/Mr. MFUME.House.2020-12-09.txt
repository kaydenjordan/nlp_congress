 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, Mr. Pallone of New Jersey. I appreciate his oversight of  this bill and the way his committee has moved us to where we are today.   Mr. Pallone and I go way back. When I left this body some time ago, I  didn't know I would come back and he would be chair of the committee,  but I couldn't think of a better person.   I also say to Mr. Walden, the ranking member from Oregon, that the  body obviously will miss you. And as you heard on both sides of the  aisle with the comments that have been made, people have respected your  leadership and the leadership that you have brought to that committee  both as ranking member and as chair. By the way, let me tell you, there  is life after Congress. I went out and found 24 years of it before  coming back. So best of everything to you, sir.   Members of the body, if I might, let me just talk a bit about a  distinguished, in my opinion, woman whose picture is here beside me.  Her name was Henrietta Lacks. She was born 100 years ago in Roanoke,  Virginia.   Mrs. Lacks and her husband and her family later moved to Baltimore  County in 1941, seeking, as a lot of people did, what they thought were  jobs that were available the further north you moved. They moved to an  area near what was known as the old Bethlehem Steel Plant. Henrietta  and her family lived not far from me and my family in a segregated  Black enclave known as Turner Station.   Ironically, Mrs. Lacks got ill. In 1951, as a young mother, she went  to the hospital complaining of vaginal bleeding. She went to Johns  Hopkins at the time, which was one of the few hospitals that African  Americans could go to and be treated.   Upon examination, gynecologists discovered a large, malignant tumor  in her cervix. During her treatment there, two cell samples were taken  from Mrs. Lacks and from her cervix without her permission and without  her knowledge. One sample was healthy tissue, the other sample was  cancerous tissue. And these samples were given to a physician and a  cancer researcher at Hopkins to study.   What this researcher would soon discover was that Mrs. Lacks' cells  were unlike any others he had ever seen. Where other cells would die,  Mrs. Lacks' cells doubled every 20 to 24 hours.                                time  1500    This continued after her death.   The cells from the cancerous sample became known eventually as the  HeLa immortal cell line.   The HeLa immortal cell line is the oldest and the most commonly used  human cell line in scientific research anywhere in the world. The cell  line was found to be remarkably durable and prolific, which allows its  use extensively in scientific study. This was the first human cell line  to prove to be successful in in vitro studies, which was a scientific  achievement with profound implications on the future and profound  benefits to medical research.   HeLa cells can divide an unlimited number of times in a laboratory  cell culture plate as long as fundamental cell survival conditions are  met and sustained. There are, as we have come to know over time, many  strains of HeLa cells as they continue to mutate in other cell  cultures, but all HeLa cells are descended from the same tumor cells  once removed from Mrs. Lacks. The total number of HeLa cells that have  been propagated in cell culture far exceeds the number of cells that  were in her body.  [[Page H7087]]    Today, these incredible cells are used to study the effects of  toxins, drugs, hormones, and viruses on the growth of cancer cells  without having to experiment on humans while that is being done. They  have been used to test the effects of a number of different things:  radiations, poisons, to study the human genome, and to learn more about  how all viruses ultimately work, and they have played a crucial role in  the development of the polio vaccine.   When Jonas Salk was so close to getting to what he thought was an  effective vaccine, Dr. Salk tested the vaccine against the cells, and  the cells directed him to make the vaccine even more potent.   The NIH analyzed and evaluated scientific literature over the course  of time involving HeLa cells and found that over 110,000 publications  cited the use of those cells from 1953 to 2018. So this analysis, I  think, further highlights the persistent impact of HeLa cells in  science and in medicine, proving that they have been a consistent and  essential tool that has allowed researchers to expand their knowledge  base in fields such as cancer biology, infectious disease, and many,  many other areas.   There is so much to be said about Ms. Lacks, who died in that same  Black, poor enclave many, many years ago, but to her credit and to the  credit of all science, her living clearly was not in vain, and her  death has proven something that nobody ever anticipated at the time:  that there could even be such a cell that would continue to develop and  mutate long beyond the donor's ability to live.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger) of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how much time remains on my  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My thanks, again, to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and the  others who have spoken on behalf of this, including Congressman  Ruppersberger, who has been, as he indicated, a part of this effort for  a while.   And that while goes all the way back to the other reason that I am  here today, and that is my friend of 42 years and a Member of this body  for 23 years, the late Elijah Cummings, who originally introduced this  bill before his death, and a commitment that I made to he and to others  long ago that, working outside of the Congress, I would be supportive  of him.   But now that I am inside, I wanted to make sure that I got unanimous  consent from this body, as I did a month  [[Page H7088]]  or so back, to be able to assume the leadership of this bill, its  sponsorship, and to move it forward, and we have been doing all that we  could to get to this point.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not thank Mr. Pallone  and Mr. Walden for their efforts.   Let me, if I might, just say a couple of things, Mr. Speaker. It has  been long recognized that the burden of cancer is not equal and not  equivalent among different racial and ethnic groups in our society. In  fact, there is a fourfold increase, or disparity, in the number of  Black people diagnosed with cancer in this country as compared with the  proportion of Black people participating in clinical trials.   The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) mentioned how sensitive this  is right now as we are trying to work with drug companies to come up  with a number of vaccines. And whether it was the Pfizer trial or the  Moderna trial, one thing is clear: there has never seemed to be enough  persons of ethnic backgrounds, particularly African Americans and  Latinos, who are participating in these trials.    To underscore this more, let me remind you that 20 percent of  Alzheimer's patients in this country are African American, but only 3  to 10 percent are the trial participants in clinical trials.   As I said, COVID is a disease with a roughly twofold higher rate of  diagnosis and mortality between African Americans and other  populations.   So all of that, in the aggregate, really stresses the need for a more  diverse research participatory effort in order to fully understand,  comprehensively deal with, and cure these diseases.   Clinical trials are an essential step in advancing potential new  cancer treatments. We know that. Patient participation in those trials  is absolutely crucial to their success.   Now, many patients will express a willingness to participate in  clinical research, yet only a small fraction of those persons do  actually do that.   In terms of the larger African-American community, some of the  barriers that have existed continue to exist. People can't take time  off from their job to participate and be studied in a clinical trial,  or, more importantly, there is this level of distrust.   The distrust, particularly among African Americans, goes back to  1932, when our government, through the United States Public Health  Service, oversaw and gave authorization for what was to become known as  the infamous Tuskegee Study, where 600 Black men, without their  knowledge, without their approval or consent, were injected with  syphilis and told that they were being treated for something altogether  different.   Those 600 men lived and watched their bodies change. Many of them may  had reinfected others. They suffered a great deal of pain. And nowhere  during that time did the government step in and say, ``Stop it.''                                time  1515    That Tuskegee study, which many of us grew up hearing about, is  something that lurks in the minds of a lot of African Americans about  why you can't trust the government on research when it comes to your  body. The shame that went with that ought to be a collective shame that  all of us in this country feel.   We are beyond 1932. People are still getting ill. There are all sorts  of infectious diseases. We need vaccines, and we have to find a way now  to participate in that process and to find a way to get beyond the  things that hold us back.   But in this instance, I just thought it was important to mention why  that reluctance tends to exist.   Racial and ethnic groups, and older Americans, rural Americans, and  poor Americans, are all the groups that still remain underrepresented  in cancer clinical trials. Without action, these groups will continue  to face barriers in terms of enrollment in cancer and other clinical  trials, which then deprive many Americans from access to effective  treatments and effective interventions.   Mr. Speaker, I close by reminding us how we began, and that is with  the story, the life, and the lesson of Henrietta Lacks, who died at an  early age, a mother of five who came north seeking employment, who  developed an illness, who got treated, and who, without her knowledge  or consent, had cells taken out of her body that were not cancerous--in  addition to the cancerous cells--only to miraculously find that there  was something very, very special about Ms. Lacks and her biological  makeup: a cell that continued to mutate and to mutate and to double  long after it was taken from her body, long after her death, and even  now has created 110,000 studies about this miraculous cell, which we  call HeLa, that has been the basis of research, Nobel award-winning  research, in the years that followed.   My thanks to all of you for participating and for understanding the  passion that drove Elijah on this, that drives me on this.   I want to thank the Lacks family, the Henrietta Lacks Foundation.   I want to thank the American Cancer Society, the National Institute  of Minority Health and Health Disparities, Research America, and all  the other organizations that continue to fight to bring about some sort  of balance and equity in the whole issue of research and clinical  trials.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
