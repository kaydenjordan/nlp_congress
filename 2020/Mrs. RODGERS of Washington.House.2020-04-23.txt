 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I appreciate his leadership.   I rise in opposition to this select committee. Energy and Commerce  has a long tradition of bipartisan oversight in its broad jurisdiction  and has the tools to prevent any fraud, waste, or abuse.   In the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, we are working  right now, Republicans and Democrats, to make sure the FTC is  protecting Americans from bad actors who are using the coronavirus to  commit fraud. Our Oversight and Investigation team is working around  the clock to stop bad actors and to track the spread of the virus  itself, as well as the stockpiles of PPE, ventilators, and test kits  sent to the States.   Our Health Subcommittee is working with HHS, FDA, CDC, and NIH to  ensure resources reach hospitals and frontline healthcare workers who  need it most.   The same can be said for the Small Business and Financial Services  Committees' efforts to ensure that PPP loans are implemented  effectively.   There is also the Ways and Means Committee oversight of the economic  impact payments or any of a number of other committees involved in  Congress' unprecedented bipartisan response to this crisis.                                time  1100    This select committee duplicates the existing jurisdiction of the  Energy and Commerce Committee and others. It will erode the trust and  effectiveness in our work that is underway during the greatest  healthcare and economic crisis we have seen in our lifetime.   We shouldn't create a new committee that will divide us, make this  response partisan, create more bureaucracy in Congress, and undermine  the hard, bipartisan work of my colleagues and staff who are doing  their jobs on their committees already.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to let  our committees continue to do their jobs and reject this resolution.
