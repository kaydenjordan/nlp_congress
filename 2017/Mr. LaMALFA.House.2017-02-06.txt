 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, I had a chance to go out  in the district and look at the conditions of our flood control system  in northern California, which, I am sure, is reflective of a lot of the  systems across this country. One particular area I was shown has had 10  feet of levee eaten away just since the end of December. This points  out, with recent legislation that has been passed--good legislation-- that we still aren't, by any means, close to fulfilling our  infrastructure needs.   Our flood control systems all over the country and in my own district  in northern California need immediate results. We expect a great amount  of rain. I know we complain about drought in California--feast or  famine--but we need to continue to shore up these systems here because,  otherwise, it will place communities in danger from the high flows we  could get.   With so much rain forecasted in the near future and with our lakes  getting full, there won't be a place to put that water. We need this  infrastructure, and we need the Army Corps and everybody to be on board  with fully developing and permitting these projects and getting the  money going. Urgency is needed.                            ____________________
