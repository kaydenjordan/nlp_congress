 Mr. Speaker, forgive my getting organized. The floor  has been moving a little faster than we expected.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to try a couple of things and try not to bore  everyone out of their minds over the next hour. Some of what I am going  to touch on is going to be a little technical. Part of it is really  cranky.   I have a number of different boards, and they are going to try to hit  different points in different orders. I will beg of staff, help me sort  of get them all stacked up right here, if we could.   First thing, I want to go to geek town for a moment. Just to put this  in perspective, I have come to this floor since January talking about  inflation. Now, how many of you remember the discussions we were all  having--actually, it would be more had at us--that inflation was  transitory. Now, they sort of apologize--the Federal Reserve, the  Treasury Secretary Yellen, hopefully the White House, though the White  House seems to be disconnected from reality--that it is not transitory.   If you saw the numbers that came out last Thursday, Friday, we have  something called structural. What does that mean to anyone? Does this  place even care to understand?   First, let's do the first bit of geeky. When you hear a discussion  that the yield curve is inverted, how many of you immediately reach  over to your television and say, ``Oh, God, I have the wrong channel  on,'' and turn it off? It is not that complicated. It is a way of  people using big words to try to sound smart.   Inverted yield curve just means, hey, I expect over the next 2 years  to have higher inflation so the value of my dollar goes down faster  than I do over the 10 years.   That means if I buy a 10-year bond, I might be willing to take an  interest rate here, but I expect inflation to be so high in the next 2  years, I want a higher interest rate because, theoretically, it is real  simple: When things take longer, you should have more risk and,  therefore, want a higher interest rate.   Why is this important to a conversation on the floor of the House? Go  look on your favorite financial website right now. The 2 years has a  higher interest rate than the 10 year. The 5 years has a higher  interest rate than a 10 year. The 7 year has a higher interest rate  than the 10 year. That is the markets telling you that they expect  inflation to be with us for years.   You also saw in the inflation report we received last week, you saw  my brothers and sisters on the left: Hey, energy prices are down--yay.  Oh, why is the core inflation so high?   Congratulations, you did it. Functionally, 30 years of substantial  stability in inflation, and we got ourselves a wage-price spiral. We  dumped, in March 2001, so much money into the economy that it set off  what is called a wage-price spiral. Wages go up; you have to raise your  prices. Well, if you raise your prices, you have to pay your workers  more. If you pay your workers more, you have to raise your prices.   What happens when that becomes embedded into the structure of the  economy and energy goes up and down? And how many of our friends on the  left keep saying, ``Well, it is Ukraine''? Of course, if you remove  energy prices, you still have inflation built into the core.                                time  1515    This is really, really horrible, dangerous, and brutal.   Does anyone here give a damn about poor people?   Does anyone here care about the working middle class?   Does anyone care about people trying to retire?   Mr. Speaker, you have got to understand the brutality.   Because where does that money go?   I am going to show some boards here. I represent the Phoenix- Scottsdale area. I have the highest inflation in the continental United  States. I am still trying to figure out why Alaska has an urban zone  that is higher than mine. But functionally I have the highest inflation  in the country.   If you live and work in my community and did not have a pay hike--I  am going to show it, and you are going to hear this multiple times--you  now work for a month and a half for free, Mr. Speaker.   This place functionally taxed you. One month and a half of your labor  has been stripped from you. And the money doesn't disappear. What  happens is your wages become worth less purchasing, but that wealth  transfer from you, Mr. Speaker, is actually a form of tax because the  $30 trillion over here of borrowed money your government has, actually  now it gets to be paid back with dollars of less value.   Whether you know it or not, Mr. Speaker, if you are my neighbor in  the Phoenix-Scottsdale area, you have been taxed out of a month and a  half of your wages. And thank you. You helped to actually buy down the  U.S. debt because borrowers benefit from inflation, but people trying  to save, people getting ready to buy a home, getting ready for  retirement, and people just trying to survive get crushed.   So if you had listened to the floor the last couple of days, Mr.  Speaker, how many times have you had someone come to this floor and  actually show they even care?   No. We will give some great speeches about: Hey, 50 illegal crossers  of our border got shipped to Martha's Vineyard. Ooh.   Come to my State. That is like every few minutes. I am a border  State. Come down to Yuma with me, Mr. Speaker, and let me show you what  the hell is actually going on.   But in Washington, D.C., I am still waiting for my brothers and  sisters on the left to come behind these microphones and apologize for,  functionally, what is the biggest tax in U.S. history. We are now  rivaling what happened to this country in the late seventies and very  early eighties, except the crisis is much more complex now.   Here is why: Yes, you had the wage spirals, the price spirals, and  the fuel spirals of the late seventies, but we had a beneficial  demographic. We had lots of available workers.   Today, we have this crazy thing going on where our available work  population because of our demographics--my fear is the Federal Reserve  is going to have to break the back of employment in this country to  squeeze out inflation.   Are we all ready for that?   Because we Republicans in this legislature and in this Congress have  come behind these mikes multiple times--I have introduced legislation  and said, Look, what is inflation?   Inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods.   You can do one of two things. You can squeeze the dollars out of  society so all that free money the Democrats gave away over the last  couple years will raise interest rates, pull liquidity out, and take it  away; or we could make more stuff.   I am going to show a couple of boards here of what has happened to  productivity in the last couple of quarters. We are crashing. Our  productivity is crashing. So when you do the fancy math, Mr. Speaker,  and you are not making more stuff, it means what the Federal Reserve is  going to have to do to us is more and more brutal. And I think actually  some of the markets are actually starting to wake up the last couple of  days and are starting to understand the malfeasance, the economic  malfeasance, of this place.   But then again, I sometimes wonder: Do I work with a bunch of people  who don't own a calculator or didn't show up to their high school  economics class?   Because this isn't that complicated.   We use big, fancy words. We do brilliant virtue signaling. But the  math is brutal, and I think we need to wake up when we saw what the  President did, what was it, on ``60 Minutes'' a couple of days ago. It  was a complete disconnect from what is happening to the middle class  and the poor going on in this country.   So let's actually use a few boards here just to try to provide some  textual facts to how this all works.  [[Page H8000]]    Now, I am just trying to make a point, and this is for myself. I  represent the Phoenix-Scottsdale area. Now we have the highest  inflation in the Nation. So maybe if you are in a community that, hey,  you only had 7 percent, my folks are breaking 13.   Try being a working family that is trying to survive in a world where  your purchasing power lost 13 percent and your rents are still going  up. Rents are eventually going to come down when the Federal Reserve  has started to break the back of employment. That may be as much as 18  months away. We are finally starting to see our home prices start to  tip a bit because a Firstrust first mortgage these days is now well  over 6 percent if it is a conforming loan.   But it is fascinating. It is also the communities that have had some  of the greatest economic prosperity because there are people moving  there who also seem to be suffering the highest inflation.   Mr. Speaker, let us start to actually look at some of the drivers.  This is July 21 to July 22.   Okay, energy, hey, it is 2.7 percent of that inflation. But start to  add in shelter, start to add in energy, and start to add in--and come  back up here and all the other things, and this is the stuff right  here, this, this, and food, just skip the energy portion, and that is  how we are making the argument. You saw it in the CPI data this last  week. It is now structural. It is now structural.    At some point, if I lose my mind, I am going to talk about what  happens now that the U.S. dollar is going up.   Remember, why is the U.S. dollar now starting to go up?   I know we are geeking out.   Our interest rates are going up. If you are in a country over here,  you can say, Hey, I can put money into a U.S. dollar-denominated bond  and get this high interest rate. I am going to pull my money out of  this country and put it over here.   Okay. So now there is a hunger to convert to dollars raising the  value of the dollar.   Okay. Do you understand we are now exporting our inflation around the  world? So the crappy economics this place did, now you are kicking the  rest of the world's head in.   So we also talk about how much we care about the poor and how much we  care about the poor around the world.   Does anyone understand here when we blow up our own economics, we  export our bad policy?   It is very much like when we did the tax reform at the very end of  2017, because we did so many things right and boosted economic growth  so substantially and GDP growth, and we lowered income inequality and  all these good things were happening here in the United States, the  World Bank actually raised worldwide GDP projections because when we  got our economics right, the rest of the world actually got less poor.   Well, now you are seeing the other side of the coin, Mr. Speaker.  When we get our economics wrong, we also export misery.   Mr. Speaker, some of these charts you have all seen before. I have  had them here on the floor, and it is just basically trying to show  what has happened. Just look at this line here. This is functionally  what is happening to your ability to afford things. And you will notice  it happened, functionally, almost the day this place had unified  leftist control, when the Democrats took control of the White House,  already had control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and  they pushed through their policies. You can almost see, hey, policies  change, and, yes, look at the time of the pandemic, but at least when  it came to your purchasing power and your ability to survive, it was  fairly stable.   This line coming down here, do you see that collapse?   That is thanks to you for Democrat policies.   We have been trying it. If anyone has a suggestion on a better way we  could do this, I am trying to visually come up with some way because we  are often engaged in sort of a malpractice here. We use big, fancy  words. We talk about, well, I have 13 percent inflation in my Phoenix  market.   I have been trying to find a way to describe what that actually means  to a working family. So that is where we came up with this concept of  saying: Do you realize how many days of your labor you have lost?   And then we have tried doing it where you also adjust it for what the  gasoline prices are.   How many days of labor do you lose for higher gasoline prices?   If anyone has a suggestion how graphically we can sort of show, here  is the labor you lost just because of higher fuel prices. But here is  the labor you lost just because of what has happened.   In my area it is air-conditioning prices. In your area, Mr. Speaker,  it might be heating. We are going to have a fun winter for those of you  who don't live in the desert.   But also our core inflation, we have been trying to do things like  show a calendar.   Is there another way you can help the American people understand the  stress they are feeling?   What is the old saying?   There is a lot more month left instead of cash at the end of the  month?   It is real, and it is pervasive.   There also needs to be an understanding. The inflation that this  place set off this last year will be part of our economics for a decade  or two.   So, Mr. Speaker, if you are the person thinking about retiring a  decade from now, I sure hope you are re-looking at everything you need  and how many dollars you have to set aside.   What is your housing? What is your healthcare?   Because you have got to also understand there are some inputs here.  So let's say the mean inflation in the country is 8, 9 percent.  Healthcare in the country is functionally running double that.   Mr. Speaker, are you ready to have your copay on your future  healthcare be doubled what it is today?   Because that is what is coming at you. So, yes, the Democrats have  pushed a subsidy bill on drug prices, but that doesn't cover the fact  that inflation is about to come and kick your head in. And, once again,  it is also reaching into the general fund, putting it over here. We are  going to borrow the money; we are going to try to find some way to tax  it from you or tax it from my kids.   You know the world has changed, Mr. Speaker. Let's see if I can  actually find some of these to make it a little easier.   But you start to realize when even the left-wing talking head  Democrat apologists who hold economics degrees are basically standing  up and talking about the misery the Democrat policies have brought to  this country.   So let's see. We have Jason Furman.   How many of us have ever seen Jason Furman say a single nice thing  about a Republican?   Of course not. He basically makes his living berating those of us on  the right and basically defending Democrat policies.   The math has gotten so ugly he can no longer defend what Democrats  have done to people in this country. The medium CPI excludes all of the  large changes in either direction and is a better predictor of labor  market slack.    Now, this is important, where I'm trying to get here. Jason Furman is  basically trying to help us understand that we are busting through a  9.5 percent annual rate in August, which is the single highest monthly  print in the datasets which started in 1983. I don't mean this to be  disjointed. I want it to sort of become crisp. The core of inflation is  functionally higher than any time it has been published since 1983.   Mr. Speaker, how old were you in 1983?   Do you remember the level of misery?   Congratulations. This is what the policies around this place did.   And then you get a clown who says, Oh, it is Ukraine. It is this and  that.   No, it is not. This stuff was in the futures market long before.   Mr. Speaker, do you remember a year ago September when the futures  markets in energies and those things were blowing off the charts?   That was telling you this was coming.   But that would require some economic literacy.   Look, I accept some of this is geeking out when you start to try to  do CPI and core CPI.   The simple point of a chart like this is it is not like, hey, we had  this huge fluctuation of fuel prices, but everything else was fairly  normal.   Sorry. It is not.  [[Page H8001]]    This is my Phoenix area.                                time  1530    When you start to realize that my folks are living with over 13  percent, it might be a reason why a lot of us from the West are  incredibly cranky because we are just now getting the announcements of  how much our electricity is going to be going up.   For the rest of you in the country--you know, we are about to hit our  lovely time of the year when the temperature comes down, and we are not  running our air conditioners. You are all getting ready to turn on your  heat.   Have all of you in the colder States, have you started to budget your  money for what is about to hit you in your heating bills? For my  brothers and sisters on the left, you better hope that it doesn't get  cold before the election day before your folks start to see their power  bills.   Just sort of making the point--food prices continue to increase with  food at home having the largest annual increase since the end of the  1970s. I was in high school in the late 1970s--I am willing to admit  it--and fashion was pretty horrible and inflation was worse.   I remember watching my President get up on television, wearing a  sweater, explaining that we were going to have to live poorer. I  remember this old guy running for President, who was actually  optimistic, saying, hey, if we open up our reserves and natural gas and  those things, we will live better.   That was also one of the great ironies that I think the oldest  candidate running for President, Ronald Reagan, had the biggest portion  of young people voting for him. It was because of optimism.   I desperately want to get behind this microphone and demonstrate  optimism. I have a 7-year-old and an 11-week-old--at my age--that is  being pathologically optimistic. I want my little boy and my little  girl to have an amazing American life. The American dream is not some  sort of piece of rhetoric to me, it is what we are structurally; it is  a gift we are given. The math is horrendous.   My 11-week-old son--that just came to us as a surprise--in 30 years,  he is entering sort of the beginning of his peak earning years, and the  United States will have--on today's dollars and today's math, without  inflation calculated in it--this is from CBO a couple weeks ago, and  they had not put long-term inflation into the math--$128 trillion of  borrowed money in today's dollars. That is $128 trillion borrowed money  in today's dollars.   So, of course, this place is fixated on how we are going to save that  next generation and how we are going to create economic prosperity and  economic growth because growth is moral.   Oh, sorry, I take that back. It is moral to some of us. Control,  power, voting out $4 trillion of borrowing since this White House and  since this unified Democrat government--with a stunning amount of that  money being transferred in subsidies to people that vote for them--and  they don't demonstrate even a hoot of caring for survival of people who  are going to be in retirement. And for these young people, that is  another Congress' problem.   If this place had a soul, we would be fixated day after day on what  we are going to do to make more stuff to bend inflation so the Federal  Reserve doesn't have to break the back of people's lives. Of a future  where instead of having the debate of--hey, ObamaCare, let's subsidize  things more, the Republican alternative, which was also a subsidy bill.  Screw that.   Why don't we do something that is rational? Maybe we should change  the price of healthcare, adopt technology, cure things. Look, I have  done dozens of presentations here on the economics of cures, the  economics of technology disruptions in healthcare. Yes, it means you  have to say ``no'' to armies of lobbyists.   It is also the only mathematical way I can find you save this place,  save this country, save this experiment, save little boy's economic  future, my little girl's future. We are not going to do it, because it  doesn't hand huge amounts of power and control to the left.   It is not a check from government to someone that is going to turn  around and write one political party a check. It is that cynical. What  do we do? We are going to watch cable television for a couple days,  complain about 50 migrants who illegally crossed into the country  showing up in Martha's Vineyard because that is easy to understand and  it is good television.   The same day--you got how much poorer that day because of inflation.  You got that much closer to Social Security having no money left in the  trust fund. That $128 trillion I just mentioned to you, every dime from  the $30 trillion borrowing we are at today to the $128 trillion--the  model says every dime of that increased borrowing--75 percent is  Medicare, 25 percent is Social Security, and the rest of the budget is  in balance.   Okay. The problem is right in front of us. Let's do something bold  and fix Social Security. Except the Social Security proposals around  her are absurd. There are some things we can do where you don't do  taxes in a mechanism where you actually slow the economy down, and  therefore, lose much of the economic growth you were trying to fix to  be able to have revenues in FICA.   Then the revolution I have talked about so many times here on the  floor of disruption of cure diseases. I don't mean this to sound like a  non sequitur, but it ties in. Diabetes is basically a third of all  healthcare spending. Type 2 is really complex, some genetic, a lot of  it lifestyle, but we help fund it through how we do the farm bill and  other things.   We know there has been a breakthrough, it is only like a half a dozen  people, and it is very short-term, so we don't have the longer  latitudinal data, who have been cured of type 1.   Think about the hundreds of billions of dollars this place basically  was handing out--that we all know we are going to be here a year or two  from now holding hearings on how much was stolen, wasted, handed out to  political cronies, and favoritism. Could you imagine if we took a  fraction of those dollars, and said: Well, diabetes is 31 percent of  all Medicare spending, it is 33 percent of all healthcare spending,  maybe having the revolution of a cure there--really hard.    Oh, by the way, it is also the single biggest thing you can do for  U.S. sovereign debt and the future economic growth of the country. It  turns out when we look at poverty--the number of our brothers and  sisters who are really below the poverty line--I have some Members hear  that say, oh, it is racism. Oh, it is education.   It turns out health may be the number one component. Grandma just had  her foot cut off because of diabetes. What does that do to the entire  family structure's ability to participate in the economy? Maybe the  moral discussion--I represent a Tribal community that has the second  highest per capita diabetes in the world. Number one is right down the  street; it is the sister Tribe.   If you actually cared--having the disruptive conversation of, screw  it, we are going to find a way to have this health revolution because  it is great economics. It is also moral. It is compassionate. It is  loving. And saying that we are going to build one more clinic--we are  going to build more clinics. That is compassion? We are going to help  teach you how to live with your misery when there is a path for a cure?   It is just that optimism that should be part of the ethos of what we  are. Maybe it doesn't raise us political money. Maybe it is not good  campaigns. Maybe it is beyond our intellectual comprehension around  here. God knows, the intellectual gravitas of this place has just  almost become trite when you hear the debates and discussions we have  on the floor.   The economics are sound. The compassion is noble. And it is actually  the right thing to do. Yet, I can't tell you--I have been doing this  for a few years now--the poor staff here who has had to listen to these  speeches and watch me hold up these boards and then try to scribe it  down--which I apologize when I do the machine gun talking.   There is a path here. I am trying to find a couple of the slides that  are just terrifying me right now. I accept the media--excuse me, the  Democrat propagandas--media, same thing--don't want to talk about  inflation and what it does to people. Don't want to talk to what it  does to retirees and young couples and those things because it is not  going to help their friends win.   But maybe understanding it--maybe actually having it be written about  in  [[Page H8002]]  a moral aspect, a moral discussion of what we are doing to working  families in this country might actually get some of us off our heinies  to come here and do things, saying, hey, you do realize there is policy  we can engage in.   Naming a piece of legislation the Inflation Reduction Act, when it  does no such thing. When it comes back being scored as, hey, you know,  several years from now it is still borrowing money. The way the  Democrats were scoring, saying, well, we get inflation reduction by  taxing people and yanking money out of the economy by lowering  productivity and taking their money away. Oh, by the way, all the  savings ended in the future years, and it is all gimmicks.   That is not me talking. That is actually liberal groups that were  scoring the bill that were outraged on the fake economics. You start  looking at this growing divergence, the split of inflation in metro  areas and other parts of the country.   San Francisco where you now have people abandoning it has only about  5.7 percent inflation. Where they are coming to, places like my  community, I am busting through 13. Can you see why I'm concerned?   I am looking for a chart. My fear is I don't have it here, it may be  in the piles over there.   There was data out about 10 days ago talking about productivity. Now  who knows what productivity is?   Okay. The way they do the model, you know, the people that score  this, they basically say, hey, we have this many workers and those  workers produce this many units of production. Okay. And we have been  doing this modeling for a very long time. It is really good for the  economy when a worker actually produces more every day than they did  the day before. That is not just because, hey, they made the production  line go faster, it is because we got the tax code, right, so they did  investments.   One of the amazing things that happened after the 2017 tax reform is  we did something called expensing it. Now, part of that expensing you  actually got to take--I am going to geek out--the last quarter of 2017.  So that is why there is this sudden lift in the end of 2017, even  before the tax reform was done because we did something  retrospectively.   Then the next couple years, boom, you saw all this capital coming  back in from the rest of the world because we fixed the international  repatriation incentives to bring money back to the country. Then we  said, if you go buy a piece of equipment that will make you faster,  better, cleaner, more productive, we are going to let you--instead of  depreciating it over the next decade, we are going to let you take it  on day one.   Yes, we take a big hit today on tax receipts, but--eventually that  was going to happen on the tax receipts, it just happens over a longer  time, but we take it today--here is the catch, we get a sudden pop of  productivity. So there is more economic activity and that new step up  in activity means we get more tax revenues in the next couple years.                                time  1545    Guess what happened in speech after speech of our brothers and  sisters on the left? This is a giveaway to the rich. It is a giveaway  to the big corporations. I have quotes from a half dozen Members,  senior Democrat Members here, who told us we were going to go into  depression because of what the Republicans did in tax reform.   Guess what happened? Within a year, the poor started getting less  poor. The middle class got much more prosperous. Income inequality  started to shrink. Food insecurity shrank. Corporate tax receipts grew.   How is that possible? Because it turns out that getting the tax and  regulatory code meant investment in things that made us more  productive.   When you make society more productive, what are the two ways you get  paid more? Inflation, which just means you are getting compensated for  really bad public policy. The dollar is worth less, so we are going to  pay you more so you just hold even. When your paycheck goes up for  inflation, you didn't gain anything.   The other thing economics tells you is you pay people more because  they are being more productive, and that productivity is absolutely  necessary if we are going to survive our demographic curve, if we are  going to make our promises on Social Security and Medicare.   You have to understand that all this has to work together. You have  to do everything from immigration policy to environmental policy to tax  policy to regulatory policy. You have to get all these things right.  Instead, we are going just to do the try it around here, and we are  going to do great virtue signaling.   Why this board is important is the quarters now where we are starting  to see Democrat policy kick in, we are having an absolute crash of  productivity. So, you are saying, but we have all these people working.  Okay, but the math is the math.   They may be working, but something is going on out there. Maybe this  is the phasing out of the expensing, which was part of tax reform. Some  on our side are trying to make it permanent; Democrats oppose it. But  this is really bad. You need this to look very different.   Even if you just cared about inflation, productivity is one of your  cures. If you get someone here who says Congress doesn't have  influence, this is about monetary supply, and it is the Federal  Reserve, yes, it is.   My argument is when we pump out spending that is going to require  borrowing, and the Federal Reserve basically acts like our daddy who  indemnifies us from really stupid policy and buys up our debt, we are  functionally creating monetary policy by our profligate spending.   Instead of putting those dollars into things that change  productivity, change people's ability to survive and have wealth and  economically grow and, therefore, bend the inflation curve, we did just  the opposite. We handed out money at one point to encourage people to  stay home.   Somewhere here I think I have the Larry Summers chart. Remember a  couple of years ago, Larry Summers was, like, an absolute hero of the  left, great academics, well spoken, well respected, and then he made  the sin of saying: Please don't do this. Dumping another $1.9 trillion  on the economy when you are not asking people to either step up their  skills or actually participate in the economy, please don't do this.   All of a sudden, the left, as they do because he didn't engage in  sort of the theater of virtue signaling, turned on him. Oh, he is evil.  He is bad. Well, it turns out, he was right.   The amount of misery these crappy economics have created to people in  this country, the number of people who are poorer--one of the projects  we are working on in our office is, in a decade, the Social Security  trust fund runs out of money, 12\1/2\ years. We haven't calculated in  the inflationary cycle yet. That wasn't part of the trustees' report.   Let's say this place continues to do what it does, which is nothing,  and we don't fix it. With the cost of everything being higher, even  though you have the Social Security COLAs, you have to still pay your  healthcare copays, which are inflation doubled, at double the rate. You  may be heading toward doubling the number of senior Americans who are  in poverty.   The number of Members here who are getting behind the microphone and  saying, ``Oh, this is just transitory. It is Putin's tax hike. It is  the evil oil companies.'' No. It is crappy policy. Larry Summers and  others told you it was. They told you this was coming. You are trying  to continue to virtue signal or blame other people.   Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains.    I will do my very best not to use up that time.   I am not even sure I should do this one to all of you. We will come  back to that previous one and see if we can make it make more sense.   Let's see. The left has been in control here for, what are we, about  18 months? Since President Biden was sworn in, off the top of your  head, before looking at the slide, how much has been added to the  deficit? Under unified Democrat control, how much have we borrowed?   Remember, you have a President who almost gleefully gets behind a  microphone and says, I have lowered. Well,  [[Page H8003]]  that is because some of the borrowing during the pandemic was insane.  We borrowed $4.8 trillion, and here are some of the things: the rescue  plan, the omnibus, you know.   You start to add in just the growth of spending, and then what is  fascinating is we are now finally starting to see some of these charts  that have interest. It is one of the reasons I wanted to touch on that.   You do realize our borrowing costs today have almost doubled.  Actually, I think they have more than doubled since the day President  Biden was sworn in.   There is a model out there that says if you had a 2-point higher  interest rate on U.S. sovereign debt over--functionally, I think the  model was 25 years, 2 points higher. We are 2-plus points higher right  now. But if that were to be sustained for about 25 years, at the end of  that 25 years, every dime of tax receipts from this government pays  nothing but interest.    Now, back to the slide where I was fixated on productivity and  economic growth. Are you getting the pitch? If we would stop the clown  show and start to fixate on things that help people--and is helping  people really Republican or Democrat, because this place isn't doing  it. We subsidize people. We sure hand out a hell of a lot of checks,  but almost none of that makes society healthier and more productive.   There is a path. When you start to see things like this and realize  when we factor in the new interest rates, the amount of just the  financing, just the financing on $4.8 trillion of additional borrowing  we have done in--what?--the last 18 months, when the 2 year today was  in--what?--3 and a half, still going up.   Why isn't there a sense of worry around here? I mean, you all walk  around with these cell phones. You know, there are calculators on them.   This was just an attempt--and I know the slide is noisy. We were just  trying to work in the components of GDPNow. Let's see if I can make  this make sense.   If you are crazy enough to have been watching this, there is an app  you can go to right now and download it from the Atlanta Federal  Reserve. It is called GDPNow.   What they try to do is take datasets as they come out, and it is a  formula. It is pure math. This isn't like the New York Fed, which  actually does attitudinal things and sort of purchasing attitudes and  savings attitudes. GDPNow is just cold, hard math.   This was an attempt to try to show, hey, here are some of the  components. GDPNow is a real GDP calculator. What is going on, because  as you know, GDP in the first quarter came in negative, but there were  genuinely some timing and some energy effects on that one.   But GDPNow in the second quarter came in negative, and that one was-- well, it looks like it is structural. As of about 2 hours ago, the  GDPNow web app you can put on your phone--a couple of weeks ago, they  thought this quarter was going to be about a 2\1/2\ percent growth  rate, which would have been nice. It sort of meant, hey, the fall of  economic expansion looks like it had bent and was coming back up.   As of a couple of hours ago, now it has fallen all the way down to  0.3 with negative bias, meaning these inputs that the Atlanta Fed is  using continue to fall.   I am going to predict we are heading into a third negative GDP  quarter.   Now, are we going to have the same argument that we had last quarter?  Well, technically, two negative quarters is not a recession.  Technically, we have this little committee over here, and they decide  if it is a recession. So, we spent a week trying to decide: Should we  call it a recession? Should we say we are not in a recession?   My attitude was: Who cares? How about we do something that would be  much more compassionate? Let's go talk to the family down the street  that is just trying to survive and ask them how they are doing.   I am going to get up here and geek out on the components that  actually go into a GDP calculator. My real request is this place  functionally start to understand the crappy policies we have made the  last 18 months.   We can reverse course. We can do things policy-wise that get economic  growth, get productivity, produce hydrocarbons, produce the things that  are components for prosperity, or we can continue to functionally  export misery, not only throughout our country but throughout the  world, because that is what we have done.   Be prepared. In a couple of weeks, you are going to find out we have  had another quarter of negative growth. We are going to have the press  and the Democrats say: Oh, but that is not a real definition of  recession. That is a committee over here. Let's talk about migrants  being shipped to, you know.   Instead, we will do everything we can to understand the scale of the  economic dislocations that policy around here has done in the last year  and a half.   Understand, Republicans: We are going to take the majority of this  House this November. My math, from what I can see policy-wise, even if  we controlled everything, it is going to take years to fix.   Remember the opening here? I tried to explain something, and that was  called the yield curve. When you have an inverted yield curve, what  does it mean? It is not that complicated.   My 2-year T bill, I give you money to hold a 2-year Treasury bond,  full faith and credit of you, the taxpayers, or a 5 year, a 7 year. All  those are paying higher interest rates than if you bought a 10 year.   That lets you know the markets now believe inflation is here for  years and years. The data on these boards now says inflation is here  for years and years.   How much policy do you see coming from our brothers and sisters in  the majority demonstrating they care enough to actually take on the  misery, or are we just going to engage in the political theater, the  virtue signaling, to survive the next election cycle?   Madam Speaker pro tempore, I apologize for the discombobulation of  not having the boards set up.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
