 Mr. Speaker, West Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine,  Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska,  Vermont, and Wyoming. During President Biden's first year in office,  the number of illegal immigrants that the Border Patrol has encountered  on our southern border has surpassed the population of these 12 States  and the end is nowhere in sight.   I am not sure if the Biden administration knew that their policies  would lead to the number of illegal immigrants surpassing the  population of over 20 percent of U.S. States, but by reversing the  successful policies of the previous administration, they have created  this crisis.   This administration has listened to special interest groups over the  will of the American people. This administration has implemented catch- and-release policies. This administration has canceled the remain in  Mexico policy, and on his very first day in office, President Biden  issued an executive order ending border wall funding.   This administration has turned their back on every State of the Union  to pursue a far-left agenda. This administration has created a new  State of chaos in our Nation with their failed policies. It is time for  us to reverse course and to return to commonsense policies that work  and that protect our Nation's borders.                                time  1115                           Remembering Our Veterans     Former President Ronald Reagan once said: ``Veterans know  better than anyone else the price of freedom, for they've suffered the  scars of war. We can offer them no better tribute than to protect what  they have won for us.''   Today, we remember the service of our veterans, the price they have  paid and the Nation that they helped build and fought to protect.   We know that America's veterans risked their lives on the field of  battle to preserve this Nation and the ideals of democracy, liberty,  and freedom.   But we must not forget that they not only fought to protect the  rights that were established by our Founding Fathers, but they also  returned home to set an example of enduring patriotism and leadership  in our communities, our States, and our Nation.   When their service ended, our veterans helped advance our country by  embodying the American spirit of hard work and perseverance.   Today, we thank them for the example they set.   This day, more than any other, let every American reach out to a  veteran and say: Thank you for your service; we are grateful for your  many sacrifices that you have made on behalf of our Nation.   As we stand in this great institution of democracy that our veterans  helped build and then fought to preserve, let our Nation remember the  hundreds of thousands of men and women who fought for our freedoms, and  let us always remember that our Nation would have been forgotten to  history long ago if not for those men and women brave enough to protect  it.   May God bless our country, and may God bless our veterans.                            ____________________
