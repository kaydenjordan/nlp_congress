 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel, Chairman McCaul, and  Mr. Smith, and have a deep sense of gratitude to Congressman Schiff for  introducing H. Res. 296; and to my sister, my Armenian sister,  Congresswoman Eshoo, for helping us plot this strategy to get this bill  to the floor.   April 24, 1915, is a day that lives in infamy in the hearts and minds  of millions of Armenians worldwide. It is a day that I grew up  understanding from my Armenian mother to be one of the darkest in  history. It is the day that the Ottoman Government embarked on a  systematic slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians, two-thirds of the  Armenian population.   This genocide is recognized in countries around the world, including  Canada, France, and Germany. It is recognized in 49 States in our Union  as the first genocide of the 20th century, yet the House of  Representatives hasn't recognized both that the genocide occurred and  that the Ottoman Empire perpetrated it.   Elie Weisel once called denying genocide--and in particular, the  Armenian genocide--a double killing, because it not only exterminates a  group of people, it murders the memory of that crime. Congress must  ensure that memory is not destroyed and those lives are honored.   As a child, I listened to my mom speak of the atrocity with pain and  fear. She is gone now, but her pain lives on in me to this very day.   By righting this terrible wrong, one that has festered for far too  long, we are alleviating that pain and sending a message that history  can't be rewritten. We are stating, in no uncertain terms, that America  will no longer abandon Armenians with feeble excuses made for a so- called ally. We are affirming that truth is truth.   Thousands of documents totaling 37,000 pages in the National Archives  support the truth: Armenians were exterminated by Ottoman forces and  Turkish sympathizers.   In 1918, former President Theodore Roosevelt sent a letter saying:         Because the Armenian massacre was the greatest crime of the       war, failure to act against Turkey is to condone it and means       that all talk of guaranteeing future peace is nonsense.    Usually, these words serve as a general warning, but today they apply  to specific ongoing atrocities. We must not stand silent as Turkey  attempts the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds in Syria.   Even Russia's President Putin had said the Armenian people ``went  through one of the greatest tragedies in human history.''   Iran's former Vice President stated: ``The Ottoman Turkey Government  perpetrated genocide in 1915.''   If our rivals can talk about this, if they can take a stand,  certainly we can.   Armenian genocide, we must say it here: It happened, and it will  never happen again. We must make that commitment.
