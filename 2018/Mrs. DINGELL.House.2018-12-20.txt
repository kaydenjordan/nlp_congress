 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7328, and  I thank all of my colleagues for the very hard work that has gone into  this.   This important bill reauthorizes the Pandemics and All-Hazards  Preparedness Act, and it also gives the FDA revenue and authority to  improve their oversight of the over-the-counter drugs.   Although the hour is late, I am very glad we are sending this bill to  the Senate today, and I urge my colleagues to quickly pass this bill  before the 115th Congress expires. I know we all want it to expire, but  we can do some good things before it does.   Today, 60 percent of all medicines sold in the U.S. are over the  counter; yet the FDA has only 18 full-time employees overseeing that  entire market. That is not reflective of the way that our healthcare  systems run, and it is putting patients at risk every single day.   Our bill reforms the system for the better by creating a new user fee  program to give the FDA resources it needs to improve public health,  and it allows the agency to update OTC monographs by administrative  order rather than the ineffective rulemaking process we have been  watching. This will be a big win for patients, who will benefit from  the improved safety of their products, as well as the industry, as they  will have a reliable pathway to bring new, innovative products to  market. We haven't seen a new sunscreen on the market in more than a  decade.   I want to thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in  the Energy and Commerce Committee for all of the time and the effort  they put into this legislation. I especially want to thank Kim Trzeciak  of the committee staff for all of her hard work.   Let's get this done before we go home for the holidays. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 7328.
