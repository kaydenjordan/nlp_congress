 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I first want to start by associating  myself with the remarks of my chairwoman and suggest to this body that  it is time for Congress to begin to govern and run the day-to-day  operation of the Government of the United States in a timely fashion.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third iteration of the fiscal year 2018  Defense Appropriations Act that has been brought to the floor. I, for  one, have  [[Page H720]]  nothing more to say about the merits of this legislation that would not  be redundant. However, I do want to reiterate my profound respect for  the exceptional work that has been put into this legislation, time and  time again, by Chairwoman Granger, all of the members of our  subcommittee, and our superlative staff.   Today, January 30, 2018, Congress is 122 days late. We are 122 days  past the start of the current fiscal year and 122 days past the time  that the legislation we are considering today for the third time should  have been completed, conferenced, and signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, we have a number problem. As an appropriator, I ask for  a number to craft a bill that, by law, does not violate the Budget  Control Act. We need a number so that Chairwoman Granger, our  subcommittee members, and I can make decisions on how best to move  forward so our military leaders are not hindered and forced to comply  with the constraints of continuing resolutions. As an appropriator, all  I want is a number. Give us a number, and we will finish our work for  this fiscal year and give the certainty that has been repeatedly asked  for by the Department of Defense and our 17 intelligence agencies.   Unfortunately, operating under the fourth continuing resolution and  passing essentially the same Defense Appropriations measure for a third  time does nothing--nothing--to solve the number problem, nor does it  remedy the slight inconvenience that this bill exceeds the Budget  Control Act by $35 billion.   Today's legislation does recognize this inconvenience by obviating  sequestration. I guess that is what passes as budget control in these  days in this Congress.   Some may say that we must pass this bill today to support our men and  women in uniform. I would respond by saying that today's 60 minutes of  theater continues to avoid meaningfully addressing the needs of our  troops. If we were serious about that, we would have solved our number  problem and allowed the chair and ranking member of the full committee,  and the subcommittee chairs and ranking members of all 12 committees,  to negotiate a realistic budget figure last summer so that we could  have completed our bill last September. That would be helping our  troops.   I would also add that if we don't agree to an overall domestic  discretionary number, then we will continue to disinvest in the true  security of this Nation--our people.   We need a domestic number so we can make decisions and give direction  to all Federal agencies so they can plan on how to best invest in our  national economy, jobs, and the health and prosperity of our people.  The International Trade Commission needs direction so they can fully  enforce our trade laws. Customs and Border Protection needs direction.  This government needs timely decisions and certainty.   According to the Department of Defense, 71 percent of people aged 17  to 24 years of age in the United States would fail to qualify for  military enlistment because of physical or mental health issues, low  educational scores, or major criminal convictions. General Joseph  Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has testified that  the strength of the United States military is a direct reflection of  the strength of U.S. society.   I would propose that improving the strength of our country is not  just a robust defense number that I desperately want. We need a robust  domestic number that allows for the critical investments necessary for  the success of our economy, the creation of jobs, and for the people of  this country.   Our number problem is solvable. Give us a negotiated budget number so  we can stop wasting everybody's time and the money of the American  taxpayers. Then we can truly start supporting the strength of our  national security, our troops, and our national economy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Lowey), who is the ranking member on the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member on the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and a member of the  Defense Subcommittee.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development, and Related Agencies, and also a member of the  Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 30 seconds.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), my friend and a senior member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member on the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would simply close at the point where I began and ask  the Members of this institution at large--the United States Congress,  both Houses--to please give the Appropriations Committees numbers for  defense and discretionary spending so that under the leadership of  Chairman Frelinghuysen and Mrs. Lowey, in this case under Chairwoman  Granger, myself, and the other 11 subcommittees, we can finish our  work. It is less than 2 weeks before we will begin fiscal year 2019. I  would ask my colleagues to please give us those numbers so that we can  do our work effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
