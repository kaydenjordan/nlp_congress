 Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to J. Michael  Keeling, a lifelong advocate for employee retirement benefits who  believed in creating engaged workforces through Employee Stock  Ownership Plans, or ESOPs.   A proud graduate of Harvard and the University of Texas School of  Law, and a lifelong student of history, Mr. Keeling's support of ESOPs  began in the 1970s when he served as chief of staff for former  Congressman J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle, an ardent supporter of these plans.   When Mr. Keeling joined the ESOP Association, he distinguished  himself as an outstanding advocate and lawyer on behalf of employees  and their companies seeking to establish Employee Stock Ownership Plans  during the 1980s.   In 1991, after serving as general counsel to the organization, Mr.  Keeling was chosen by the ESOP Association's board of directors to lead  its operations as president and chief staff officer. It was during his  distinguished 28-year tenure in this position that many important  achievements benefitting thousands of businesses and millions of  employee owners took place.   Thanks to his efforts, the ESOP Association developed a nationwide  network of chapters facilitating education, training, and networking  among employee owners. These local groups help hundreds of companies  better engage their employee owners and successfully navigate the often  complex regulations guiding ESOPs.   Recognizing that good policy is predicated on good data, Mr. Keeling  worked with the ESOP Association to establish the Employee Ownership  Foundation to fund research on the economic and personal effects of  ESOPs and broad-based employee ownership. Since its inception in 1997,  the foundation has donated millions of dollars to fund academic  research. Its support was the key factor in establishing the first  academic center devoted specifically to employee ownership: the  Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing, at  Rutgers University.   Thanks to foundation-funded research, as a nation we now have clear  evidence that companies with employee stock ownership are much more  likely to withstand difficult economic times, more likely to invest in  employee training, and are far less likely than conventionally owned  firms to lay off employees. The foundation also has funded the academic  study of dozens of fellows and researchers interested in employee  ownership and its role in the U.S. economy.   During his tenure at the ESOP Association, Mr. Keeling visited nearly  600 ESOP companies. The breadth of insight he gained, coupled with his  deep understanding of ERISA and tax law, made him a uniquely credible  voice in the retirement plan community.   Mr. Keeling is retiring from his role as head of the ESOP Association  this year, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his  longterm, passionate efforts to preserve and advance the retirement  benefits of millions of working Americans.                            ____________________
