 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Jane  Goff, a lifelong educator who will be retiring from the Colorado State  Board of Education after 12 years as a representative from the Seventh  Congressional District. Jane's dedication to education for Colorado  made a significant impact, which will last for years to come.   A native of Colorado, Jane graduated from Jefferson County Public  Schools, where she would later spend 34 years as a French and Spanish  teacher. She served on the Jeffco PTA Board of Directors and is  president of the Jefferson County Education Association.   After the Columbine High School tragedy, Jane was frequently  consulted on school safety and crisis response, providing a teacher's  perspective to a variety of local, State, and national audiences.   After retirement from Jefferson County Public Schools, Jane was  elected to the Colorado State Board of Education in 2008 and reelected  in 2014. She served as a member of the National Association of State  Boards of Education for 3 years before being elected president of that  association in 2014.   Jane has worked side-by-side with students, educators, and me to help  improve outcomes for students and our entire community. She leaves a  lasting legacy for Colorado students, and she will be dearly missed on  the Colorado State Board of Education.   Jane, thank you for your friendship, your partnership, and your  service to public education and to the State of Colorado.  [[Page H5644]]                                ____________________
