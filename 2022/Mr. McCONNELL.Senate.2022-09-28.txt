 Mr. President, first, this morning, the Senate and the  entire country are watching the news and praying for the people of the  great State of Florida, where a seemingly massive, massive hurricane is  poised to make landfall soon. I understand the current forecast  suggests that Hurricane Ian may be both extremely powerful and  unusually slow-moving, a terrible combination for the citizens and  communities in its path.   Our colleague the senior Senator from Florida reported this morning  that State officials and the relevant Federal Agencies have been  working well together and that, thus far, every request Florida has  made of the Federal Government has been approved. The bipartisan  government funding bill the Senate is on track to pass this week will  ensure that the Federal Disaster Relief Fund is fully resourced at this  critical moment.   We are all keeping the people of Florida at the forefront of our  thoughts and will stand ready to help our colleagues from Florida, the  Governor, and local officials however we can.                            Continuing Resolution    Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter, the path to  keeping the government open and funded has been clear for weeks now.  The solution was always going to be a clean, bipartisan continuing  resolution, negotiated by Senators Shelby and Leahy, without any  unrelated, partisan language jammed in. Our Democratic colleagues tried  to complicate things by jamming in a phony, partisan figleaf on the  subject of permitting reform.   Republicans strongly support real, substantive permitting reform. We  are actually leading that charge. Senator Capito has an outstanding  bill that would make significant changes to make it easier to build  things in our country, create jobs in our country, and unleash domestic  energy in our country.   The problem was that the Schumer-Manchin language was not actual  permitting reform by any stretch. It was a phony figleaf. It was  designed to create the illusion of progress while sapping the political  will to tackle the issue in any meaningful way. The Democrats carefully  tailored the bill to avoid making any--any--impactful changes to  permitting laws. In fact, we had panicked State-level elected officials  from around the country writing the Senate to explain how the  Democrats' bill would actually make the existing problems even worse.  Fortunately, the Senate saw through the political game, and the phony  figleaf didn't have the votes.   So I am glad that our colleagues capitulated and abandoned their  phony figleaf. I look forward to a bipartisan funding bill coming to  the floor this week, and I hope our Democratic colleagues will push the  liberal special interests aside and let actual, robust permitting  reform become law someday soon.                             Biden Administration    Mr. President, on another matter, 2 years ago, the American people  elected a President who claimed he would govern as a uniting moderate.  In underscoring that mandate, voters gave him unusually small  coattails--the slimmest possible majority--in Congress.   The all-Democratic government inherited an economy that was, by every  account, already primed and ready for economic recovery. Vaccines were  already flooding the country. A major bipartisan stimulus had just  passed, literally, days earlier. And remember, before the temporary  COVID shot, years of Republican policies had our economic fundamentals  humming along with low inflation, low unemployment, and robust growth,  an outstanding trifecta for working families. To put it as plainly as  possible, the Democrats had one job: Just don't mess things up.   But, alas, fast-forward to today.   Overall inflation is a staggering 13.2 percent since President Biden  and his party came into power; consumer prices--through the roof;  supply chain chaos left and right; the worst single year for both  grocery inflation and electricity inflation since the fallout back in  the Jimmy Carter era. The stock market has plummeted below where it was  when President Biden took office, cutting the value of Americans'  retirement savings just as the cost of living has soared. America's  real wages--our citizens' buying power after inflation--is lower today  than it was the moment President Biden put his hand on the Bible.   The Democrats asked for total control. They got total control, and  they created a total disaster. The net effect of this far-left policy  experiment has been the equivalent of all-out economic warfare against  the American middle class. But alas, Democrats hardly seem to even much  less care.    The same day the latest sky-high monthly inflation report came out,  our colleagues literally headed down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White  House for a folk music concert--folk music concert--celebrating  additional hundreds of billions they had just dumped--dumped--into  ``green'' energy subsidies.   Do you know who isn't partying? Working families in Wisconsin who are  paying a ``Democratic Inflation Tax'' averaging $673 every single month  just to tread water. In Georgia, that is $681 every month and in  Colorado, $953 every month.   None of this had to happen. It didn't have to happen. Democrats were  literally warned in advance that their plans for far-left reckless  spending would send inflation through the roof and crush normal  Americans.   So what did our colleagues do? One gigantic party-line spending bill  in 2021, another huge, reckless taxing and spending spree just this  past summer, and student loan socialism that has cashiers and  carpenters eating the graduate school debt of doctors and lawyers. It  adds up to nearly $3 trillion of party-line waste--$3 trillion of  party-line waste. And it adds up to 13.2 percent inflation and  counting.   So Democrats wanted one-party control of Washington; they got it.  They promptly used that power to create a literal nightmare for  American families.                           Tribute to John Calipari    Mr. President, now one final matter, in my home State of Kentucky,  college basketball ranks up there with horseracing as one of our  signature pastimes. Our greatest players have become local heroes. Our  greatest seasons have become local legends. So it is no surprise, then,  that our basketball coaches are larger-than-life figures.   Plenty of notable ones have passed through the halls of our  universities. But the University of Kentucky's John Calipari--Coach Cal  to most of us--is already one for the history books.   Of course, there is his record with the program: 365 wins, 4 Final  Four appearances, and a National Championship.   There is also his record of public service. During the past 13 years  with UK, Coach Cal has leveraged his position in the public eye to  transform the face of charitable giving in Kentucky. In recognition of  his work, the organization Multiplying Good presented Coach Cal with  their Jefferson Award for public service this year. Previous recipients  of this prestigious award include Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, Colin  Powell. Coach Cal is the first men's college basketball coach to  receive the honor.   Sometimes Coach Cal's efforts are local. Every Thanksgiving, he helps  folks around Lexington enjoy the family meal they deserve. Every  Christmas, he gathers presents for children in need. But sometimes,  Coach Cal's efforts touch every corner of the Commonwealth. As Kentucky  reeled from  [[Page S5118]]  multiple crises in the past few years, his assistance has proved  invaluable.   During the pandemic, he helped Fayette County students access the  resources they needed to continue their schooling from home.   When tornadoes hit Western Kentucky last winter, he rallied  Kentuckians to raise money through a telethon. And when heavy rainfall  and floods damaged communities in Eastern Kentucky this summer, he did  the same, pulling our State together to help victims rebuild. In  total--in total--Coach Cal's telethons have raised more than $12  million for charitable ventures in Kentucky and across the world.   So thank you. Thank you, Coach Cal, for your service to our State.  And congratulations on receiving this distinguished award.
