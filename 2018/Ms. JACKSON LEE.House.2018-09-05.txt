 Mr. Speaker, 1 minute is really not enough time, but  I really wanted to highlight, as quickly as I can, some crucial issues  that we have experienced over the work recess.   First of all, I condemn the actions of Saudi Arabia as it relates to  the bombing of the two or at least one bus of children. I believe the  United States should address this question immediately, for children  are our most precious resource.   I am concerned that now 497 children still remain without their  families at the border, that 300 of those parents have been deported,  and most of the children are under 5. This is inhumane, cruel. And it  is, of course, the most tragic act that this Federal Government could  have done. I ask the Trump administration immediately to respond.   Listening to the hearings of Justice Kavanaugh, let me indicate that  there is no comment on the character of the man, but there is a comment  on the appointment. And that appointment involves an individual, the  President of the United States, who is under investigation, and, also,  the papers that are needed have not been provided.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me indicate that I note that the State  Department and the Defense Department decided to cut the funding for  Pakistan. Pakistan is a nation that we should attempt to continue  negotiations and diplomacy, and we should recognize that those military  dollars are important for the fight against terrorism. These things  should be taken up on behalf of the American people.                            ____________________
