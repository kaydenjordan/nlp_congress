 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 477, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, which impedes the ability of  businesses and employers to fill in-demand jobs.  [[Page H409]]    Legislation deserves a proper, thorough, and bipartisan examination,  which is why the House has long established procedures to do just that.  Those procedures respect the majority and minority and ensure that both  sides are represented.   Democrats are ignoring these procedures and bringing this bill  straight to the floor, steamrolling the committee of jurisdiction. Time  and again Speaker Pelosi has shown more interest in ``our way or the  highway'' governing than upholding the deliberative process of the  people's House.   Rushing a bill to the House floor without committee consideration  simply because we have gaveled in a new Congress and need something to  fill the time on the floor isn't a sustainable path forward under any  circumstances. This is particularly frustrating considering the  bipartisan agreement that our Nation's apprenticeship system needs to  be updated to provide more opportunities for hardworking Americans.   H.R. 447 closes pathways to work for students and job seekers at a  time when our Nation is in desperate need of getting more Americans  back to work. In recent years, steps were taken to increase the number  of high-quality apprenticeships and introduce innovation into work- based learning programs. For example, the Trump administration created  Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, IRAPs, which provide  another avenue for companies seeking skilled workers who want to  develop programs with more input from other industry leaders rather  than from the Federal Government.   Democrats like to say that IRAPs are ``untried'' or ``untested.''  Other words for that are ``new'' and ``innovative.''   This bill would take away opportunities for the 131 IRAPs that have  been recognized in the last 4 months, the vast majority of which are  for nursing credentials. Limiting nursing credentials during a global  pandemic is idiotic.   By prohibiting these innovative programs, the bill assumes that a  registered program that worked for one employer will meet the diverse  needs of every business across the country, regardless of size or  industry.   In fiscal year 2019, 252,000 individuals entered apprenticeships, but  only 81,000 graduated from the registered system. In fact, there have  been, on average, over 190,000 new apprenticeships every year since  2015, but only 81,000 graduate in a year from the registered system.  That is a graduation rate of 43 percent, at best. Yet Democrats refer  to this program as the ``gold standard.''   Lord help us if this is the gold standard.   Clearly, there is room to improve the registered system, make space  for employer-led innovation, and get more Americans back to work.  Instead, Democrats assume that simply throwing more taxpayer dollars at  a broken system will lead to the creation of a million new  apprenticeships. But they have failed to address the underlying  problems with the system and, along the way, are shutting down a new,  more flexible option that businesses have already found appealing.   Stifling innovation and doubling down on an 80-year-old system that  favors union-driven apprenticeships will hurt our efforts to get more  Americans back to work. Yet language included in the legislation favors  grant funding for entities partnering with unions. Turning the bill's  grant program into a union slush fund would also block countless  potential for participants from accessing grant money.   Even worse, H.R. 447 will force job creators to deal with overly  prescriptive requirements, additional bureaucracy, and time-consuming  paperwork on top of the one-size-fits-all approach. It is no wonder  this stifling environment has discouraged new and small businesses from  participating in the registered apprenticeship system.   Employers know best what skills their employees require to excel in  the workplace. That is why Republicans believe Congress should  encourage employer-led innovation in the apprenticeship space.  Unfortunately, today's legislation falls woefully short.   We know that apprenticeships will play a defining role in closing the  skills gap and putting more Americans to work, but only if employees  and job creators are given the flexibility to innovate and develop  high-quality earn-and-learn programs without overreach from Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho  (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague on the other side of the aisle says that  these grants are not restricted to union programs, or programs that are  associated with unions. But the language in the bill is ``to the extent  practicable programs should be connected with the union.'' That term is  not defined.   The Department of Labor can arbitrarily deny grants to nonunion  programs. There is no accountability for this. In fact, there is very  little accountability in this bill at all. And the American people want  to know where their hardworking tax dollars are being spent. This is  just a lousy bill and we ought not to be passing it in these  conditions.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As my other colleagues have pointed out, millions of workers will  need reskilling due to the pandemic-related job loss and displacement,  not to mention the devastating executive orders signed by President  Biden which eliminated in one day hundreds of thousands of jobs.   The World Economic Forum discusses this issue at length in their  recent report titled: ``The Future of Jobs Report 2020.'' In the  report, they point to a double disruption scenario impacting workers  due to both automation and COVID-19 workplace disruptions.   This double disruption is further reinforced in their findings that  84 percent of employers are set to rapidly digitalize working  processes. And, again, as I mentioned, they don't even take into  consideration what President Biden has done to eliminate hundreds of  thousands, and it could be millions of jobs.   The demand for reskilling workers is high, and we will be left  chasing the need of our workforce with the current one-size-fits-all  approach this bill seeks to enshrine into law.   As in-demand skills evolve into the years to come, the skills gap  will continue to grow in the absence of forward-thinking reform. Again,  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join Republicans  in creating new apprenticeship pathways through innovative models such  as the industry-recognized apprenticeship model. I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, would you clarify how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, IRAPs,  which would be eliminated by this bill represent a new apprenticeship  model that puts employers in the driver's seat to create programs that  meet the unique needs of their workers.   This new, innovative model was spearheaded by President Trump's  Department of Labor. Currently, 80 percent of apprenticeships are  employer-led and are not a part of the registered apprenticeship model.  The registered apprenticeship model is riddled with burdensome red tape  which discourages countless businesses from participating.   IRAPs, on the other hand, give job creators the freedom to break away  from the Washington-knows-best model and connect workers, families, and  communities with fulfilling careers.   This bill looks backwards and relies solely on a model created during  the Great Depression. We should be looking forward and not closing  opportunities for new models that reach more workers and industries  like the industry-recognized apprenticeship model.   Mr. Speaker, there is bipartisan agreement that the National  Apprenticeship Act is in desperate need of an update. But the bill  before us fails to deliver for students, workers, or job creators.   While Democrats continue with this ill-advised legislation,  Republicans will continue working hard to inject innovation and  flexibility into the apprenticeship model so that more Americans, many  of whom have been put out of work by this very administration, can get  back to work.   I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the en bloc amendment,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding my great affection for the gentlewoman  from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester), I have to highlight at least one  amendment in the en bloc that I am concerned with.   The amendment offered by Representative Escobar would add Job Corps  Centers to the list of education providers that may be considered as  partners for program sponsors as they are developing their program.   I understand Mr. Levin thinks this is a great idea, and it is well- intentioned, I am sure. But I do not believe we should be adding more  responsibilities to a program that has consistently failed to do that  which Congress has already authorized it to do.   For decades, this federally funded program has struggled to ensure  the safety and security of students. There is ample documentation about  the deficiencies in Job Corps. In fact, over 30 different government  reports and audits have raised concerns over the safety and security of  participants.   Until we have resolved the underlying problems with Job Corps, I do  not believe we should encourage more individuals to participate in the  program by listing this as an available option.   The other amendments are largely minor changes to the bill that do  not redeem the underlying policy or do anything to seriously reform and  improve our apprenticeship system.   While I wish we could have a serious debate about the opportunity for  additional reforms in this space that would be supported by a large  number of Republican Members, it is clear that Democrats are unwilling  to have that conversation today.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the en bloc amendment and encourage my  colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, no one on our side disagrees that millions of people in  this country now and in the future need constant education and the  opportunity to gain new skills.   Mr. Speaker, we all support apprenticeships. I want to tell a little  story about how long I have been involved in helping to create  apprenticeships. I have a brother who is 8 years younger than I, and it  took me 7 years to finish college. I had just barely finished and was  working at a new resort in North Carolina, Beech Mountain. He was a  senior in high school, and he came to me and said: I don't want to go  to college, but I don't want you and mom and daddy to be ashamed of me.   We have created a system in this country where we think people have  to have a baccalaureate degree to be successful. That is not true.   I asked my brother what he wanted to do, and he said: I want to be a  carpenter.   I said: That is about the most honorable profession in the world.  Some famous people were carpenters.   So, I went to my boss. I don't know how I knew this, but I said: My  brother would like to be a carpenter. We are desperate for carpenters,  electricians, and plumbers here. Could we set up a carpentry  apprenticeship program?   We did that with the help of a local junior college, community  college, contractors, and AGC. We set up a carpentry apprenticeship  program. Seventeen guys, mostly recent high school graduates, enrolled  in it.   Three-and-a-half years later, my brother and three other guys  graduated with their journeyman license. Now, I consider that a great  success. I have been interested in apprenticeships since 1969. I saw  how successful they were.   Those are the kinds of programs that we need to be fostering in this  country. My brother went on to be an engineer with the telephone  company. He never got a bachelor's degree, but he showed me how to use  my first computer, taught me how to use it, set it up for me.   My brother is a very successful man, a lot smarter than I am, but he  did that by using his skills, his brain. And he continues to educate  himself.   What we need is constant education, the opportunity to learn new  skills, but this bill and these amendments don't advance the cause. We  need to stop looking backward 80 years and look forward to the needs of  a modern economy.   Yes, the President hit the ground running. He sure did. He eliminated  thousands of jobs in his first week, and he continues to eliminate jobs  with wrongheaded policy. This bill and many of the actions of our  colleagues indicate how beholden they are to union bosses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the en bloc  amendment and ``no'' on the underlying bill. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this en bloc incorporates eight amendments with  bipartisan support. I want to highlight a few amendments from this en  bloc in particular.   First, the amendment offered by Mr. Feenstra from Iowa will ensure  that the Departments of Labor and Justice collaborate on technical  assistance to support the development of related instruction that is  aligned with the mentoring program administered by the Department of  Justice.   Second, several amendments add industries to the list of  nontraditional apprenticeship industries and occupations.   Modernizing the 80-year-old National Apprenticeship Act ought to  include apprenticeship opportunities within a variety of sectors. Far  too often, society paints apprenticeships as only applying to the  trades, which is unfortunate. While there are certainly valuable  pathways within those fields, we need to expand the horizons of what  apprenticeships are capable of providing for workers.   This is also why I think it is important to call these professions  rather than the trades. A broader policy should not be limited by how  it has traditionally been viewed or how we speak about it.   Third, the amendment offered by Mr. Lamb from Pennsylvania and Mr.  Taylor from Texas includes veterans service organizations in several  key places. Because apprenticeships recognize and build on prior  knowledge and skills, veterans stand to benefit greatly from these  opportunities and should be engaged in the system as much as possible.   Unfortunately, I do need to highlight one amendment that could be  much stronger. Our Democrat colleagues have obviously recognized that  the underlying bill does nothing to promote innovation in  apprenticeships but, instead, simply doubles down on the status quo.                                time  1100    So several Members have offered an amendment allowing for  ``demonstration projects'' to promote innovation. Mr. Speaker, this is  insulting. This Chamber deserves a real debate as to how to promote  innovation within apprenticeships and work-based learning.   Republicans offered amendments to do just that, but they were not  made in order. Representative Allen offered an amendment specifically  to protect existing industry-driven apprenticeships currently operating  out of the Department of Labor. Representative Thompson offered an  amendment to create additional innovation in work-based learning.   Rather than allowing that debate to take place and Members to vote on  these proposals, Democrats blocked consideration of those amendments  and offered this do-nothing fig leaf of an amendment instead. Even the  limited authority for demonstrations must still be approved by an  advisory committee with heavy labor representation, giving union bosses  veto power over any new ideas that might threaten their hold on  apprenticeships. In the absence of real innovation, fake innovation is  better than no innovation, but we could do better.   Despite my frustrations with Democrats' refusal to debate serious  proposals to modernize the apprenticeship program, on balance, this en  bloc amendment offers good ideas worthy of support. I support the en  bloc amendment and encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I find it intriguing that my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle say they are passing legislation that is cost- effective when they are anticipating millions of jobs and generating  lots of revenue, especially when they are denying that they are taking  money from hardworking taxpayers who want to have apprenticeship  programs that are not controlled by the Federal Government, and not  allowing those taxpayers--those employers--to tap into a system that  has grant programs for them where they are creating real jobs not  controlled by the unions. It is just intriguing to me that they could  be doing that.   I don't know if I will be here 5 years from now or if Mr. Levin will  be here 5 years from now, but I sure hope somebody does a check on the  promises that are being made here for all the wonderful things to come  as a result of this bill. And I predict that those ``investments'' that  are the income being taken from hardworking taxpayers are not going to  produce what is being predicted by our colleagues. So it is intriguing  for me to hear that. I do hope somebody will be around to check on it  and give a report on it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to highlight a couple of amendments in the en  bloc that I have some reservations about and that I think would benefit  from additional discussion if this bill is taken up in the Senate.   First, Moore amendment No. 15 creates a new reporting requirement on  ``State agencies.'' I don't think new reporting requirements will  achieve our goal of increasing employer engagement in the registered  apprenticeship program when the underlying bill doubles down on the  reasons employers choose not to participate in the first place.   But I would at least encourage my Democrat friends to clarify if they  mean for that reporting requirement to apply only to ``State  apprenticeship agencies'' or if they truly want to empower the  Department of Labor to demand reports of any and every State agency it  chooses, regardless of that agency's involvement in apprenticeship  programs.   Second, Payne amendment No. 18 may well make it harder to engage  small- and medium-sized employers by requiring grantees to have  demonstrated expertise in engaging specific types of small- and medium- sized businesses.   Madam Speaker, to be absolutely clear, I believe we should take  reasonable steps to encourage grantees to partner with small businesses  owned or controlled by women, minorities, or veterans. The underlying  bill does this.   Unfortunately, the Payne amendment actually requires demonstrated  success in this area, which would likely shrink the pool of grantees  significantly, particularly in locations that already offer fewer  apprenticeships programs. This is a well-meaning amendment, but as  well-intentioned as it is, I hope the Senate will take another look at  how to increase the participation of minority-, women-, and veterans- owned businesses without creating requirements that will reduce  apprenticeship opportunities.   The balance of the amendments are unobjectionable. They are  unobjectionable because they mostly don't do anything noteworthy. In  some cases they repeat provisions already in the bill. In other cases  they add additional items to existing laundry lists. In short, these  amendments are fine. They don't make the bill better in any substantive  way, but they don't make it worse.   But, Madam Speaker, the fact that the majority is spending our time  on mostly meaningless amendments highlights the fundamental flaw in  this bill and process. We are on the floor debating amendments that  don't do much, while amendments that could have made significant  improvements to the bill were blocked by the Democrats from  consideration.   We have talked repeatedly during this debate about how the Democrat  bill eliminates existing work-based learning programs at the Department  of Labor, mostly nursing apprenticeship programs, at a time our  economy, particularly the healthcare sector, needs all the help it can  get.   Representative Allen offered an amendment to remedy this flaw in the  bill, but my Democrat friends were afraid of taking that vote. So we  aren't considering that proposal today.   We have talked repeatedly about how this bill doubles down on the  existing flaws of the current 80-year-old system while offering no  opportunities for employers or workers to pursue meaningful innovation  in the work-based learning space.   Representative Thompson offered an amendment to fix that problem in  the bill, but Democrats didn't want to take that vote either.   We have talked repeatedly about how this bill seeks to protect big  labor at the expense of workers in desperate need of high-quality  apprenticeship programs. Representative Keller offered an amendment and  Mr. Perry spoke of this inequity in his floor amendments. The amendment  from Mr. Keller would have put union and nonunion apprenticeship  programs on equal footing. Democrats won't let the people's House weigh  in on that issue.   Madam Speaker, I am going to support this en bloc amendment, but I  hope at some point we will have an honest debate about how to truly  improve this bill to provide workers the apprenticeship opportunities  they need, or at least to protect the apprenticeship opportunities they  currently have.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Madam Speaker, our colleagues talk a lot about the fact  that 94 percent of people who complete apprenticeship programs get jobs  immediately, but they never talk about the gold standard they call the  registered programs, which graduate only 43 percent of the people who  enter them, so I think they are very selective in the statistics that  they use.   Madam Speaker, expanding funding and giving funding to State  apprenticeship offices, in my opinion, is just a hook for more Federal  control. And everything about this underlying bill is to have more and  more control at the Federal Government level, which enhances the role  of unions in apprenticeship programs. That is not the way we should be  going.   Our colleagues have not noticed, I think, how quickly the workforce  is having to adapt to, particularly, technological changes that are  occurring in our country. These programs change very, very little over  time because of the hidebound unions and the hidebound system that we  have.   We need the employers on the ground who are dealing with creating new  jobs all the time in new industries to be able to tap into their  taxpayer dollars that are coming into the Federal Government, which are  denied to them unless they are hooked to a union. That is wrong, and we  need fair systems.   As Mr. Keller and Mr. Perry have pointed out, even the standards set  for industry programs that are controlled by unions are different than  they are in the private sector. There are more regulations on the  private sector than on the union programs.   This is not a good way for us to be going in the year 2021. We need  innovation. We need to be forward-looking, not backward-looking.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague for  yielding.   Currently, the underlying bill favors grant funding for entities that  partner with unions. This would block countless potential participants  from accessing these funds and would further cement the program in the  way it has been since the 1930s.   If we want to reach 1 million apprenticeships in this country, I fail  to see how limiting access by creating earmarks and kickbacks will  achieve that goal.   The amendment offered by Representative Hill would make it optional  for grant applications to partner with unions. If the majority truly  believes that this is not a requirement intended to push more workers  into unions, this should be no more than a technical clarification.   Although it would not redeem the underlying bill, this amendment  would be a step in the right direction toward opening more  apprenticeship opportunities for Americans. I strongly urge my  colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment offered  by Representative Stefanik, a distinguished member of the Education and  Labor Committee.   Modernizing the apprenticeship system in this country is more  important now than ever, as millions are in need of reskilling.   This amendment would drastically improve the Registered  Apprenticeship Program while also permitting DOL to pursue models of  work-based learning outside the registered system, such as Industry- Recognized Apprenticeship Programs.   The exclusion of this amendment would stop this innovative progress  and scrap the 131 IRAPs that have already been recognized, the vast  majority of which are for nursing credentials.   Unlike the Democrats' narrow-minded bill, Representative Stefanik's  amendment recognizes the needs of students, workers, and job creators.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  alternative.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
