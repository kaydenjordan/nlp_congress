 Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, November 6, El Paso lost a  beautiful soul, the beloved Judy Ackerman, who had been battling cancer  since 2015.   A veteran who served our country, a conservationist who loved the  outdoors and the Chihuahuan Desert, she was always ready for a hike.  She was a relentless activist who was never seen without a petition in  hand fighting for the integrity of our natural spaces and our beautiful  community on the border. Judy's legacy is one that El Pasoans will  never forget.   Judy dedicated 20 years of her life to the preservation of the  Castner Range in El Paso, and her advocacy has brought us closer than  ever to protecting this crown jewel of west Texas.   Today, we honor her service to our country, to conservation, and to  El Paso.   Thank you for being my friend and thank you for being the best friend  our community could ever have. You will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
