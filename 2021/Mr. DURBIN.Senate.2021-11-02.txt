 Mr. President, next week, our Nation will commemorate  Veterans Day. It will be the first time in a generation that we will  honor that day as a nation no longer at war.   With the conclusion of the war in Afghanistan--the longest war in our  history--thousands of American troops finally came home. These heroes  have returned to our shores, just as this Veterans Day stands as a  reminder of everything we owe them, as well as every American who has  served this Nation in uniform. More than 2,400 Americans perished in  the war in Afghanistan. Thousands more return home with wounds--visible  and invisible--that will stay with them for life.   Words are not enough to honor that sacrifice. We need to ensure that  our veterans and families have access to the best healthcare in the  world, affordable housing, programs that support them as civilians,  whether it is students, employees or businessowners.   To serve our Nation in uniform takes a special measure of courage and  devotion. For some members of our military, it also takes a great deal  of persistence and determination.   Let me tell you about one. I am speaking, of course, of those members  of our military who were born in other nations and want to serve  America. Over the years, I have shared the story of one of these  heroes--his name: Oscar Vasquez.   When Oscar was 12 years old, his family made the journey across the  border from Mexico to America. They settled in Arizona. From the time  he was a child, Oscar dreamed of serving America in the military. He  studied hard in high school, even joined high school ROTC.   But during his junior here, he ran into a problem. He tried to sign  up for basic training, but the recruiter informed him that he couldn't  serve in the U.S. military without a U.S. birth certificate. It was a  tough setback, but Oscar was determined.   He was awarded JROTC officer of the year by his high school, and he  led a group of students in an underwater robotics competition. They  squared off--these high school students--squared off against college  students from schools like MIT. Guess what. They won. The victory led  him to Arizona State University, where he earned a degree in mechanical  engineering.   After graduating, Oscar got married and had a child, but his  undocumented status still prevented him from reaching his full  potential, so he moved back to Mexico--a country he hadn't lived in  since he was a young boy--to apply for legal entry into the United  States. He would have been barred from reentering the United States and  separated from his family for 10 years without a special waiver, so he  decided to call my office.   He reached out to us and said: ``Can you help me get a waiver?''   When the Department of Homeland Security finally granted it, Oscar  came home to America.   What was the first thing that he did?   He got his paperwork in order and enlisted in the U.S. Army. Within 6  months of returning to the United States, he was off to basic training.  Oscar served our Nation with honor as a cavalry scout in Afghanistan.  And, today, he is finally an American citizen.   We spend so much time around here talking about immigrants in  negative terms. You look at Oscar and the sacrifice he made to serve  our Nation in the military--this man who came to the United States as a  little boy, knew what his goal was, and it was to risk his life for  this great Nation.   When I hear some of the speeches given on the floor--one yesterday  about how the United States is going to give a million dollars to every  one of these undocumented people--I think to myself, these  preposterous, outlandish, exaggerated stories told about these  immigrants belie the real determination many of them have to come to  this country and make a difference in their lives and a difference in  our future.   Oscar is a living example. Oscar, like so many others, fought for our  Nation in every war in our history. But even those who are ready to  risk everything in America, for them, our immigration system still is  broken.   During this pandemic, thousands of DACA recipients and undocumented  immigrants have actually helped save lives across America. They didn't  enlist in the Army. They used their skills as doctors and nurses and  paramedics and respiratory therapists. They may have saved a member of  your family, these immigrants.   On farms throughout the country, thousands more performed  backbreaking labor to put food on our table. Donald Trump's  administration classified them as ``essential workers.'' I think, for  once, President Donald Trump was right.   The pandemic has proven how much we depend on immigrants as members  of the military, first responders, and agriculture workers. We couldn't  function without them.   That is precisely why reforming our broken immigration system is an  integral part of President Biden's Build Back Better. We must include  protections for immigrants, like Oscar Vasquez, who have given  everything they can to America.   If we want to rebuild our economy and drive its growth for years to  come, we should begin by ensuring that immigrants can earn their place  in the American story.   How many examples do each one of us know in our own families and  other families where these immigrants came to America with literally  nothing?   Many of them couldn't speak the language and went hard at work to  establish a life, a family, a community, a business that ended up  helping the entire Nation.   Immigration reform could boost our Nation's GDP by more than $1  trillion over the next 10 years--hundreds of thousands of new jobs. And  don't buy this theory that it is zero-sum when it comes to the  creation of jobs. We have found over and over again that a determined,  hard-working person takes a job and helps create a new job in the  process. It happens with the creation of business, the creation of jobs  over and over again.    It is far past time to reform our immigration system. With the Build  Back Better package, we can finally get it done.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
