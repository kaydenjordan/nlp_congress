 Madam President, I come to the floor today to urge my  colleagues strongly to vote against the nomination of Colin Kahl to  serve as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. That position is the  No. 3 position in the Department of Defense.   Last week, Colin Kahl became President Biden's first nominee not to  garner one single Republican vote on the Senate floor. The Vice  President had to cast the tie-breaking vote. Every other nominee, even  some of the most partisan progressives, earned at least one or some  Republican votes.   What makes this nomination even more out of the ordinary is that this  truly never happens with DOD nominees. If you look back over the last  decade, recorded votes on DOD nominees are rare and only a few times  did a nominee receive support from fewer than two-thirds of the Senate.  It just doesn't happen. It happened this time.   Some of his tweets have raised concerns from a number of our  colleagues that Dr. Kahl might have shared sensitive or classified  information on Twitter. The junior Senator from Tennessee highlighted  this on the floor last week.   Furthermore, Dr. Kahl's tweets also show a history of volatile  behavior that goes further than just being highly partisan and  unbalanced. He is also somewhat of a conspiracy theorist.   In May of 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced  that Israel had seized a major nuclear archive from Iran. That archive  has since revealed many previously unknown nuclear sites, and the  International Atomic Energy Agency is working to gain access to inspect  these sites today, thanks to Israel's discovery.   But what did Dr. Kahl say about Israel's discovery at that time? He  was skeptical, and he added: ``This sure has an eerie pre-2003 Iraqi  vibe to it.'' In other words, rather than being alarmed about the fact  that Iran had many undeclared nuclear sites, Dr. Kahl alleged that  Israel was trying to goad America into war.   Somehow, for Dr. Kahl the problem is never Iran or the weak 2015 Iran  deal that didn't cover the nuclear sites that Israel revealed. He wants  to give Iran massive sanctions relief to return to that deal. No, for  Dr. Kahl the problem is Israel, especially when our Israeli friends  reveal information about Iran's nefarious behavior.   Again, this isn't about a policy disagreement. This is about whether  Dr. Kahl is someone who can accept facts, even when those facts  undercut his policy preferences.   National security is a bipartisan priority. It always has been and  always  [[Page S2209]]  will be. As I said at the beginning of this, traditionally, nominees  for key DOD roles receive bipartisan support in the Senate. In fact, I  can't recall a single nominee for a top DOD position in the past 40  years who didn't garner at least one vote from the other party--either  party.   Now, I hope President Biden keeps this in mind as he staffs the rest  of his administration. We need nominees who will work with Members on  both sides of the aisle, and those Members have to trust that person in  return. Moving forward, I would urge President Biden to listen to his  own calls for bipartisanship and unity and send us nominees who could  be approved without controversy.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was listening intently to the Senator  from Texas, who is certainly familiar with the problems on the border.  It happens that I spent 30 years down there as a builder and developer  many years ago. I got to know the border people. They are trying to do  a great job down there against some pretty impossible odds.   You know, one thing I always think about is, it has nothing to do  with Central American citizens or Mexicans; it is the people from the  Middle East, terrorists from all over. Open borders don't work. So I  applaud him for his efforts on that           Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021    Mr. President, this week we have a real opportunity before us to pass  the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of  2021.   If you listen only to the national media, you would think that  Congress can't get together on much of anything, but this bill is a  real example of how that is not always the case. The reason is simple:  Everyone agrees that we need clean, safe, drinking water and to support  State and local projects to protect water quality.   There are tangible benefits for communities too. Just consider what  the bill does for my State of Oklahoma. First, it will increase the  Federal funding for local projects by over $315 million in the next 5  years, an increase of 123 percent.   More than that, the State retains the control to direct funds to  projects they have identified. It is called local support. It is kind  of a unique concept. It demonstrates clearly that we who are  representing an area know more about the area than people who don't  represent the area.   This will increase funding for local projects. It will also provide  needed resources to help Oklahoma achieve its comprehensive water plan,  meeting its goal of using no more freshwater in 2060 than was used in  2010.   I am proud to cosponsor this bill because it not only recognizes that  urban and rural communities have different water infrastructure needs,  but it also provides specific benefits to rural States like my State of  Oklahoma.   A month ago, the Water Quality Division director of the State of  Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, Shellie Chard, testified  before the EPW Committee to highlight the challenges facing rural water  systems and the innovation that they are using in rural States and  communities to ensure safe and affordable drinking  [[Page S2215]]  water. She highlighted the need for assistance to small, rural States  in complying with government regulations, and this bill does that by  giving small and rural States access to Federal funding and assistance  in complying with government regulations that are often more burdensome  and overbearing for them.   The bill also empowers rural communities to work with technical  experts at nonprofit entities and State agencies to implement best  practices and more efficiently comply with the Federal regulations.  When a small town like Meridian, OK, needs help addressing harmful  contaminants in their water system, local rural water organizations can  provide consistent help and expertise, and they do. They are out there.  They want to help. Dedicating resources to help our rural communities  will ensure they spend more of their time and their money on community  projects, not navigating a bureaucracy.   More than just taking care of our water infrastructure today, this  bill has an eye on the future by reauthorizing the Water Resources  Research Act. The Water Resources Research Act supports cutting-edge  water research at universities across the country, including Oklahoma  State University in Stillwater. OSU will receive research funding over  the next 4 years to study wastewater reuse, produced water from oil and  gas operations, and more.   The bill will also more than double the funding for the enhanced  aquifer recharge research program. This program does essential work to  refill the groundwater aquifers, especially in areas with water  shortages, to sustain a reliable municipal water supply.   I thank my colleagues Senator Carper and Senator Capito for working  together to move this bill through the normal committee process and  bring it to the floor. This is what bipartisanship means, and we do see  this every day, in spite of what you might get from the media. I look  forward to this bill being passed and enacted into law quickly. It is  important that this not be the end of our bipartisan infrastructure  work.
