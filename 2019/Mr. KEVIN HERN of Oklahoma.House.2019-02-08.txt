 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Ossie Mills from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Those who knew Mr. Mills best  say that he was a loyal friend, a hard worker, a devoted husband and  father, and a servant of God. Mr. Mills encouraged and challenged  others to live out their full potential.   Mr. Mills served as an executive vice president at Oral Roberts  University from 2011 to 2018, where he served as executive director and  global council member of Empowered21. He also served on the Board of  Directors for Convoy of Hope, a worldwide, faith-based organization  aimed at empowering others to live lives free of poverty, disease, and  hunger.   Most recently, Mr. Mills was the president and CEO tvChaz, a faith- based streaming platform aimed at helping people discover God's vision  for life.   While Ossie Mills' time on Earth has come to an end, the impact of  his work will last for years to come.   Mr. Mills is survived by his loving wife, Bonnie, and his three  children, Nick, Olivia, and Alex.                            ____________________
