 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H. Res. 92, condemning North Korea's development of multiple  intercontinental ballistic missiles.   The world has watched in fear as this brutal dictatorship has labored  to miniaturize a nuclear warhead capable of being delivered by an ICBM.  Across the 45th District, Californians are anxious about the growing  threat from North Korea and its efforts to develop the capability to  strike the West Coast.   Orange County is home to a large Korean-American population who have  spoken out forcefully against this rogue regime, fearing for the life  of their Korean kin and the safety of the entire world. As I tell all  concerned constituents when I am back home in California, and I will  repeat here today: I share your concern and will do all I can to ensure  we eliminate this threat.   Mr. Speaker, just today, an interview with the most high-profile  North Korean defector in two decades was released. The man's warning  was dire: Kim Jong-un will use nuclear weapons at the slightest sign of  an imminent threat to his rule.   The time for the old strategy of strategic patience has passed. We  must take serious actions now to prevent a nuclear weapon from ever  threatening the United States or one of our allies. I urge the  President to address this grave threat with the Chinese President at  their upcoming summit.   I thank my friend, the gentleman from South Carolina, for undertaking  this effort, and I am proud to join him in this fight.
