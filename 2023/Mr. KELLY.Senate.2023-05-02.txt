 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Captain Gwen  Niemi for her service in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corp--WAC--during  World War II, from 1942 to 1946. Ms. Niemi was among the first 200  women to become officers in the WAC.   Captain Niemi was born on February 2, 1920, in Lancaster, PA. Ms.  Niemi obtained her degree in physical education from West Chester State  College. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Gwen attended the first  WAC training course in Des Moines, IA, graduating from WAC training as  a second lieutenant in 1942.   Her first assignment was training recruits at the WAC Training School  in Daytona Beach, FL, and was responsible for instructing almost 500  trainees. Gwen next commanded a WAC Company of 180 personnel at Tyndall  Field located outside of Panama City, FL. While on assignment at  Tyndall Field, Ms. Niemi was temporarily assigned to duty at the San  Antonio Aviation Cadet Center. She was promoted to the rank of captain  and transferred to Eastern Flying Training Command at Maxwell Field,  AL, where she served as a career field manager and evaluator for the  WAC Program.   Upon her discharge from the WAC with the rank of captain, Ms. Niemi  moved to Tucson, AZ, where she became a teacher in the physical  education department at the University of Arizona. Ms. Niemi took 5  years off from teaching, having two children, and then returned to  teaching physical education and English and reading at Tucson School  District No. 1, now known as TUSD.   Please join me in celebrating Captain Gwen Niemi for being a patriot  and a true trailblazer, for her brave service during World War II, and  for going on to be an educator at the University of Arizona and at  Tucson School District No. 1.                            ____________________
