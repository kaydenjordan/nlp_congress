 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 2946) to amend title 18, United States  Code, to clarify the meaning of the terms ``act of war'' and ``blocked  asset'', and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
