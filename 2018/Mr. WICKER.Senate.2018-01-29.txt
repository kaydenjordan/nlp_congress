 Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska has generously  allowed me to intrude on her time for a half a minute to say that I  strongly support this legislation--the Pain-Capable Unborn Child  Protection Act.   Science is on our side in supporting this legislation, and public  opinion is on our side in supporting this legislation. There are 60  percent of women, 64 percent of Independents, and 56 percent of  Democrats who support ending late-term abortions, which is what we are  trying to do. Medical practice is on our side in this legislation, and  world opinion and world practice are on our side.   Let me simply reiterate that we in America are among a grim group of  seven countries who permit abortions after 20 weeks--Canada and the  Netherlands in the West and then China, North Korea, Singapore, and  Vietnam. We are in a grim group that includes North Korea and China. We  may not have the votes this time, but we are advancing the issue, and  we are going to continue to fight for the unborn, particularly those  who are capable of feeling pain after 20 weeks.   I thank the Senate for its time, and I particularly thank the Senator  from Nebraska for indulging me for a moment.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
