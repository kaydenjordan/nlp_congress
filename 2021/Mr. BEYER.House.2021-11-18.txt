 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his extraordinary  [[Page H6592]]  leadership on the Ways and Means Committee in putting this together,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support the Build Back Better Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill finally makes it clear that our government's  most important responsibility is to give every American the possibility  for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   The Build Back Better Act makes the boldest actions to fight the  existential crisis of climate change.   It contains some of the most important benefits for American families  ever contemplated by Congress: lowering drug prices, paid family leave,  affordable childcare and healthcare, universal pre-kindergarten, and an  extended child tax credit.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would boost our economy in the best and  strongest way by investing in our workforce and increasing labor force  participation.   It will create long-term structural benefits for our economy that  strengthen our supply chains, reduce the effects that drive up energy  prices, and restrain inflation.   Along with the recently enacted infrastructure bill, it will create  millions of jobs.   Mr. Speaker, a vote for the Build Back Better Act is a vote for  sustained, long-term economic growth that will benefit generations of  Americans.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
