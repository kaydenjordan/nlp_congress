 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about the farm bill-- something that we have in common, something that both of our States  know is very important for this country's economy. This legislation is  one of the most important chances we have in this Chamber to address  one of the  [[Page S4390]]  most pressing issues in rural parts of our country right now.   I want to speak about two of my most urgent priorities for this  year's farm bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  them.   The first is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which  most of us call SNAP. There are more than 40 million Americans who rely  on SNAP every day. More than 40 million people would go hungry if they  didn't have access to SNAP. Many of these Americans are disabled. Many  of them are elderly and retired. Nearly half of them are children.  Millions of them--and I truly mean millions--are working.   Congress should not take SNAP away from hard-working Americans just  because they don't fill out monthly paperwork. Last week, the House  passed its own version of the farm bill that would do just that. That  is shameful.   Here is the truth about SNAP. The vast majority of able-bodied adults  on SNAP are already working. They are already working. They have jobs.  Many of them work several jobs. They are doing everything they can to  get ahead, just to have a small slice of the American dream. They still  need SNAP. They need SNAP because their wages are too low.   To be clear, they already have to follow the work requirements. There  have been work requirements in place since 1971. But the farm bill  would just add more redtape, more paperwork for struggling families  just so they could eat dinner.   This is the difference between the House farm bill and the Senate  farm bill: The Senate farm bill got it right; the House farm bill has  created this terrible requirement of paperwork just to get SNAP. One of  our House colleagues said that it is to promote ``self-sufficiency,''  as if low-income workers on SNAP aren't already working every waking  hour just to scrape by. The House plan is a blatant example of how out  of touch Congress is about poverty in this country. It is shameful that  some Members of the House from my own State would even support this  cruel plan when so many New Yorkers rely on SNAP every single day. I am  happy that the Senate farm bill has more heart than that.   The bill that came out of committee shows respect for all hard- working families who need SNAP, and now we need to take it a step  further to do even more to help hungry children. I am submitting an  amendment to the Senate farm bill called the SNAP for Kids Act. It  would increase the amount of SNAP funding that families with kids in  school are allowed to receive. If we pass this amendment, we will help  families stretch their food budgets just a few more days at the end of  every month when they need it the most, before the next paycheck comes  in, and we will help keep millions of children in this country from  going hungry. That should be a priority here--protecting children--for  all of us.   I have two young children, and I know that many of our colleagues in  this Chamber also have young children. Our children will never have to  have access to SNAP to get basic nutrition. They will never know what  it is like to wake up hungry because their parents didn't have enough  food to feed them a nutritious dinner. I believe at my core that we  need to care about other people's children as much as we care about our  own, so I urge my colleagues to do what is right and support the SNAP  for Kids Act. Let's reject the House of Representatives' cruel plan and  commit ourselves to protecting SNAP instead of destroying it.   The second issue I want to talk about today is dairy prices. My home  State of New York is one of the biggest dairy-producing States in the  country. We are blessed with thousands of dairy farms and even more  hard-working men and women who wake up before the Sun rises every  single day to produce the milk that keeps our families healthy.   Unfortunately, over the last few years, our dairy farmers have taken  a serious hit from persistently low dairy prices. Many of our dairy  farms are operating below their cost of production. Over the last  decade, dairy farms all over New York have actually had to shut down  because of this crisis. Many are currently on the brink of failing.    This is what one dairy farmer said:         It's stressful. . . . Do I want to wake up and lose $30,000       a day?    Imagine the pain our dairy farmers and their families suffer when  they wake up before dawn, every day, without a break, and they still  can't make ends meet and provide for their own children. Imagine the  heartbreak and the depression of the last dairy farmer in a family--the  one who has to sell the farm despite generations of hard work because  he just can't make ends meet.   This is a crisis right in our backyard. It is hurting our  agricultural economy. It is hurting our rural communities, and, most of  all, it is hurting our farmers and their families. One big reason is  that our dairy insurance program didn't work.   I have heard from dairy farmers all across New York who have been  essentially ripped off by the dairy insurance program because the  program failed to cover our farmers when they needed it the most--when  milk prices have plummeted.   Our dairy farmers need a lifeline, and I was very proud to add a  provision to the Senate farm bill for $77 million of those premiums to  be returned. This is great news for our dairy farmers, but there is  still so much more we can do. I have asked the Secretary of Agriculture  for emergency funding to address this issue now, but he refuses to help  our dairy farmers.   I am submitting an amendment that would require the Department of  Agriculture to help our dairy farmers with emergency funding now. I am  asking the Secretary of Agriculture for the exact same amount of  funding he just gave cotton farmers across this country when they were  struggling.   The USDA should be fair and treat our dairy farmers with the same  support. I want this emergency funding to go directly to those farmers  who need it so they can keep producing milk--without going bankrupt-- long enough for the industry to come together to balance supply and for  Congress to create a more fair milk pricing system.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment too. It affects all of  us. I know you believe our farmers work hard every day. They need our  support. I urge all of us to stand with them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
