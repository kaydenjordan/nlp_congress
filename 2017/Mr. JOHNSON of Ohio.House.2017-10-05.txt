 Mr. Chairman, I saw recently, and I remember  Ronald Reagan said something when he finally got his tax reform package  done back in 1986--why it took so long and why it was so difficult. And  at the end the day, he said: You know, the lawmakers and the  policymakers forgot one important factor in their calculations that  brought us to this point; they forgot to include what the American  people have to say about this.   That is what is happening here today, Mr. Chairman. The American  people have told us they want economic growth. They want opportunities  for their kids and their families, a better quality of life. They want  Washington to live within its means and stop taking more and more and  more from them out of their paychecks.   So let's do a little bit of comparison. Let's look at, my colleagues,  the Democrat budget. It raises taxes by $2.7 trillion, compared to the  CBO January baseline. That is almost $3.8 trillion more than revenue  levels in our House Republican budget. It increases spending by $6.2  trillion, compared to the Republican budget over that 10-year period.  It increases the debt held by the public by $3.9 trillion, almost $4  trillion relative to the House Republican budget.   And what is important, Mr. Chair, it never balances. There is not  even an attempt to balance; not to mention that there are no  reconciliation instructions that would give us an opportunity to deal  with healthcare and other economic growth reforms.   Mr. Chairman, this is not a responsible budget that is being offered  by  [[Page H7878]]  our colleagues on the other side. I urge my colleagues to oppose it and  to support the House Republican budget later today.
