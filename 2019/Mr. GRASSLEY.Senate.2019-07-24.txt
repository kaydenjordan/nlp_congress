 Madam President, I ask permission to speak in morning  business for 1 minute.    Madam President, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement  will be a very big boon to the American worker. In my State, one out of  every four American manufacturing firms export to Canada and Mexico.  Seventy percent of these are very small or medium-sized businesses.  More than 25,400 Iowans depend on manufacturing jobs.   By encouraging auto manufacturers to use more U.S. content in our  cars and high-wage labor, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will help  American workers compete on a level playing field and benefit from  selling to two of our largest trading partners.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, at the website  ThisIsIowa.com, you can view a video of people visiting a fake real  estate office in New York advertising modern, spacious properties. You  can see the astonishment, then, on the faces of New Yorkers as they are  shown beautiful, modern apartments, as well as homes near art museums  and award-winning restaurants.   The prices and the neighborhood amenities seem too good to believe.  The details are real and so are the job opportunities real. Only the  location is not New York. The location is Iowa. Check it out on  ThisIsIowa.com.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to advise my  colleagues about a new rule that the Department of Homeland Security  published in the Federal Register this very day to finally bring some  needed reform to the EB-5 green card program.   As I mentioned in my remarks on this topic last week, this rule was  first proposed in January 2017. Those of us who want to reform the EB-5  program have been waiting 2\1/2\ years for this rule to become final,  and we have been waiting much, much longer than that for some  meaningful reforms to this fraudulent-laden program that we tried to  get enacted into law in previous Congresses and couldn't get done  because of being up against these very powerful, moneyed interests. I  think the President and his team deserve a lot of credit for pushing  these reforms across the finish line and getting a big win for rural  America.   As I have said on numerous occasions, Congress intended for the EB-5  program to help spur investment in rural and high-unemployment areas  when this program was established in 1990. Unfortunately, over the last  30 years, big-moneyed interests have been able to gerrymander EB-5  targeted employment areas in a way that redirected investment away from  our rural and economically deprived communities and towards major  development projects in Manhattan and other big cities. Therefore,  instead of providing much needed investment for rural America, as  originally intended, EB-5 has become a source of cheap foreign capital  for development projects in already prosperous areas of America.   For the first time, this rule will bring much needed change so that  condition cannot continue. Under the rule, States will no longer be  allowed to game and gerrymander targeted employment areas. Instead, the  Department of Homeland Security will make targeted employment area  designations directly based on revised requirements that will help to  ensure rural and high-unemployment areas get more of the investment  they have been deprived of for far too long under this program, as it  has been misdirected.   Again, this is a major win for rural America and high-unemployment  areas, and I want to sincerely thank President Trump and the people in  the administration who worked on this rule for making this happen and  looking out for the interests of my constituents in Iowa and other  rural States and for areas of high unemployment.   This rule also addresses the minimum investment threshold amounts  that are required for the EB-5 projects around the country.   This is the very first time the investment thresholds have been  adjusted since the program was created in 1990. Think of the inflation  since that time.   For projects that are outside of targeted employment areas, the  threshold will be raised from $1 million to $1.8 million. For projects  in targeted employment areas, the threshold will be raised from  $500,000 to $900,000. The minimum investment amount will be  automatically adjusted for inflation every 5 years.   It is ridiculous that our country's major green card program for  investors has been operating with investment amounts that haven't been  adjusted a single time in 30 years. That makes no sense, and I am glad  the President and his team have taken necessary action to restore a  little common sense to the EB-5 program.   There is more work that needs to be done on the EB-5 program, and we  will  [[Page S5037]]  have to do that by legislation, but the President and his  administration deserve a lot of credit for finally implementing these  first reforms that I and several other colleagues have championed for  years.   I, more than most, understand the power and influence that big- moneyed EB-5 interests have historically had in Washington, and how  they have used that power and influence to consistently thwart any  attempt to reform this program in such an obvious way that it is  needed.   Their unrelenting efforts to stymie EB-5 reform over the years  absolutely epitomize the swamp culture that so many voters rejected in  the last Presidential election, and getting rid of that swamp culture  is exactly what the President campaigned on. This is a perfect example  of his carrying out a campaign promise.   They are also representative of a culture in Washington that too  often disregards the interests of the little guy in rural Iowa in favor  of the interests of the rich and the powerful. Again, I applaud the  President and his team for standing up to these rich and powerful  interests.   I am happy to say that, with the publication of this rule, the little  guys in rural America finally got a win in the EB-5 program. I now look  forward to working with the President and my colleagues to build off of  this win and bring further reform to the EB-5 program in the future.  Thank you, President Trump.
