 Madam Speaker, San Diego County is home to over 230,000  veterans. Each year thousands of servicemembers exit the military and  choose to stay in San Diego. It has been one of my greatest priorities  in Congress to support those in the Armed Forces transitioning back  into civilian life. The transition can be tougher for some people than  for others. Many veterans struggle with mental health conditions like  post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury, and they may turn to  alcohol or drugs to deal with these mental health issues.   Studies have shown that the top two risk factors to becoming homeless  are mental health issues and substance use disorders. The next biggest  risk factor is economic insecurity. In expensive regions like ours,  rising housing costs can exacerbate these risks and drive up the rate  of homelessness. In our county we have over 1,000 veterans experiencing  homelessness. We have made serious progress, as my colleague, Mr. Hill,  said, here in Congress in reducing the number of veterans experiencing  homelessness primarily due to the HUD-VA Supportive Housing, or HUD- VASH, voucher program, which aims to serve chronically homeless  veterans. HUD-VASH recognizes housing first as the best way to end  homelessness and couples rental assistance with case management  services from the VA.   Since this partnership was forged between HUD and VA in 2019, the  rate of veteran homelessness has been cut in half. HUD-VASH works, and  I have spent the past several years supporting the program and looking  for ways to improve it.                                time  1745    One of those ways to improve this program is to expand eligibility  for those who don't have access to the program.   Currently, veterans with other than honorable discharges are not  eligible for HUD-VASH because, generally, they don't have access to VA  healthcare. A veteran could receive, I think as Chairwoman Waters  mentioned, an other than honorable discharge for administrative or  relatively minor reasons.   This eligibility gap prevents thousands of homeless veterans from  being housed while receiving critical supportive services. Now,  Congress has recognized the value of extending access to veterans for  other VA homelessness service programs. Two years ago, we allowed other  than honorable veterans to access the grant and per diem program for  transitional housing and supportive services for veteran families for  rapid rehousing.   This bill, my bill, the bipartisan Veteran HOUSE Act, closes this  gap. The legislation expands eligibility for the HUD-VASH program to  include veterans with other than honorable, but not dishonorable,  discharges.   We know how to end veteran homelessness. Several cities across the  country have already achieved functional zero. HUD-VASH is one of the  most vital tools we have to accomplish this goal, and we must make sure  more homeless veterans have access to this resource.   This bill will see that at least 1,300 additional veterans are  eventually served by HUD-VASH and will stop more homeless veterans from  falling through the cracks.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Financial Services Committee, particularly  Chairwoman Waters, Mr. Heck, and Mr. Stivers, for moving this bill  through their subcommittee. I also thank my colleagues on the House  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Chairman Takano and Chairman Levin, for  taking swift action on this bill last year. Both committees passed this  bill with unanimous support.   Finally, I thank all the local organizations in San Diego for  supporting this bill, as well as the National Alliance to End  Homelessness and many national veterans service organizations,  including The American Legion, the VFW, Disabled American Veterans, and  Paralyzed Veterans of America.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Veterans  HOUSE Act, and I call on the Senate to act on this bill to help more  homeless veterans.
