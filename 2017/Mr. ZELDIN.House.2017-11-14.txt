 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  legislation, which contains critical reforms that protect access to  affordable insurance, improves the way policyholders are treated when  filing a claim, and places the National Flood Insurance Program on the  path towards fiscal solvency.   Included in this legislation is the bipartisan bill I introduced with  Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney that provides a credit to NFIP  policyholders who reduce their flood risk through mitigation.  Homeowners who do the right thing and invest in mitigation activities  deserve a strong return on their investment in the form of lower NFIP  premiums.   On Long Island, where the coastal economy is our main economy,  protecting life and property from flood damage is a top priority.   I look forward to working with all my colleagues in Congress to get  this bill passed in the Senate and sent to the President's desk without  delay.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this essential legislation, grateful  for Chairman Hensarling's and Chairman Duffy's leadership on this  issue, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), the chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus and a long time leader on flood insurance  issues.
