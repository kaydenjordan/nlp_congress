 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Reed, as  the chair and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it  is our honor to pay tribute to a great leader and senior executive of  the Department of Defense, Mr. Robert R. Hood.   Mr. Hood has served as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Legislative Affairs from August 2017 to July 2020. As he prepares to  leave this position to enter into the private sector, we commend him  for his sound leadership, advice, and professional judgement on  numerous critical issues of enduring importance to the Department of  Defense, Congress, and this Nation.   Mr. Hood has served our Nation for more than 18 years in various  capacities within the Federal Government. His service to our Nation  includes roles as a professional staff member for the House Committee  on Science, as well as senior legislative assistant, senior policy  advisor, and assistant to the Speaker of the House of Representatives  for policy. Mr. Hood also served 5 years as the Director of  Congressional Affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration,  a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy.   Mr. Hood previously served in the White House as special assistant to  President George W. Bush in the Office of Legislative Affairs,  overseeing coordination with the Senate, including the Armed Services,  Homeland Security, Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees.  Before working on the White House staff, Mr. Hood served at the  Pentagon as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Legislative Affairs, where he was responsible for promoting the  policies, strategies, and budget of the Department of Defense to the  U.S. Congress. Mr. Hood also served as the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense, Comptroller, for Budget and Appropriations Affairs, working  closely with the Appropriations Committees of the Congress.   For the past 3 years as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Legislative Affairs, Mr. Hood deftly managed and guided the  Department's congressional relations, ensuring the preparation of key  senior leaders for Senate confirmations, congressional hearings, and  briefings, while simultaneously developing and leading a skilled and  focused legislative affairs team. His leadership, knowledge, and  personal efforts greatly contributed to one of the most successful  legislative years in Department history, culminating with the  establishment of the U.S. Space Force, which was signed into law on  December 20, 2019 as part of the fiscal year 2020 NDAA.   Mr. Hood provided significant contributions and leadership during the  development and execution of the Secretary of Defense's Congressional  Engagement Strategy, ensuring an integrated legislative program  directly aligned with the National Defense Strategy. This comprehensive  plan supported the Department's priorities, aligned legislative  objectives to the congressional calendar, and guided the execution of  over 4,000 congressional engagements within the Office of the Secretary  of Defense and oversight and alignment of over 10,000 congressional  engagements across the Department during his 3-year tenure. The  strategic execution of these engagements directly led to the attainment  of Department of Defense legislative priorities and resourcing at  historic levels in the fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 National  Defense Authorization Acts, NDAAs, appropriations bills.   On behalf of the Senate, we thank Robert, his wife Jennifer, and his  children: Evan, Caroline, Megan, and Emma, for their continued  commitment, sacrifice and contribution to this great Nation. We join  our colleagues in wishing him future success as he transitions into the  private sector.                            ____________________
