 Madam Speaker, over the last 30 years I have been a poll  worker, an election judge, an election protection lawyer, and a civics  educator working to protect the right to vote.   I have seen firsthand the flaws in our system that prevent Americans  from participating in our democracy. Voter suppression tactics, the  influence of dark money, gerrymandering, and other anti-democratic  practices have all disenfranchised voters.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, voters have been victim of such  tactics for years. But many Americans have made clear that we want a  government for the people and by the people, and House Democrats are  answering that call.   I am particularly proud that my bills to increase access for voters  with disabilities, bring transparency to inaugural funds, and increase  the availability of ballot drop boxes have all been included in this  legislation. I am also hopeful that my amendment to increase access to  early voting for college students will also be included.   H.R. 1 will strengthen our democracy and ensure that the power in our  government rests with the people.
