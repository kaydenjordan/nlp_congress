 Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No.  320, No. 321, and No. 322 due to my spouse's health situation in  California. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on the  Krishnamoorthi Amendment. I would have also voted ``nay'' on the  Davidson Amendment. I would have also voted ``yea'' on the Final  Passage of H.R. 2842--Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act.                            ____________________
