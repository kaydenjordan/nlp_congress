 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member  for allowing me to have this opportunity to speak about this amendment.   The amendment allows military towns who are on the bubble of  eligibility for USDA rural development programs the ability to apply  for loans and grants for their communities.   Given the transitory nature of military service, town populations  change frequently and having this buffer will allow otherwise  ineligible communities to have the ability to apply and compete for  assistance in funding critical facilities such as fire departments,  hospitals, and children's centers.                                time  1915    Allowing these communities to compete for financial assistance does  not increase spending for these programs. We are probably only talking  about four military towns at this point. So these towns are in the  rural part of America, and, again, we are just saying that they should  have the ability to compete.   That is the amendment, the best I can explain it, and I ask for  support of the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
