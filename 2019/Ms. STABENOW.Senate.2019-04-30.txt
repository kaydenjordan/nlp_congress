 Madam President, today I wish to pay special  tribute to Olivet College in Eaton County, which this year is  celebrating 175 years of educating the people of Michigan.   Let's think back to 1844. Michigan had been a State for only 7 years.  The very first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls in New York  was still 4 years away, and it would be another 19 years before  President Lincoln would sign the Emancipation Proclamation.   It was an era marked by gender and racial inequality; yet a group of  leaders led by ``Father'' John J. Shipherd had a different vision: a  college founded on the values of inclusion, mutual respect, honesty,  and integrity, a Christian institution where neither gender, nor race,  nor lack of financial resources would prevent people from attaining an  education.   This was a radical idea. Coeducation--women and men learning  alongside one another in the same classrooms--was rare at the time, so  was admitting Black students alongside White students and poor students  alongside the affluent.   It was so controversial, in fact, that Olivet College wasn't formally  chartered by the State until 1859. Then in 1863, in the midst of the  Civil War, the college honored its first graduating class: Mary N.  Barber, Sara Benedict, and Sophia A. Keys.   One hundred seventy-five years later, a lot has changed, but Olivet  College's core values remain the same.   Those values include diversity. Comets come from all across Michigan  and the United States and nine other nations around the world. Half are  the first person in their families to go to college, and half come from  low-income families. About 1 in 3 Comets are students of color.   Those values include inclusivity. That is a special focus of the  Olivet College Women's Leadership Institute, which helps young women  from middle school through college recognize and cultivate their unique  strengths and abilities and become Michigan's and America's next  generation of leaders.   Those values include community. Comets aren't just responsible for  their own education. Whether they are sharing perspectives in the  classroom, working together to score a goal on the soccer field, or  combining their voices in the Olivet College Gospel Choir, students are  committed to the growth of others.   Those values include service; 100 percent of Comets take part in  service learning, where students use what they have learned in the  classroom to solve real-life problems both in the community and around  the world. Just as it did in 1844, Olivet College understands that the  future of humanity rests in the hands, hearts, and minds of those who  will accept responsibility for themselves and others.   The founders of Olivet College once wrote this: ``We wish simply to  do good to our students, by placing in their hands the means of  intellectual, moral and spiritual improvement, and to teach them the  divine art and science of doing good to others.''   Doing good to others--since 1844, Olivet College has been doing just  that. Congratulations to students, faculty, staff, and alumni on your  first 175 years.   Thank you.                            ____________________
