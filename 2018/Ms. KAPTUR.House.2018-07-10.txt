 Mr. Speaker, this week, America's closest allies have  come together to discuss issues critical to our common security at the  2018 NATO Summit.   In these challenging times, with serious global threats, we must  affirm our commitment to NATO. Liberty's defense requires strong bonds  with proven allies.   Sadly and needlessly, our President's wishy-washy statements  regarding the transatlantic alliance have already led to uncertainty  and discomfort among our allies. How counterproductive.   Instead of strengthening bridges among freedom-loving nations, our  President has derided our closest allies. He has cozied up to Vladimir  Putin and North Korea's dictator, even inviting Russia back into the G7  Group.   Putin's murderous regime is waging an illegal war in Ukraine, killing  over 10,000 Ukrainians already, displacing millions, and actively seeks  to undermine our democratic institutions and alliances.   This President's dangerous behavior is weakening U.S. leadership and  global security. NATO has brought peace and security to liberty-loving  nations. We must be clearly resolute in our defense of liberty, and to  that end, NATO.                            ____________________
