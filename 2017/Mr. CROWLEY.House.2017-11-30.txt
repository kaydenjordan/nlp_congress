 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 636         Resolved, That until otherwise provided by the House, the       authority of the ranking minority member of the Committee on       the Judiciary shall be exercised by the minority member of       the Committee who, prior to the adoption of this resolution,       ranked immediately below the ranking minority member.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
