 Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming, and I ask  unanimous consent that he be able to resume as soon as I finish my  remarks.    Now, in America, Mr. President, we have always kept a  basic promise: We pay our debts on time without exception. It has been  a key to our economic success and our standing in the global markets  across the world. Today, it is time for us in this Chamber to do our  jobs and make sure those promises remain unbroken.   In order to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States,  the Senate must act and, by the end of this week, send a bill to  President Biden's desk suspending the debt ceiling and allowing our  government to keep paying its bills and meeting our outstanding  obligations.   Later this afternoon, the Senate will vote on cloture on the House- passed message that would suspend the debt ceiling through December  2022. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will then vote to pass this  bill on a simple majority basis.   Democrats have been clear from the start: We are going to do the  responsible thing and vote to allow the United States to keep paying  its bills. Every single one of us is going to vote for cloture this  afternoon.   For months, Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans have insisted  they want a solution to the debt ceiling but only if Democrats do all  the work by themselves. We have already presented Republicans with  numerous opportunities to do what they say they want, including  offering a simple majority vote so Democrats can suspend the debt  ceiling on our own, as Republicans have asked, but each time,  Republicans have chosen obstruction and have kept us, unfortunately, on  a path to default. Republican obstruction on the debt ceiling over the  last few weeks has been reckless; it has been irresponsible.   Nonetheless, today, Republicans will have an opportunity to get  exactly what they have kept asking for. The first and easiest option is  this: Republicans can simply get out of the way, and we can agree to  skip the filibuster vote so we can proceed to final passage of this  bill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, good morning.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the motion to concur in  the House amendment to S. 1301, occur on Thursday, October 7, at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with  the Republican leader.    Mr. President, we have been negotiating all afternoon  and all night, just until recently. We are making good progress. We are  not there yet, but I hope we can come to an agreement tomorrow morning.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4981, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  three times and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 409, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, October 7; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; and that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:10 a.m., adjourned until  Thursday, October 7, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
