 Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of  the house and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   On September 30, as the House of Representatives met to consider  legislation to avoid a government shutdown, Representative Jamaal  Bowman of New York knowingly pulled a fire alarm to cause chaos and  stop the House from doing its business. This is a felony, plain and  simple. It is not difficult to understand.   Capitol Police were forced to waste resources investigating rather  than doing their job to keep the Capitol safe. USCP determined Bowman  broke the law, and he was indicted by the Attorney General of the  District of Columbia. Realizing no number of excuses could get him out  of this, Mr. Bowman pled guilty.   As a former principal of the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action in  New York City, Mr. Bowman should know the consequences of pulling a  fire alarm to cause panic. In New York schools, the policy is clear.  When a student commits a crime on campus, police are called, and that  student is either suspended or expelled.   One would think Representative Bowman would be able to hold himself  to the same standards as he held his students to. I don't think that is  a lot to ask.   The Republican majority held our own former Member accountable after  the House Ethics Committee found he engaged in criminal behavior. It  would be hypocritical for the House Democrats to not join us in holding  one of their own Members accountable who actually pled guilty to  breaking the law.   I do not submit this resolution lightly, Mr. Speaker. Article I,  Section 5 of our Constitution gives the House the solemn responsibility  to discipline Members for disorderly behavior. As conviction  demonstrates, Representative Bowman sought to cause panic to delay  official proceedings of this House.   I urge my fellow Members to vote ``yes'' on my resolution and to hold  our colleagues accountable when they break the law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    To use that logic, then all those people should have just said  ``sorry,'' and we would move on, right?   No, we don't do that.   Let me tell you, I take a little bit of offense to ``What the hell is  wrong with you?'' I will tell you, there is nothing wrong with me. I  took an oath to defend the Constitution, and that is exactly what I am  going to do. I am not going to apologize for it. I am going to hold the  Constitution. It is very simple. We really shouldn't even have this  debate. If you break the law and you follow due process, there are  consequences to your actions, even if you say ``sorry.''   We can try all of the diversion tactics that we would like. It  doesn't change the fact that someone broke the law and that someone  should be held accountable. It is disappointing, Mr. Speaker, that  their own party can't hold them accountable, that they have such  hypocrisy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my friend from New York (Ms.  Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Burlison).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, although your district may appreciate all of those  accomplishments, are we supposed to just forget about the crime that  you committed?   Perhaps, in education, maybe we should have studied a little harder.  If you commit a crime, there is a penalty to that crime. You don't get  to say: I committed a crime, but I did all these good things. All these  good things erase this crime over here. It doesn't work that way.   Again, I will say that it is not profoundly stupid to hold up the  Constitution. The left may believe holding up the rights of the  Constitution is profoundly stupid. I don't believe we do. I will again  say that this hearing and this censure is not profoundly stupid. It is  actually a hearing of where we followed the law.   Mr. Speaker, the other fact that I may want to correct--I will  correct the truth with maybe the other half of the truth--is  ``immediately'' means right away. So when you say, ``I immediately''  took action, ``I immediately''--well, the incident occurred  on September 30. October 26 was when you pled guilty. I think that is a  little bit longer than immediately. Again, maybe math wasn't my best  subject either.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Alford).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Lawler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I agree. I wish we didn't have to be here.  We should, as most sports teams do, clean up our own locker room. That  would be the best-case scenario, as we actually did with a member of  our Conference. We cleaned up our own locker room. It would be nice if  the other side would clean up theirs.   So, I agree with you, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. I loved your ``My Cousin  Vinny'' analogy. That was funny, but this isn't a funny thing. It was  good, but this isn't funny.   You committed a crime to try to disrupt a proceeding. This is  serious. I think it is a little more serious than jaywalking when you  try to disrupt the business of the House.   Again, I wish we weren't here because I wish you all would clean up  your own locker room so we could really get on to the people's  business. We can do both.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms.  Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I would just remind you that we talk about  baseless claims. If I am not mistaken, Capitol Police did an  investigation, referred it to the District of Columbia that did an  investigation, and Representative Bowman pled guilty to a crime. I  don't think that is baseless. In fact, I think that is basis for crime  and that is basis for this censure. Because baseless means you have no  cause, Mr. Speaker, and I think the mere fact that Mr. Bowman pled  guilty isn't baseless. It is basis for a crime.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, therein lies the problem. I am one of the  so-called MAGA Republicans which, again, I don't apologize for.   Under MAGA Republican leadership, I might remind everybody, crime was  down--or excuse me, crime was up--crime was down under the last  administration. Clearly, crime was down. The economy was up.   All of these problems that we are dealing with in this Congress  today, Mr. Speaker, have been created by the Biden administration and  created by my friends on the left. That is the truth. Those are the  facts.   Under the MAGA Republicans, how many wars were we fighting overseas?  Zero. What was the crime rate? Down. Again, we have some serious  problems since the Democrats, this administration, took office, and  therein lies the problem.   You want to talk about law and order. You want to talk about Cagney &  Lacey and Ace Ventura, that is cute. That is cute.   Mr. Speaker, you want to talk about a disgrace to this body? Doing  investigative work and actually following due process, that is what we  are supposed to do. That is what I thought we did.   I will not apologize for following law and order, but under the  Democrats' law and order, you shouldn't go through any investigation.  You should just on a whim do some impeachment. That is what the other  side of the aisle does.   We clean up our locker room, but when you commit a crime, it is  unfortunate that we have to bring this to the table. As much as they  want to compare us and call us names, they can continue to do that, but  the facts speak for themselves. We waited until an investigation was  completed before we brought this censure resolution. We  [[Page H6196]]  didn't do it on a whim. That is law and order. If that is Cagney &  Lacey, following due process, perhaps, Mr. Speaker, my friends on the  other side of the aisle could use a little investigative reporting and  some detective work themselves.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time for  closing.    Mr. Speaker, we need to be accountable to this body.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in case my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle need clarification, I want to make it clear, the American  people know that they are not better off than they were 4 years ago,  and they know it is Democrats in this Congress and the White House that  have put them in this anguish as we see today, just to clear things up.   All we have heard from congressional Democrats is excuse after excuse  for Representative Bowman's criminal behavior. I daresay, Mr. Speaker,  that if a Republican did what Mr. Bowman did, that every single Member  on the Democratic side would be down here calling for censure, if not  expulsion.   Mr. Bowman himself, despite pleading guilty, said it was an accident.  How? Someone looks at a sign that says ``Fire'' and thinks, hmm, I  wonder what this will do?   Mr. Chairman, I urge everyone to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, by the direction of the House Republican  Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 913         Resolved, That the following Members be, and are hereby,       elected to the following standing committees of the House of       Representatives:         Committee on Appropriations: Mr. Edwards.         Committee on Armed Services: Mr. Gooden of Texas.         Committee on Oversight and Accountability: Mr. Cloud (to       rank immediately after Mr. Grothman) and Mr. Waltz.         Committee on Small Business: Ms. Maloy.         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure: Ms. Maloy.    Mrs. McCLAIN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the clerk be  authorized to make technical corrections in the engrossment of H.R.  5933, to include corrections in spelling, punctuation, section  numbering and cross-referencing, and the insertion of appropriate  headings.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
