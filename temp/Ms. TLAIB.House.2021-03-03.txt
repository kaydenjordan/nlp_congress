 Madam Speaker, I rise today in loving memory of Aiyana  Jones, who was only 7 years old when she was killed by Detroit police.   The fact that the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act could have  been named after countless other people murdered by police shows that  this is long overdue. It is important to note this bill is a start, not  the end, of our movement to transform what it means to feel safe in our  country.   We must demand true accountability, justice, and reparations for the  generations of police brutality against our Black communities. We must  invest in the social programs that we know will give our communities  the opportunity to thrive.   This is the justice that Aiyana Jones and George Floyd and many other  lives lost to police violence deserve.
