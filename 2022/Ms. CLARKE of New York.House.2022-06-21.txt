 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman  from Houston, Texas, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, for anchoring us  this evening as we commemorate Caribbean American Heritage Month.   Let me acknowledge our chairwoman, Joyce Beatty, and, of course,  Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who speaks for me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud Caribbean American and on behalf  of my fellow Americans of Caribbean descent in celebration and  recognition of the National Caribbean American Heritage Month.   Let me take this opportunity to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee for  her vision in establishing this designation of Caribbean American  Heritage Month in June 2006.   I rise today to honor the tremendous contributions Caribbean  Americans have made and continue to make in the building of our great  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, our contributions are not just reflected in the tapestry  of American culture. They are brightly reflected in the heritage of  this Nation's first woman Vice President, Kamala Harris. It is  reflected in the first African-American woman to serve in Congress, my  predecessor, the Honorable Shirley Chisholm.   Mr. Speaker, the list of noble Caribbean Americans is too long to  list, and so I rise today as a proud Caribbean-American representative  of our sheer glory and significance in American history.   I rise today to remind the world of the continued excellence  demonstrated by Caribbean Americans in every sector of our civil  society. From government to the private sector, to entertainment and  sports, Caribbean Americans continue to exemplify a unique distinction  of creativity, innovation, and excellence that engenders a deep sense  of pride in our accomplishments.   Let me be clear: We essentially represent our homes of origin as de  facto goodwill ambassadors while, simultaneously, we represent some of  the best talent that the United States has to offer.   Having a month to highlight our tremendous contributions gives us a  special perspective on the collective benefit of such a diverse people  of African descent, Latin, Asian, and the European diaspora.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give honorable mention to one of the  Founding Fathers of our Nation, Alexander Hamilton, born in the  Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.   I rise today to sanctify the Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey, a proud  Caribbean man from the island nation of Jamaica who formed one of the  largest Pan-Africanist movements in our Nation's history. I rise today  to call for justice, his exoneration, and his rightful place in our  American history.   I rise today on behalf of our ancestors of Caribbean descent, in  recognition and in celebration of National Caribbean American Heritage  Month.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark this moment on June 22, 2022, to honor  and reflect on the lives and contributions of all those who planted the  seeds of freedom and prosperity, knowing that they would never live  long enough to feel the liberating power of the freedom they fostered.  Their fight, now our fight for justice, fairness, equality, and equity,  is certainly not over, but thanks to their legacies, the perpetual  contributions of Caribbean Americans manifested through us in this  generation, we are on our way to fulfilling the American dreams of our  ancestors.  [[Page H5729]]    Mr. Speaker, as we mark the 16th anniversary of the National  Caribbean American Heritage Month, it is with a profound sense of  gratitude that we will finally have this opportunity to celebrate our  history, heritage, and unique place on our American journey and in our  American journey.   During the month of June, we are blessed to celebrate the freedom of  Juneteenth and commemorate the lives sacrificed through the indignities  of human bondage. But we reclaim the human dignity afforded to the  waves of Caribbean immigrants who have been a beneficiary and  significant part of the battle from the very foundation of our Nation's  existence.   We use the month of June to educate and acknowledge our rightful  place in American history.                                time  2045
