 Madam President, I come to the floor as a proud Member of  this Chamber of the Senate and as someone who believes earnestly in our  role in our country's constitutional order. I am on the floor because a  real and significant challenge to this body and each of our Members is  potentially in the very near future.   Right now, the House of Representatives is holding an impeachment  inquiry, focused on grave and significant charges against our President  related to the very threats to our democracy of foreign interference  that our Founders feared the most. I am not here to argue over whether  President Trump's actions deserve impeachment or perhaps even removal  from office. It is, I think, inappropriate to reach that point.  Instead, I am here today, as the inquiry proceeds in the House, to urge  my colleagues in the Senate--Republicans, Independents, and Democrats-- to take seriously the moment we are in and the tests we may have soon  ahead as a Senate when we will need to uphold and defend the role of  this institution.   I am on the floor to issue a challenge to all of my colleagues. If an  impeachment trial does take place in the Senate, all of us must decide  to approach it as Americans--less as people representing any parochial  or partisan or particular interest, less as Democrats or Republicans or  Independents, and instead as Senators. If we are called to serve as  jurors in an impeachment trial, all of us must show our Nation and the  world that this body--that this institution--has not been completely  overtaken by the divisive political era in which we live. Nothing less  than the Senate's very legitimacy will be at stake.   Our Founders warned about the challenge of this moment. They warned  specifically that foreign powers improperly influencing our American  Government were, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, ``the most deadly  adversaries of republican government.'' This is why our Constitution  entrusts Congress with the enormous power of potential removal through  impeachment.   James Madison called impeachment ``indispensable . . . for defending  the Community [against] the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the  chief Magistrate''--a reference to the President. Alexander Hamilton  argued that the Senate was the proper body to hold an impeachment  trial. The Founders entrusted us to protect our country from ``the  misconduct of public men'' and ``the abuse or violation of some public  trust.''   George Mason put forward the precise language that appears in our  Constitution, the language of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' and  urged that impeachment must be a remedy to remove even a President,  asking: ``Shall any man be above Justice?'' Our Founders insisted that  no one--no one--in our Nation, in our constitutional order, not even  our President, is above the law. This fundamental principle remains the  very linchpin of our government.   Based on what we know today from press reports about the President's  actions and from notes of a conversation, I believe it is critical that  the House conduct a thorough impeachment inquiry. If the House does  vote impeachment articles, Members of the Senate will have to live up  to the responsibilities which the Framers of our Nation entrusted to  us. The eyes of history will be upon us.   Let me be clear. I am not saying that if the House should vote  articles of impeachment, it will be the Senate's duty to vote to remove  him. It will be, instead, the responsibility of every single Senator to  carry out their duty to serve as impartial jurors with their principle  focus--their oath--to uphold and defend the Constitution and nothing  else informing our decisions.  [[Page S6226]]    This is a challenge to all of my colleagues. Both Republicans and  Democrats must appreciate the gravity of this process as we call on our  colleagues to do the same. Democrats, equally with Republicans, must  not allow our vigorous disagreements with this President and our  colleagues to influence our judgment and cloud it. We have to  understand that this process--this likely future moment--is far more  important than our own individual political fortunes. An impeachment  trial of a President would be a true test of the integrity and  capabilities of the Senate--our commitment to follow the facts, to  consider the evidence, and to apply the rule of law. It will be a test  that we, as a body, cannot afford to fail.   It is important to begin the process of establishing what that  process might look like as soon as there are impeachment articles, if  that is the direction the House takes. The basic rules are clear as  stated in the Constitution: The House is given the ``sole power of  impeachment,'' and the Senate ``the sole power to try,'' as jury, ``all  impeachments.'' If the House votes to impeach, the Senate must conduct  a trial and either convict by two-thirds or acquit on whatever counts  are presented.   At that trial, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court will  preside; the House managers will present the case; the President's  counsel presents his defense; and the Senators serve as the jury. The  manner in which our leaders, Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer,  direct the Senate in the event of a trial will be the most important  test in a generation of whether our Senate remains capable of enforcing  the law, living up to the Constitution, and upholding the  responsibilities our Founders bestowed upon us.   I will remind you of the opening vote in the Senate of the  impeachment trial for President Clinton. The vote that set the rules  under which that trial would proceed was unanimous. It was 100 to 0. An  impeachment trial, should it come in the near future here, must not be  gamed or politicized or subjected to brinksmanship, and any trial  should be governed by rules that are passed on a broad and bipartisan  basis, animated by justice over partisanship.   In many ways, an impeachment trial would mean that our institution of  the Senate would itself also be on trial. We as a body need to show the  American people and the world that we are more than just 100 elected  politicians who have been brought here by partisan whim or by a bare  majority of our States but, instead, by a body whose sum is much more  than its individual parts. We must act as stewards together for our  democracy. History is watching us, all of us--Democrats, Independents,  Republicans. How we respond will shape and impact our Senate and our  Nation for years to come.   In the days, weeks, or months to come, I hope my colleagues will rise  to the challenges we face, deliberate with an eye toward history, an  ear toward our constituents, and a heart focused on our Constitution,  and prove that, in this body, we answer to the Constitution, not to any  particular or partisan loyalty to our President or to any other elected  official. The health of our very institutions and of democracy itself  is at stake.                        Remembering Sonia Schorr Sloan    Madam President, in my home State of Delaware, we have just lost a  dear friend and a remarkable leader.   Sonia Schorr Sloan was a force of nature. ``Sonny,'' as we  affectionately called her, dedicated her life to confronting social  injustices, and her activism, her philanthropy, her mentorship, and her  public service made my home State of Delaware a better place for  everyone. So I rise to celebrate and honor her work, her spirit, and  her impact on so many of us.   Her story began on April 1, 1928. She was born in Wilmington, DE, to  parents Sigmund and Rosalia Schorr. Sigmund Schorr was a well-known  Wilmingtonian haberdasher, who was elected to the Delaware General  Assembly and later served for many years as president of the New Castle  County Board of Elections. Rosalia, her mother, worked as a public  schoolteacher and was very active with community and civic groups, like  the Young Women's Hebrew Association and the Gardeners Guild of the  Arden Club. Sonny credited her parents for raising her in an atmosphere  of active community involvement.   Throughout her life, she was exceptionally bright and gifted. As an  honors graduate of Wilmington High School, she pursued a bachelor's  degree in bacteriology and graduated magna cum laude from Syracuse  University in 1949. She was accepted to Jefferson Medical College in  Philadelphia, where she earned her master's degree in microbiology. She  was the very first woman to graduate from Jefferson in its 125-year  history and was the first student to complete graduate work there.  After teaching several years at Temple University School of Medicine,  she became the very first woman hired by DuPont to work in the  prestigious central research department in Wilmington, which is where  many great inventions were made.   While at DuPont, she got involved with the Young Democrats and met  fellow scientist Gilbert Jacob Sloan of nearby Fairfax. Sonny and Gil,  who were, frankly, inseparable for the rest of their lives, fell in  love. A few years later, they were married at Temple Beth Emeth on  Memorial Day of 1957. Together, they raised two wonderful sons, Victor  and Jonathan.   During this period, Sonny became more and more involved with local  community groups and political organizations. Sonny's commitment to  public service was a hallmark of her life. She was a skilled and  forceful advocate, a tireless campaign organizer, and a relentless  fundraiser for community groups and campaigns alike. Whether it seemed  doable or not, when she saw a need, she would fill it.   When people felt like Delaware needed a more active advocacy  organization or they were concerned about civil liberties and civil  justice and civil rights, Sonny and others founded and launched the  Delaware Chapter of the ACLU. When she became increasingly concerned  about the restrictions on access to reproductive rights, she launched  and ran a capital campaign to build a brandnew facility for Planned  Parenthood of Delaware. She was involved in the creation and launch of  an AmeriCorps program, Public Allies of Delaware, and the Cancer  Support Community of Delaware. She was involved in so many different  civic and community organizations and in so many campaigns that they  are more than I could relate in my time on the floor.   Her legacy of service to our State, which began more than 60 years  ago, steadily grew over the next 50, 60 years. She eventually formed  her own fundraising firm, and according to Sonny, it raised over $100  million for various nonprofits and agencies. She was able to pick and  choose the causes she championed and didn't do anything for which she  lacked passion. Her work touched our whole community, from the Food  Bank of Delaware and the West End Neighborhood House to the YWCA of  Delaware and the Delaware College of Art and Design.   Besides supporting these many causes, Sonny invested in the people in  whom she believed. She was a mentor from the very first days of when a  young, then-29-year-old Joe Biden launched his campaign first for  county council and then for the U.S. Senate, and she played a central  role in Joe Biden's first election in 1972 to this body. Sonia Sloan  mentored countless other people and dozens of other elected officials,  not just my predecessor and the Vice President. She was a mentor to  this young candidate as well when I first ran for office.   Equally, if not more importantly, she was a tireless and engaged  mentor for folks no one has heard of--folks not elected but folks in  need. She was a mentor for a young man who had just been released from  our local juvenile detention center. Sonny helped him get a State  identification card, helped him get a new job, and helped him get a new  bicycle--a reliable means of transportation. She helped him, mentored  him, and supported him until he was able to get back on his feet.   She recorded books for the blind. At one point, she even agreed to  put up the deed of her own home to bail out a Vietnam war protester  from jail. These were the sorts of things Sonny did that many have  never heard of.    She won too many awards in our State to name, but she was inducted  into the Hall of Fame of Delaware Women. Yet she wasn't the sort of  person to hold up these accomplishments.  [[Page S6227]]  Aside from her civic engagements, she loved to run and was often seen  jogging around Rockford Park, which is near my home. She adored cooking  for her family; she collected stamps; she could play the flute and  piano; and she loved to read.   Upon learning that Sonny had passed away at age 91, one friend  remarked that Sonny still had so many stories to share and so much  energy and passion to give.   Another friend called her a beacon of light and a pillar of courage  whose light will shine for many years to come.   She never stopped taking a chance on young candidates and on first- time candidates.   A friend of mine, recently elected State Senator Laura Sturgeon,  said: Sonny Sloan took a chance on me, even though I had no political  experience, name recognition, or resources. Once people heard she was  in my corner, endorsements and support poured in. I am who I am because  of my parents, but I am where I am, representing the Fourth District in  the State Senate, because of Sonia Sloan.   It is clear that she accomplished many firsts, broke many barriers,  and paved endless paths for many people. She had strong and passionate  feelings about countless issues, but the empowerment of women, the  election of women to office, and the advancement of women in our  society was absolutely at the forefront.   As she so often said, ``Women's issues are not just women's issues;  they are everybody's issues.''   One of the last times I got to see Sonny was at a dinner in her honor  in March of this year. It was there that I joined hundreds of friends  and neighbors to recognize her legacy of service, from her efforts to  end the Vietnam war to her advocacy for women's rights. She lived her  life committed to a deep belief she shared with many of us--to focus on  what you can do to change just one life for the better because, as the  Talmud teaches, when you change one life, you can change the world.  Sonny did that thousands of times.   She was tough and determined, funny and smart. She never hesitated to  offer very direct input to those of us she knew needed correction or  direction, but she could equally offer compelling and comforting  advice. She has been and will continue to be that voice of conscience  inside my head, challenging me not to settle for the easy but to push  for what seems difficult or even impossible.   Her dedication for fighting for justice was rivaled only by her  tireless love for Gil, Victor, Jonathan, her five granddaughters, and  five great-grandchildren. She was the best of what we are as  Delawareans. Her sharp intelligence, her fierce resolve, and her  unwavering dedication to people and causes will be impossible to  replace.   So, to Sonny, I wish to say: We will all miss you--family, friends,  neighbors, and the thousands whose lives you have touched. You have  affected the lives of countless Delawareans. I am truly grateful to  have known you and to have been a part of your work to make our State  and our world a better place. You will forever have my deepest thanks.   Back in October of 1969, in concluding an anti-war rally, Sonia read  a Jewish prayer with some touching and, I think, fitting final words:         Bless our country, that it may always be a stronghold of       peace, and its advocate among the nations. May contentment       reign within its border, health and happiness within its       homes. Strengthen the bonds of friendship among the       inhabitants of all lands, and may the love of Your name       hallow every home and every heart.    These are touching and fitting words.   Sonny, bless you and thank you.   I yield the floor.
