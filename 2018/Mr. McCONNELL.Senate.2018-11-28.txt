 Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  key members of the administration will be coming to the Senate at 11  a.m. this morning for an all-Members briefing with respect to Yemen and  Saudi Arabia.   Senators on both sides of the aisle have legitimate concerns about  the war in Yemen, the terrible humanitarian plight of Yemeni citizens  caught in the crossfire, and the multiple U.S. interests wrapped up in  this conflict.   The U.S.-Saudi relationship is a longstanding and critical one, but  Senators on both sides of the aisle also have legitimate concerns about  the recent conduct of the Saudi Government. All of us want to see our  critical foreign partners behave responsibly. I have been encouraged to  hear both Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo call for an end to the  war in Yemen and for accountability following the murder of Jamal  Khashoggi. So I look forward to hearing from both Secretaries today and  learning more about the administration's strategy to achieve these and  other important objectives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there is a lot more work to do. That  has been our message after returning from the Thanksgiving holiday. The  Senate is staying focused on wrapping up this year's remaining  priorities: getting more of the President's team in place, confirming  well-qualified nominees to our Federal courts, and attending to the  pressing legislative business the American people need and expect us to  handle.   Yesterday, the nomination of Stephen Vaden to serve as general  counsel at the Department of Agriculture was confirmed with bipartisan  support, and the motion to advance the nomination of Karen Kelley for  Deputy Secretary of Commerce was cleared by an even wider margin.   But these important steps haven't always come easily. As I mentioned  yesterday, between the day the Vaden nomination was favorably reported  by our colleagues on the Agriculture Committee and yesterday's  confirmation vote, 351 days elapsed--351 days on the Executive  Calendar.   These stories are similar for so many of the President's well- qualified nominees: Needless delays, a recordbreaking number of cloture  votes, and then many go on to clear this Chamber with bipartisan  support. In some cases that support is nearly unanimous, but my  Democratic colleagues made this body drag its feet regardless.   We will press on and continue this week to make progress and put to  rest the various outstanding items that have to be completed before the  end of the 115th Congress.   Today, the Senate will vote to confirm Karen Kelley to serve as  Deputy Secretary of Commerce. By any metric, Ms. Kelley has the  experience and economic acumen to continue a record of outstanding  service in that role--a record she has already begun by serving capably  in her acting capacity since last year. I hope each of my colleagues  will join me in voting to confirm her.  [[Page S7148]]    Then the Senate will turn to consideration of the judicial nominee,  Thomas Farr, to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of  North Carolina.   Mr. Farr is a graduate of Hillsdale College, Emory Law School, and  Georgetown University. Over a nearly 40-year career in law, he has  developed expertise in labor relations and constitutional law. The  American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal  Judiciary--a body that has frequently been held up by our Democratic  colleagues as the gold standard--has awarded Mr. Farr its highest  possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified.''   Our friend, Senator Burr, has testified that his fellow North  Carolinian has ``the requisite expertise, character and judgment  required for the federal bench'' and that ``he will serve in this role  honorably.''   I urge all of our colleagues to join me in voting to advance his  nomination later today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
