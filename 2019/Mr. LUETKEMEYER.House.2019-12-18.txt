 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  this political charade that has tormented our country for nearly 3  years.   If there was ever any doubt that this entire illegitimate  investigation is 100 percent politically motivated, earlier this month,  Speaker Pelosi actually admitted the impeachment process began 2\1/2\  years ago.   Let me say that again. The Speaker of the House said publicly that  the Democrats have been trying to remove our President from office  since the day he got elected, simply because it was not the outcome  they wanted.   Another of my Democrat colleagues publicly admitted, in May, that the  driving force behind their actions was: ``If we don't impeach the  President, he will get reelected.''   This wasn't an investigation, Madam Speaker; this was a political  crusade. In order to arrive at their Stalinistic, predetermined  conclusion, House Democrats spent the last several months staging well- rehearsed hearings where the charges were drawn up by their own focus  groups; Democrat donors served as witnesses; and Democrat staff served  as judge and jury.   Even with the odds so blatantly stacked against the President,  Democrats still came up with absolutely nothing.   A while ago, the Speaker spoke of the Pledge of Allegiance. The last  phrase of the pledge is ``justice for all.''   Justice was not something afforded the President during the  investigation. He was denied due process, something the Supreme Court  said should be afforded in all congressional investigations. That makes  this process illegal and illegitimate.   What a shame. What a sham.
