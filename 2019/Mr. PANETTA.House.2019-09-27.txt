 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my Democratic and  Republican colleagues to present to you, to present to this body, a  trophy that recognizes something that hasn't been done in over a  decade.   Now, I am not talking about the 2009 Raise the Wage Act. I am not  talking about the 2009 Hate Crimes Act. I am not even talking about the  creation of the Office of Congressional Ethics in 2009.   What I am talking about is that these Congressmen in front of you  actually beat the Capitol Police in football on Tuesday night for the  first time in a decade.   Now, at the game, Mr. Speaker, fortunately, there were no serious  injuries. At practice, there was, but not at the game.   We had a lot of sore muscles, but most importantly, we did raise a  heck of a lot of money for local charities and the Capitol Police  Memorial Fund.   So, Mr. Speaker, I present this trophy to you, this rather large  trophy to you, I present it to this body as a reward for that victory,  but also a small reminder of what Democrats and Republicans can do when  we work together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney  Davis).
