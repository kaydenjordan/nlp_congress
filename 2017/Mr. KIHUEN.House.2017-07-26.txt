 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and the chairman  for accepting my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, veterans have made an incredible sacrifice for our  country, and they deserve the highest quality treatment and care when  they return to their civilian lives.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has the obligation to provide  critical services to veterans and ensure that America's veterans have  access to high-quality and affordable healthcare in their communities.   Recently, the VA decided not to renew its contract with the Ely  Community Clinic in my district, and it is forcing veterans in Ely and  the surrounding communities to rely solely on the Choice Program to  access care.   We owe it to our veterans not to use the Choice Program as a crutch,  but to make the proper investment in the healthcare of our veterans and  the healthcare that they deserve. Veterans  [[Page H6420]]  have already fought for their country. They shouldn't have to fight to  keep their VA clinic in Ely.   The intention behind my amendment is to remind the VA that they have  the responsibility to continue operating the healthcare clinic in Ely,  Nevada, and to emphasize the importance of continuing to provide care  in rural communities across the country.   The Choice Program was not intended to allow the VA to shirk its  responsibility for certain veterans; instead, it was supposed to help  veterans who have nowhere else to turn.   I was sent to Congress by the people of the Fourth Congressional  District to fight for Nevada's veterans, and I will continue fighting  to ensure that veterans in rural Nevada and communities across the  country do not lose access to the VA and make sure that they receive  the healthcare that they have earned and deserve.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to briefly  explain Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22.   Before I begin, let me express my appreciation and thanks to my good  friends, Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz for their  hard and constructive work in shepherding this important legislation to  the floor.   Chairman Dent and I worked together constructively for many years on  the Homeland Security Committee and he has always distinguished himself  as one of the most bipartisan members of the House.   And Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz has for years been one of the  ablest Members of this body; I thank them both for their commitment to  the important work of ensuring that our veterans receive the care and  support they have earned from a grateful nation.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22 makes a modest but important improvement  to the bill by increasing the amount of funding for the ``Supportive  Services for Veterans' Families'' account by $2 million, offset by a  reduction of $2.5 million to the $4 billion allocated to the VA's  ``Information Technology Systems'' account.   Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male  and female) who are homeless on any given night.   And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some  point during the course of a year.   The VA's ``Supportive Services for Veterans' Families'' Program helps  veterans; and their families, who may have fallen on hard times or hit  a rough patch in life and need a little help from the country they  selflessly risked their life to defend.   Homeless veterans or veterans facing homelessness who have minor age  children are in need of special programs that allow for housing that  welcomes children.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22 will enable this vital program to serve  more veterans' families in need of help by providing a bit more funding  for grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer  cooperatives that provide supportive services to very low-income  veteran families living in or transitioning to permanent housing.   The SSVF Program ensures that eligible veteran families receive the  outreach, case management, and assistance in obtaining VA and other  benefits.   These services may include health care, daily living, legal services,  fiduciary and payee services, personal financial planning, child care,  transportation, housing counseling.   The SSVF Program enables VA staff and local homeless service  providers to work together to effectively address the unique challenges  that make it difficult for some veterans and their families to remain  stably housed.   Many homeless veterans, including in my own state of Texas, lack  housing because they lost their job or could no longer afford rent;  many suffer from an untreated mental illness that keeps them from  working.   Every day the SSVF program makes a real difference in the lives of  real people.   Veterans like the Air Force veteran who, hoping to utilize the skills  he learned in the service, instead bounced from job to job after being  discharged and found himself sleeping at night on the cold cement under  a bridge in Chicago.   Through the Thresholds Veterans Project, funded through the SSVF,  this hero received steady community service support and eventually was  placed in his own studio apartment.   He now says, in his own words: ``I have a home. I enjoy bein'  inside.''   Veterans like the one in Texas who because he lost his job at a  manufacturing plant and was unable to pay the bills, was forced to seek  shelter for himself and his family at a homeless shelter.   Fortunately, the homeless shelter was a SSVF grantee and was able to  assist the veteran obtain employment and his family in securing  affordable low-cost housing.   There are thousands of similar success stories made possible by the  SSVF Program that I could share but all of them share a common theme:  they involve veterans who served their country proudly, fell down on  their luck, picked themselves back up, and found affordable and  sustainable housing for their families because of the assistance and  support made possible by the SSVF program.   Ensuring that veterans have a place of their own to call home is the  very least we can do.   I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit  ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness  in America.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22.                         ``Heroism Knows no Gender''         Liz (Names and some identifying information have been       changed to protect confidentiality) is an Army Veteran and a       single mom. After losing her job, she struggled to pay the       rent and provide for her daughter. Liz's landlord said she       had always been an excellent tenant but his patience was       wearing thin as her rent arrears continued to increase.       Disheartened with a fruitless job search and unsure of where       else to turn, Liz came to the Veterans Outreach Center (VOC).       She was immediately connected with a Case Manager, an       Employment Specialist, an Accredited State Veterans Benefits       Counselor, and the SSVF team.        In order to avoid the immediate crisis of homelessness, the       Services To Enable Positive Solutions (S.T.E.P.S) program at       the VOC paid Liz's rent arrears, which had escalated to an       amount that was insurmountable. Within a few short days of       connecting with the team at VOC, Liz had a job interview that       resulted in full-time, meaningful employment. In less than a       week, she had a benefits review with an on-site counselor       from the New York State Division of Veterans Affairs during       which she applied for an increase in disability compensation.       The payment of Liz's back rent allowed her and her daughter       to keep a roof over their head. With a roof over their heads       and their living situation stabilized, Liz was able to focus       on her employment and securing her benefits, which are both       components of an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that will       help Liz sustain permanent housing in the future.        The VOC was able to stabilize Liz and her daughter while       concurrently providing the supportive services necessary for       her to maintain permanent housing. The temporary financial       assistance was delivered to the landlord in a timely,       efficient manner with the help of a S.T.E.P.S collaborative       partner. Through coordinated case management, the       aforementioned supportive services were provided quickly and       effectively. The longterm result of this effort is yet to be       determined, but at the 90-day benchmark, Liz has retained       both her job and her home. She has realized this goal       independently, without requesting any additional financial       assistance. Consequently, the VOC was able to better the       lives of a mom (a Veteran) and her child immeasurably through       SSVF funding.                 ``Your Unselfish Helping Hand Gave Us Hope''         Mariano Salas and his family were the first clients to       participate in Community Psychiatric Clinic's (CPC) SSVF       program. Both Mariano and his wife had lost their jobs and       they and their young daughter were facing homelessness. The       SSVF program secured their housing and helped stabilize their       lives. Here is Mariano's story in his own words:        ``I was on the brink of giving up completely. But       truthfully one thing I can say, no words express enough our       sincerest gratitude to you in assisting my family and I       during a very difficult hardship. Desperation, fear and       depression were daily emotions upon my family. But with your       unselfish helping hand, you gave us hope, peace, and great       big smiles on our faces. Your untiring assistance has given       us tremendous hope for a better future. SSVF gave us a boost       as we are working so hard to get decent paying jobs to       support our family and put food on our table. Today, instead       of focusing all our energies on fear of being homeless, we       are focusing our energy on securing a stable job and to       become self-sufficient. My wife is working now and I have       interviews lined up so we can support ourselves and manage       our daily living expenses. I am privileged and honored to       have been served by SSVF. Thank you SSVF and GOD BLESS YOU       ALL.''        With deepest gratitude,        Mariano Salas    Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain describe Jackson  Lee Amendment No. 25, which simply provides that:   ``None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of  Veteran Affairs--Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and  Outreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part  II, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code.   This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among  veterans in the United States does not increase.   I thank Subcommittee Chairman Dent and Ranking Member  Wasserman  Schultz for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation  to the floor.   I offer Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 because I believe reducing and  eliminating  [[Page H6421]]  homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives to protect  our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest priorities.   Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in  the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who  have given so much to us.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 will help remind us of our obligation to  provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which  includes adequately funding for programs Veterans Administration  Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide case-management services,  adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other  areas that contribute to veteran homelessness.   VASH is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program  for disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA medical  Centers provide referrals and case management while Public Housing  Agencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers.   Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I  believe that we could be doing much more for them.   Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male  and female) who are homeless on any given night.   And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some  point during the course of a year.   Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because  of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal  living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard  housing.   While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among  veterans remains a big challenge.   In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and  2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162.   We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on  the uniform and fought for us.   Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very  least we can do.   Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives.   In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided  by VASH.   I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and  within my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this  funding has positively impacted many communities across this country.   In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate  the issue of homelessness.   For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been  involved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing  Veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and  medical services that will help them get back on their feet.   Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 and  commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran  homelessness in America.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.              Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Al Green of Texas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13  printed in House Report 115-259.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 220, line 22, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(increased by $70,000,000)''.        Page 225, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(reduced by $70,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Al Green) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I will be withdrawing my  amendment, but I do desire to make some points.   I am grateful to the chairperson of the committee and the ranking  member as well. I know them to be admirable persons who desire to do  the very best for our veterans.   I would like to state, Mr. Chairman, that we have many people who are  on the front line of democracy. These are the people who go to distant  places, and a good many of them don't always return the same way they  left, and, Mr. Chairman, as a result of this, they need special  attention. They need medical attention.   We have a circumstance in our country that breaks the hearts of a  good many Americans each and every day when they see persons standing  on the streets with signs indicating that they are veterans and that  they need help. Mr. Chairman, what we propose to do with this amendment  is to provide that additional help that they need.   This amendment would accord an additional $70 million to medical  services for homeless veterans, the veterans that we see living in the  streets of life, the veterans who are appealing to us for help. A good  many of them need help that goes beyond something that is physically  wrong with them. A good many of them may need some help because of some  mental illness that they may have.   Mr. Chairman, in Texas, we have, on any given night, about 1,768  veterans who are living on the streets. According to the VA, about  40,000 veterans were homeless on a single night in January of 2016.  This is a decrease from where we have been.   The decline is admirable and we ought not overlook the decline, but  my belief is we can still do better and we can still help those who are  in need of some services. So this amendment would accord the $70  million and bring us back to our 2017 levels.   Mr. Chair, I would ask that the chairperson and the ranking member  please understand that my desire is to be of service to our veterans.   Mr. Chairman, if I may engage in a colloquy at this time. You have  heard my appeal. My hope is that Congressman Dent and I might be able  to work together to do what we can to enhance the services that are  needed to provide medical attention for homeless veterans. I am sure  that Congressman Dent has seen the evidence of it, and the empirical  evidence is available for us to review if we would like to, but I would  like as much assistance as we can get.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 326, strike lines 1 through 7.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Kihuen) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes language in the bill  that would prohibit the closure of the Yucca Mountain project, which  includes the storage of high-level nuclear waste in my district.   As you may know, in 1987, Nevada was targeted as our Nation's nuclear  waste dump through the ``Screw Nevada'' bill. In the 30 years since the  bill passed, Congress has wasted $3.7 billion of taxpayer money.   Yucca Mountain sits in a seismically active area less than 100 miles  away from Las Vegas, which holds an urban area with over 2 million  residents. Mr. Chairman, just last week, there was an earthquake 33  miles away from Yucca Mountain. This place is not safe for our nuclear  waste.   Moreover, the city sees tens of thousands of visitors traveling to  Las Vegas each and every year, many of whom are your constituents from  your districts. In 2016 alone, over 40 million visitors traveled to Las  Vegas.   I have grave concerns with the transportation of nuclear waste to  Yucca Mountain should this project continue against the will of my  constituents. This project will not just impact my constituents. It  impacts constituents in 329 congressional districts in 44 different  States and Washington, D.C. Putting a nuclear repository in our  backyard means that this high-level nuclear waste must travel through  your backyards first.   Your constituents will see high-level nuclear waste transported  through their communities on rail and truck. A simple car crash or  train derailment would leave your constituents at risk and cost our  taxpayers more money to clean up the mess.   As it stands, Mr. Chairman, this transportation plan also damages our  national security and the ability of the Nevada Test and Training  Range, the largest air and ground range in the contiguous United  States, to meet and train our servicemembers.                                time  2215    Mr. Chairman, I have been to Yucca Mountain. I have driven through  the desert that is home to the bighorn sheep and desert tortoises and  ancient petroglyphs and relics of the westward expansion. It is clear  that reopening Yucca Mountain threatens the health and safety of  Nevadans and Americans from across the country.   Our State, which has no nuclear energy-producing facilities, should  not be the dumping ground for the rest of the country's nuclear waste.  And the bottom line is this: If any of my colleagues would support this  bill to bring Yucca Mountain nuclear waste to our State, then I am sure  you support bringing it to your State. I am sure we can find a location  in your State, and I would love to work with you on that. I am sure you  wouldn't like your neighbors bringing their trash to your backyard.  Don't bring it to my backyard either. Don't bring it to my  constituents. Don't bring it to Nevada.   I urge your support for my amendment. Prevent billions and billions  of dollars, taxpayer dollars, being wasted by continuing to pursue the  Yucca Mountain project.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen), my esteemed colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen), my esteemed colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
