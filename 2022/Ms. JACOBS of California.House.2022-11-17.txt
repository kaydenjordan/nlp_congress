 Mr. Speaker, the debate is officially over:  abortion rights are a kitchen table issue.   Last week, abortion rights were on the ballot in five States.  Abortion rights went five for five, not only in what are considered  blue States, like California and Vermont, but in a battleground State  like Michigan, and red States like Montana and Kentucky.   Abortion was one of the top issues that motivated people to vote.  That is because, for me and for millions of women, reproductive  healthcare is our healthcare. That is why women showed up at the ballot  box to defend abortion rights. That is why we need to do the same in  Congress.   The House has already passed legislation to protect the right to  access an abortion and contraception and protect those who cross State  lines to access an abortion.   We need to do more. The House needs to pass the My Body, My Data Act,  to create a new national standard to protect reproductive and sexual  health data. The Senate needs to step up and abolish the filibuster so  we can finally protect abortion rights at the Federal level.   Mr. Speaker, the voters spoke loud and clear. It is time to hear them  and to act.                            ____________________
