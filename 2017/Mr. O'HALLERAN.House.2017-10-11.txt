 Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, as a father,  and as a grandfather, nothing I do is more important than ensuring  every child in Arizona and America has the opportunity to live up to  their God-given potential. No matter where they live, kids deserve to  grow up healthy, with every chance to succeed.   That is why it is beyond unacceptable that, for the first time ever,  Congress missed the deadline to reauthorize the Children's Health  Insurance Program.   For decades, CHIP has been a bipartisan program and has been  reauthorized with broad support, until now. It has now been 11 days  since CHIP expired. This is an outrage for children across the Nation  who depend on the affordable, quality care they receive, thanks to  CHIP. It is especially troubling for Arizona.   Arizona has had the unfortunate distinction of being one of the worst  States for healthcare access for children. Until last year, it was the  only State in the entire Nation without an active Children's Health  Insurance Program.   Arizona froze CHIP KidsCare program in 2010. At its height, the  waiting list for coverage after the freeze topped 100,000. I repeat:  the list topped 100,000 because of a freeze put on by the State of  Arizona.   Two years ago, Congress reauthorized CHIP and included enhanced match  rate funding for States under the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to  advocates on the ground and with bipartisan support in our State  legislature, this enhanced funding finally paved the way for our State  to reopen KidsCare.   Last year, KidsCare began enrolling children--over 23,000 so far. We  have just begun the hard work of educating and reaching out to the  working families who qualify for coverage.   Arizona is one of a handful of States, as you can see here in this  chart in blue, that would run out of Federal funds to cover children by  December of this year, absent congressional action.   Families in these States are the most at risk for losing critical  access to care, until Congress steps up to the plate and passes a  robust reauthorization with enhanced rate funding.   I have met and heard from many of these families and their providers.  I know what is it stake for them.   Cate Arnquist is a mother from Tucson, Arizona, whose 8-year-old son,  Zachary, was approved for coverage through KidsCare last month. This is  a huge relief to Cate, who recently moved to Arizona with her husband  and works at a local elementary school. Cate said:         It's important for me to know that if I need to take him to       the doctor, I will be able to take him. As a parent, your       kids are always your biggest priority. I think every parent       wants to make sure their kids are healthy.    Cate, I couldn't agree with you more. Kids like Zachary deserve to  know that their elected officials here in Congress are looking out for  them.   Graciela is a working single mom who lives in Phoenix. Her 17-year- old daughter, who suffers from high blood pressure, relies on KidsCare  coverage. Graciela says:         I just pray and ask everybody who is behind CHIP to think       about it. They don't know how hard it is sometimes when you       are a parent and you don't know what to do. Should I put a       plate of food on the table or should I take my kid to the       doctor?    These are questions no parent in Arizona or in America should have to  ask themselves. Doctors in our community agree.   A pediatrician practicing in Gilbert, Arizona, shared an important  story  [[Page H7966]]  with us about a family with five children in her practice. The father  works as a grocer, but makes $20 too much to qualify for Medicaid. That  is $20.   One of the children has significant developmental delays and another  child has a serious neurological disease. After the youngest child was  born, it became clear that he most likely had the neurological disease  as well.   The doctor referred this child for evaluation, but the family was  unable to take him to the neurologist because they could not afford the  office visits and diagnostic testing necessary. Had KidsCare been open  at the time, the family could have applied for coverage, since they  qualified, based on their income.   This story and our experience in Arizona should be a cautionary tale  for the rest of the States who may freeze their program if Congress  fails to reauthorize CHIP now.   No family should be put at risk when they need help for their kids.  Working families like these are doing their best to make ends meet and  raise healthy kids.   Reauthorizing CHIP isn't just the right thing to do morally, but it  is the smart, economic decision for our communities. I understood that  when I was a Republican State legislator and fought for KidsCare, and I  understand it now here in Congress.   We all know that when children have meaningful access to quality,  affordable, comprehensive healthcare coverage, our schools, families,  and our State's bottom line all win.   Healthy kids have a better shot in school and grow up to be healthy  adults. When we invest in them, when we invest in their families, we  are investing in their futures and our future.   We must do better. Instead of playing partisan games and spending  time on bills that make coverage and affordability worse for Americans,  we need to make CHIP reauthorization front and center of our focus.   While I am pleased that the Senate Finance Committee and the House  Energy and Commerce Committee have started to take up action, it is  past time to get a robust bill to the President's desk.   CHIP has long been a bipartisan program, and I will keep working with  anyone, regardless of office or party, to make sure our kids have the  care they deserve. They are counting on us. We cannot let them down.   I am pleased to be joined this evening by my colleagues who are  committed to fighting for kids in our communities. I want to thank them  for joining this Special Order hour to fight for CHIP and a strong  reauthorization process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island  for caring about our Nation's children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I am kind of new to this body, but when I came here, I  came with the same intention as I did when I first got into the Arizona  State Legislature. One of the first issues I worked on was this  program, a program that helped kids stay healthy, a program so that  they could be successful at school, a program that is imperative. Yet,  today, millions of people around this country, millions of families  around this country are asking themselves: What are they going to do  about my children's health? What is going to happen? Who is going to be  there for my child?   When I was a police officer, I had, sadly, the ability to see people  in poverty day in and day out, what it meant to their families, but  especially what sick children look like, what it means to see children  taken out of homes in ambulances instead of having preventative care,  what it means for a child to have to be in a hospital instead of having  had the ability to have preventative care, what it means to a child  with disabilities to have to go through that process and not have the  physical therapy that is needed.   This happened time and time again before CHIP became reality. I don't  think America wants to go back there. I think America wants to move  forward and make sure our children are healthy and able to withstand  the issues in our society that lead us to make sure that they do.   I cannot understand, for the life of me, why we would keep these  families--it is 11 days now. It is going to mean many more. We will  have to find some level of agreement. Yet, as was just mentioned by the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin, we are funding this by taking money away  from the elderly, from those also in need, from those also at risk.   I have to say that when I patrolled the streets of Chicago, I did so  to make sure that people were saved and safe. And I can't believe that  I have come to this body and found out that we are willing to keep  these families waiting, we are willing to sit back and not understand  the core issues of what it means to those families to have to suffer  through this process of the unknown of their child's future healthcare.   I have to say that this is an issue that most Americans and most of  this body agree to. I don't know why we have gone down this path of  taking money--or thinking of taking money away from the elderly. It is  wrong. But I do know that we should get this dealt with quickly and  make sure the families in America that need it can provide for their  children's health.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Representative Langevin, the gentleman from  Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Rhode  Island not only for his discussion today, but also for all his work on  behalf of the children of America. I think that his record speaks for  itself, and it is obvious that what we just heard came from his heart.  So I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   I asked my fellow colleagues, when they start to work on this bill  again--hopefully, they do it in a speedy fashion--that when they wake  up in the morning, they think of what it means to have their child  potentially without healthcare, what it means to have the unknown that  we don't know if next month or the month later they will lose that  coverage because Congress has failed to address the issue that they  have all agreed on for 20 years. We have to and we must find a way to  come to agreement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
