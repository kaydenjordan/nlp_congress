 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman  Mitchell, for his leadership in this amazingly important area, and also  to point out the bipartisan nature of this bill not only, Mr. Speaker,  to you, but to those people who might be watching at home at a time  when it seems that we can't agree on anything, here we have an  agreement in a College Transparency Act in how to ensure a better  investment for the futures of our children.   Now, there are those who have opposed this bill, and I can't really  wrap my brain around it, Mr. Speaker. Someone suggested that this might  grow government. But that is absolutely not true. As a matter of fact,  the data that would be made available in this act is already collected.  But the problem is that that data is collected, and then it is siloed  and accessible only to institutions or government entities and not to  the end user. That strikes me as illogical, at best, and stupid, at  worst.   Someone says it burdens colleges with data collection requirements,  yet, again, the data is already being collected. What about personal  privacy? Does it disclose individuals' private information? Well, if it  did, I wouldn't be standing here today extolling the virtues of this  bill which I cosponsored and Mr. Mitchell sponsors that support it  again across the aisle to include the likes of the distinguished  gentleman, Mr. Polis, from Colorado.   Instead of disclosing personal data of individuals, it discloses  metadata of groups so what we would learn, for example, is that  individuals who majored in X at college Y had an employment rate of Z,  and that their earning potential was A as opposed to another university  where it might be B.   What more pertinent information, Mr. Speaker, could there be to young  people as they seek to choose an area of study and a place to engage in  that area of study than their likelihood of success based on those who  have done the same thing at the same college or university before them?   So we have addressed some of the things that this bill doesn't do,  but let's speak briefly about what it does do. Without any ability to  articulately argue, this bill increases transparency. When you step  aside from the realm of national security, I can think of no reason  that the Federal or State or local government should be in the business  of collecting data that they don't share with the citizens who put them  in office or the people who fund their endeavors. Indeed, this isn't  national security, unless you contemplate the fact that right now our  children attend universities deprived of information that might help  them make better choices.   So this increases transparency. It creates informed consumers. It  allows individuals to decide for themselves which college or university  might offer a program that they are interested in, is the best  investment of their time, and perhaps their or their parents' or the  government's money. It informs payers to that very end, whether that  payer is the student, a family member, or the State of which they are a  resident. It gives us a return on the investment.    The fact that this data has been collected low these many years, and  it took the leadership of Mr. Mitchell and good folks like Jared Polis  working across the aisle to get us to this point, is lamentable, but we  have the opportunity in the College Transparency Act to correct these  wrongs, not to reburden our universities with more data collection  requirements, but to take the data that is already being collected and  give it to the end users, the students.   So it is with that that I again offer a hearty congratulations to  Congressman Mitchell, a begrudging ``I wish I had thought of that,''  and I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that while we  already collect this data, we do not disseminate it where it would be  most useful, and that is to the end users. I hope that all can find a  way to join us from both parties in supporting this commonsense  measure, the College Transparency Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the president of  the University of Virginia in my district.                                             University of Virginia,                                         Office of the President,                                  Charlottesville, VA, June 1, 2017.      Hon. Tom Garrett,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Garrett: On behalf of the University of       Virginia (UVA), I thank you for your co-sponsorship of the       College Transparency Act. I appreciate your support of       transparency, good data, and enhanced consumer information in       higher education, as well as the bipartisan efforts that led       to the creation of this bill.        The College Transparency Act is a step in the right       direction for improving federal data, which is currently       limited, and at times, inaccurate. Improving data helps       students and families with the important decisions associated       with choosing a college, and also helps institutions of       higher education improve student success. The Association of       Public and Land Grant Universities, for which I serve as the       Chair of the Council of Presidents, compiled case studies       showing the importance of this type of data for improving       student outcomes. I look forward to working with you, in your       influential position as a member of the House Committee on       Education and the Workforce, on this issue and many others as       Congress moves forward with reauthorizing the Higher       Education Act.        Once again, thank you for your dedicated support of UVA.            Very truly yours,                                                   Teresa Sullivan,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I would note that institutions from the  University of Virginia to the entire Virginia community college system  have endorsed this commonsense piece of legislation. It is a shame we  haven't done it sooner. Let us not miss the opportunity to pass this  now.
