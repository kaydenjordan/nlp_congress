 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an important time  in Alabama's history.   I am proud to lead the efforts joined by my colleagues from Alabama  in introducing a resolution today, which honors the 200th anniversary  of Alabama's statehood.   On December 14, 1819, Alabama was incorporated into the Union as the  22nd State. December 14, 2019, will mark 200 years since the historical  day of our State's incorporation. This is a monumental occasion in our  State's history, and we are looking forward to joining Alabamians in a  year full of memorable celebration and commemoration of the  bicentennial.   It is my greatest honor to represent and serve the people of  Alabama's Second Congressional District, which includes Montgomery, our  State's capital city. Alabama is currently experiencing extreme  economic development and job growth across the State, which makes this  special time even more exciting for us all.   I join my colleagues in recognizing this milestone in our State's  history. I am grateful to have the opportunity to serve the people of  Alabama as we celebrate the birthday and history of the beloved State  we all call home.                            ____________________
