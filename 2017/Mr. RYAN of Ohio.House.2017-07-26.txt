 Mr. Chairman, while I rise to oppose this  appropriations package, even though the Legislative Branch division of  this package is worthy of our support, I commend Chairman Yoder both  for the product and for the way he reached across the aisle to work  with me and other members of our committee and the minority in this  process.   For all of their hard work, I would also like to thank Liz Dawson,  who is on their team; Jenny Panone and Tim Monahan from the Legislative  Branch minority staff; Joe Eannello from Chairman Yoder's office; Adam  Berg on the minority staff; and Anne Sokolov and Ryan Keating on my  team.   This year's Legislative Branch appropriations bill would, among other  things, allow us to catch up on some deferred maintenance in our  buildings; invest in information technology to modernize the Library of  Congress, Congressional Research Service, and Copyright Office; and  adjust to the new cybersecurity environment faced here in the United  States Congress.   I am also pleased to see that this bill provides additional funds for  the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police to increase congressional  security in the wake of the tragic shooting at our congressional  baseball practice several months back.   Our goal is to give them the resources they need to maintain the  security on the Capitol campus and increase their coverage of Members  and  [[Page H6363]]  gatherings of Members that might be targeted. It is the responsibility  of the House to look out for our safety and the safety of our  constituents and staff, and the funding included in this bill is a step  in the right direction.   There are things I hope we can improve on as the bill moves forward.  For example, I would like to see more money for personnel at the  Library and CRS, not just for information technology; and more for the  Government Accountability Office, which is flat-funded in this budget.  Because of inflation, GAO will have 200 fewer employees than expected  at the end of the year.   GAO's audits and investigations root out waste, fraud, and abuse in  government, something that we all agree upon here should be done. With  the Trump administration resisting all of this oversight, GAO is more  important today than it ever has been.   While I would support the Legislative Branch bill if it came to the  floor on its own, unfortunately, we are not considering it on its own.   I oppose tying $1.6 billion of wasted taxpayer money for President  Trump's border wall to the Legislative Branch bill. We need bipartisan,  comprehensive immigration reform, which would include smarter, more  effective enforcement of our laws.   A few years ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said  immigration reform would reduce our deficit by $900 billion and  increase real GDP growth by over 3 percent. But simply building a  ridiculous wall that faces opposition from both Democrats and  Republicans won't do anything for our economy, and it isn't even a  cost-effective way to strengthen enforcement.   Besides, we were told repeatedly over the course of the last 18  months that Mexico would pay for the wall. They would ask the  President: Who is going to pay for the wall? Mexico is going to pay for  the wall.   Why is there a single dime of American taxpayer money for a border  wall that President Trump promised Mexico would finance?   I oppose the Republicans' partisan budget strategy. By refusing to  work with Democrats on a bipartisan budget deal that raises the Budget  Control Act caps, Republicans are seriously risking some combination of  sequestration, stopgap funding bills, government shutdown, and a  catastrophic default on our national debt.   Nondefense discretionary spending is one-sixth of the Federal budget.  Having already cut it to the bone, they are now sawing off the limbs.   The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations  bill; the Transportation bill; and the Financial Services bill that  funds consumer protections and regulation of big banks will all see big  cuts because of the draconian spending caps.   Today's package will squeeze out investments in our infrastructure,  jobs programs, early childhood education, scientific research, and all  the things that need to be priorities. We are turning our backs on  working families across the country who depend on these programs every  day.   We all believe in the free market system. We all believe in  capitalism. We all want to reward risk-takers and provide a good  environment for growth for those men and women who will make the  investments to hire the workers. But capitalism is not a perfect  system.   It is these programs in this bill that we need to fund to make sure  that we grow the entire economy, that we have sustained growth, we  invest in education, we invest in research, and we invest in  transportation infrastructure, in order for us to grow the economy.   As former Appropriations Chairman David Obey used to say, those  programs were about ``knocking the rough edges off of capitalism.'' On  this side of the aisle, we believe making those investments is best for  the economy. That is what is at stake.   Yes, we must adequately fund defense, veterans programs, and the  legislative branch of government. But that can't come at the expense of  everything else.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to make it unanimous  here. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Utah for offering this  amendment and Mr. Richmond for coming here to support it.   Again, everything has been said. This is appropriate. We are in  unchartered waters here. We were at the baseball practices. We saw what  happened to our colleague.   We go out to events; we can have security. We go to our office; we  can have security. You come home, and you can't. So I think this is  appropriate.   I want to thank you for taking this issue up on behalf of the body.  We have so many Members today that will take opportunities to diminish  this body, and you stood up and showed some leadership in enhancing  this body. I want to support this amendment, and I thank the chairman  for allowing this to happen.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman.   I think the Wounded Warrior Project we have going on here in the  House of Representatives is a great project. It is a great opportunity,  as you articulated, to get people into the legislative process, both in  our district offices and here in Washington, D.C., and I want to voice  my support for that.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I have been here long enough to  recognize that, at times, the majority party will come to some level of  disagreement with the Congressional Budget Office. We were here during  the healthcare debate, we were here during tax cuts and all kinds of  different things that happened in the last 15 years that I have been  here.   They are not perfect, and they sometimes annoy us. As I can tell from  my good friend on the other side, he is in the annoyance period with  the Congressional Budget Office. But this is an essential component to  what we do here.   The Congressional Budget Office sincerely attempts to give us the  best, most accurate information that they could possibly provide us,  and those estimates change over time as circumstances change over time.  When you are talking about one-sixth of the entire United States  economy, it is going to be difficult to give you entirely accurate  information.   But not having this essential service here, I think, would be  detrimental to this Congress, detrimental to our ability to even gauge  and forecast into the future, and so I oppose this amendment strongly  and vigorously.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Yarmuth) who I know also has a strong opinion on this matter.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania  will be postponed.                  Amendment Number 5 offered by Mr. Griffith    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in House Report 115-259.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is breathtaking in its  completely overt vindictiveness. Some Members don't like the calls the  refs have made in games. You can have your opposition and your opinion.  Here, we are trying to get the referee fired. We cannot function as a  group here if we are going to continue to try to demean and criticize  this very group that is trying to help us do our job.   As I said a few minutes ago, the Democrats have had a long list of  frustrations with the CBO, but did we have the President, the leader of  our party, and a significant number of Members of the United States  Congress start bad-mouthing the CBO? We did not.   We had our complaints, in all fairness, but we think that this group  of professionals is essential to how this body functions.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Black), the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, if  you are not going to just believe Democrats on this issue.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished ranking member on the  House Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Chairman, let me just say quickly again and  reiterate that we are living in a world now where facts are trying to  be diminished, science is trying to be diminished, and we rely on these  professionals to give us as accurate information as we can possibly  obtain at the time from the professionals that are in this office. We  rely on this office very much to make the decisions that we make here  that have such great importance. While they are not always perfect, I  think they always put forth a good product for us.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Let me just say briefly that I support this amendment. Making the  Capitol complex and other buildings in the legislative branch more  family friendly is an important priority. People come here from all  over the country to meet with us, to see the sights, and to witness  democracy in action.   If you have traveled far and wide with your family like I have, you  know how much of a difference that it would make even for a brief part  of your day, like the inevitability of having to change a diaper. This  amendment will make it a little bit easier. So this is just a very  thoughtful, practical pro-family amendment, and I encourage all of our  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
