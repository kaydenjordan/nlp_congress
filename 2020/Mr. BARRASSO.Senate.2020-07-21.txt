 Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss  our economic recovery. Let me be clear. Our economy will not shut down  again. Government will not forcibly close businesses for a second time.   Yes, America is coming back from the coronavirus. The prepandemic  economy was strong; it was healthy; and it was growing. Every part of  the economy had record job growth. Unemployment was at a 50-year low.  Shutting down the economy slowed the spread of the virus, but it did  not eliminate it. It saved lives, and it bought us time.   Reopening was never conditioned on having a vaccine, nor was it  conditioned on eliminating the virus entirely. Businesses, large and  small, are today continuing to reopen, and they are opening in a safe,  scientific, and sensible way. I saw it all across Wyoming the last 2  weeks as I traveled the State   In Casper and Cheyenne, Main Street is busy again. Mom-and-pop  businesses are bringing back workers. Cody was full of activity over  the Fourth of July. Yellowstone is welcoming thousands of visitors, and  people are heading to all of the activities in Thermopolis. The rodeos  have been a huge success. Wyoming is literally back in the saddle  again.   Businesses all over the country are bouncing back and bringing back  workers. In June, the economy added nearly 5 million jobs. It shattered  all forecasts. This was by far the largest ever monthly jobs gain in  U.S. history. More than 7 million people have been hired back in the  last 2 months. May and June job creation set records.   The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, to me, as a doctor, is  troubling. Still, it is no reason to stop reopening, as long as we open  in a responsible way.   Now, people have made great sacrifices. We all did what the experts  said we needed to do. Now Americans are ready to get back to business  and get back to work. People don't want another shutdown, and you know  that. You have seen that in your own home State, and they most  assuredly don't want laws coming out of Congress that make it easier to  stay closed and harder to reopen. As a doctor, I know we can flatten  the virus curve without flattening or flatlining the economy. People  can resume normal life and stay healthy.   The key, of course, is for all of us to do our part and take the  proper precautions, and we know what they are: Social distancing, good  hygiene, and, of course, wearing masks. As a doctor, I know masks help  lower the infection spread, especially indoors when we can't socially  distance. Together, we can manage the risk, and, as a nation, we can  move forward.   Millions of Americans are returning to work and doing it safely.  Congress's rapid response to the pandemic back in March set this  recovery in motion. Medical workers now have better tools for virus  testing, for treating the disease, and for developing a vaccine.  Americans are doing everything they can to protect the most vulnerable.  We are taking care of seniors and people with chronic medical  conditions. The country is conducting a record number of tests. More  than 45 million people have been tested. I think the number is now  close to 50 million. There are well over 700,000 tests each day.   Widespread testing allows us to pinpoint virus hotspots so we are  able to surge aid where it is most needed. Hospitals now have more  effective COVID-19 treatments. I talked to doctors around the State of  Wyoming and around the country. We are seeing incredible progress in  vaccine trials. A successful vaccine is vital to beating the virus.   Now, it is key to the economic comeback as well. Scientists hope to  have a vaccine ready in record time--actually, before the end of this  calendar year. All this progress has given businesses the confidence to  reopen and to put people back to work. A solid majority of Americans  now will tell you that they see their finances as being stable.   Consumer spending the last 2 months has been way up. Manufacturing  has started to take off again. Simply put, the pro-health, pro-jobs  policies that this Senate has put in place, those policies are working.  We are only getting started.   Now Congress must build on the CARES Act successes. The next bill,  the one that we are working on now, cannot be a bloated bailout  bonanza. We will not pass Speaker Pelosi's bill from Handout Heaven.  No, the next aid measure must be focused. It must be focused on  healthcare and safety and schools and jobs.   Here is my three-part test for the next pandemic package. Will it  save lives? Will it save lives with testing, treatment, and vaccines? I  am very optimistic of what I have seen about the research with the new  vaccine. Will it protect our medical community and small businesses and  schools from frivolous lawsuits? There are 3,500 that have already been  filed across the country by sue-and-settle lawyers focused on  coronavirus. And will it get people back to work and children back to  school safely?   We must help schools reopen in a safe way. Children need to get back  to school. It is essential for their well-being. That is why the  Nation's pediatricians--the American Academy of Pediatrics--is urging  schools to reopen, and they say with the children physically present-- with the children physically present. Remote learning, we know, for  very young people, has not worked. Children cannot lose another year of  school. To lose a full year of school for these young people would be  devastating. It would be a learning loss, as well as a loss of the  ability to learn and making it that much harder to pick up further down  the line. And if kids aren't in school, many parents can't go back to  work. Most people with their jobs cannot work from home.   So I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, my Democratic  colleagues, to join us, to join our effort to  [[Page S4338]]  reopen our economy and reopen our schools.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I would like to take the  opportunity to express my appreciation to Maggie for her hard work as  an intern in my Cheyenne office.
