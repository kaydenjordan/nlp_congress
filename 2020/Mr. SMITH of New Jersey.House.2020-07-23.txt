 Mr. Speaker, someday, future generations of  Americans will look back on us and wonder how and why a society that  prided itself on the commitment to human rights precluded virtually all  protections to the weakest and most vulnerable--unborn children.   I believe they will demand to know why dismembering a child with  razor-sharp knives, pulverizing an infant with powerful suction  devices, or chemically poisoning a baby with any number of toxic  chemicals failed to elicit empathy for victim babies.   The bill before us today reverses several modest but important pro- life policies, including the Protecting Life in Global Health  Assistance policy, which is a reiteration and expansion of President  Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy. Announced by Ronald Reagan at the  UN conference on population growth in Mexico City in 1984, hence, its  name, the policy was and is designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer money  is not funneled to foreign NGOs that perform or promote abortion as a  method of family planning.   After Reagan announced that policy, Mr. Speaker, I offered the first  amendment in 1985 to protect that policy, and we won. We lost in the  Senate, but since it was an executive order, the policy did survive.  And I have done it many, many times since.    The policy established pro-life safeguards, benign, humane  conditions, on the $8.8 billion in annual global health assistance. For  years, Mr. Speaker, foreign NGOs have been empowered by taxpayer funds,  grant money, to weaken, undermine, or reverse pro-life laws in other  nations, especially in Africa, and to destroy the precious lives of  unborn children.   The Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, which was put  into effect by President Trump, mitigates U.S. taxpayer complicity in  global abortion. U.S. foreign assistance, Mr. Speaker, and the foreign  entities that we fund with billions of dollars of grant money should  consistently affirm, care for, and tangibly assist women and all  children--all children regardless of age or condition of dependency.   I have authored many laws in this body, including the PEPFAR  reauthorization, the 5-year reauthorization of the President's  emergency plan for AIDS relief.   When Henry Hyde, taking his cue from George W. Bush, authored that  important legislation, I, and many others, joined in. We were strong  supporters, but Henry Hyde was the leader.   That legislation has saved the lives of some 17 million people with  ARVs, as well as with prevention strategies. And it has made all the  difference in the world in the area of malaria as well as tuberculosis.   Mr. Speaker, I believe we must increase access to maternal and  prenatal care and ensure access to safe blood  [[Page H3713]]  and better nutrition. We must also expand essential obstetrical  services, including skilled birth attendants, while improving  transportation to emergency care facilities to significantly reduce  maternal mortality and morbidity, including obstetric fistula.   The law or the policy on the books with regard to obstetric fistula,  I offered the bill on that. It passed the House. It did not pass the  Senate. But then I got USAID to adopt it administratively. I have been  to the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia, where many women have  gotten their lives back because of reparative surgery.   No one is expendable or a throwaway, Mr. Speaker. Birth is merely an  event, albeit an important one, but only an event.    Mr. Speaker, birth is really just an event.   Ultrasound has shattered the myth that an unborn child is anything  but human and alive and growing. It really is up to us to do all we can  to make that life as healthy as humanly possible.   Victim babies, like their mothers, absolutely deserve respect,  protection, and an abundance of compassion.                                time  1215
