 Madam Speaker, on September 5, 2019, the Madison County  Sheriff's Department responded to a hostage situation near Canton,  Mississippi.   Upon arrival, the suspect fled and led deputies on a high-speed chase  throughout the northeastern part of the county before spike strips were  deployed to stop the suspect's vehicle. Once immobilized, the suspect  began to fire on deputies, striking two officers.   Deputy Brad Sullivan was shot multiple times as he arrived on the  scene and was later transported to the University of Mississippi  Medical Center. Deputy Sullivan remains in serious condition as our  community unites with prayer, donations, and medical skill to save the  life of this brave officer.   On behalf of Mississippi's Third Congressional District, I would like  to extend my sincerest gratitude and respect for Deputy Sullivan, the  other deputies who responded, and the entire Madison County Sheriff's  Department.   We ask all Mississippians to continue to pray for Brad's recovery and  for God's hand of protection on all our law enforcement officers.                            ____________________
