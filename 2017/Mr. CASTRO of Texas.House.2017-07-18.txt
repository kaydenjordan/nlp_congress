 Mr. Speaker, every day, millions of Americans  from every corner of our Nation get up early in the morning, leave  their families, go off to work. They work hard to support themselves  and their families. Many of them work two or more jobs at a time. Some  come home very late, miss seeing their kids go to bed. These are folks,  again, in every part of the Nation who don't ask much from their  government. The only thing that they ask is that we live in a country  where there is opportunity to pursue their American Dreams.   That means different things for different people. Some kids dream of  growing up and being a teacher, an engineer, a lawyer, a firefighter,  many things. As parents, we want to see our kids succeed, to live in a  nation that remains the preeminent Nation of opportunity around the  world.   Unfortunately, over the last 6 months, the policies pursued by this  administration are endangering the United States' infrastructure of  opportunity, endangering our position in the world. Today we are going  to have an opportunity to talk about some of those policies that are  harmful to America now and America in the future.   President Trump's proposals on the budget, for example, would hurt  the creation of jobs, the ability of people to get healthcare, would be  bad for the environment, would do so much harm in so many ways. So I am  honored tonight to be with three of my colleagues, all of us from  different parts of the country: Myself from Texas, the congresswoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), the congresswoman from Washington State  (Ms. Jayapal), and the congresswoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz).   First I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, Congresswoman Gwen  Moore, because I know that she has some very strong opinions and  perspectives on healthcare.    This week, I thought it was astounding, in the  course of less than 24 hours, the Senate was unable to pass a  healthcare bill. The President had promised for months that there would  be a new healthcare bill to replace so-called ObamaCare. That failed in  the Senate. And then the strategy after that became: Well, we are just  going to repeal this, and we are going to give ourselves 2 years to  come up with a replacement.   That failed today, and I think it failed for good reasons, because  that would be disastrous for the American people; 32 million people  would be dropped from the healthcare rolls if all you did was repeal.   So what were you hearing in this whole debate in Wisconsin from your  constituents and your voters up there?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.    Sixty-four percent of long-term nursing home  stays are paid for by Medicaid.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.    And, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, in the  1990s, my grandmother was in her eighties. In 1993, she went into a  nursing home and stayed there for about 3 years until she passed away.  My grandmother suffered most of her life from type 2 diabetes, and  before the end of her life, she had to have one of her legs amputated,  and finally succumbed to congenital heart failure, but there is no way  that my family, my mom, would have been able to afford to pay for 3  years of a nursing home stay but for the effect of this program.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin.    And, by the way, Congresswoman Moore, that is  why a lot of people were referring to these cuts as cruel. I mean, it  really is cruel.    That is right. You bring up a great point, and  then I want to talk real quick about the budget.   There is this underlying tone from the President and from other  politicians that some of the folks who are on Medicaid are somehow  undeserving, that they are somehow freeloading, and that is just not  the case. It is a complete misunderstanding of who these Americans are.   We talk about how healthcare failed. It seems like the President  promised healthcare, but it didn't happen.   One of the things that they wanted to do before healthcare, which  hasn't happened either, was tax reform. That is going to be very  difficult, especially when one of the foundations of your new tax plan  is giving a tax cut to the wealthiest folks, literally who need it the  least, but it raises a question of the budget and what the budget does  for the American people.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.    Congresswoman, you bring up a great point, and  you focused on the environment there and how the President's budget  proposal and the majority's budget proposal is damaging to the  environment.   I think about a series that I saw yesterday in Texas. The Texas  Tribune is an online publication, but it is kind of like the State  newspaper, and they did a series called ``A Pass to Poison.'' And in  the series, they noted that in 2016, I believe, there were about 3,700  incidents of air pollution in Texas, and the regulating agency in  Texas, which is TCEQ, only gave out fines for 20 of those incidents.   So you talk about breathing harmful air. I can't help but think what  will happen if these cuts that are being proposed under this budgetary  situation go through, are we going to have 5,000 incidents now, and you  are still only going to fine 20 people?    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, when Americans think about their  main concerns--I have a bread and butter district where people are  thinking foremost about their work. They want to make sure that they  can support themselves and their family members, but there hasn't been  much in the way of anything from the White House to create jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.    I hear you. I wanted to give Congresswoman  Wasserman Schultz the last word.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 55 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 19, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
