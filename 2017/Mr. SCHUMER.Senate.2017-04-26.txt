 Mr. President, as Senators continue to negotiate the  appropriations bills this week, I want to reiterate my hopes that we  can reach an agreement by this Friday. So long as we try to operate  within the parameters our parties have operated under for the last few  spending bills, I am optimistic about the chances for a deal.   I am glad the President has taken the wall off the table in the  negotiations. Democrats have always been for border security. In fact,  we supported one of the toughest border security packages in  comprehensive immigration reform in an amendment offered by two of my  Republican colleagues, Senator Hoeven and Senator Corker. We may  address border security in this bill as well, but it will not include  any funding for a wall, plain and simple.   Now, we still have a few issues to work out, including the issue of  cost sharing, Puerto Rico, and getting permanent healthcare for miners,  which I was glad to hear the majority leader voice support for  yesterday--permanent healthcare for miners. I want to salute Senator  Manchin, who has worked so long and hard for these poor miners who have  struggled and have had hard, hard, hard lives. They shouldn't have  their health benefits taken away. But above all, in the bill we have to  make sure there are no poison pill riders. That has been a watchword of  our negotiations in the past and is what led to success, and I hope  both sides of the aisle will pursue that now.   We Democrats remain committed to fighting President Trump's cutback  on women's health, a rollback of financial protections in Wall Street  reform, rollbacks of protections for clean air and clean water, and  against a deportation force. Those are the kinds of poison pill riders  that could hurt an agreement, and I hope we will just decide at the  given time that we can debate them in regular order, but they shouldn't  hold the government hostage and pass them without debate.
