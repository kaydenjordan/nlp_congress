 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  387, the Email Privacy Act.   As I said last Congress, current law is woefully out of date when it  comes to protecting privacy in electronic communications. I support  H.R. 387, just as I supported the same legislation previously, because  it is long past time we afforded Americans the privacy they are due  online.   At the same time, I am disappointed this bill has come straight to  the Floor, and not through the Judiciary Committee, a committee on  which I sit. Nor are any Members able to offer amendments on the Floor.  Going through the committee process and allowing amendments on the  Floor would have enabled us to address some of the concerns raised by  law enforcement about H.R. 387, such as its view that the bill fails to  enable personnel to expediently obtain critical evidence. As a former  prosecutor I share its interest in making sure that while we improve  privacy protections we do not impede the ability to bring people  swiftly to justice. I urge the Senate to work to address the points  raised by law enforcement so we can continue to improve H.R. 387.   I encourage all Members to support H.R. 387.
