 Mr. President, I have listened over the last several  weeks to accusations and a type of smear campaign, quite frankly, of a  good judge and a good man: Neil Gorsuch.   It is remarkable to me to see that the debate has become more about  character destruction than it has been about policy differences. I  understand there are policy differences, but why does it have to come  to this?   In the past few weeks, I have heard on this floor that Neil Gorsuch  shouldn't be a Justice on the Supreme Court because he has no  independence from President Trump.   No. 2, I have heard he was handpicked by far right groups like the  Federalist Society, a group of legal minds committed to the original  interpretation of the Constitution--clearly, a scandalous group of  radicals.   I have heard that Judge Gorsuch supports torture, he is against  privacy, he hates truckers, he will step on the little guy, he will  help only big corporations, he is just not mainstream, and I have heard  that he shouldn't be selected because he was not approved first by the  Democratic Senate leadership.  [[Page S2413]]    All of these reasons have been given for a historic change in Senate  tradition not to give a Supreme Court Justice an up-or-down vote. Block  him on a procedural motion; for the first time ever, block a Supreme  Court Justice on a procedural motion with a partisan vote.   Let me take these one at a time as I walk through this.   No. 1, I heard constantly that he is not independent enough from  President Trump. As far as I know, he had never even met President  Trump before. This didn't seem to be a standard, to be independent from  the current sitting President.   Let me give an example: Justice Elena Kagan, who is clearly qualified  as a legal mind, but I would say Republicans have serious policy  differences with her. Justice Kagan was allowed to have an up-or-down  vote. This body did not have a standard that they had to be independent  from the President. If they had a standard like that, Justice Kagan  would have never been on the bench. Why do I say that?   On May 10, 2010, President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to be an  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. From 1997 to 1999, she served  as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and was Deputy  Director of the Domestic Policy Council for President Clinton. In 2009,  she was confirmed Solicitor General of the United States for President  Obama. She worked for President Obama in the Obama White House as his  Solicitor General and then was taken directly out of the White House  and put on the Supreme Court.   I would say that is not independent from the President. So this  mythological new standard that any Court Justice nominee needs to be  independent from the President clearly wasn't in place when Elena Kagan  was being heard.   It is also interesting to me that one of the most talked about  decisions from Judge Gorsuch was a Chevron decision that he put out.  The whole crux of that decision was the independence of the executive  branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. Let me just  read a few paragraphs from the decision he wrote. He wrote this:         For whatever the agency may be doing under Chevron, the       problem remains that courts are not fulfilling their duty to       interpret the law and declare invalid agency actions       inconsistent with those interpretations in the cases and       controversies that come before them. A duty expressly       assigned to them by the APA [Administrative Procedures Act]       and one often likely compelled by the Constitution itself.       That's a problem for the judiciary. And it is a problem for       the people whose liberties may now be impaired not by an       independent decisionmaker seeking to declare the law's       meaning as fairly as possible--the decisionmaker promised to       them by law--but by an avowedly politicized administrative       agent seeking to pursue whatever policy whim may rule the       day. Those problems remain uncured by this line of reply.    In other words, the judiciary needs to have oversight of the  executive agency in what they put out as far as agency rulings, not  allowing the White House or any agency to just make any decision they  like. He continued writing:         Maybe as troubling, this line of reply invites a nest of       questions even taken on its own terms. Chevron says that we       should infer from any statutory ambiguity Congress's       ``intent'' to ``delegate'' its ``legislative authority'' to       the executive to make ``reasonable'' policy choices. But       where exactly has Congress expressed this intent? Trying to       infer the intentions of an institution composed of 535       members is a notoriously doubtful business.    In all the accusations that he is not independent of the President,  in one of his most famous opinions, he declares that we absolutely need  to have independence from the White House--of any White House--and have  a clear separation of powers between judiciary, legislative, and  executive. That actually does not stand up to simple muster. So the  first thing falls: no independence from the President.   The second issue which came up often was that he was handpicked by  far-right groups. There were all these groups that handpicked him, so  somehow that made it horrible that these different groups would  actually try to support him.   I go back to Justice Kagan. Again, that wasn't the standard at that  time, and I could use numerous judges through that process. Elena Kagan  was supported by the AFL-CIO, by the Human Rights Campaign, by numerous  environmental groups like WildEarth Guardians, Sierra Club, and the  National Organization for Women. She had a lot of different liberal or  progressive groups that were very outspoken in support of and helping  to push her nomination.   There is nothing wrong with that. She was a nominee who was actively  engaged in White House politics; she was actively engaged in Democratic  campaigns. Before that, as far as working for the Dukakis campaign, she  was a Democratic activist, and it was well known. That did not preclude  her from getting an up-or-down vote for the Supreme Court because she  is sitting on the Supreme Court today. There was no cloture vote  mandate or requirement for a 60-vote threshold as there was pushed by  this minority.   This issue that somehow you can't be handpicked or that having some  groups that would support you from the outside somehow precludes you  from being a serious consideration is not legitimate, and everyone  knows it.   I have also heard individuals out there saying that he is for  torture, he is against privacy, he hates truckers, he will step on the  little guy, he is only for big corporations, and he is not mainstream.   Here is the problem: When you actually look at the history, it is  very different from that. Of the 2,700 cases that Judge Gorsuch has  been involved in, in the 10\1/2\ years he has been on the Tenth  Circuit, he has been overturned in his opinions once--once in 2,700  cases; 97 percent of the time his cases were settled unanimously, and  99 percent of the time he voted with the majority.   Lest you don't know the Tenth Circuit as we know the Tenth Circuit in  Oklahoma, because it is the circuit court for our State, the majority  of the judges on the Tenth Circuit are judges selected by President  Carter, President Clinton, and President Obama. They hold the majority  in the Tenth Circuit. So to say that he voted with them in the majority  99 percent of the time would be to say that the Carter, Clinton, and  Obama appointees also apparently had these radical ideas. It is just  not consistent with the facts.   Then I have heard of late that the President should have engaged with  Senate leadership on both sides of the aisle to be asked for their  approval of the nominee before that nominee was ever brought. Well, I  don't know if that has ever been a requirement. There have been times  that Presidents in the past have had conversations with people on both  side of the aisle. Fine, but it is certainly not a requirement of the  Constitution, and it certainly doesn't preclude a nomination.   It is interesting to me that Judge Gorsuch offered to meet with 100  Senators one-on-one, face-to-face. Only 80 of them accepted his offer;  20 of them refused to even meet with him face-to-face. He did 4 days of  hearings in the Judiciary Committee, 4 solid, long days, where he  answered every possible question he could answer.   He has had extensive background checks. Everyone has gone through  every piece of everything they could find that has ever been written.  In fact, the latest new accusation is they found a couple of places  where what he wrote seemed to look strangely like something else  someone else wrote--which, when I saw it and read the side-by-side on  it, I thought: He forgot to do an annotation and a footnote in the 800  opinions he has written. In the tens of thousands of annotations that  he did, he didn't do a couple of them. Somehow that doesn't seem to  rise to the level that he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court--that in  the tens of thousands of annotations he put there, he might have missed  a couple.   I would challenge anyone serving in this body, to say: You can serve  only if you have never missed a single footnote on any paper you ever  wrote. I would say: Those who live in glass houses probably shouldn't  throw stones because we have all had times like that.   He is a solid jurist. I believe he will do a good job. In the time I  sat down in his office, we looked at each other face-to-face, and I  went through multitudes of hard questions with him, trying to determine  his judicial philosophy, seeking one simple thing: Will you interpret  the law as the law--not with personal opinion but as the law.   This body is about opinions. This body is about listening to the  voices all across our States and trying to make  [[Page S2414]]  good policy. Across the street at the Supreme Court, it is about one  thing: What does the law say and what did it mean when it was written?   The Constitution and law were not living documents. They do live in  the sense that if you want to make changes in the Constitution, you  amend the Constitution and you make changes to it. You can't suddenly  say it meant one thing one day but culture has changed and now it means  something new.   If you need new law, this body passes new law. Across the street,  they read the law and ask: What does it mean? It is that  straightforward.   I look forward to having a jurist on the Supreme Court as an  Associate Justice who says: I may not even like all my opinions and you  may not like all my opinions, but I am going to follow the law, and  what the law says is what we are going to do.   I think that is the best we can ask from a Supreme Court Justice, and  I think it is a fair way to be able to get him an up-or-down vote. I  have to tell you, I am profoundly disappointed that the Senate, to get  a simple up-or-down vote, had to go through all of this just to be able  to do what we have always done. Regardless of background or preferences  or policy or politics, this body has always said the President, for his  nomination, should get an up-or-down vote when they go through the  process.   We are going to do that tomorrow. We will put Judge Gorsuch on the  bench, and we are ready for him to go to work.   Mr. President, I yield back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
