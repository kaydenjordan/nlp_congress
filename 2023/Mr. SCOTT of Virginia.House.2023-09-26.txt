 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment, as the gentleman  from Wisconsin has said, prohibits funds from being used to finalize,  implement, administer, or enforce the milk section of USDA's proposed  rule that aligns nutrition standards to the 2020 dietary guidelines for  Americans. This appropriations rider is preemptive as the final rule  hadn't even been released by the Department, and it is out of place  because this issue should be taken up within the context of a child  nutrition reauthorization, not an appropriations rider.                                time  2330    This amendment disregards the normal scientific process currently  being undertaken to establish the nutrition guidelines.   School meals and beverages are required to be consistent with the  dietary guidelines for Americans, which are evidence-based  recommendations set to provide nutritional guidance.   This amendment would effectively undermine the unbiased, evidence- based process that ensures that children receive the most nutritious  meals and replace that scientifically based process with a political  process.  [[Page H4541]]    It is critical that science continue to guide the process in  determining options in schools and that the regulations are updated to  align with the newest dietary guidelines using a process that  intentionally allows for adaptations in line with the latest scientific  and expert recommendations.   Importantly, the Department of Agriculture has specifically requested  public feedback on the proposed milk options for consideration when  crafting the final rule.   The bottom line is that scientific experts, not politicians, should  be the ones to determine the nutrition standards and ensure that our  children get the healthiest meals possible.   A dozen organizations, including the Academy of Nutrition and  Dietetics, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Heart  Association, have all urged Congress to continue to respect the  scientific-based process and not interfere with the normal procedure.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
