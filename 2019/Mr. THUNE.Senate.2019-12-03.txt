The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds).    Mr. President, when I learned that Johnny Isakson would be  retiring at the end of the year, I was saddened. I served with Johnny  for a long time, not just here in the Senate, where we were both  freshmen Members in 2005, but in the House of Representatives as well,  and I have been honored to call him my friend.   It is really hard for me to imagine Congress without Johnny. He is,  hands down, as I have said, the nicest person ever to serve in the U.S.  Senate. He is a model of decency and graciousness and the kind of  person who can fight hard every day for the principles that he believes  in without ever developing any rancor toward his political opponents.   He is not just kind and decent. He is also a tremendously effective  legislator. He is deeply knowledgeable on a  [[Page S6815]]  whole range of issues, and he possesses the gift of being able to  explain complicated subjects in a very clear way. He gets things done.  He doesn't stand around talking about things or playing to the cameras.  He just rolls up his sleeves and gets to work, and he makes things  happen.   If there was a decency index and we were all rated on that decency  index on a scale of 1 to 10, Johnny would be the perfect 10. Anybody  who knows Johnny knows that he has a real passion for people and he has  a real passion for veterans.   I had the opportunity to work with Johnny on a couple of important  issues. We served together on the Senate Finance Committee. Tax reform  was something to which he brought tremendous knowledge and experience  and know-how. He talked with great understanding about the complicated  issues that we had to deal with when it came to reforming our Tax Code.  His experience was invaluable as we did something that hadn't been done  in over 30 years and reformed an outdated, archaic Tax Code that was  keeping us noncompetitive in the global marketplace.   In 2015, he became the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  and he spent the past 5 years working tirelessly to increase  accountability at the VA, to improve healthcare for veterans, and to  strengthen veterans' benefits. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, under Johnny, passed 25 pieces of  legislation, all of which were signed into law. One of those pieces of  legislation was the VA MISSION Act, which was a bill that made  significant reforms to the healthcare delivery system for veterans to  ensure that veterans have access to the care that they need when they  need it.   My wife Kimberley and I have traveled with Johnny and Dianne a number  of times over the years. One trip that will forever stand out for me is  a trip we took led by Senator Burr to a number of World War I and World  War II cemeteries in Europe--the Normandy American Cemetery, the Meuse- Argonne American Cemetery, and the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery, as  well as several others. We walked in battlefields where American  soldiers fought and bled, and we visited the graves of young Americans  who died on those fields.   It was a profoundly moving trip, especially because we were able to  visit the graves of soldiers from our home States of South Dakota and  Georgia. While the trip would have been meaningful enough on its own,  it was doubly so because Johnny cares so much about those issues. It  meant so much to him to visit the places where American soldiers had  served and died, to remember their sacrifices, and to honor their  memory.   I am going to miss working with Johnny. His retirement is a real loss  for the institution, and I am not the only Senator who will miss his  expertise and dedication, as well as his unfailing graciousness and  good humor. The Senate is going to be a poorer place without him.   There have been a lot of tributes to Johnny since he announced his  decision to retire, and one that I came across that I thought really  captured Johnny was published in a Georgia magazine. The author of the  piece is a political science professor at Kennesaw State University,  and this is what he said:         As a political science professor and an administrator, I'm       often asked by students if good people can serve in       government and keep their integrity. Johnny Isakson is always       the first example I come to. It's very often a shocking       revelation to most people--that good people can, and often       do, serve in government for long periods, fight hard for what       they believe in, and remain true to themselves and their       principles. And they don't have to sell their souls to do it.       It's a great lesson, really.    I remember being down in Georgia with Johnny a few years ago on the  weekend of the Florida-Georgia football game, and we were at one of the  celebrations. I remember being struck by how well known and how well  liked Johnny was among the college students who were there. Nowadays,  we often hear about young people being disillusioned with politics, but  I have to tell you that these students weren't disillusioned with  Johnny Isakson. I think that is because they recognized Johnny's  character. They knew that Johnny was somebody who was truly, genuinely  committed to making life better for the people of the State and for the  people of this country. Here was somebody who had gotten into public  service because he genuinely wanted to serve.   Interestingly enough, on that trip we were near the coast of Florida  or Georgia, and I had to get back to Macon, GA. My daughter was  competing in a cross-country meet there. Johnny was kind enough--he was  flying back to Atlanta--to take me on that plane and to drop me at  Macon, GA, so I could watch my daughter compete.   Interestingly enough, when he got on the plane to go back from Macon  to Atlanta, they had engine trouble. They had to make an emergency  landing. Johnny ended up, I think, having to drive or have somebody--a  taxi or somebody--drive him 100 miles from Macon up to Atlanta and his  home, but that is the kind of person that he is. He thought it was  important for me to be there and to see my daughter compete, and he was  always willing to go out of his way to make it possible for somebody to  be able to participate in an event like that--a family event.   That is what I think about when I think about his retirement. I am  sad about his retirement, but I am happy that he is going to have a  chance to spend more time with Dianne, with his family, his children,  and his grandchildren. I have been lucky enough to get to know Dianne,  as well as Johnny, over the years, and they are just the same--the  warmest, kindest, most gracious, most genuine people you will ever  meet.   I know that after years of sharing him with the people of Georgia and  the American people, Dianne and the rest of the family will enjoy  having Johnny to themselves for awhile. After all, somebody has to  babysit those eight beautiful grandchildren.   The Senate is losing one of its finest Members, but he has more than  earned his retirement. I wish him and Dianne the very best in  retirement. I pray for God's blessing upon him, and let him know how  much we are going to miss him.   I yield the floor.
