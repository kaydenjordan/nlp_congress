 Mr. Speaker, what an extraordinary day  that we have, the beginning of the speakership of   Mike Johnson of  Louisiana.   I hope everyone will see his acceptance speech last night. They need  to look at that. It was a conservative, very clear voice calling for  limited government, expanded freedom, and reduced regulations to  provide for a strong America. It is such a positive message. He  promised to be with the people, and he is so much with the people, he  is sitting in the front row. No Speaker has ever sat in the front row.  This is another first.   In addition to that, Speaker   Mike Johnson is going to address  Bidenomics, the most extraordinary inflation in 40 years, where  American families have lost $7,000. He is going to stop the war on  fossil fuels so that we have fuels and energy independence. He is going  to be for a strong America, and that is how we are going to deter the  dictators around the world who have invaded Ukraine, who have invaded  Israel, who threaten the people of Taiwan.   America will be strong.   We will have a dynamic Speaker. We look forward to his leadership,  and again, America is back on track.

I am grateful to see Chairman Fleischmann working with  Ranking Member Marcy Kaptur as we oppose this amendment.   This is a time when the Chinese Communist Party is conducting the  largest nuclear buildup in world history. War criminal Putin is  invading Ukraine and threatens nuclear weapons. The dictatorship in  Tehran is invading Israel; it is developing nuclear weapons while  chanting, ``Death to Israel, Death to America.'' In defense, we should  be modernizing America's nuclear arsenal.   We did not choose the war of dictators with the rule of gun who are  invading democracies with rule of law, but we are in this. Ukraine has  been invaded, Israel has been invaded, and they threaten Taiwan.   Plutonium pit production is among the most critical national security  needs. As with every weapon, we must continue to invest in improvements  to our nuclear inventory to achieve peace through strength in the  tradition, as the chairman has so correctly said, of Ronald Reagan.   Sadly and incredibly, last night, BBC News broadcast a report: Russia  has just rehearsed a massive nuclear strike capability. This was  presented on Russian Putin's state TV last night as the defense  minister reviewed with the war criminal Vladimir Putin of how current  this is.   The United States currently has a statutory requirement of producing  80 plutonium pits per year, as close as we can to 2030. Of those 80,  the Savannah River Site will be responsible for producing 50. As the  only Member of Congress who has actually worked at the Savannah River  Site, I know of the competence and capabilities of people at this site.
