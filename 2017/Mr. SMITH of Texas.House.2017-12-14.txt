 Mr. Speaker, the liberal media helped elect a  U.S. Senator from Alabama. Their alliance with the Democratic Party is  now so close, we should call them mediacrats. Admittedly, the  mediacrats got an assist from some Republicans, as well as the  candidate himself.   The primary lesson to be learned from the election is that  Republicans must confront media bias. They must constantly point it out  and remind the American people of this corrosive effect on our election  process. Republicans should join the President exposing fake news.   The media should trust the American people with the facts, not tell  them what to think. Because the media is so biased, their credibility  with the American people is at an all-time low.   For the sake of our country and for the sake of fair elections, I  hope the media will return to their paramount responsibility: providing  the American people with unbiased news.                            ____________________
