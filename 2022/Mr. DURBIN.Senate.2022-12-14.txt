 Mr. President, 10 years ago today, when I first heard the  news, I couldn't believe it. Then, as I heard the details and learned  of what had happened in Connecticut, I thought to myself, This is the  moment. This shooting is so outrageous and horrible, this is the moment  when finally America will come to grips with the reality of gun  violence.   What I am referring to, of course, is the Sandy Hook Elementary  School. It was 10 years ago today that 20 beautiful little children and  6 teachers and staff were murdered in a classroom at this grade school.  I thought, This was it. All of the gun violence and all the gun deaths  notwithstanding, this will do it. It is the tipping point. America will  come to the honest reality that gun violence is unacceptable and will  do something about it.   Other nations have done something. Other nations have had incidents  like this, maybe even fewer victims, and they have decided to change  their nation's laws. They have done so, and they made their nation  safer because of it.   We are gathering here this morning at the request of Senator Chris  Murphy of Connecticut to remember what happened 10 years ago. Senator  Murphy was with the families of Sandy Hook, as was Senator Blumenthal,  when they learned of the children's fate.   Can you imagine being the parent of one of these little kids and  being asked to wait in a building across the street while they looked  at the remains of these children and tried to identify them with their  parents? I don't know if I would ever recover from that as a parent or  a grandparent.   Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal tried to give the families  comfort. I can't imagine that assignment. They both have brought much  more than sorrow to this cause. Since that shooting 10 years ago, they  have brought a fierce resolve to do something about it and to end the  horrific carnage of gun violence in America.   This has been an important year for gun safety in this Congress.  After the racism-fueled mass murders at a grocery store in Buffalo, NY,  after the slaughter of 19 little children and 2 teachers in their  elementary school in Uvalde, TX, Congress passed the most significant  gun safety law in 30 years: the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. And  the Senate did something that hadn't been done for 7 years: We actually  confirmed a Director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives. That is a position the gun lobby had fought to keep open  and unfilled for 7 years. We have a man on the job now. So we have made  some progress, but we have a lot more to do. The American people want  us to do more.  [[Page S7159]]    It is hard to say, in this great Nation that we have been blessed to  live in, that we are the only--only--Nation on Earth that accepts these  horrifying levels of gun violence on a daily basis and mass shootings.  A mass shooting is a shooting where at least four and sometimes more  people are shot or killed.    Many times, because of the repetition of this horrific conduct, we  think it is inevitable, unpreventable, and we in America shrug our  shoulders and say: That is what happens in the United States of  America. Just in the category of fatal shootings in schools,  kindergarten through 12th grade schools, how many fatal shootings have  taken place in America in those schools in the 10 years since Sandy  Hook? There have been 189--189 school shootings since Sandy Hook in  America.   Gun violence is now the leading cause of death of American children.  Think about that for a second--the leading cause of death. Every year,  more than 3,000 children and teens die by firearms--3,000 a year-- another 15,000 are wounded, and more than 3 million American children  are exposed to gun violence every year. For many of these kids, the  trauma of seeing friends, parents, siblings, classmates shot may result  in lifelong damage to their physical, mental, and emotional health.  That is what trauma does to the survivors.   This past June, 2 weeks after their 10-year-old daughter Lexi was  murdered at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Kimberly and Felix Rubio  testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. In their  testimony, Lexi's mom Kimberly issued a prophetic warning. She said:         There's a mom listening to our testimony thinking, I can't       imagine the pain that family is going through, not knowing       that our pain will one day be their pain unless we do       something.    While school massacres and other mass shootings tend to capture the  Nation's attention, there are tens of thousands of Americans who die  every year from the daily toll of gun violence, and many of these  deaths barely make the news, they are so commonplace in modern America.  They die in suicides, gun accidents--alone or in small groups--domestic  disturbances, gang disputes, and crossfire.   There is no corner of the country that hasn't been impacted by the  gun violence epidemic. Some of the politicians like to point and say:  Oh, Chicago has got all of the problems. Sadly, that is not the case.  We all face these problems. There are many so-called red States that  vote on the other side politically that have terrible gunshot and  violence statistics. It affects red States and blue States, big cities,  suburbs, small towns, rural areas--you name it. America is awash in  guns and gun violence.   So far this year in the city of Chicago, so far, 2,718 shootings have  taken place. According to the Chicago Sun-Times tracker, 88 of those  killed by guns in Chicago this year were children.   Last Sunday, I was at a vigil in the Hyde Park section of Chicago at  Augustana Lutheran Church. We come together each year to pray for an  end to this gun violence, but we know in our heart of hearts that  prayer is not enough. I believe the Good Lord expects us to pray but  expects us to take action, too.   The Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, has held 11 hearings  on gun violence in these last 2 years. We have heard from a lot of  witnesses. One I remember was Ernest Willingham from the West Side of  Chicago. After the Cabrini-Green housing project towers were torn down,  Ernest and his family moved to the west side of town. Before he was 17,  Ernest Willingham's father, brother, and cousin had all been shot. A  few years ago, he lost his best friend to a stray bullet.   Despite the horror around him, Ernest became the first in his family  to go to college. He is now a premed student at Northeastern University  in Boston. He has been accepted to medical school.   Ernest said that when he grew up, young people ``attend a lot more  funerals than weddings,'' and parents ``live in constant fear that  their [kid] will be the next'' victim.   Since Sandy Hook, millions of Americans have advocated to keep guns  out of the hands of criminals and people with mental instability and to  protect their kids, but the gun lobby has worked to put more guns in  more hands across America.   Many gun manufacturers and sellers have launched aggressive marketing  campaigns for their deadly guns.   One of the more notorious ads showed a photo of an assault weapon-- this is a military-style weapon--with the words under it ``Consider  your man card reissued.'' The assault rifle in that ad is a Bushmaster  XM-15, the same kind of semiautomatic assault rifle used to commit that  mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School. ``Consider your man card  reissued.''   Another ad showed soldiers in combat with the words ``Use what they  use.'' Use the same weapons that soldiers and marines use in combat,  but use them here in America. The ad came from the company called  Daniel Defense, the manufacturer of one of the semiautomatic assault  rifles used to murder those 19 little kids and teachers in Uvalde.   It gets worse. AR-15s and AR-style weapons have become the weapons of  choice for mass shooters.   This is an ad for a JR-15, a junior model of the AR-15. It is 20  percent smaller and lighter. It is designed for children--children-- under the age of 18.   Look at the logos in this ad. I hope you can see it. They are also on  the weapon. This gun manufacturer uses cartoon skulls sucking on  pacifiers to try to hook children on using military-style assault  weapons.   If I made that statement without this ad, you would say: Durbin is  making up a lie. That can't be true. They really want to sell these  guns to adults to give to little kids, and they have them festooned  with these images that children will find interesting?   On July 4 this year, a 21-year-old with a Smith & Wesson AR-15  military-style rifle went up on a rooftop during a Fourth of July  parade in Highland Park, IL.   Now, Highland Park, IL, is one of these idyllic suburbs, a beautiful  little place, wonderful families, a great community. And a Fourth of  July parade is like a rite of passage. You take your kids out to see  the flags, hear the bands, and enjoy every single moment of it.   This Fourth of July that we just witnessed was different. Up on top  of the roof, he pulled out his AR-15. He fired off 83 rounds in less  than a minute. Don't tell me about good shooters with guns, good guys  with guns that stop bad guys. There were good guys with guns all over  the place, in uniform, with firearms by their side. What could they do  in the 60 seconds when he fired off 83 rounds? Nothing to stop him.  That gunman killed seven people and injured dozens more.   Fourth of July parade, Highland Park, IL--he left a little 2-year-old  boy, Aiden McCarthy, an orphan. He killed his mother and his father. He  paralyzed an 8-year-old boy with a bullet that severed his spine.   The Fourth of July attack in Highland Park was the 309th mass  shooting in America in 2022. Do you know how many we have had since the  Fourth of July? We have gone from 309 on the Fourth of July to 627 mass  shootings in the United States of America this year.   Not every shooting is committed with an assault weapon, but if a  gunman wants to cause mass harm, assault weapons are the weapon of  choice. And you ought to see, if you haven't already, the ``60  Minutes'' segment of what happens to the human body when it is hit with  a bullet from one of these guns. It doesn't pass through neatly and  cleanly. It does damage inside the body which is almost impossible to  repair.   Doctors know the harm these bullets cause when they tear through the  flesh. They don't just pierce bones and organs; they pulverize them.   I will make it clear: I support banning these military-style assault  weapons from civilian use. We have banned them before, and I voted for  that. It saved lives. It is time to ban them again.   Military assault weapons belong in the hands of the military, not in  the hands of an 18- or 19-year-old on a roof in Highland Park, firing  off 83 rounds in less than 60 seconds.   One other point: Federal law gives the firearms industry broad and  unjustifiable immunity from civil liability. I am embarrassed to say  that the  [[Page S7160]]  laws of the United States protect the manufacturers of these weapons  from liability. There may be a way around that, and I hope there is.  Firearm manufacturers should not have a license to recklessly peddle  high-powered killing machines to those who shouldn't have them. They  should be held accountable.   Every other product in America is held accountable. Why do guns get  off the hook?   The brave families of Sandy Hook took assault weapon manufacturers to  court for their marketing practices. The families prevailed, leading to  a landmark settlement earlier this year.   Congress should do more to allow victims of gun violence and  negligence to seek justice in our courts. If naming and shaming won't  cause the gun industry to act responsibly, a day in court just might.   As we mark the grim anniversary of that devastating day 10 years ago  in Newtown, CT, we have got to recommit ourselves to do more--more to  protect our kids, more to prevent mass shootings, more to reduce the  daily toll of shootings in our homes and neighborhoods. Our work is not  done. Families across America are counting on us. Let's do something.  Let's stop this carnage in America.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, one of the frustrations of local  government is that good work tends to go unnoticed. If the streets are  clean and the trains run on time, it can be easy to overlook the hours  upon hours of work and collaboration that go into good governance.   And in my home State of Illinois, we have a team of heroes working  behind the scenes of local government every day, in the second-largest  county in the country. They are the 17 members of the Cook County Board  of Commissioners. And each one of them is responsible for funding Cook  County's many agencies, keeping our streets safe, and providing  oversight for everything from Chicago's courtrooms to one of the  largest health systems in America.   This year, one of Cook County's best is retiring after nearly 20  years of effective, dedicated service to the 13th district. His name is  Larry Suffredin. And I have been honored to count him as a friend and  admire his leadership for many years.   Larry entered office as a reformer, a title he has proudly lived up  to since he was first elected to the board of commissioners in 2002.  Over the past two decades, he has been a staunch advocate for the  health and safety of his constituents--from Rogers Park to Glencoe--and  an expert on the innerworkings of county government.   But long before Larry was elected commissioner, his commitment to the  people of Cook County was clear to anyone who knew him.  [[Page S7191]]    In fact, it is a commitment he demonstrated all the way back in the  sixth grade, when he was hired for his first job: delivering newspapers  to his neighbors in Westchester, IL. In Larry's words, it was a job  that ``helped me figure out how to deal with people.'' And it meant  waking up early in the morning, keeping close track over each stop on  his route, and--occasionally--outrunning his neighbors' dogs.   It was an experience that melded together two of Larry's great  qualities: his assiduous attention to detail and his determination to  help his community however he could.   By the time Larry graduated high school, he had set his sights on a  career in law. And after earning his bachelor's degree from Loyola in  Chicago, he made his way to Washington, where he--like me--attended  Georgetown Law. He actually received his J.D. just 3 years after me.   With his law degree and sharp mind, Larry could have easily landed a  comfortable job at a big law firm, but instead, he enlisted in the Air  Force and served as a captain in the U.S. Air Force Reserves.   After being honorably discharged, Larry returned home to Cook County  to serve his community as an assistant public defender. In just 2  years, he tried 32 cases to verdict.   It was around this time that Larry started developing a reputation as  an outstanding attorney. He distinguished himself in the courtroom with  his knowledge of the law and a masterful command of the complexities of  State government. Soon enough, the calls started flooding into Larry's  office, and over the past several decades, he has been hired to argue  cases before courts at every level, even the U.S. Supreme Court.   But no matter how far his legal talents took him, Larry's heart  always led him back to Chicagoland.   And soon after Larry was elected to the board of commissioners, he  emerged as one of Cook County's strongest advocates. Over the years, I  have had the privilege of working alongside Larry. For instance, in  2008, he was instrumental in saving the Cook County Health System from  financial collapse. Under his leadership, the county created an  independent health board, a decision that received criticism at the  time but, in retrospect, was both courageous and wise. Thanks to Larry,  the Cook County Health System is still in operation today, providing  comprehensive care that would not have been possible without the  creation of that independent board.   As commissioner, Larry has also been a champion for transparency. One  of his first accomplishments was codifying the Cook County code of  ordinances for the first time ever. Now, that may not sound like a big  deal, but for the residents of Cook County, it was a game changer; it  meant that everyday citizens could keep tabs on the Cook County Board,  along with the laws making their way through the legislative process.  It was a testament to one of Larry's core values: that government works  best when it is both clear and accessible. That is why, as  commissioner, he has regularly held community meetings with his  constituents--to personally answer their questions about newly enacted  laws or provide his take on the latest county board meetings.   If you ask Larry, he would likely tell you that one of his proudest  accomplishments in county government is the work he has done as Forest  Preserve Commissioner. Cook County's forest preserves encompass 70,000  acres of wild, wonderful nature. In Larry's words, ``it's one of the  most beautiful things we have . . . [the preserves hold] about 85  percent of all the stormwater runoff in the area. It gives us oxygen,  because of all the trees. There are so many things that this land does  to improve the quality of life in our area that we just take for  granted.''   Well, under Larry's leadership, these forest preserves have never  been taken for granted. In one of his last acts as commissioner, Larry  pushed for a bond referendum to fund the cost of the preserves'  restoration and maintenance. In last month's election, the referendum  passed, with the vast majority of Cook County voters supporting it.   Perhaps one of the only enemies that Larry has made throughout his  years of service to Cook County is the gun lobby. Back in 2006, he  spearheaded an ordinance banning assault weapons in Cook County. And  that measure has withstood one legal challenge after another, making  Larry one of the most effective advocates for gun safety reform in all  of Illinois.   It is hard to imagine Cook County government without Larry at the  helm. But his legacy will be felt for years and decades to come by the  more than 5 million Illinoisans who call Cook County home.   For every resident appealing a property tax assessment or enjoying a  sunny day by Bullfrog Lake, Larry has made a world of difference.   Larry, I want to thank you for everything you have done for our  friends and family in Chicagoland. I am grateful for your many years of  partnership and friendship.   Loretta and I look forward to celebrating your retirement with you,  your wife Gloria, and your two children, who have grown up right before  our eyes, Tom and Elizabeth.                            ____________________
