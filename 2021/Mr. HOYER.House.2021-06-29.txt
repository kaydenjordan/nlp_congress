 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  am glad to be back.   Madam Speaker, I have been out for 2 weeks, and now that I have a new  knee, I am good for another 20 years. That is what they tell me. They  guarantee me that.   Madam Speaker, when I brought this bill to the floor just about a  year ago, I referred to our Capitol Building as a sacred space for  democracy, a symbol around the world of democracy. The intervening  months have shown us, in ways we could not have imagined then, just how  true that statement was and is.   Sadly, we in this House, our colleagues in the Senate, all who work  here, experienced on January 6 a wrenching reminder of how democracy  demands our eternal defense and vigilance. We watched our temple of  democracy defiled by a violent mob of insurrectionists. For many of us  here, that was a watershed moment, seeing such evils pervade the halls  of the American Capitol.   However, Madam Speaker, for African Americans, who have been serving  here, working here, and visiting here for many decades, that sense of  defilement of this sacred space is all too familiar for them.   Our colleague, the former speaker of the California Assembly, Karen  Bass, made that clear when she spoke. When they see individuals like  John Calhoun, Charles Aycock, and James Paul Clarke celebrated in stone  and bronze in these halls, they are reminded that, for so much of our  history, the leaders and leading institutions of our government and  country did not view them as equal or, at times, even human.   When they enter the solemn Old Supreme Court Chamber and stare into  the cold marble eyes of Roger Brooke Taney, they are reminded that, at  one time, the highest court in our land declared that Black lives did  not matter.   Mr. Speaker, we ought not be surprised when our fellow citizens of  color raise signs that say: No, America, Black lives do matter. That is  somewhat what this debate is about.   In the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision written by Justice Taney, a  distinguished citizen of Maryland revered in his time for his intellect  and his accomplishments, Taney, in this terrible decision, quoted the  Declaration of Independence, which all of us quote so often: ``We hold  these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.''  Today, we would say all men and women are equal, irrespective of color.   But this Dred Scott decision ought to teach us a lesson today. It  ought to humble us today. When people around us say, ``Boy, that is the  right decision,'' because it happens to be the decision of the moment,  not a decision of history.   Beneath those lines, Taney wrote these: ``The general words,'' that  is, that all men are created equal, ``The general words above quoted  would seem to embrace the whole human family.'' Hear me, colleagues.  This is Taney speaking in a decision where he is about to say Black  lives do not matter.   He said, however, that it ``would seem to embrace the whole human  family,'' not divided by color or gender or nationality or religion,  the whole human race. And he went on to say: ``And if they were used in  a similar instrument at this day would be so understood.'' I want you  to think about that.   I want you to think about it, colleagues, with humility. Frankly, I  want those who argue for the originalist point of view to think of  that. Taney thought of that. And he thought, in his day, in 1857, the  whole human family would be covered by ``all men are created equal.''   But notwithstanding that belief, he did not so rule because he was  mired in the past, and the progress of those some 90 years had alluded  him because he went on to say: But ``the enslaved African race were not  intended to be included and formed no part of the people who framed and  adopted this Declaration.'' An originalist.   The Founders were human. They were extraordinary humans, but they  were human. Their environment shaped their thoughts, as they do ours.   Taney's words were used by the Confederacy during the Civil War to  justify the creation of a regime built to sustain the enslavement of  African Americans in perpetuity, with no possibility of recognizing  their humanity.                                time  1615    Even though Taney said that in 1857, that would have been the popular  definition of all men are created equal, Blacks and Whites alike.   And those words have been used ever since by bigots and white  supremacists to justify segregation, racial violence, and  discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my fellow colleagues that we must not allow the  author of those words to hold a place of honor in our Capitol. That is  why I introduced this legislation along with Representative Barbara  Lee; my dear friend of over a half a century,  Jim Clyburn;  Representative Karen Bass, former Speaker of the California Assembly;  Chairman Bennie Thompson from Mississippi; and Representative G. K.  Butterfield a North Carolina former Supreme Court Justice; and the  present chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Joyce  Beatty from Ohio.   Because this building, this sacred space, this temple of democracy  has been defiled for too long. We owe it not to forget history. We must  learn from history. But we ought not to honor that which defiled the  principles for which we think we stand and for which I think we do  stand.   It is time, Mr. Speaker, to remove those symbols of slavery,  segregation, and sedition from these Halls. How recently we saw,  remembered the savage genocide in Tulsa just a few weeks ago, justified  in the minds of many, I am sure, that these, after all, were not men  who were created equal. They were not children created in the image of  God. And therefore, some rationalized the taking of their lives  because, after all, their lives did not matter, and therefore, no one  was prosecuted, no one was held accountable.   As I said, Roger Brooke Taney was from my State of Maryland, and I  acknowledge, as I was growing up as a kid in the late 1950s in high  school and then in college in the 1960s, my party was the  segregationist party. And my party decided that we did not want to be  that party and that there was not a home for segregationists in the  Democratic Party. That is a decision we made consciously, knowing full  well the cost and that is why Lyndon Johnson said when he signed one of  the civil rights bills: We may have just given up the South.   In our State capital of Annapolis, Mr. Speaker, we removed the statue  of Chief Justice Taney, the highest ranking Marylander in the Federal  Government in history. It had stood there when I was sworn in as a  member of the State Senate. And when I listened to Governor Agnew give  his State of the Union, it was on the site of the  [[Page H3272]]  Roger Brooke Taney statue on the east front of our Capitol.   If you turn and walk west through the Capitol of Maryland, you will  come out on a park. It is the Thurgood Marshall Park, a testament to  the progress and enlightenment that occurred from Taney to Marshall in  our State.   The decision to remove Taney's statue was long overdue, but as the  gentleman from Texas said Martin Luther King said: It is never too late  to do the right thing. And this, today, is the right thing. It reflects  our growth as a State as we have confronted the most difficult parts of  our history and it will reflect our growth as we recognize it here, as  we did overwhelmingly when we passed this last year. Over a third of my  Republican colleagues joined the Democratic colleagues in saying Black  lives do, in fact, matter.   Those who say we shouldn't teach about slavery or that we should  sweep it under the rug or that we should skip over the lines in our  Constitution that reference it, do a disservice to our understanding of  America's greatness.    Jim Clyburn, our whip, a civil rights hero in his own right, likes  to quote de Tocqueville saying that America's greatness is not that it  always does the right thing. America's greatness is that it is willing  to correct its wrongs. We are great because we approach our past with  humility and openness. And we are great because we continue to protect  our democracy through more inclusion, more tolerance, more justice,  more equality, that all men and women, irrespective of artificial  distinctions or real distinctions, are equal in the eyes of our  Constitution and of our laws.   That is why Democrats and Republicans came together earlier this  month to make Juneteenth a national holiday, overwhelmingly, a handful  voting against that, in an articulation of our principles today, not  yesterday. That was Roger Brooke Taney's great blindness. That is why I  believe we can take this important step together today.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House once again to join me in passing this  legislation, to remove these statues and bust of Chief Justice Taney  from the Capitol. Not to forget them. Not to say they weren't part of  history, but they are not deserving of our honor. Not because we want  to erase history but because we are determined to confront it.   As a Marylander, proud of steps we have taken in Annapolis, I believe  that Justice Thurgood Marshall would be a far better ambassador for the  greatness of American democracy and for our State of Maryland than  Roger Brooke Taney. Where Roger Brooke Taney represents the worst of  American justice and racism, Thurgood Marshall represents the best of  justice and equality. He deserves to be honored in this Capitol for his  trailblazing career and lifelong dedication to civil rights and equal  justice for all.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues, not as Republicans and  Democrats, but as Americans who believe we are a special, exceptional  country because we lift up the individual and we protect the 1 against  the 99 if the 1 is right. That is the essence of America. And even  though they did not live it out perfectly, they articulated the  perfection of all men are created equal. And endowed not by the  Constitution, not by the laws of Congress, not by the majority vote of  their fellow citizens, endowed by their creator with certain  unalienable rights.   That is what this vote is about today, and I urge my colleagues, vote  ``yes'' for America, vote ``yes'' for its principles that are so  respected properly around the world.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Chairwoman Maloney's  leadership on this issue and so many other issues to protect the  citizens, protect consumers, protect voters, and protect, frankly,  those who stand up and say there is wrongdoing.   I heard the remarks of the ranking member, and I appreciate his  thoughtfulness. But as I was listening to him, I am thinking: How do  you make sure that somebody is not cowed by a President, any President,  who is prepared to take adverse action without cause against somebody  because he or she does not like the investigation they are undertaking?   As the gentleman may know, and as my colleagues may know, I urged a  rule that we adopted in this House which said that it is a violation of  our rules to out a whistleblower. We have put whistleblower protections  in, but unfortunately, when we had whistleblowers come forward most  recently, they were attacked and attempted to be outed, which would  have subjected them, obviously, to the adverse consequences against  which we tried to protect them in the legislation that we passed on  whistleblowing. So, I see some analogy between these two.   I thank Vice Chairman Gomez, Chairman Connolly, Chairman Lynch, and  Representatives Porter and Lieu for working on this legislation and  supporting this legislation. I was proud to introduce it with the chair  of the committee and proud to support it.   Madam Speaker, Americans deserve the highest standards of ethics,  transparency, and accountability from their government. Federal  agencies and officials work for the people, and they must be  accountable to the people. That is why the previous administration's  assault on the independence of inspectors general was so alarming.   This is not an attack on a specific administration. As the  gentlewoman and chair of the committee has pointed out, we have a  Democratic President now, so this is going to bind him. It is not going  to bind his predecessors. If anything, it is certainly not anti-Biden,  but it is to say: President Biden, we respect you, but we want to have  inspectors general who have the confidence they can move ahead without  fear of retribution.   Former President Trump removed or replaced, as has been pointed out,  the inspectors general from the Departments of Defense, State, Health  and Human Services, and Transportation. What kind of a check and  balance is that, if a President can simply say, ``I don't like what you  are doing. I am removing you''? I would suggest none, with all due  respect to my friend.   These watchdogs must be able to act independently and be free from  political pressure or threats to their careers. It seems to me that is  a very commonsense, rational judgment to make. That is what this is  about.   We introduced our bill to address the challenge exposed by the  actions of the prior administration, that is true. But that has not  been the only administration that has acted to undermine inspectors  general.   I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation  today. It will build on the provisions that I pushed to include in the  House Rules Committee, as I pointed out in January, which protects  Federal whistleblowers by making it a violation of House rules for  Members to reveal their identities.   Those who come forward to reveal misconduct or violations of the  public trust need to be heard and must be protected from threats of  retaliation. If that is not the case, it will undermine the very  objective that we seek in creating IGs. They need to know that they can  go to inspectors general or to Congress under strong whistleblower  protections.   House Democrats, and I hope House Republicans, will renew the faith  in government and ensure that it works for the people. We are  determined to protect and strengthen government accountability.   I hope all of us, in a bipartisan way, will repair this very critical  principle of accountability for the people of this country.
