 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the launch of the  Greater Oklahoma City Asian Chamber of Commerce, which will empower  businesses and support the economic growth of the Asian community in  Oklahoma.   The Asian community is one of the fastest growing populations in the  Nation and in Oklahoma, with nearly 50,000 Asian residents and more  than 5,300 businesses in the greater Oklahoma City metro area,  resulting in $203 million in payroll and $1.2 billion in sales.   Clearly, the Asian community has fostered great innovation and  boosted our local economy. I am proud to serve such a vibrant community  and am grateful for their remarkable contributions to the district.   Thank you to the incredible leaders and entrepreneurs who have  created this new chamber that will benefit the community and beyond.   I am particularly grateful for the leadership of Scarlet Le-Cao and  her vision in starting the Greater Oklahoma City Asian American Chamber  of Commerce. Her leadership will be vital for years to come.                            ____________________
