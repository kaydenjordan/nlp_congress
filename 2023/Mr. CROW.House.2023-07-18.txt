 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims of the  horrific mass shooting that occurred at Century 16 movie theater in  Aurora, Colorado, 11 years ago. My community forever changed the night  of July 20, 2012.   Twelve people, with arms full of popcorn and candy, walked into  theater 9 and never walked out. I think those of us in this room whose  communities have faced this type of tragedy would agree: There is a  before and there is an after, and what comes after is a shattered  community trying to make sense of a senseless act of violence.   Today, we remember Veronica, AJ, Micayla, Jessica, Alexander,  Jonathan, John, Matt, Alex, Jesse, Rebecca, and Gordon. They should  still be here.   Every year, Aurora and the greater Colorado community come together  to remember the lives we lost and the collective trauma shared. We also  recognize those, who in the face of unspeakable fear, stepped up to  help their loved ones and neighbors.   Let us not grow numb to the pain of this day, rather, we honor the  lives of those we lost by being relentless in our pursuit for gun  reform. As Members of Congress and as Americans, it is our duty.
