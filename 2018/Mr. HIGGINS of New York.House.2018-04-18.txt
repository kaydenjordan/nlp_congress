 Mr. Speaker, 120 years ago, Dr. Roswell Park  founded the first cancer center in America in Buffalo, New York. For  the last century, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has been a  leader in furthering our understanding of cancer and pioneering new  patient treatments.   Roswell Park gave the world the first preclinical chemotherapy  program, the prostate-specific antigen test, and it is collaborating  today with Cuba on a promising new lung cancer vaccine. Herceptin, for  metastatic breast cancer, was clinically trialed and tested at Roswell,  and new immunotherapy clinical trials are occurring there today.   In addition to promising new treatments, Roswell is home to the  compassionate cancer experts for those afflicted with cancer and for  those who love the afflicted.   Today, we are urging the National Institutes of Health to renew  Roswell Park's well-deserved designation as one of just 49 national  cancer centers in the Nation.   New lifesaving and life-quality treatments are within reach at  Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.                            ____________________
