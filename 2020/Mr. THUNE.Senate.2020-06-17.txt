 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in the wake of recent tragic deaths of  several African Americans at the hands of the police, our country has  reached a turning point.   Americans of every race, background, and political persuasion are  calling for change. Too many Americans feel unsafe right now. Too many  Americans live in fear that what happened to George Floyd could happen  to their own fathers, sons, and brothers. Too many Americans see in law  enforcement officers individuals to be feared rather than trusted.   Americans are ready for all of that to end. They want reform and  increased accountability. They want to make sure that we are holding  our law enforcement officers to the highest standards. And they want  their fellow Americans to feel confident that what happened to George  Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others will not happen to their  loved ones.   Members of Congress have been listening. I have been listening.  Today, I am proud to rise in support of Senator Scott's policing reform  bill, which I am cosponsoring.   Senator Scott's Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities  Everywhere Act, or the JUSTICE Act, is the product of a lot of serious  work--years of it, in fact. The JUSTICE Act is an extensive bill that  addresses various aspects of policing reform. One important section of  the bill is the George Floyd and Walter Scott Notification Act, which  would correct deficiencies in law enforcement reporting of use-of-force  incidents.   Right now, the FBI National Use-of-Force Data Collection receives  data on only about 40 percent of law enforcement officers. That needs  to change. The only way we can understand the scope of the problems we  are facing is to have full and accurate data. A complete data picture  will allow us to pinpoint problems, identify troubled police  departments, and develop best practices for use of force and  deescalation training.   There are many, many police departments across our Nation that are  doing an exemplary job of policing, that have excellent relationships  with the community, and that are already implementing a lot of best  practices. But there are also more troubled police departments.   Police departments that fail to train their officers properly  overlook officer misbehavior. We need to identify those police  departments and demand their reform. Collecting full and accurate data  on use-of-force incidents will help us do that.   One policing measure that has been found to reduce both officers' use  of force and complaints against police officers is body cameras. Body- worn cameras record every officer interaction with the community, which  encourages appropriate behavior and helps to create an accurate record  of events. These cameras keep both citizens and police officers safer.  But implementing the use of these cameras can be costly, as can storing  the copious data that accumulates. So the JUSTICE Act will create a new  grant program to help local police departments purchase body-worn  cameras and associated data storage. Funding eligibility will be  conditional on the department's implementation of best practices for  these cameras, and any department that fails to properly use the  cameras that it has purchased using the grant program will face a  reduction in Federal funding.   Another important section of the JUSTICE Act focuses on police  deescalation and duty-to-intervene training. Sometimes police end up  using force in situations where it could have been avoided simply  because they lack the necessary training to deescalate a situation  without the use of force. It may be understandable that well-meaning  but overwhelmed police officers in dangerous circumstances have  sometimes resorted to the use of force too quickly, but that is not a  situation we can accept.   Every police officer in this country should be given the kind of  training that will ensure that use of force is restricted only to those  situations where it is absolutely needed.   I expect to see a lot of support for this bill from my Republican  colleagues here in the Senate. I wouldn't be surprised if this bill  receives a lot of support from law enforcement, as well, because most  of our Nation's law enforcement officers want to implement policing  best practices. They want to develop strong relationships with the  communities they protect, and they want to avoid use-of-force incidents  that place both officers and suspects in jeopardy.   I met with local law enforcement leaders in my home State of South  Dakota last Friday. What I heard from them was a real desire to do  everything they can to serve every member of their communities. They  have already been participating in forums to listen to community  concerns in the wake of George Floyd's death, and they are supportive  of JUSTICE Act measures to help departments expand their minority  hiring, to improve deescalation training, and to develop and promulgate  best practices. I wouldn't be surprised if they and a lot of other law  enforcement agencies end up backing this bill.   I really hope Democrats will come to the table as well. Senator Scott  has produced a bill that should have the support of every Member of the  Senate, and I hope that it will.   We have made a lot of progress as a nation when it comes to  overcoming the sins of our past, but it would be a mistake to think  that because we have made progress, our work is over. There is still  much to be done and many wounds to heal.   We must make those tasks a priority. We must continue to work toward  a more perfect Union, toward the full realization of our founding  promise that all men are created equal, and toward  [[Page S3028]]  an America where there is truly liberty and justice for all.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
