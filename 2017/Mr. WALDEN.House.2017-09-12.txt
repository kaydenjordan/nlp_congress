CUT-GO COMPLIANCE.         Subsection (f) of section 319D of the Public Health Service       Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-4) is amended by striking ``through       2018'' and inserting ``through 2017, and $128,300,000 for       fiscal year 2018''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 931, the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2017, introduced by  my friend and colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee,  Representative Chris Collins from New York, who we will hear from  shortly, will create a national registry to collect information to  better understand cancer incidence in firefighters.   These heroic first responders experience occupational health risks  every day. In my district, it is oftentimes from forest fires, like we  are having all summer long. This past weekend I saw firsthand what our  firefighters face as they battle a number of fires raging in Oregon,  putting themselves in harm's way to save property, infrastructure,  lives, watersheds, habitats, and our forests.   I was deeply reminded yesterday morning, as I watched some of the  news coverage that took us back 16 years ago to 9/11, and seeing the  scenes of the buildings collapsing and burning and the people emerging,  individual citizens, first responders, caked in dust and toxins and  dealing with smoke, you realize just the peril that our first  responders often find themselves in. They rush into buildings to save  lives, and we deeply appreciate what they do. That is why this  legislation is an important step to help them.   Nationwide, we have this problem with our firefighters. They came to  us and said: We need this registry.   Again, going back to the West and what we face, and I saw it when I  flew across the country to come here, not only are there fires and  smoke throughout Oregon, but also all across the West: Colorado,  Montana, Wyoming, hill and valley choked with smoke.   Close to 8 million acres burned in wildfires so far this year; more  than half a million in Oregon on both public and mostly private lands.  Thousands of residents have had to be evacuated. Firefighters, of  course, stayed behind. They do what they do.   Multiple studies have shown a correlation between firefighting and  cancer. However, the reasons behind this are not fully understood. We  owe it to these first responders to understand the causal link to  cancer. Having better data to identify why firefighters are at an  increased risk for some cancers will hopefully lead to better  protective measures and ultimately reduce some of the hazards that they  face when putting their lives on the line.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Collins) for his  good work on this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Collins), the author of this very important legislation and  an important member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), the chairman of the  [[Page H7251]]  Subcommittee on Health, the gentleman who helped move this legislation  forward, and leads our committee on matters of health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance), another very important member of our Energy and  Commerce Committee, who I know had many constituents horribly affected  by the tragic events of 9/11.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Faso), who also had constituents who were very affected by  the events of 9/11.    Mr. Speaker, we all join in thanking our first  responders. This is the least of the things we can do to show how much  we care about our firefighters, and I would encourage our colleagues in  the House to support this very important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
