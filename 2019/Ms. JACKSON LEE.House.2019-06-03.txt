 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2157,  the Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019.   This bill is a comprehensive emergency disaster supplemental bill I  to help meet the urgent needs of American communities still struggling  to recover from recent hurricanes, typhoons, wildfires, floods and  other natural disasters.   This bill would have been signed into law much earlier, had it not  been thwarted by Republican House Members from the 21st Congressional  District of Texas and from the 4th Congressional District of Kentucky  who deprived the bill of the unanimous consent needed for passage.   This robust disaster package includes $17.2 billion in long overdue  emergency spending for disaster-stricken communities across our nation  and territories.   It builds on the legislation that passed the House in January-- including an additional $3 billion to address the urgent needs of those  living in the Midwest (Nebraska, Missouri, South Dakota, Iowa and  Kansas) and South (Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the  Carolinas) who have been devastated by flooding and tornadoes in recent  months.   This bill also provides some additional disaster assistance to  communities continuing to recover from Hurricane Harvey.   House Democrats are standing up and acting to help communities across  the United States and in Puerto Rico, Texas, the Northern Mariana  Islands, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa recover and  heal from devastating disasters--these communities should not be held  hostage because of this administration's benign neglect toward Puerto  Rico.   Senate Republicans should come to their senses and join Democrats in  advancing this bill and speeding relief to millions of Americans.   Included in this legislation is critical funding for:   Infrastructure and community development to rebuild our  transportation systems and repair housing, businesses and public  infrastructure;   Farmers and rural communities to bolster the farmer safety net and  restore disaster-damaged lands;   Social services, mental health, education and dislocated worker  initiatives to invest in the well-being of children, workers and  families in disaster-struck areas--including providing critical  nutrition and Medicaid assistance for Puerto Rico and U.S. territories;   DOD and Veterans Affairs to repair and rebuild hurricane-damaged  bases and facilities; and   Disaster resiliency to mitigate damage and costs from future  disasters which are becoming more frequent as a result of climate  change.   American families hit by natural disasters deserve to know that  (their government will stand with them throughout the road to recovery.   Democrats are committed to delivering this assistance to our fellow  Americans as they work to rebuild their lives and their communities.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2157, the ``Supplemental Appropriations Act of  2019,'' provides much needed and long overdue relief to Americans in  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Texans who are still suffering  from the ravages of Hurricanes Maria, Irma, and Harvey as well as  provide relief to victims of Hurricane Michael which struck Alabama,  Florida, and Georgia in October 2018 and to the victims of the  Midwestern floods.   Hurricane Harvey ranks as the second-most costly hurricane to hit the  U.S. mainland since 1900, causing more than $125 billion in damage.   Our residents need more money for single-family home repairs, whether  it is disaster recovery or general housing dollars and I will continue  to strive on behalf of the neighborhoods and on behalf of hard-working  homeowners who deserve these funds, so they can continue on with their  lives and return to their homes.   Victims of natural disasters are entitled to know who to contact when  issues related to FEMA arise and to be assured that their questions are  answered, and complaints addressed.   Allocating funding for measures such as Electricity Delivery for  necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey,  Maria, Irma, and Super Typhoon Yutu, is vital to negate the effects of  these catastrophic events from significantly worsening.   Hospitals, first-responders, and a number of other vital institutions  that help our communities recover from the after-effects of natural  disasters need access to electricity.   Moreover, with the severity of natural disasters and the ranging of  their locations, we must be proactive in our preparation for recovery.   Alternatively, water is the most essential resource known to man.   A human can go for more than three weeks without food--Mahatma Gandhi  survived 21 days of complete starvation--but water is a different  story.   At least 60 percent of the adult body is made of it and every living  cell in the body needs it to keep functioning.   Under extreme conditions an adult can lose 1 to 1.5 liters of sweat  per hour and if that lost water is not replaced, the total volume of  body fluid can fall quickly and, most dangerously, blood volume may  drop.  [[Page H4195]]    We do not have the luxury of ignoring hurricanes, floods,  earthquakes, mudslides, tornados or other natural disasters.   With these events it is not a question of ``if'', but ``when.''   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2157.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2940, which  strengthens the ``Temporary Assistance for Needy-Families'' program.   Specifically, H.R. 2940 extends the authorizations for the Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) and the Child Care  Entitlement to States (CCES) through September 30, 2019.   The legislation passed by Congress to end the Trump Shutdown  authorizes the TANF program through June 30, 2019.   H.R. 2940 is necessary to ensure that the Department of Health and  Human Services has the authority to pay fourth quarter allotments to  states, tribes, and territories on time and in full, preventing any  interruption of benefits to low-income parents and children.   TANF is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) and features four program goals: provide assistance to  needy families so that children can be cared for in their own homes;  reduce the dependency of needy parents by promoting job preparation,  work and marriage; prevent and reduce unplanned pregnancies among 1  single young adults; and encourage the formation and maintenance of  two-parent families.   Under TANF, the federal government gives states a fixed block grant  totaling $16.5 billion each year.   This annual amount has not increased for inflation over the past two  decades-and now covers only two-thirds of the purchasing power when it  was created.   TANF and SNAP are essential to provide nutritional and financial  assistance to the nation's neediest families and children.   Nearly half (48 percent) (3,375,666) of Texan children live in low- income families which is significantly higher than the national level  of 41 percent.   Texas needs to increase the amount of funding for needy families to  support their livelihoods and prosperity.   Many TANF families struggle with multiple barriers to self- sufficiency, such as disabilities, mental health issues, domestic  violence and substance use disorders.   As a result, these families may not always be able to meet the full  participation requirements.  [[Page H4198]]    States and counties should be given the flexibility to provide  partial credit to these families with special needs.   TANF funding should be increased annually by an amount commensurate  with the rate of inflation to ensure that the program's actual value  does not decrease each year.   Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in Texas has supported  57,201 Texans in FY2018.   Texas has reported March 2019 TANF expenditures of $3,371,717 for  18,195 cases.   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Texas is  listed as one of nine (9) states that spend less than 10 percent of  TANF funds.   Another families program that falls under assistance for needy is the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides  nutritional assistance to children and families.   Texas has spent $357,125,771 over the span of 1,377,384 cases in  April 2019.   As of April 2019, Houston has 1,557 SNAP cases, which provides  services to 3,168 people, of which 252 are elderly and 1,461 are  children.   In total, SNAP has funded $350,743 in food assistance as of April  2019 in Houston.   Long-term reauthorization and adequate funding for this safety-net  program are critical for counties, which invest over $58 billion  annually in human services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2940  to support the extension of these critical programs for our needy  families and children.    Madam Speaker, I was saddened to stand alongside  Congresswoman McBath to ask for a moment of silence for yet another  innocent group of Americans who died.   We must gather in this House and demand the Senate to pass our  legislation on gun safety, but we must also stand together against  making legal access for anyone to have a silencer. We just have to do  better as relates to the lives of Americans.   I stand, as well, to support the passage of the Supplemental  Appropriations Act, very important to those of us in Texas.   As I watched this past week all of the disasters that were happening,  it was sad. It was disappointing to know that there were Members on the  floor objecting to this bill.   In particular, Houston, Texas, impacted by Hurricane Harvey, needed  this money for its water treatment, its reimbursement, freshwater, and  its sewage treatment.   In addition, the people in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico  territories are desperate for resources. Many of us who visited know  that they are long overdue.   Finally, I am supporting the extension of TANF, the very important  nutrition legislation that provides for our children. It is expiring on  June 30.   We have to do better. We cannot, in essence, yield to people who  believe that these kinds of solutions should be over.                            ____________________
