 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just want to briefly associate myself  with the remarks of the Republican leader,  [[Page S2255]]  Senator McConnell, with respect to the alleged breach of the Supreme  Court and reiterate that this is a lawless action. If it turns out to  be what we believe to be true, it should be investigated, punished as  fully as possible. The Chief Justice has to get to the bottom of this.  And, if applicable, the Department of Justice needs to pursue any  criminal charges.   Let me just say, too, that I believe, as Senator McConnell pointed  out, that all nine Justices on the Supreme Court should tune out the  bad-faith noise and feel totally free to do their jobs following the  facts and the law where they lead. We need an independent Supreme  Court, and we should, at every turn, be defending the independence of  our Supreme Court.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr.  Tuberville).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier today on the floor,  President Biden has apparently decided that COVID is over at our  southern border but not, apparently, for American toddlers.   While a court injunction has barred enforcement in a number of  States, the Department of Health and Human Services has still not  repealed its mask and vaccine mandate for Head Start Programs--a  mandate that requires children as young as 2 years old to wear masks  indoors and, incredibly, outside.   The scientific evidence for masking toddlers is shaky at best. The  World Health Organization does not recommend masking for children under  5. The concerns about the effect on speech and children's development  are real. But none of that seems to matter to the administration.   Despite the low danger of serious illness in children, apparently the  Biden administration believes that toddlers should be masked in  perpetuity--a position Secretary Becerra doubled down on in front of  the Senate Finance Committee last month.   If the Biden administration isn't going to repeal its toddler mask  mandate, it is time for Congress to step in and do it for them. The  resolution of disapproval that I have introduced and which we are  voting on in the next few minutes would end the administration's  mandate, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for this  resolution. It is past time to call a halt to the Biden  administration's outdated and unscientific mandate and ensure that our  toddlers can run around the playground mask-free.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask for the yeas and nays.                             Vote on S.J.
