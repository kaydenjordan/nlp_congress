 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment prevents a huge water grab  by the State of California from farmers and communities in California's  Central Valley.   Under Sacramento's new plan, residents and farmers, alike, will  suffer skyrocketing rates that will cripple our local economy, our  farms, and our communities. Specifically, the State is mandating 40  percent of the water from Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers to be  flushed out into the ocean.                                time  1900    Currently, we are losing about 25 percent of our current water being  flushed out by these mandated flows. This will increase it to 40  percent. This water feeds the Central Valley Project and the farmers  that rely on it. My community relies on this water for drinking, to  operate our local businesses, and for green power. This powers our  local communities.   The amendment prevents the State from robbing water from the Valley  and protects the New Melones reservoir from depletion. The New Melones  is a Federal facility that provides water for the Central Valley, and  generates hydropower for Californians.   The Bay-Delta Plan will drain significantly more water from New  Melones each year than it currently releases, leaving the reservoir  completely dry some years. The reservoir will be unable to meet its  water obligations to the federally-authorized Central Valley project,  which is critical to moving water all across the Central Valley. Lower  water levels will reduce the ability to generate power.   My amendment prevents Federal dollars from contributing to this  misguided plan, and the State from robbing our water. We need more  water in the valley, not less.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock). The reservoir resides in his district.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chair, the gentleman talks about a compromise. I will  not compromise and allow our people to go without water, people that  [[Page H6523]]  have no drinking water, only to have FEMA come in and bring bottled  water. I will not shut down our farms. That is not a compromise.   This is a Federal project that has our water for our community that  now they want to double the amount that goes out to the ocean. It is a  waste. It is harmful to our community. It will shut down our  agriculture, and it will leave people without potable drinking water.   This is insanity to try to say that you are saving the fish when  there is no science. This will harm the fish. Without water, without  green power, and without cold water, you will kill the very fish that  you are trying to save.   I believe that our farms deserve this, our communities deserve this,  and our people must have it to survive.   I yield back the balance of my time.
