 Mr. President, I hear from Iowans all the time about  the high cost of hearing aids. The $5,000 or $6,000 or even $10,000  costs are often shocking for seniors who are on fixed incomes.   Thirty-eight million Americans, and, obviously, most of the time  adults, have hearing loss. Hearing loss makes it harder to work, harder  to socialize, and then easier to become isolated.   In 2016, I began a bipartisan effort with Democratic Senator Warren  of Massachusetts to allow consumers to purchase over-the-counter  hearing aids. If you can buy nonprescription reading glasses over the  counter, it makes very good sense that you should be able to buy basic,  safe hearing aids as well.   When Senator Warren and I began our efforts, our goal was simple: By  making more products more easily available to consumers, this  competition will increase and then lead to lower costs.   Despite every special interest, we passed in 2017 a bill that is  entitled the ``Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act.'' Last week, the FDA,  just now, released proposed regulations for over-the-counter hearing  aids. This is very welcomed news, but it took the FDA bureaucracy more  than 3 years to draft regulations.   Senator Warren and I pressed both the Trump administration and now  the Biden administration to take action, get these regulations out so  we can get these over-the-counter hearing aids on the market. I am glad  that the FDA finally did its job.   Now the same Iowans who told me about the high cost of hearing aids  can comment on the draft regulations. So everybody who wants to make  such comments has until January 18 of next year to make comments on the  draft regulations.   As long as the FDA bureaucracy acts--and I hope they will be  listening--I expect Iowans can purchase over-the-counter hearing aids  sometime in early 2022.   This is good news for Iowans and for Americans, generally.   I yield the floor.
