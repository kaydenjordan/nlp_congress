 Madam Speaker, this legislation does stir a great number of  emotions in me. I do know what it is to protect life, take life, and to  see life lost, and our role should always be to protect the innocent.   But I also know that our role as a society has been to subsidize the  genocide of our unborn, and that reflects how desensitized we have  become to the true value of a child each year, as we kill hundreds of  thousands of the most innocent among us: unborn children who smile, who  grab, and who are self-aware and feel pain.   If we truly are what we do, then who are we if we purposely bring  unthinkable pain to a baby boy or baby girl just before their life is  snuffed out of them?   This legislation is a leap forward for our collective conscience as a  nation, and it is a strong step forward in returning value to life that  we see, especially the most unique life that exists out there: that  special creature that was created by God.
