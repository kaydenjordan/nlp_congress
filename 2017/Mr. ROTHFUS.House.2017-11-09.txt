 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Jobs, jobs, jobs. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express  my support for the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act.    Whose side am I on? The tens of millions of folks who don't have jobs  out there who want job opportunities. We know from some studies that,  over the last 8 years of wrong regulation, 650,000 small businesses  have not been created. That means 6\1/2\ million jobs, 6\1/2\ million  people who are not paying Medicare tax, and 6\1/2\ million people who  are not paying Social Security tax. We need these people in the game,  Mr. Speaker, and this act can help them get into the game.   This is an important piece of pro-jobs legislation, and I thank my  colleague, Mr. Emmer, for introducing it.   We all want our economy to become vibrant once again so it can  generate opportunity and prosperity for all Americans. Unfortunately,  regulatory burdens--both new and preexisting--often get in the way of  raising capital and building a business.   At hearing after hearing at the Financial Services Committee, we have  heard from financial institutions that are unable to lend to small  businesses or are afraid to do so. We have also heard from businesses  that cannot find the capital they need to expand or to retool. All of  this has an impact on jobs and wages as well as on our overall economy.   The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is a targeted, commonsense bill  that will make it easier for small businesses to access capital that  they need to grow.   Specifically, H.R. 2201 will permit businesses to issue a limited  number of securities to individuals with whom principals have a  preexisting relationship. This would include family and friends who are  often early investors in startups.   Businesses will only be able to issue a small amount of securities-- $500,000 a year--but that is a step in the right direction toward  helping businesses that need funding.   This is good policy that will make it easier for small businesses to  get off the ground, grow, and add jobs.   At the same time, this bill ensures that our regulators can continue  to police fraud and abuse, and to do so aggressively. On that point,  there is no ambiguity. Fraud is illegal, and it will not be tolerated  or excused.   Again, I strongly support the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. It is  good for the economy and good for hardworking Americans. It is good for  jobs, jobs, jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
