 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 389, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1994) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  encourage retirement savings, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1994.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1994, the Setting Every  Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, or the SECURE Act. This is  the most substantive promotion of retirement savings in the last 15  years, and we all should be pleased that we are part of it this  morning.   One of my priorities since becoming chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee has been helping American workers of all ages prepare for a  financially secure retirement, so I am particularly pleased to be  bringing this legislation to the floor this morning.   I also am very proud of the fact that I was able to collaborate with  Ranking  [[Page H4136]]  Member Kevin Brady and our Republican colleagues in drafting this  legislation. Both Republicans and Democrats have wins in this bill, and  I would like to thank Mr. Brady this morning for all of his hard work  in helping me to write this legislation.   Unfortunately, currently, Americans face a retirement income crisis  with too many people in danger of not having enough in retirement to  maintain their standard of living and avoid sliding into poverty.   Social Security benefits are modest; employer-sponsored pensions are  disappearing; and too many people find it difficult to save for  retirement. According to a recent study, one-third of American workers  believe that they will either face a significant financial hardship  during retirement or, in fact, will never retire. And the 2018 study  found that almost two-thirds of workers have no retirement account  assets.                                time  0915    The SECURE Act, which the Ways and Means Committee approved with  unanimous, bipartisan votes, goes a long way in addressing this problem  by making it easier for Americans to save.   For example, the SECURE Act includes a small employer automatic  enrollment credit. Automatic enrollment is shown to increase employee  participation and retirement savings opportunities. Our bill creates a  new tax credit of up to $500 per year for employers to defray the  startup costs for new 401(k) plans that include automatic enrollment.   The SECURE Act also increases the age for required minimum  distributions from 70\1/2\ to 72. This age hasn't been adjusted since  the 1960s. With Americans working longer, this will encourage them to  continue saving.   The SECURE Act also allows long-term, part-time employees to  participate in their employer's 401(k) plans. Women are more likely to  work part-time than men, so this legislation is particularly important  for women.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Murphy for her leadership here.   The bill would also make it easier for small businesses to offer  retirement plans to their employees by eliminating outdated barriers to  the use of multiple employer plans. As a result of this provision, it  is estimated that 600,000 to 700,000 new retirement opportunities will  be formed.   All of these are important, commonsense proposals that will improve  our retirement system.   I also note that this bill has tremendous support from a diverse  group of stakeholders: AARP, SEIU, the Women's Institute for a Secure  Retirement, Church Alliance, the Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts, and the  National Rural Electric Cooperative.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I want to highlight a provision that fixes an  urgent problem affecting children of our fallen troops and first  responders. Due to changes included in the Republicans' tax law, the  amount of tax imposed on survivor benefits for children of veterans,  Active Duty servicemembers, and emergency personnel increased  significantly.   This bill eliminates that tax increase by repealing those changes. It  also makes sure that all similar payments, like Tribal government  payments to children, payments out of the Alaska Permanent Fund, and  certain scholarships and fellowship grants will not be subject to this  unexpected and unfair tax treatment.   These fixes could not have been accomplished without Mrs. Luria's  leadership on behalf of our troops, along with many Members on both  sides of the aisle who supported her efforts.   We should recognize Ms. Moore's leadership on Tribal payments and Mr.  Horsford's leadership on the scholarship issue.   I am very proud that we were able to put together a bill that will  help American families prepare for a financially secure retirement, and  that it was done on a bipartisan basis, which we will acknowledge as  the morning moves on, with significant stakeholder support.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1994, the SECURE  Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Church Alliance.                                                Church Alliance,                                                      April 1, 2019.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways and Means,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Kind,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Kelly,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal, Ranking Member Brady, Congressman Kind       and Congressman Kelly: The Church Alliance expresses our deep       gratitude for inclusion of a provision to clarify that all       church-affiliated organizations are able to participate in       church 403(b)(9) retirement plans in the recently introduced       Setting Every Community up for Retirement Enhancement       (SECURE) Act of 2019 (H.R. 1994). We are grateful for the       tremendous bipartisan work that has been done over the past       several years on retirement reform, and are hopeful Congress       will swiftly pass this legislation to ensure retirement       security for clergy, lay workers and their families across       the United States.        The Church Alliance is a coalition of the chief executive       officers of 37 church benefits boards which are affiliated       with mainline and evangelical Protestant denominations, three       Jewish groups, and some Catholic schools and institutions.       Church Alliance members provide employee benefits to       approximately one million clergy, lay workers, and their       families, serving over 155,000 churches, synagogues, and       affiliated organizations such as schools, colleges and       universities, nursing homes, children's homes, homeless       shelters, food banks, and other ministries.        Section 110 of the SECURE Act seeks to clarify a recent       positron by the Treasury Department and IRS to disregard more       than 30 years of practice, precedent, and clear statutory       language to bar employees of certain church-affiliated       organizations from participating in retirement income account       plans offered under section 403(b)(9) of the Tax Code. As a       result, employees of church-related nursing homes, daycare       centers, summer camps, preschools, colleges, universities,       hospitals, and other social service organizations stand to       lose access to the unique plan features they have come to       depend upon. In addition, the Treasury and IRS position would       cause church 403(b)(9) plans to incur significant transition       costs, which would unfortunately siphon resources away from       our core mission of supporting clergy and church lay workers       and lead to higher costs for these plan participants.        We are encouraged by the introduction of the SECURE Act and       its upcoming markup on April 2. We hope the House votes on       passage of this important legislation as soon as possible. On       behalf of the Church Alliance, thank you for your       consideration of and attention to this important matter. We       look forward to continuing to work with you to promote the       retirement security of people of faith nationwide.            Sincerely,                                              James F. (Jim) Sanft,                                      Chair of the Church Alliance.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Select Revenue Measures.    Madam Speaker, that is one of those moments when I didn't  mind the gentleman's time running over.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from  diverse coalitions across the country, including the Girl Scouts, the  Jewish Federation, the Boy Scouts of America, the Christian Schools  International, The Rural Broadband Association, and the National  Council of Farmer Cooperatives.                                                      April 1, 2019.    Charities & Co-ops Endorse ``SECURE Act'' Retirement Package--Stops              PBGC From Grossly Overcharging Our Pension Plans         We endorse the bipartisan ``SECURE Act'' retirement package       introduced by Ways & Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-MA),       Ranking Member Kevin Brady (R-TX), and Reps. Ron Kind (D-WI)       and Mike Kelly (R-PA). The ``SECURE Act'' stops the Pension       Benefit Guaranty Corp. (PBGC) from grossly overcharging       ``Cooperative and Small Employer Charity'' defined benefit       pension plans, i.e., plans covering multiple charities or       rural cooperatives (``CSEC Plans'') by including critical       provisions of H.R. 1007, the ``Retirement Enhancement and       Savings Act'' and H.R. 1993, the ``Providing Retirement       Security to Workers in Small Businesses, Cooperatives, and       Service Organizations Act'' championed by Reps. Kind and       Kelly.        Our core missions are to provide food, electricity,       broadband, and other necessities of life, educate and empower       children, care for the most vulnerable, and promote the       sustainable development of the communities in which our       millions of members, volunteers and beneficiaries live.       However, current PBGC rules designed for large ``single-      employer'' for-profit companies inappropriately require us to       divert scarce resources from our core missions. These bills       fix this inequity permanently.        The same facts that led Congress to adjust funding rules       for CSEC Plans in 2014 strongly support adjusting PBGC       premiums charged to CSEC Plans today. (See Cooperative and       Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act of 2014 (Pub.       L. No. 113-97). It does not make sense for CSEC Plans to be       subject to premiums designed for large ``single-employer''       for-profit companies.        It's time to stop forcing charities and not-for-profit       cooperatives to subsidize the PBGC premiums of large       ``single-employer'' companies. PBGC's own data supports       reducing premiums for CSEC Plans; in fact, PBGC projects       making more than a 3,000 percent return on CSEC plans for the       2014-2018 period.        Congress should include these provisions in any retirement       package sent to the President's desk.

Madam Speaker, I acknowledge the good work that Mr. Kelly  and Mr. Kind did on one very important amendment on this as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), who was very instrumental in the provisions  that will simplify the Form 5500 filing process for small business.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support  for the SECURE Act from the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners.                                             National Association of                                         Insurance Commissioners,                                                        May 7, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Ways and Means Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Ways and Means Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady: On behalf of       the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC),       we would like to express our support for H.R. 1994, the       Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement       (SECURE) Act. Recognizing the retirement savings crisis that       exists in the United States, state insurance regulators have       worked to make improvements to regulation and guidance       impacting product delivery, compliance, and innovation of       insurance products designed to help mitigate this crisis       under the NAIC Retirement Security Initiative. Given the       unique products and features of our sector, state insurance       regulators have embraced a broader public policy       responsibility to not only ensure consumers remain protected       by a solvent industry, but to help foster an environment       where they have greater flexibility and more options to take       informed steps to secure their retirement. The SECURE Act is       aligned with the goals of this initiative as it seeks to       provide greater consumer options for retirement plans.        Several of the provisions contained in the SECURE Act also       complement our own consumer financial literacy and disclosure       efforts and will make it easier for consumers to save for       retirement. First, the legislation makes it easier for       consumers to engage in a tax-free rollover of an annuity to       another employer-sponsored retirement plan or IRA and avoid       surrender charges and fees, making these products more       portable and providing consumers more flexibility. Second,       the bill would encourage plan participants to think in terms       of lifetime income by requiring benefit statements to break       down the total account balance into estimates of monthly       annuity income at least once a year. Third, the legislation       makes it easier for ERISA plan sponsors to select companies       to offer annuity products by creating a safe harbor that       relies on the conservative solvency regime of the state       insurance regulatory system, which is specifically designed       to ensure that an insurance company's obligations will be met       both today and many years into the future.        We applaud your leadership in this effort to assist savers       in making more-informed decisions to prepare for their       retirement and allowing defined contribution plans to become       a more effective vehicle for providing lifetime income.            Sincerely,      Eric A. Cioppa,        NAIC President, Superintendent, Maine Bureau of Insurance.      David Altmaier,        NAIC Vice President, Commissioner, Florida Office of       Insurance Regulation.      Michael F. Consedine,        Chief Executive Officer, National Association of Insurance       Commissioners.      Raymond G. Farmer,        NAIC President-Elect, Director, South Carolina Department       of Insurance.      Dean L. Cameron,        NAIC Secretary-Treasurer, Director, Idaho Department of       Insurance.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), who was very instrumental in provisions which  will help small businesses sponsor retirement plans, including  multiple-employer plans.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), chairman of the Trade Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), who was very instrumental in the provisions  providing pension funding relief for community newspapers and home  healthcare workers as they attempt to maintain their retirement plans.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who was a leader on the kiddie tax issue  addressing Tribal distributions.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore) for her  support of the bill before us and her leadership on addressing the  unfair tax that has plagued Tribes making taxable distributions to  their children and young adults.                                time  1000    The kiddie tax was enacted to prevent wealthy families from shifting  family income to minor children.   The rationale for this new law does not apply to funds distributed by  Indian Tribal governments because Indian Tribes are not taxable  entities and their distributions could never be intended for the  purpose of a tax deduction.   The Ways and Means Committee will work to address this problem, with  the goal of excluding such Tribal government distributions from the  kiddie tax provisions.    Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining on both sides?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), who is very knowledgeable about retirement  issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and thank the gentleman for his valuable work on  the kiddie tax issue that affects the children of fallen first  responders.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Murphy), who was instrumental on a provision allowing  long-term, part-time workers to participate in 401(k) plans.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), who was very instrumental on a provision  related to benefits to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical  responders.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott). Chairman  Bobby Scott is responsible for a number  of very important provisions in this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria) and thank her particularly for her critical  leadership in preventing an unfair and unexpected tax burden from being  imposed on the children of our fallen soldiers.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Virginia an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As I close, I want to take a moment to celebrate this truly  bipartisan process that brought this legislation to the floor today.   First, I want to thank the Democratic members and Republican members  of the Committee on Ways and Means, and, in particular, I want to thank  Mr. Brady for his good work along the way.   I also want to acknowledge that there is more work to be done in the  leadership space in terms of retirement savings, and I am hopeful that  we will be able to do that as well.   Let me acknowledge Mr. Roe, Mrs. Trahan, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, Ms.  Blunt Rochester, Mr. Walberg, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Banks, Mr. Pocan, Mr.  Budd, Mrs. Luria, and Mr. Bacon.   Certainly, as I come down the home stretch in closing, I want to  acknowledge much of the good work that has taken place by staff members  on both sides as well. But let me cite on the Democratic side, if I  could--this was a pretty big bill, and it required a team effort. The  Democratic staff, including Kara Getz, Andrew Grossman, Beth Bell,  Aruna Kalyanam, Mary Petrovic, and Lee Slater all did yeomen and  [[Page H4146]]  yeowomen's work in making sure that we would get to this day.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman really gave away his argument  in the opening sentence, when he said: You know the drill on the MTR.   Yes, we know the drill on MTRs, how they are being used to heap scorn  on complicated arguments, the demagogue arguments that should be taken  up in a separate space.   But you know what else this is about? For those of us who came  through the wards and precincts of American politics, there is a  difference in politics between being cute and being clever. This is  cute. This is not clever.   So let me just bring to your attention the following:   We have before us today the most important and substantive advance in  retirement savings in the last 15 years in America. Understanding today  that the average Social Security benefit in America--``average,''  meaning that half the American people who receive the benefit are below  $16,000. We have a chance to augment retirement savings and open up  more opportunities for people to save for a retirement that we all know  comes pretty quickly.                                time  1115    This has been well met in a bipartisan manner. It was marked up in  the committee. And one Member said at the Rules Committee the other  night: There is one sentence here, Mr. Chairman, over which we  disagree.   Have we gotten to this point, in this institution, where now one  sentence stops us from advancing good legislation? I certainly hope  not.   There is another provision in this legislation, as we proceed to the  Memorial Day recess, that ought to be critical in all of our minds. We  fixed an egregious error in the tax bill. We have straightened out that  issue, where families will not be taxed at the highest marginal rate of  the parents, but, instead, we will recede to a previous provision that  made sure that the survivors of those who were killed in military  conflict would receive a benefit. That was important.   Let me just say to the new Members on our side: This is a safe  provision. For years, I wore a bracelet for the refuseniks who wished  from Russia to emigrate to Israel. There is no weakness on our part in  support of the State of Israel on this side of the aisle.   You have a chance to stand up right now for retirement savings for  those who have lost loved ones in military conflict, to stand up for  Tribal interests, to stand up for those who receive scholarships, and  to continue help for those families who are in financial distress  because they lost a loved one in a military conflict.   Set aside the demagoguery, and turn down this motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of the bill, H.R. 1994, the Clerk be authorized to make  technical corrections and conforming changes.
