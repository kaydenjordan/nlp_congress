 Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. I have  information that indicates that approximately 300 amendments were  considered and that of those amendments, 161 amendments offered by  Republican members of the committee were adopted during the  consideration of S. 1679. Is that correct?    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Calendar  No. 120, H.R. 1628, be referred to the Committee on Finance for the  purpose of conducting a public hearing.    Mr. President, we Democrats are here on the floor to take  a stand against a bill that is a disaster for our Nation's healthcare-- Medicaid patients, families with loved ones in nursing homes, people  who struggle with opioid addiction, women who rely on Planned  Parenthood, and people who work in the healthcare industry. We stand  with them and for them tonight, but we also stand for the American  public, who is being left in the dark about what TrumpCare will mean  for them.   This is not the normal order of Senate business. The Republicans are  going about this in a way that is so procedurally flawed that it is an  embarrassment to democracy itself. They are hiding this bill. They are  hiding this bill because people will be outraged when they find out  what is in it.   That is why a Republican aide said that they are not releasing the  bill--because ``we aren't stupid.'' Think about what that statement  means. First, it means that they have a bill. Second, it means that  they think it is political suicide to make the bill public. So they are  bypassing the normal and necessary process that is needed to make good  legislation.   The way you make legislation is to allow the Sun to shine in, and  that starts with hearings. Every legislative body in the country--from  a school board to a county council--has hearings because we have  figured out over the centuries--for all of our flaws--that you need  hearings, not just to placate the masses but to figure out whether your  legislation is any good or not.   Republicans have not held a single hearing on TrumpCare. No one who  knows anything about healthcare is allowed to say anything about this  bill because they are not even allowed to see it, but anyone who has  ever tried to understand the American healthcare system knows that it  is complicated. The President said so himself. You need expert  testimony, public input, and time to talk to your home State. That is  the way you get a good product, but Republicans have totally bypassed  the two committees that exist in order to consider legislation like  this.   Think about it. Under normal circumstances, this legislation would be  in the Finance and HELP Committees' jurisdictions. There would be  hearings, and there would be a markup, but that is not the process that  is being used. There is no markup. There are no committee hearings. It  is just 13 dudes, and they are rushing to pass a bill without  [[Page S3578]]  women, without Democrats, and without input from the American people.  Here is the order of the people who get to see the healthcare bill: 13  men in secret, Republican lobbyists, POLITICO, Republicans, Democrats,  and, then, the American people.   This is shameful. This is a violation of the way democracy itself  should work. When they are done, the product will be the fruit from the  poisonous tree. It will not be good because the process that will have  produced it will have been so flawed.   There are many, many Americans who do not support this bill, and I am  going to highlight just three groups who stand to lose.   First, you have people who are going to pay more for insurance, lose  their insurance altogether, or lose the ability to choose their  providers. Families will not be able to afford nursing home care for  their loved ones or to pay the hospital bills for a parent after she  has had a heart attack. Americans who have preexisting conditions will  struggle to buy insurance because insurance companies will be able to  charge more for conditions like diabetes or cancer or asthma. Women  will be blocked from getting annual checkups or cancer screenings at  their local Planned Parenthood clinics. All of these people stand to  lose if the bill moves forward.   Second, you have people whose jobs may be at risk. Healthcare makes  up about one-sixth of the American economy, and it does not exist in a  vacuum. It is an industry that impacts millions of workers, and you can  bet that those jobs will be affected by this bill. One study found that  TrumpCare will take away nearly 1 million jobs by the year 2026. We are  supposed to be helping American workers, not taking away their jobs or  making it harder for them to get healthcare.   Finally, this bill hurts the working poor. These are the people who  will struggle even more under TrumpCare, and I do not know why we would  punish them. Why would we leave them with nowhere to turn? I know that  millions of Americans feel the same way that I do. They care deeply  about the poor, the vulnerable, and the sick among us, because they  have made news in standing up for their neighbors.   One woman named Jessie went to a town hall to make her voice heard on  TrumpCare, and I want to read what she said:         It is my understanding the ACA mandate requires everybody       to have insurance because the healthy people pull up the sick       people, right? And as a Christian, my whole philosophy on       life is pull up the unfortunate. So the individual mandate,       that's what it does. The healthy people pull up the sick. If       we take those people and put them in high-risk insurance       pools, they're costlier and there's less coverage for them.       That's the way it's been in the past, and that's the way it       will be again. So we are effectively punishing our sickest       people.    Look, we may not agree on policy, but I hope we can agree on the  process. So what will it take? What will it take for this process to be  restored and for TrumpCare to be considered in the way that it ought to  be considered?   The answer is actually very straightforward. We need three  Republicans. It only takes three Republicans, and you can be a person  who hates the Affordable Care Act or has mixed feelings about the  Affordable Care Act or anywhere in between. It only takes three  Republicans in the U.S. Senate to restore the U.S. Senate itself--to  restore the hearing process, to restore public confidence, and to  restore bipartisanship.   All we need are three Republican Senators to say: I will not vote for  anything if there hasn't been a public hearing. I will not vote for  anything that is being jammed down Americans' throats. I will not vote  for anything without being able to go back home and figure out how it  will impact my State's hospitals.   This is not an unreasonable task. We are just asking for three  Republicans to say: Let's be a Senate again. Let's restore order and  transparency and do things the right way because that is the only way  this bill will not be a total disaster.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to give a status report on this  bill. Right now, we think it is with the 13 men who are working on it  in secret; they will show it to Republican lobbyists, and then they  will send it over to the CBO for a score, and eventually the American  public and the Senate will be able to see the bill.   We will have a process called vote-arama, which is mostly nonsense,  and there will be lots of opportunities to offer amendments, but let's  be clear about what happens at the end of vote-arama. The leader will  offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. So what does that  mean? That means all of the amendments that were adopted along the way  get taken out, with one 51-vote margin, and all of that vote-arama was  for show because Mitch McConnell will put his bill on the floor that  was negotiated in secret with those 13 people.   If there was any question that our democracy is being rolled over by  Senate Republicans, I want you to think about these 13 men. They are  drafting a bill without any input from women, from Democrats, from  experts, and by working in secret they are cutting out about 250  million people who are from the 40 States who aren't represented among  those 13 men. You can bet that those 40 States have unique healthcare  needs and unique healthcare laws. And without the right language, the  bill could throw healthcare in each of those States or any of those  States into total chaos.   They have also cut out Senators on the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, even though these  committees are actually constructed for the purpose of working on  legislation like this. They know how to get things done like this.  There are members of the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee who  are among the experts on this issue, yet they don't get a chance to  even see the bill. These Senators have jurisdiction over this  legislation, but they are being left out. This is just not the way it  is supposed to work.   We need transparency. We need bipartisanship. But now the Republicans  will try to tell us that the hearings are bypassed all the time. That  is not true. In fact, this body will hold a hearing on almost anything.  In 2017 alone, the Senate has had hearings on hot tub safety, self- driving cars, a treaty for outer space, multimodal shipping, the  maritime administration, and dozens of other issues. Look, those are  actually not to be trivialized. It is important for the Senate to have  hearings. It is important for subcommittees to do their work. But  nobody can tell me that hot tub safety, self-driving cars, a treaty for  outer space, multimodal shipping, and the maritime administration are  more important than one-sixth of the American economy. It is a joke.   We are talking about one-sixth of the American economy, about  millions of jobs, and about people with life-threatening diseases and  life-changing medical bills, so we know how important hearings are to  do legislation. When the Senate took up the ACA, there were almost 100  hearings. Think about that: 100 hearings versus 0. There were  roundtables and walk-throughs held by the two committees. We considered  hundreds of amendments and accepted  [[Page S3599]]  more than 150 amendments from Republicans. But, for this bill, no  markup, no transparency, no bipartisanship--just 13 men meeting in  secret outside of the regular process.   The only thing that has changed is now the market is under siege, but  the market is under siege because of the Republican administration.  They are purposefully creating uncertainty. That is not a rhetorical  flourish; they are saying they are doing that. President Trump actually  said he wanted to create uncertainty in the healthcare market in order  to create leverage with Democrats.   Think about how unusual that is. Think about how offensive that is.  It is perfectly appropriate for one party to try to generate leverage  in a negotiation against the other. That is part of politics, either in  an election context or in the public policy context. But the way that  this President and Tom Price are trying to generate leverage is by  raising healthcare premiums in order to force Democrats to buckle. That  is unheard of. It really is unheard of. And it hurts everybody across  the country to create this uncertainty.   It is bad enough that the Republicans are trying to take healthcare  away from 23 million people--from nursing home patients and their  families, from women who are pregnant or fighting breast cancer, from  sons and daughters and moms and dads who struggle with opioids. But to  add insult to injury, they are going to jam it down your throat. You  don't get to read what it is about before it passes or hear from  doctors or nurses or experts about how it will affect you.   So why are they working on this bill in secret? The answer is very  simple. The bill stinks. They are ashamed of it. The bill itself is an  embarrassment. The process is an embarrassment. They have said so  themselves. No matter how you look at this, this bill is a disaster for  people and their families. It will be a disaster for anyone who relies  on Medicaid, which will be cut by at least $800 billion, and Medicaid  is a safety net for people who need care but can't afford it.   Look at nursing home care. Medicaid covers three out of every four  long-stay nursing home residents. My wife's grandmother was in a  nursing home and just passed away, had great care, and wouldn't have  been able to get the care she needed were it not for Medicaid. This is  not an uncommon story--millions of Americans across the country of all  income levels. People think of Medicaid as for people who are not  financially in a position to get care in any given moment. That is  true. It does take care of the poor. But it also takes care of nursing  home care for people who worked all their lives and just don't have  enough. It is $9,000 a month in the State of Hawaii for nursing home  care. It is more than that for hospice care. We all know that nobody  escapes end-of-life care. Rich or poor, left or right, red, blue,  purple, nobody escapes this part of your life, and everybody needs  help. There might be a few people who save up enough cash money to be  able to shell out $10,000 a month for that kind of care, but for the  rest of us, Medicaid is that lifeline.   There are actually some Republicans who don't want to cut Medicaid.  They have seen how the program improves people's lives. Arkansas and  Kentucky, for example, expanded Medicaid. These States have seen big  jumps in the number of the people who now have their own doctor or have  gotten a checkup in the past year, people who are now more likely to  say they are in excellent health. But under TrumpCare, we will be back  to the bad old days.   This bill is also a disaster for older people, who will be hit with  what the AARP is calling an age tax. This will get a little wonky--not  as wonky as that referred to by my colleague who spoke about 5 minutes  ago but a little wonky. Right now, companies are not allowed to charge  any more than three times as much for an older person as a younger  person. Three times is the cap. But TrumpCare will increase that rate  to five times. So what happens is every year, as you get older, your  insurance costs will go up and up and up. That is why they call it an  age tax. In other words, many seniors will see premium increases that  can cost them thousands of dollars more each year at a time when people  are already struggling to find money to pay for healthcare.   This is also a disaster for patients who don't want to lose their  healthcare provider. Right now, an estimated one in five women goes to  Planned Parenthood clinics. I understand we have different views about  reproductive choice. I understand that. But we also understand--when we  are talking on the level about Planned Parenthood and when we are  talking about Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, everybody who  pays any bit of attention to this understands what Planned Parenthood  does for women across the country--again, conservative women,  progressive women; Planned Parenthood doesn't care. Planned Parenthood  is not using Federal funding for abortion. We all know that by now. It  is cancer screenings, and it is quality healthcare and birth control.   People talk about giving more choices for healthcare and saving  taxpayers' money, but the CBO estimates that defunding Planned  Parenthood will take away options for nearly 400,000 women across the  country and will cost taxpayers more than $130 million.   It is also a disaster for those struggling with opioid addiction.  This bill will take away treatment for mental health and addiction,  leaving hundreds of thousands of people fighting opioid addiction  without adequate health insurance. We saw the statistics that opioid  addiction, I believe, is killing more people annually than HIV/AIDS  killed at its apex. I believe it has either surpassed or is comparable,  in terms of cause of death, with car accidents. This is one of the  leading killers in the country, and Medicaid is the program that funds  opioid addiction for most of the people who get help.   This bill is also a disaster for patients with preexisting conditions  because it means we will be going back to the dark days when insurance  companies could charge you more for having a preexisting condition.   I have heard from people back home in Hawaii who are terrified of  what this could mean for their health. One woman wrote that she is in  the middle of a fight for her life against breast cancer, and she is  scared that under TrumpCare, she will lose her insurance, that she will  have to stop her treatments and could lose her life. A husband wrote to  me that his wife has stage IV breast cancer. She has had every possible  treatment and surgery imaginable to extend her life, but without the  guarantee of affordable coverage for all, her fight will quickly come  to an end. She is 29.   Even people without serious medical conditions will be affected by  this preexisting condition's nonsense. We know that because before the  Affordable Care Act became law, insurance companies were able to  discriminate based on what they determined to be a preexisting  condition.   One woman in Hawaii told me that in the days before the Affordable  Care Act, she was rejected by insurance companies because she had back  pain at one point in her life. The pain never came back, and she never  needed treatment again. She was young and healthy, but the insurance  company wouldn't give her insurance.   We cannot accept the end of nationwide protections for people with  preexisting conditions. We cannot accept high premiums or so-called  high-risk pools that have historically failed in giving people the  coverage they need and deserve. We don't have to do it this way.   We don't have the majority, and this is being done under a process  called reconciliation, which means that you don't need a filibuster- proof majority; you just need 51 votes. So if you are proud of your  bill--we have Senator Hatch, chairman of the Finance Committee and one  of the most respected Republicans in the country, actually. We have  Senator Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee. Both have a long history of being able to do  deals--Orrin Hatch with Teddy Kennedy and my predecessor, Dan Inouye;  Lamar Alexander with just about everybody--Chuck Schumer, Patty Murray.  These are conservative Members of the Senate. There is no doubt about  their Republican credentials. But they are also people who are capable  of crafting legislation in the right way. I have no doubt they like  their gavels. I have no doubt they like chairing hearings. I have no  doubt they have the personal, intellectual, emotional, and political  [[Page S3600]]  stamina to go through a process which may take more than a couple of  days.   I will tell you, this is the world's greatest deliberative body--it  is--and these are a bunch of impressive people I serve with in the  Senate. But without a hearing, you get a garbage product. You get a  bill that just stinks, that staffers say they are keeping secret  because ``we're not stupid.'' They are so embarrassed at this product  that they are keeping it secret, because they know the moment this  thing gets posted, everybody from everybody's home State--and not just  Democratic States and not just purple States, but every home State is  going to say: My community health center is going to get shut down. My  opioid treatment center is going to get shut down. My hospital may no  longer exist.   They know this bill stinks.   There is a simple solution. All we need is three Republicans to say:  Let the Senate be the Senate. The House did whatever the House was  going to do.   There was a weird White House Rose Garden signing ceremony without a  bill even being enacted. It was the most bizarre thing I have ever  seen, where everybody was congratulating each other for inflicting pain  on the American people.   But the Senate has to be the Senate here, and what that means is that  we have to be that cooling saucer. We have to actually slow down and  have a deliberative process. All we need is three Members of the Senate  on the Republican side to say a very simple thing. They can be as  critical of ObamaCare as they want, they can be as partisan against us  as they want, but all they have to say is this: I am not voting for a  bill that doesn't get a hearing. I am not voting for a bill that  doesn't get a hearing. Let this thing see the light of day.   I yield the floor.
