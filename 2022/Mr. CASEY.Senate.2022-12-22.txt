 Mr. President, this bill is about protecting pregnant  workers. We shouldn't be treating pregnant workers who happen to be  State and local government employees differently than we treat private  sector employees or differently than we treat Federal workers.   What this bill does is give pregnant State and local workers the same  protections. So if a woman is pregnant in the workforce and she needs  accommodations that are reasonable, as the bill provides, we should  provide them, whether she works in State or local government or whether  she works in the Federal Government or private sector.   The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on a bipartisan  basis, considered this amendment and rejected it and voted the bill  itself--the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act--out of committee 19 to 2. I  would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6569    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to amendment  No. 6569.   The yeas and nays are ordered.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant executive clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, I want to start by saying something very  simple about what we are about to vote on. This bill is about two  words: reasonable accommodations. It is as simple as that. More than 30  years ago, we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act,  [[Page S10071]]  which said something very simple as well. It said that a worker with a  disability in the workplace should have reasonable accommodations, not  any accommodation--reasonable accommodations.   Thirty years of case law, thirty years of testing that principle have  shown us that pregnant workers should have the same protections,  reasonable accommodations, so that if a woman is pregnant in the  workforce, she can do her job and have a healthy and safe pregnancy.  That is all this bill is about.   The organizations supporting it are across the board. Every  organization you can think of is supporting this bill. I urge a ``yes''  vote, similar to the House vote on this, which was 315 to 101, more  than three quarters of the House.   I turn now to my colleague Senator Cassidy.    Mr. President, I wish to expand upon the remarks I  delivered earlier today on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which  this body voted to include in the omnibus spending package. I first  introduced this bill in 2012 with Senator Shaheen. Senator Cassidy  joined us this Congress, and the bill now has broad, bipartisan  support.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a very straightforward piece of  legislation; it closes a loophole in the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination  Act to allow pregnant workers to request reasonable accommodations so  that they can continue working safely during pregnancy and upon  returning to work after childbirth. This is a commonsense bill that has  broad, bipartisan support--everyone from the ACLU to the U.S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops to the Chamber of Commerce.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is very simple. Pregnant workers  should be able to request reasonable accommodations--a stool, a water  bottle, a bathroom break--when such an accommodation would help them  remain at work safely during their pregnancy and so they can return to  work after childbirth. Other accommodations that a pregnant worker  might request include, but are not limited to, light duty, temporary  transfer, additional or more flexible breaks, changing food or drink  policies, time off to recover from childbirth, accommodations for  lactation needs, and flexible scheduling.   The bill is intended to help women like Peggy Young, a UPS driver who  requested light duty while she was pregnant. Peggy was denied her  request, even though other workers had received light duty, because  there is no requirement under the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act to  provide reasonable accommodations. She was forced onto unpaid leave and  eventually took her case all the way to the Supreme Court. She won, but  the ruling did not provide full protections to the millions of workers  who get pregnant each year. That is why we need the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act, so that every pregnant worker will be able to request an  accommodation without fear of being fired or forced on leave, when all  she needs is a stool or a bathroom break.   Young did not solve this issue, and the standard is still unworkable  for employers and pregnant workers. After Young, over two-thirds of  women still lost their Pregnancy Discrimination Act pregnancy  accommodation claims in court, mostly because they were unable to find  a suitable comparator under the Young comparator framework. Pregnant  workers need immediate relief to remain healthy and on the job.  Pregnant workers should not have to muster evidence and identify  someone else at work to get their own medically necessary  accommodation, as basic as a stool or extra restroom breaks. Pregnant  workers, especially in low-wage industries, usually do not have access  to their coworkers' personnel files and do not know how all their  coworkers are being treated.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would create a clear, explicit  right to accommodations, allowing pregnant workers to remain healthy  and attached to the workforce. It is a solution that provides clarity  to both employers and employees. That is why the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce and other business groups support the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act sets up a simple framework that is  easily understood and utilized by both employers and employees. Under  the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a pregnant employee may request  reasonable accommodations from their employer, the same process that  individuals with disabilities use under the Americans with Disabilities  Act. Employers are familiar with it, the interactive process is easier  for both the worker and the employer.  [[Page S10082]]    Workers will be able to secure the accommodations they need in a  timely manner, while employers will avoid costly litigation over  allegations of discrimination. A significant advantage of using this  same framework is that employers are already familiar with it--and have  over 30 years' experience providing reasonable accommodations to people  with disabilities already.   Over the years, I and my colleagues--along with supporters of the  legislation--have worked carefully to ensure that the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act will both protect pregnant workers from discrimination and  provide actionable, realistic parameters and guidance for employers.  That is why, as I mentioned previously, the bill has the support of  over 200 advocacy groups from all parts of the ideological spectrum.   Now, some have claimed that the Americans with Disabilities Act-- ADA--already gives pregnant workers who truly need accommodations a  right to accommodations. That is simply not true. It is not what we are  seeing on the ground or what courts are deciding in their rulings.   First, the ADA does not protect pregnant workers who need  accommodations to prevent complications from arising in the first  place, such as extra restroom breaks to prevent a urinary tract  infection or temporary light duty to prevent a miscarriage, which  doctors sometimes advise.   Second, many courts have held that the ADA does not protect even  those pregnant workers with serious pregnancy complications like a  high-risk pregnancy, bleeding, or severe nausea. That has remained the  case even after Congress expanded the ADA in 2008. Clearly, the ADA,  while a vitally important law, is not adequate to keep pregnant workers  healthy and on the job.   It is time to step up and protect pregnant workers who just need a  little help--a water bottle, a stool, light duty--in order to keep  working safely. This is the right thing to do. The Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act is a reasonable and responsible bill that will help  workers continue working safely during pregnancy and after childbirth.  With broad support and a framework that is already familiar to  employers, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a commonsense,  bipartisan bill that should be enacted without delay.   In closing, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Senator Cassidy,  who has been a true partner on this bill, along with our staffs;  Senator Shaheen, for cosponsoring with me all these years; Senator  Murray and Senator Burr for their work to shepherd the bill through the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and the majority  leader, Senator Schumer, for helping us to see this bill through the  U.S. Senate.                            ____________________
