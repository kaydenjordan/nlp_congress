 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my good friend, for the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oklahoma made such a compelling  argument for this rule--I can't believe I am saying this--I am going to  vote for this martial law rule.   It is a shame that we are at this point, rushing to meet deadlines  that have been staring us in the face for weeks and hurrying to finish  up important legislative business in the waning days of this Congress.  But we are where we are, and we need to be responsible.   When it comes to something like funding the government, it is  appropriate to use all the tools in our toolbox to keep the lights on.  So, while I think rules granting same-day authority should be avoided  whenever possible, times like this are why they exist.   There is also suspension authority in this rule that would allow this  House an opportunity to take up criminal justice reform, a bipartisan  first step that our Republican President has already promised to sign.   With so much work in front of us today, I am not going to waste time  on process. I won't belabor the President for his words and tweets,  which made completing our business tougher than it needed to be. And I  will even spare my friends in the majority further conversation about  how I wish we weren't, once again, standing on the brink of another  shutdown. Consider it my gift to them for this holiday.   This House needs to move quickly and responsibly. Everyone  understands that, so I will simply say that I will be voting for this  rule. I urge my colleagues to do the same, so we can finish our  business and prevent another government shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I have nothing else to say, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Let me begin, Mr. Speaker, by again thanking my colleague from  Oklahoma for the work that he and other appropriators did to try to  keep the government running. We are here right now not because of the  appropriators. We are here right now because Donald Trump has made a  mess of things.   Mr. Speaker, it is surreal that we are here today, days before the  end of a Congress, hours before one-quarter of the Federal Government  runs out of money, scrambling to keep the lights on at the brink of the  third Republican government shutdown this year, because we are not  dealing with divided government. Republicans today control not only  this Chamber, but also the Senate and the White House. They have been  fighting among themselves for weeks over whether and how to keep the  Government of the United States open for business. It would be comical  if it weren't so serious.    This proposal that we are being given right now is not a solution. It  is a political temper tantrum all to please one man: the person sitting  at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It doesn't solve the disagreements in this  Chamber or the Senate, and it doesn't prevent the shutdown America is  facing.   This President and this majority ran on fear during the last  election: fear of immigrants, fear of those seeking asylum, and fear of  anyone who doesn't look exactly like them.   What happened, Mr. Speaker? They were resoundingly rejected. The  American people chose a different course. They don't want a government  that reacts only to the wants of the President's ever-shrinking base,  the small segment of society that actually supports his offensive  border wall.   Let me remind my colleagues, according to polling, Americans, by a 2- to-1 margin, want the President to compromise on the wall to avoid a  shutdown. This proposal is exactly what the President may want, but it  is precisely what the American people rejected.   The Senate passed a bipartisan continuing resolution to keep the  lights on. This House was prepared to pass it until the President's  latest outburst. Governing by tweet isn't governing at all. If the  President's most senior advisers are Fox & Friends and Rush Limbaugh,  maybe we shouldn't be surprised when we find ourselves here today.   But this morning, this House came together to pass same-day authority  so the majority could move quickly on a bipartisan, short-term  continuing resolution. Democrats joined our Republican colleagues in  this effort to provide the tools needed to keep the lights on. This is  how you are using them?   This isn't a serious plan. To even vote for disaster relief, this  bill requires you to support the President's offensive wall. Democrats  and the American people have already rejected this false choice.   This wall is a medieval solution to a 21st century problem. What is  next, Mr. Speaker, money for a moat around Mar-a-Lago?   This will not become law, what we are doing right now. This is a  waste of time. If it even passes here--which is a big if--it is dead on  arrival in the Senate. I say to my friend: The clock is ticking. Let's  get to work on a clean bill that can make it to the President. This  isn't that. This is just offensive.   Again, let me remind those in this Chamber the Senate, in a  bipartisan way, came together by a voice vote and supported a  continuing resolution, a clean CR, to keep the government running for 7  weeks. That is it. It is all we are proposing here today. This Chamber  can't even do that. This is a disgrace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if I could just respond to my colleague, if I thought  for one second building a stupid wall would somehow secure our borders,  I would be for it. But every expert I have talked to, including people  on the border, say they need more personnel and say we ought to invest  more in electronic equipment to surveil our borders. I don't know of a  wall that has ever been built that people haven't climbed over or dug  under. This is ridiculous.   By the way, when the President campaigned, he said that he wanted to  build a wall and that Mexico was going to pay for it. Now he wants to  build a wall that by all accounts is going to be useless in terms of  protecting our borders, and he wants the American taxpayers to pay for  it.   Well, you have $5 billion. How about rebuilding our roads and our  bridges that are crumbling in this country?   If you have got $5 billion that you don't care what you do with, how  about investing it in affordable housing?   Or how about dealing with the issue of climate change?   Or how about making sure that some of the 40 million-plus Americans  in this country who don't have enough to eat have food?   Wasting money on something so ridiculous is offensive.   So we want border security. We are happy to work with you on enhanced  border security, but this isn't it. This is a campaign slogan. This is  a waste of taxpayer money. It is ridiculous. It is embarrassing. For  the President to want to shut down the government over this is  disgraceful.   By the way, on the disaster package, just so my colleagues understand  this, the disaster package in this bill does not include $600 million  in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico. So unless this Congress takes  immediate action, 1.4 million of our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico  stand to suffer deep cuts in food assistance, causing many of them to  go hungry. That is shameful. Where is the help for them?                                time  1700    Of course, we should pass a clean CR to ensure that our government  remains open. But my friend talked about disaster assistance, and I  just wanted to point out that one thing that is missing in their  disaster package is the nutrition money for our fellow citizens of  Puerto Rico. I am sure there are others.   We are rushing this thing through. There is no transparency here. We  thought we had a deal to keep the government open for 7 weeks. Then,  all of a sudden, I guess the President tuned into ``Fox and Friends''  and changed his mind. You don't know where this President is going to  be day-to-day or hour-to-hour or minute-to-minute. But he is the guy  who said that he would be proud to own a shutdown.   Well, I think it would be a disaster for this country to have another  shutdown. I think it would be expensive. I think we should to do  everything we can to avoid it, and that is why we ought to send a clean  CR back to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I don't really want to prolong this debate much longer here. Every  day with this administration is another self-made crisis, another  demonstration of bad faith.   No one can trust what comes out of the White House, what the  President says. His word is worthless. And here we are, as evidence of  that fact.   Mr. Speaker, the government is set to run out of money tomorrow. We  are running out of time to act. But, apparently, this is exactly what  President Trump wants.   Last week, he said he would be ``proud to shut down the government.''  Today, he confirmed he wouldn't even sign a clean CR to keep our  government open for just a few more weeks.   It is irresponsible and abhorrent to attach funding for his offensive  border wall to a bill to keep the lights on.  [[Page H10480]]  That is why, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up the Senate amendment to H.R. 695,  which is the clean CR that has already passed the Senate by a voice  vote. Every Democrat and every Republican stood together and passed the  CR. It wasn't controversial over there. Somehow, it is controversial  here.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just respond to the gentleman that we are all for  compromise. This 7-week CR is a compromise. The clean CR is a  compromise. In a bipartisan way, unanimously in the United States  Senate, they accepted it. The President said he was for it. Then he  changed his mind after watching ``Fox and Friends'' or listening to  some right-wing radio host.   The gentleman talks about protecting the border. We want to protect  the border. We want to invest money in things that will actually  protect the border, not in a press release, not in a sound bite, not in  something that is a total waste of money, like a wall.   But what about the fact that the President is going to shut the  government down over a stupid wall and that means that the men and  women who work for the Department of Homeland Security, the people who  protect our borders, will not get paid, and we are not going to support  them?   One of my Republican colleagues, when he was faced with that  question, said: ``It's actually part of what you do when you sign up  for any public service position.''   Really? That is how we treat and respect the men and women who are  charged with protecting our borders? We turn our backs on them during  the holiday season? Merry Christmas. We are not going to pay you.   What they need, if you go to the border and talk to them, are more  personnel. They want us to invest in more electronic equipment to help  them surveil the border. They will tell you that this idea of a wall is  dumb. It doesn't work. It is not going to protect this country. It is a  waste of money.   We had a deal to move this CR forward, and the President changed his  mind. He reneged on his word. He didn't keep his promise. And here we  are.   So, as Republicans fight with Republicans here in the House,  thankfully, the Senate, in a bipartisan way, came up with a solution.  There was a compromise. Democrats are willing to support that  compromise. But, somehow, it is not enough.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I just need to correct the Record on a few  things here.   It was the President who said he would be proud to shut the  government down. My colleague may recall not too long ago the President  had a meeting with Speaker-designate Pelosi and Leader Schumer over in  the Senate. He bragged about it on camera.   The President invited the cameras in, and he said: I would be proud  to own a shutdown. That is what he said.   So we know where the President stands on this. He doesn't care about  shutting the government down. We should.   The gentleman said that votes on rules are always partisan. Well, for  the most part they are, but not this morning--not this morning.   My Republican friends brought a martial law rule to the floor, which  we don't really like because it basically condenses the process and we  don't have a lot of time to look at things. But nonetheless, we said we  would vote for it.   Almost every Democrat voted with Republicans to move this so-called  martial law rule forward so that we could bring up the Senate-passed  continuing resolution today and keep the government running and be able  to pay the men and women who protect our borders. So we came in good  faith, and we did that.   We want border security. We just think wasting billions of dollars on  a stupid wall that doesn't do anything to protect our country is the  wrong way to go.   So if you want to vote to keep the government open, then you should  vote with us to defeat the previous question because, if we defeat the  previous question, then I will bring up the Senate-passed continuing  resolution, and we can all vote for it. We can all keep the government  running. We can all go home and have a merry Christmas and a happy new  year. That is how simple it is.   My Republican friends are bringing a rule to the floor that says  that, if you vote for this rule, there is no separate vote on the  border wall. It is all together.   They know what is going to happen. If it passes the House, it will go  over to the Senate, and they are not going to accept this. They have  already had a bipartisan compromise. They had a deal with the President  until he changed his mind.   So if you want to keep the government open, then vote with the  Democrats on defeating the previous question, and we will bring up a  clean CR and we will do the right thing. We will do what we thought we  were going to be doing this morning until the Republicans got into a  fight with one another, and here we are.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman how many more speakers he  has.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking at a headline here today. It says: ``U.S.  stocks clobbered, with Dow losing nearly 500 points, amid White House  drama over government shutdown.''   Mr. Speaker, creating chaos in the stock market is how a drama queen  might act, but it is not how any President should behave. This is  totally manufactured by the White House crisis. This is ridiculous that  we are at this point, after all the agreements that have been reached  in the Senate and, we thought, here in the House.   The President turned the TV set on and started watching FOX News and  got carried away and now is reneging on his agreement. That is  unfortunate.   But I would again say to my colleagues: Let us defeat the previous  question, and we will bring up a clean CR. We will keep this government  open, and we will do the right thing by the American people. And most  importantly, we will make sure that the men and women who are  protecting our border get paid during this Christmas holiday. It is the  right thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
