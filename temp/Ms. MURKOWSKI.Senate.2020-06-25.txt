 Mr. President, in the short history of Alaska as a  State in our Union, there have been a handful of people--Bill Egan,  Elizabeth Peratrovich, Jay Hammond, Wally Hickel, Ted Stevens--whose  lives formed the fibers that wove Alaskans together. Another of those  leaders passed recently.   Byron Mallott stands among the best of us. Born in the small town of  Yakutat, AL, to the Kwaash Ke Kwaan clan of the Tlingit, in 1943 when  Alaska was still a territory, he went on to an amazing life and career.  His father was the long-time mayor of Yakutat, and when he died  unexpectedly, Byron returned home from college, campaigned to take over  the job, and won the election in 1965 at the age of 22. He then went on  to serve the State's first Governor, Bill Egan, as the commissioner of  the Department of Community and Regional Affairs. When Egan lost his  reelection campaign, Byron went back home to Yakutat and served on the  city council. In 1968, he ran for a seat in the State house, losing by  only 23 votes. In 1969, U.S. Senator Mike Gravel hired Byron to work on  his staff in Washington, DC, where he had a hand in drafting the Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act, the foundational legislation that  continues to define our State and the relationship with Alaska Natives.   After ANCSA was signed into law, Byron spent 20 years working for  Sealaska Corporation, 1 of 12 Native corporations which was created by  the law. Sealaska is based in Juneau, and its shareholders are  primarily Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. Over the course of his tenure  with Sealaska, Byron was a director, chairman, and then spent a decade  as president and CEO of the corporation. He helped fulfill the vision  of ANCSA by supporting not just the economic vitality of the Native  people in the region, but a cultural renaissance as well.   His additional business experience was extensive. Byron was a  director of several commercial banking institutions, including 6 years  on the Seattle Branch Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco, multiple years as a director of the Alaska Air Group,  and on the board of the National Alliance for Business. He also served  as president of the Alaska Federation of Native, a brief stint as the  mayor of the city and borough of Juneau, and executive director of the  Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation.   But Byron was far more than a summation of his resume, impressive  though it was. He was a good man and a good friend. When I made the  decision to run as a write-in candidate in 2010, I called to ask him to  be the cochair of that campaign. His response was instant, ``Yes,  absolutely.'' When I said I was making the announcement in an hour, he  said, ``I'll be there.'' There was no hesitation, no concern that he  was a lifelong Democrat, supporting a long-shot Republican candidate.  He exemplified in the best way Ted Stevens' philosophy: To hell with  politics, do what is right for Alaska. With Byron's help, I was able to  make history by winning the second write-in campaign for U.S. Senate in  the country's history. I don't know if I would have been successful  without him.   In 2014, Byron made history himself when he won the Democratic  nomination for Governor of Alaska, then sacrificed his own ambition by  joining with the Independent candidate for Governor to create a Unity  Ticket. Byron agreed to serve as the candidate for Lieutenant Governor,  with Bill Walker leading the ticket. Again, we did what he felt was  right for Alaska, rather than his person political gain.   The Unity Ticket won the 2014 election, but faced some serious  challenges, with low oil prices and a tough deficit situation. The  fiscal crisis unfortunately dominated the 4 years of the Walker-Mallott  administration and created rough political seas for them to weather,  necessitating some hard decisions. Through it all, Byron continued to  do what he had always done, work for Alaska and Alaskans. In the end,  Byron held himself strictly accountable, which is something few people  do, especially in politics.   A friend of mine, Dr. Rosita Worl, says that the Tlingit mourn the  passing of a leader by noting, ``In our forest, a great tree has  fallen.'' That is a fitting metaphor for Byron, who stood strong for  decades, serving as both shelter and a guide for people in Alaska.  Byron was a strong and proud man, not in a boastful way, but as a true  leader whose passion allowed him to put all Alaskans first. His heart  was Alaska, and mine is stronger for having been blessed to call him my  friend. I will miss him. Alaska will miss him.                               ____________________
