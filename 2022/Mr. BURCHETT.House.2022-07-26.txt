 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Army Sergeant  First Class Garret Hanas as Tennessee's Second Congressional District's  July Veteran of the Month.   Sergeant First Class Hanas served his country for over 20 years  assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division and spent a large chunk of his  military career jumping out of airplanes, and he is probably the only  person you will ever meet who has survived a parachute failure twice.  He broke his back in the same three places both times, which left him  with lots of health complications.   He didn't let any of this kill his spirit, though. He once said:  ``God had a bigger purpose for me, and that was to take care our  veterans.'' After retiring from the Army after over 20 years of service  assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, he dedicated much of his time  to helping his fellow veterans. He got heavily involved with the  Disabled American Veterans Knoxville chapter, where he now serves as  its commander.   He was instrumental in raising funds to get a new DAV van to  transport veterans to their doctor appointments at the VA Hospital, and  he helped start a program to refurbish used scooters and wheelchairs to  give to east Tennessee veterans who need them.   It is my honor to recognize Sergeant First Class Garrett Hanas as  Tennessee's Second District's Veteran of the Month for his service to  his country, his community, and his fellow veterans.                            ____________________
