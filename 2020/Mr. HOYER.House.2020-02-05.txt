 Madam Speaker, ``I solemnly swear that in all things  appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump,  President of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial  justice according to the Constitution and laws.''   That is the oath Senators swore on January 16. It is the oath created  by Senators when they tried the first impeachment of a President in  1868. It is an oath rooted in the Revolution fought by their  grandparents to create a republic of laws, not kings. It is an oath  whose power derives from its common sense: that a juror must always be  impartial for a trial to be fair. And it is an oath made necessary by  the fact that Senators are not, as we are not, under normal  circumstances, impartial in our work.   The words chosen for this oath recognize that when our Constitution  calls Senators to try impeachment, it calls them away from their role  as partisans. When that oath is taken, Senators are supposed to step  back from the affiliation of party or political kinship with or  opposition to the President on trial. They are required, as the oath  plainly states, to ``do impartial justice according to the Constitution  and laws.''   Madam Speaker, this afternoon, Senators will be asked to vote on the  two Articles of Impeachment the House presented on abuse of power and  the obstruction of Congress. After voting to refuse to hear evidence  and call witnesses with pertinent information, nearly all Republican  Senators have already announced that they will vote against the  articles.   In doing so, many of them acknowledge that what President Trump did  was wrong and inappropriate. They accept that it was wrong for him to  withhold military aid to Ukraine until the President of that country  promised to interfere in the American elections.   The evidence of President Trump's abuse of power and attempt to  solicit foreign interference in the 2020 elections is clear enough that  Republican Senators cannot and have not denied the facts, yet they  cannot bring themselves to confront this President and are choosing  party over country.   The Senator from Alaska, in explaining her decision to vote to block  witnesses and evidence, tried to deflect responsibility from the  consequences of her actions, writing: ``I have come to the conclusion  that there will be no fair trial in the Senate.'' I agree with that.  She further said: ``It is sad for me today to admit that, as an  institution, the Congress has failed.''   Madam Speaker, the Congress has not failed. The House did its job,  whether you agree or not. In regular order, by a vote of this House, we  impeached the President of the United States based upon our oath to  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.   The House did its job and did so with the solemnity required when  undertaking the process of impeachment, which we did not seek but  accepted as our responsibility under the Constitution. We held  hearings, called witnesses, and subpoenaed documents. Many of the  witnesses and documents, of course, were withheld by the White House.   It is the Senate that will fail if Senators do not uphold their oaths  to impartial justice. It is the Senate, Madam Speaker, that will fail  if it does not hold this President accountable for using a hold on  military aid to compel an ally to interfere in our election for his own  personal gain.   History will judge poorly those who choose fear of their party over  the courage to do the right thing. Neither the Speaker nor myself, nor  the whip, Jim Clyburn, urged any member in our party to vote any way on  impeachment. There was no lobbying. There was no pressure. Our members  voted consistent with their oath of office and the conviction that that  vote was required by that oath to protect and defend the Constitution.    Americans will judge. I am often asked why the House passed Articles  of Impeachment even knowing that the odds were slim that Senate  Republicans would set aside partisanship and hear the case as impartial  jurors. It is because I know future generations will look back on this  chapter in our history and ask: Who stood up for the Constitution and  the laws? Who stood up for the values our Founders charged us to keep?  Who refused to shrink from the heavy responsibilities of their oath? I  can be proud that the House did its job, followed the law, defended our  Constitution.   We did not convict; that is not our role. Essentially, what we said  was there was probable cause that powers had been abused and certainly  cause to see that the President refused to cooperate with the  constitutional responsibilities of the House of Representatives.   I am also proud of the House managers, as all of my colleagues on the  Democratic side of the aisle are proud of our managers who made their  case. They made their case with intellect. They made their case with  evidence that had been adduced here in the House. They made their case  and appealed to Senators to hold this President accountable, as our  Founders intended.   Almost everybody has watched a trial either in person or on  television. A trial is not an opening argument and a closing argument  with nothing in between. Seventy-five percent of our people wanted to  have witnesses because that was their understanding of what a trial is,  not just argument at the beginning and argument at the end, but  evidence for jurors who have pledged to be impartial to consider. Any  judge in this country would agree that opening and closing statements  alone are not a trial.   Nevertheless, the House managers proved their case. The truth is  clear. The American people know what that truth is and know what this  President has done. And they will remember who on this day abided by  the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  [[Page H777]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, obviously, each of us had our own reaction to  the speech that was given by the President last night. He had every  right under the First Amendment to say what he believed, what he was  going to do, and what he wanted us to do.   I suggest to you that if I took this card and tore it up because I  didn't like what was on the card, I am protected by the First Amendment  in doing that. That is a form of speech. If the effort is to shut one  another up, perhaps we will go down that road.   But, clearly, most of you in this House, or at least some of you in  this House, have said an act of destroying things that the leader  alleges are property of the House--I will ask for a ruling on that, Mr.  Speaker, in just a minute--but is an act of disagreement.   It is not an assertion, per se, that what was said was wrong,  disagreed with, or anything else. It was not an outcry to the President  of the United States that ``You lie'' that clearly undermined the  decorum of this House.   Frankly, I did not see the Speaker tear that up. I have seen it on  television. It has been played, but I would suggest to you very  seriously--well, whether anyone saw it or not, that is not my argument.  My argument is, if each of us watches closely on the floor each of our  actions and we deem those actions to be disrespectful, either to the  Speaker, that is, the Speaker at the rostrum or from the microphones  behind the desk, do we bring a resolution that that was disrespectful?   Each of you who say ``yes,'' well, I will watch very closely, and we  will go back and forth, and that will not be a good precedent because  it will undermine the premise of the First Amendment that action is  speech.   Now, an action that is criminal, an action that defames, an action  that brings the House into disrepute, that is another issue. But an  action which says: ``I feel this way'' should be protected. Now, not  necessarily agreed with, maybe even subject to criticism, but  certainly, not subject to a resolution.   This resolution will not go forward, of course, because I will move  to table it if it is offered because I believe it undermines the First  Amendment and the House.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, the majority leader asserted in his comments  that the document in question was the property of the House.   Was, in fact, the document that the Speaker had to read the property  of the House?    Mr. Speaker, an additional question.   Mr. Speaker, after the President had spoken the State of the Union  and delivered that to the Congress of the United States, at the end of  that session, I moved that that document be enrolled in the House  proceedings of last evening.   Am I to understand from the ruling that that document was  specifically the document that would have been enrolled?    Yes.    That document did not exist according to the assertion of  the Republican leader. It was destroyed.    Mr. Speaker, I don't think that answered my question.   My question was: Was the document that was destroyed or torn apart,  the document that was to be enrolled by the House pursuant to my  motion?    Mr. Speaker, the resolution is not on the floor, I don't  think.    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for clarification. Obviously, the  Parliamentarian--I think we ought to clarify this issue.   If the document has been torn apart as is alleged, and as we know it  was, that document, presumably, is not the document that was enrolled  by the House pursuant to my motion last night.   I know it is not in the possession of the House. I know that for a  fact. But there is, pursuant to my motion, a document that has been  enrolled, the President's address in the State of the Union.   So I simply want to make the point to the Parliamentarian and to the  Speaker, that the document that--I have been here for a long period of  time. Numerous times, numerous times, I have had in this drawer a copy  of the President's speech that is delivered by the communication staff  of the White House.   Mr. Speaker, is that to be presumed----
