 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.    Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that this House  has seen before in different configurations, but it is known as the  Davis-Bacon amendment.   What it does, it provides that none of the funds made available by  this act may be used to implement, to administer, or enforce the  prevailing rate of wage requirements, commonly referred to as the  Davis-Bacon Act.   Mr. Chairman, I think that we know what this bill does. It was in  1931, it was established for, I will say, trade protectionism, labor  protectionism, to lock the African-American labor from Alabama out of  the construction trades in New York City that were unionized at that  time and strongly protected, and still are, actually, but the substance  of it is this.   I have a letter here that was written by Grover Norquist, the  president of Americans For Tax Reform, and in summary, it says this:  Because the Davis-Bacon Act reduces the number of jobs, increases  costs, and has a racist history, funds from the FAA Reauthorization Act  should not be used to fulfill Davis-Bacon Act requirements. Americans  For Tax Reform, therefore, strongly supports Congressman King's  amendment.   That is one version of description of this bill.   Here is another one I thought was a little bit more descriptive. This  is an article written by George Will, and it is dated June 19, 2017. He  references back to River City, and he says a quote from that, ``The  Music Man'': You really ought to give Iowa a try, provided you are  contrary.   He starts out this article this way, and the quote is from ``Iowa  Stubborn'', a song in ``The Music Man'', Mr. Chairman. It says:         Contrary does not quite capture  Steve King's astringency.       The Iowa native and conservative Congressman was born,       appropriately, in Storm Lake, Iowa, and carries turbulence       with him. He also carries experience of actual life before       politics, when he founded a construction company, which is       one reason he has long advocated an excellent idea: repeal of       the Davis-Bacon law.        King came to Congress in 2003, and has been stubbornly       submitting repeal legislation since 2005. He would not have       succeeded even if he were less of a prickly cactus and more       of a shrinking violet.        Davis-Bacon is just another piece of government that is as       indefensible as it is indestructible. And so today, when       social hygienists are cleansing the public square of names       and statues tainted by historical connections with racism,       Davis-Bacon's durability is proof that a measure's racist       pedigree will be forgiven if the measure serves a progressive       agenda.    It is time to put an end to Davis-Bacon. We can do that here today,  Mr. Chairman.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I hear these arguments constantly:  lowest common denominator, nonunion shops.   We know it is union scale, there is a confession that it is, even  though the law says that it is prevailing wage.   Exploiting workers, race to the bottom, people work hard. These are  standard lines that come out every year, but I am the one that has  lived this. We have met payroll for over 42 years, and we pay a  competitive wage. We want to hire the best people we can and pay them  the best wages that we can, and we want to have the lowest turnover  possible. And we are in pretty good shape that way after 42 years. I  think I know about this.    Davis-Bacon increases inefficiencies and it puts people in the wrong  place doing the wrong thing for the wrong incentives.   And by the way, who is hardworking? The taxpayers are hardworking.  The taxpayers are paying the bill for an extra 20 percent on every  construction project in America. In a lot of cases, we are borrowing  the money from China and putting the debt onto our children. That is  what we are faced with here, Mr. Chairman.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I appreciate the  gentleman's remarks, but I would add for the body that the Federal  minimum wage really is not relevant at all to this Davis-Bacon wage  scale debate. There is nobody working under Davis-Bacon wage scales who  is making minimum wage. And by the way, that Federal minimum wage is  becoming irrelevant as competition for wages is driving things up.   But here is another way to think about this: I have long said that if  it is a road construction, you can build 5 miles of road instead of 4  if you get rid of Davis-Bacon; five bridges instead of four if you get  rid of Davis-Bacon.   If it happens to be river construction--we lost a lock and dam on the  Mississippi going into the weekend, lock and dam No. 11. These things  cost money. There are 29 of those. We could either fix 23 of them under  Davis-Bacon, or all 29 of them without Davis-Bacon.   There are 45 major airports in America; and if we are going to  renovate those airports, we can renovate all of them, or we can  renovate 36 of them, depending on whether this amendment passes or  fails.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from Americans for Tax  Reform and an article from The Washington Post.                                       Americans for Tax Reform,                                     Washington, DC, April 26, 2018.        Dear Members of Congress: I am writing in support of       Congressman Steve King's (R-IA) amendment (#63) to the FAA       Reauthorization Act, H.R. 4. The amendment prohibits the       usage of funds from the bill to ``implement, administer, or       enforce'' the prevailing wage requirements in the Davis-Bacon       Act.        The Davis-Bacon Act is a 1931 federal law that has a       history of high costs, lost jobs and racism. It requires       contractors and subcontractors to pay the local ``prevailing       wage'' on public works projects (over $2,000) for laborers       and mechanics. The ``prevailing wage'' is usually a wage set       by unions and is typically much higher than the average wage       for the job in the area. This leads to higher government       project costs, hurting small non-unionized contractors and       costing low-skilled jobs.        In fact, the Government Accountability Office (General       Accounting Office) in 1979 urged the repeal of Davis-Bacon       for these same reasons. Further, a 2011 study by the Heritage       Foundation found that the Act added almost $11 billion to the       deficit in 2011 in unnecessary expenses, while suspending the       Act would have added 155,000 construction jobs. Finally, the       Congressional Budget Office reported in 2016 that repealing       the act would reduce discretionary outlays by $13 billion       from 2018 through 2026.        In addition to raising costs and losing jobs, the Act also       has racist origins and was passed during the Great Depression       because minority migrant workers were taking jobs meant for       white locals at lower wages.        Because the Davis-Bacon Act reduces the number of jobs,       increases costs and has a racist history, funds from the FAA       Reauthorization Act should not be used to fulfill Davis-Bacon       Act requirements. Americans for Tax Reform, therefore,       strongly supports Congressman King's amendment.            Sincerely,                                                   Grover Norquist,      President, Americans for Tax Reform.                                   ____                  [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2017]   A Racist Vestige of the Past That Progressives Are Happy To Leave in                                   Place                            (By George F. Will)         ``You really ought to give Iowa a try. Provided you are       contrary.''--``Iowa Stubborn,'' from Meredith Wilson's ``The       Music Man''        ``Contrary'' does not quite capture Steve King's       astringency. The Iowa native and conservative congressman was       born, appropriately, in Storm Lake, and carries turbulence       with him. He also carries experience of actual life before       politics, when he founded a construction company, which is       one reason he has long advocated an excellent idea--repeal of       the Davis-Bacon law.        King came to Congress in 2003 and has been stubbornly       submitting repeal legislation since 2005. He would not have       succeeded even if he were less of a prickly cactus and more       of a shrinking violet. Davis-Bacon is just another piece of       government that is as indefensible as it is indestructible.        It is too secure to require defending because it benefits a       muscular faction. Repeal would, however, reduce the cost of       new infrastructure by many billions of dollars. And today,       when social hygienists are cleansing the public square of       names and statues tainted by historical connections with       racism, Davis-Bacon's durability is proof that a measure's       racist pedigree will be forgiven if the measure serves a       progressive agenda.        Davis-Bacon was enacted in 1931 to require construction       contractors to pay ``prevailing wages'' on federal projects.       Generally, this means paying union wage scales. It was       enacted as domestic protectionism, largely to protect       organized labor from competition by African Americans who       often were excluded from union membership but who were       successfully competing for jobs by being willing to work for       lower wages.        In 1927, Rep. Robert Bacon, a Long Island Republican, was       miffed because the low bidder for a construction project in       his district--a veterans' hospital--was an Alabama contractor       who used black labor. That year, when Bacon first introduced       his legislation, he showed that he was not a narrow-gauge       bigot. He inserted into the Congressional Record the       following statement by 34 professors concerning immigration       legislation:        ``We urge the extension of the quota system to all       countries of North and South America from which we have       substantial immigration and in which the population is not       predominantly of the white race . . . Only by this method can       that large proportion of our population which is descended       from the colonists . . . have their proper racial       representation.''        By 1931, the Depression had made government construction       money especially coveted and Davis-Bacon passed with the       support of the American Federation of Labor. The       congressional debate that preceded enactment was replete with       references to ``unattached migratory workmen,'' ``itinerant       labor,'' ``cheap, imported labor,'' ``cheap bootleg labor''       and ``labor lured from distant places'' for ``competition       with white labor throughout the country.''        Hearings on Davis-Bacon brought out the drollery in Rep.       William Upshaw, a Georgia Democrat. He said he hoped his       Northern colleagues in Congress would permit a Southerner to       smile about ``your reaction to that real problem you are       confronted with in any community with a superabundance or       large aggregation of Negro labor.''        In 1931, the unemployment rate of blacks was approximately       the same as the rate for the general population. Davis-Bacon       is one reason the rate for blacks began to deviate adversely.       In 1932, generally there were about 3,500 workers building       what became Hoover Dam. Never more than 30 were black.        In 1993, with Congress stoutly opposed to taking anything       from something as powerful as organized labor, opponents of       Davis-Bacon turned to the judiciary. A lawsuit on behalf of       some minority contractors challenged the law's       constitutionality, arguing that it burdened the exercise of a       fundamental civil right--the right to earn a living. And that       it had a disparate impact on minority workers and small       minority-owned construction businesses. The suit languished       in court for almost a decade before the plaintiffs lost,       victims of excessive judicial deference to the legislature.        In 1992, to expedite cleanup after Hurricanes Andrew and       Iniki, President George H.W. Bush suspended portions of       Davis-Bacon in South Florida, coastal Louisiana and Hawaii.       Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, promptly reversed Bush's       policy.        A 2011 Heritage Foundation study estimated that Davis-Bacon       would add almost $11 billion to that year's construction       costs. That sum will be eclipsed when--if--bold talk about       making America's infrastructure great again is translated       into spending. Then we build up the national debt while       purchasing less infrastructure than the appropriated sums       should purchase.        Davis-Bacon is rent-seeking, the use of political power to       supplant the market as the allocator of opportunity and       wealth. Rent-seeking is lucrative, which is why there is so       much of it, even when its pedigree is repulsive.     Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
