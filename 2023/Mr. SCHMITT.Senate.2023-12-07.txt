 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Sue Ellen Ball  of Houston, MO, for her retirement from the Senate after 20 years of  dedicated service.   Sue Ellen is best known for her tireless advocacy for the veterans in  Missouri needing assistance to access their hard-earned benefits. She  championed their needs and put in the extra effort to offer any  assistance, dedicating her own time on evenings and weekends to the  brave soldiers who served our country, tracking down the correct  Embassy or Agency staff to fix passport or visa issues.   Sue Ellen has been dedicated to the constituents of Missouri. She  served in former Senator Roy Blunt's office from 2003 to 2015 in a  variety of roles, including constituent services representative,  constituent advocate, and as the southwest Missouri district director  from 2011 to 2015. Since then, she has specialized as a veterans  constituent advocate with my office since January. Throughout her time  in the Senate, Sue Ellen has ensured that the citizens of Missouri have  an advocate in Congress.   She is married to Ed Ball, has one son Charlie, and enjoys her two  grandchildren Logan and Eleanor. I wish Sue Ellen the best in her well- earned retirement, during which she plans on spending as much time with  her family and grandchildren as possible. She truly is an example of a  public servant, and our Nation and our government is better off because  of her tireless efforts.                            ____________________
