 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, America has never seen anything like this  before. To think that half of the people who live in the United States  are under some order to either stay home or at least avoid contact with  others is unheard of. This is an enemy--this virus--the likes of which  we have never faced.   As strong and determined as our Nation is when it comes to these  challenges, this is unique, and it calls for unique leadership. There  are a lot of critics of the U.S. Congress--for good reason--but I think  what we have demonstrated in the last several weeks since we have  addressed this coronavirus is that there is a capacity for common  sense, bipartisan work, and a timeliness that is essential.   The first two measures were passed in record time--one for $8  billion, which opened the door for more medical resources; the second,  for $100 billion, which tried to guarantee to people they would never  have to pay to be tested for coronavirus, that there would be adequate  food supplies during this calamitous time, that we would have resources  sent to the States for Medicaid reimbursement at new levels, that we  would also engage people with family leave, as necessary, so that they  could stay out of the workplace if they  [[Page S2023]]  felt badly, and that we would also have an idea that we would come  together as a nation to move unemployment insurance with dispatch. That  passed, again, in a timely way with a bipartisan vote.   And, then, we came to the third challenge--a challenge the likes of  which I have never seen in my time in Congress, and I don't imagine  anyone else has. We decided in a span of about 7 days to come up with a  package of authorizations and appropriations, which is larger than the  annual Federal budget for domestic discretionary spending in America.  In 7 days we did what usually takes 12 months or longer, but we knew we  had to because the need is that great and America was watching and  wondering if we could rise to that challenge.   There were some bumps in the road, and it is no surprise. An  undertaking of that magnitude with this kind of pressure to get the job  done quickly and properly is bound to create differences of opinion,  and it did.   There were moments of anxiety on the floor of the Senate. Those who  have followed C-SPAN have watched many speeches that reflected the  emotional levels that were reached in this Chamber, but the emotions in  this Chamber were not that different than the emotions in most homes  across America as people worry about whether this illness will touch  their families and, if so, will they be able to conquer it.   That emotion on the Senate floor led us to further negotiations in an  effort to try to make a bill presented to us on Sunday better 3 days  later.   And that brings us to this moment. History will judge, as the Senator  from Kentucky noted earlier, as to whether there is an improvement that  has been made to this bill over the last 72 hours. I will stand up and  tell you I would testify definitely--definitely. Just consider the  first priority. We have to make sure that hospitals and clinics and  healthcare providers at every level in America are prepared to rise to  this challenge. And we know this is a challenge the likes of which we  have never seen.   When the Governor of New York suggests that the hospitals of that  great State expand their capacity by 50 percent as quickly as possible  to take the incoming patients from this COVID-19 virus--and be  prepared, he said, to expand it by 100 percent--we appreciate the  magnitude of the challenge.   On the Democratic side, our leader Senator Schumer has called it a  Marshall Plan for hospitals and healthcare. I don't think that is an  exaggeration. The bill that was presented to us on Sunday envisioned  some $75 billion for that purpose, and many of us felt that was not  adequate, as large as that number may be.   Today, we will bring a bill to the floor that will increase that  allocation for healthcare from the $75 billion in the bill just 3 days  ago to $130 billion. Is it enough? Probably not, unless God spares us  from the spread of this disease even further in the United States. It  says to those who are anxiously expanding their resources, expanding  the number of beds, bringing in retired medical personnel--as the  Governor from Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, is doing--that we hear them and  are providing them the resources to go to work to fight this challenge  we face at every corner of the United States.   The second thing that we set out to do when the bill was presented on  Sunday was to expand the opportunity for unemployment insurance. Some  have criticized us on the floor and said: Don't get into structural  changes. Well, you couldn't expand unemployment insurance without  getting into a structural change because the system, which affects only  a small percentage of Americans, is not adequate in most cases to keep  a family together. If you lose your job and try to live on that  unemployment check, it is hard to do. People lose their homes over that  and their cars. They can't pay their utility bills.   So what we have done has been described as putting unemployment  benefits on steroids. The amount of money that is going to be sent to  families who were furloughed, laid off, or unemployed is dramatically  bigger than it would have been if we hadn't restructured unemployment  compensation. At the same time, the President and the White House  suggested direct cash payments. We never argued against those but said  it is just a down payment. It is just a single check. We believe  unemployment insurance is going to be a guarantee of payments in months  to come.   Since Sunday, we expanded the period of additional unemployment  compensation from 3 months to 4 months. There is a big price on that,  of course, but we think it is reasonable to give people peace of mind  that for 4 months they will be able to keep their families together as  we work our way through these medical challenges and, God willing, see  our economy back on its feet. I hope that happens. I hope it is even  sooner, but we are prepared for 4 months.    The third thing we set out to do is one that is near and dear to me  in my State and, I will bet, in most other States. We set out to  compensate the States and some localities, counties, and cities that  are spending substantial sums of money because of the COVID-19 threats  they are facing.   Let's face it. For the most part, our Governors have been on the  frontline of defense over the last several weeks when it has come to  America's healthcare. They have done exceptional things, and they have  been called on to spend money in ways they never dreamed of. For  example, unemployment benefits, which involve State payments in many  respects, have mushroomed and skyrocketed--sometimes 10 times the  number they were just last year at the same time.   My Governor and others--mayors and the leaders of county government-- have come forward and asked: Are you going to help us? We are spending  a lot of money because of this COVID-19.   This bill does it. It was not an easy task. We had to convince the  other side that it was money well spent, and I am happy to report that,  on a bipartisan basis, we reached that agreement. As it should, some  $150 million will be going to these State and local governments. Those  are things that I believe will move us down the path toward resolving  this challenge in America and doing it in the proper way--always  keeping in mind that the welfare of workers and their families is of  paramount concern.   First is the investment on the medical side to stop the onslaught.  Second is the support for families and workers across America.   There are some items that are still being debated on the floor here.  You heard it in the early statements by the majority leader, and they  relate to the benefits to be given to businesses in order to keep them  moving forward.   We all understand the aviation industry is at the heart of the  American economy--an engine to move it, in one respect, and a  reflection of its activity in another respect. That aviation industry  is flat on its back. Some 80 to 90 percent of the passenger load has  disappeared. Hundreds of thousands of employees in the airline industry  have come to us and asked for help. We are prepared to do that, and it  is part of the package that will come before us.   The administration also asked for resources to be loaned to other  businesses that need a helping hand. I am not opposed to that. Some  are, but I am not. Yet I do believe that accountability and  transparency are essential.   Since Sunday, we have dramatically changed this package so that there  will be transparency and accountability on a timely basis as decisions  are made by this administration to allocate these taxpayer funds to  help these companies. Some of us learned a bitter lesson in the past  when benefits were given to corporations, and they were misused for  stock buybacks and dividends and profiteering at a time of great  national need. We don't want to repeat that story. We want to make  certain that the taxpayer dollars being invested in these corporations  are really designed to get them back on their feet and the economy  moving forward for the benefit of everyone who lives in this country.  Accountability and transparency are essential, and I believe this new  agreement--some 3 days after the original one was proposed--is an  improvement.   Credit should be given to both sides for many of the things that I  just mentioned, because Democrats and Republicans have had to agree for  this to make the final package. Yet we believe what we will vote on  this afternoon--and I believe we will enjoy strong bipartisan support  on the floor of the Senate--will be a dramatic improvement over the  last 72 hours. I give credit to both sides. We believe some of  [[Page S2024]]  these ideas were essential, and that is why we voted as we did on the  floor. Yet to reach this agreement and bring it forward, it took both  sides.   I salute my colleagues, starting, of course, with the Democratic  leader, Senator Schumer. He has put in some hours. I can't tell you how  many times I stepped into his office, and Michelle, his assistant, told  me he was in with Secretary Mnuchin. They spent days together--going  until 12 midnight and starting fresh early in the morning--to try to  reach an agreement, which I believe we finally have done--finally.  There are just a few little items left, but I don't think they will  hold us up.   So, to Senator Schumer and his staff, to all of my colleagues, and to  the ranking members who pitched in with their committees of  jurisdiction to try to come up with good ideas and to sell them in a  bipartisan agreement, that was an exceptional amount of work.   I give special credit, too, to the staff--to my own and to those of  the others--who have come to work in this dangerous moment. We are  being told to stay home, to telework from home when you have to and  when you can. In some cases, you can't. Those who have shown up at the  Capitol, including the staff who is here today on the floor, have come  at risk, and we know that--at risk to their own health and the health  of their family members and others whom they love, as we do. So I thank  them for this.   I understand that we may be gone for several weeks, and I think that  it is appropriate. But for a national emergency that would call us  back--and we will come back if that is necessary--I think we should  take some time away from one another and away from the Capitol to  really mind to our own health and the well-being of our own families  and work back home as best we can, by teleconferencing and in other  ways, to let people know what we have done with this new legislation.   I hope that during this period of time, I can engage my colleagues in  thinking about another issue. I and Senator Portman, the Republican  from Ohio, have introduced legislation that at this moment in history  calls for at least an inquiry into remote voting or some different  approach to voting that doesn't require our physical presence on the  floor in times of national emergency. It just makes sense.   The fact is, our meetings of the Senate almost every single day have  violated the CDC guidelines that tell us not to gather in a group of 10  or more. Yet we come to the floor because we have to--because this is  life and death when it comes to this legislation we are considering-- and because we know what our jobs are. We can find a better way to do  this in the 21st century by using the technology that is available in  so many different ways in order to have verifiable, accurate, honest  voting for those who cannot or should not physically be present on the  floor.   I have spoken to Elizabeth MacDonough, the Parliamentarian of the  Senate, and her staff and want to engage in a conversation. What we  know is that this is historic, and it really is a dramatic change from  what we have done in the past, but I don't think it is unrealistic. I  think it reflects the reality of where we are today with the public  health crisis. It may reflect the reality of tomorrow, which could be  some different national emergency or, God forbid, some terrorist  activity that keeps us away from this Capitol Building when we still  have work to do.   I thank Senator Portman; Senator Klobuchar, who has really been one  of the leaders in this effort; and Senator Schatz, who I know is a  cosponsor. We are now up to close to 20 cosponsors, on a bipartisan  basis, to move forward in this change in the Senate rules. I hope we  can have conference calls during the time that we are physically away  from the Capitol and move this idea forward. The House is considering  the same thing as well.   Now is the time to do it. It is time to bring this great body--the  U.S. Senate--into the 21st century when it comes to executing our  constitutional responsibility without endangering anyone, especially  Members and their staffs and families   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to address this issue because  I think it is important that we explain where we are today and why we  reached this point.   I can recall when Senator Graham crossed the aisle a week or so ago,  perhaps, and started talking about unemployment insurance and his goals  for unemployment insurance. It sounded consistent with the language and  conversation I heard on our own side of the aisle, our own caucus, to  use the unemployment insurance system as a way to make sure that people  were able to really weather the storm when it came to the public health  crisis we face.   The number of people who are filing for unemployment has gone up  dramatically. There were 2 million new unemployment claims filed last  week, compared to 218,000 nationwide in previous weeks. So we know that  the number of people who have lost their jobs--laid off, furloughed,  fired--is growing in a fashion we have never seen before. I have seen  it reported in my State. I am sure each of you have seen the same.   But let's get down to the bottom line. I ask my colleagues just to  bear with me for a minute. What you were describing is what we  initially set out to do. And then we met with the representatives of  the U.S. Department of Labor. I was on one of the task forces for the  Senate Finance Committee, and I sat there as a representative from the  U.S. Department of Labor came in and said: Senators, you don't  understand 50 different States' computer systems when it comes to  unemployment benefits. We can tell you point-blank that only 6 or 8  States out of the 50 could possibly do what you want to achieve.   They tell us it will take them months to reprogram their computers to  make the simple calculation--what appears to be a simple calculation-- that says that you never get paid more in unemployment than you were  making on the job. That was the reality. We didn't make that up. This  wasn't a Democratic, dreamed-up idea. This was the Trump  administration's Department of Labor telling us that when they looked  at the State departments of labor, they couldn't achieve what you want  to achieve with your amendment.   In other words, if you go forward and you are successful--I don't  believe you will be--but if you were successful, what we would end up  with is, frankly, a deadlock: no increases in unemployment insurance  benefits.   Now, let me tell you, beyond this administrative problem, which was  not our creation--it was identified by the Trump administration--there  are two or three things I want to say as a bottom line.   First, we are determined to make sure that the workers come out at  least whole, if not better, through this terrible experience they are  going through. Now, this notion that the workers would come out better  is not unique to the Democratic side of the aisle. The cash payment  proposed by the Trump administration--$1,200 per adult, $500 per  child--for some, will be a benefit, may even be a small but important  windfall that comes their way. So be it. That working families across  America would end up with this cash payment from the Trump  administration--I don't object to it at all.   But the Democrats have said that is one and done. That is an airdrop  of cash to people. What about the next week and the next month? That is  why we brought up the unemployment insurance. Now, the $600 figure we  came up with was an attempt to make sure that everyone is whole at the  end of the day. I will concede your point that some workers--some--may  end up coming out ahead because of this calculation of $600 a week.  They may come out ahead. I am not going to stand here and say that I  feel bad about that. I don't feel bad about that at all. When less than  half of the people in America have $400 in their savings, the notion  that we might end up giving people another $1,000 or $2,000 at the end  of 4 months, to me, is not something we ought to be ashamed of or run  away from. That is a real possibility, and it may happen   I will support that just as I supported the Trump administration's  cash payment to that same family. They are going through some tough  times, and they have for a long, long time. How many of us have given  speeches on this floor about income inequality in America, and some of  the hardest working people are still unable to make it, paycheck to  paycheck, week to week?   So let's give them a helping hand and not apologize for it for a  minute. We are standing with these workers and their families, and I  think you want to as well. But the way you want to calculate it, we are  told, cannot be done. It cannot be done in a fashion that brings relief  to these families when they need it right now.    I will in just a minute. I am happy to yield as soon as I  finish.   I want to make this point as clearly as I can. I believe that this is  not a windfall. Let's assume that instead of $600 a week, your  calculation makes it $450 a week. So $150 times 16 weeks--that is 4  months. How much is that going to come out to? $2,400? Is that going to  mean that someone now becomes lazy and won't go back to work? I don't  think so. I think a lot of people will use that money and need that  money and are given a helping hand and will put it right back in the  economy. That is what this is about--that these families can keep their  homes, pay their utility bills, put food on the table, and put the  money back into the economy. That is part of what we are trying to  achieve here.   If we err on the side of giving a hard-working family an extra $1,000  or $2,000 because of our approach, so be it. No apologies. We didn't  design this system. We were told we had to work within the design of  the system. We tried to do it. We think the $600 a week is a reasonable  way to do it, and I will yield for a question.    I don't disagree with my friend from South Carolina at  all. I agree with you completely. We are in the midst of a national  emergency.    That is not my announcement. That is the announcement of  President Trump. I believe it. When you look at all the people now  filing for unemployment, when you look at the hardships they are  facing, the lifestyles they have had to live to try to comply with  shelter-in-place and all the rules that are going on out there, the  number of people filing these unemployment insurance claims, they tell  us the reality of the situation.   The notion, as you said, $9,600 times three--three times 4 months  basically comes out to about $30,000 a year, roughly. That is what the  $600 is calculated to mean on an annual basis.   So, on a 4-month basis, if we end up giving people an extra $1,000 or  $2,000, it is not inconsistent with what the Trump administration says  they want to do with their cash payment. In the meantime, if we are  going to move forward--and I hope this crisis comes to an end quickly-- if we are going to move forward into a new phase--phase 4, phase 5,  whatever it is--let's work together to try to upgrade these systems, to  make them work the way we want them to work.   But in the meantime, wouldn't we want to err on the side of standing  with working families and their employees? Wouldn't we want to do that  in this first effort? I think it is the reasonable and thoughtful way  to do it.    I would be happy to yield for a question from my friend  from South Carolina.    Of course.    There is no disagreement. I say to my friend from South  Carolina, there is no disagreement, but the U.S. Department of Labor  says we cannot do that at this moment. And at this moment, when people  are hurting so badly, when they have lost their jobs, been furloughed,  laid off, and they are worried about paying their bills, the Trump  administration says we are going to send them a cash payment.   We say--and I hope it is a bipartisan statement: We are with you too.  It isn't going to end with that one cash payment. We are going to stick  with you and make sure your unemployment insurance benefits are going  to keep you and your family together. And if, by chance, you come out a  little bit ahead in this process with the cash payment or with the  calculation of this formula, so be it. So be it.   At this moment in history, facing this national emergency, we would  rather err on the side of your being able to pay your bills and keep  your family together. Future needs, we can discuss and we can debate.  We can see what we can do with the State systems. But for the time  being, there are no apologies.   From where I am standing, $600 a week is exactly what Democrats are  committed to--I hope Republicans are as well--because our belief is  that this is the moment when we need to stand with these workers.   I might say that I support Rubio and Cardin in their efforts to help  small businesses. I think that is the right thing to do. It was  bipartisan from the start and really without much controversy. Have we  asked any of those businesses to produce net worth statements before  they receive those benefits? No, we are not doing that. We understand  this is an extraordinary moment. And we may do something different if  we are thinking about a long-term policy, but for the immediate term,  let us do the right thing. Let us err on the side of helping working  families who are out of work.   That is why I would oppose this amendment if it is going to be  offered by the Senator from Nebraska. I came to the floor to explain  how we reached this point, and I hope that others will consider my  point of view.    Thank you.   I yield the floor.    I would, in the nature of a question through the Chair,  which I believe is the appropriate procedure.    Well, this is actually turning out to be a debate on the  floor of the Senate. It is almost historic.   But I would just say this. We disagree on one basic premise. I don't  believe giving people $1,200 for each adult, as the President  suggested, or out of our approach, if they ended up with a net gain of  $2,000, that we have now turned them into lazy people who will not go  back to work, and that they will just wait for the next government  check.   These aren't the people I know, and they aren't the people you know.  By and large, these are hard-working people who, with an additional  $1,000, may finally be able to buy that refrigerator, may finally be  able to get that car fixed, and may finally be able to get some dental  work done.    So I don't think paying them a little extra here is going  to change their lifestyle and attitude toward hard work.    Is that a question directed to me through the Chair?    All right. Let me just say at the outset that we are  talking about people who did not voluntarily leave their jobs. These  people did not voluntarily leave their jobs. They were terminated. They  were laid off. They were furloughed. These are not people who were  gaming a system. These are people who are victims of the system that is  hurt by this national emergency.   Secondly, if we are erring on the side of giving struggling, hard- working families an additional $1,000 a month--$1,000 a month--for  goodness' sake, I am not going to apologize for a moment.   These people are living paycheck to paycheck, in many respects, if  they are making $15 an hour. That is $30,000 a year. And for us to say:  Well, they are going to end up with 1,000 bucks; now they will never go  back to work, those people. I don't believe that.   In this world of social media and such, we have been contacted by  nurses who say: So you think we are going to quit our jobs so that we  can take advantage of the unemployment benefits? No, we go to our jobs,  and we do what we have to do, and the amount of money is secondary.    I will be happy to, and I thank the Senator from Texas.  But I would just say this: Yes, in this respect, I agree with you.   Take a look at the State systems of paying unemployment benefits. We  are told by the U.S. Department of Labor that many of them are way  behind the modern technology and cannot meet what you have stated as  your goal here.   If we want to work toward that goal of improving those State systems,  as Senator Scott said earlier, I will join you in that effort. But  let's not apologize for, perhaps, sending them an extra $1,000.   One last point, we are asking these people to stay home. We were  asking them to help us defeat this virus by not working and to stay  with their families. So one of the incentives here, if there is a good  unemployment benefit coming in, is that they can keep their families  together while they obey this directive, at least, from government,  State and Federal.    Will the Senator yield for a question?  [[Page S2050]]         Senator, I am sure you are acutely aware that this is a  4-month program. We are not offering people this benefit indefinitely.  I hope we don't have to renew it, but to say that I am going to change  my lifestyle and give up returning to the place where I have worked  forever, where I was just laid off because they closed the restaurant  because of a 4-month program, I don't think so.   I think people are more loyal to the workplace if they are treated  fairly. And if we end up giving them an additional $1,000 a month, at  the end of the day, I think it is the right thing to do.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Does the Senator support the Trump administration's cash  payment to these families, which comes to them whether they work or  not?    If I may just comment and say this. I don't think  President Trump's cash payment or an additional $1,000 a month, or  whatever it is, under the unemployment benefit is going to make a  worker lazy and government dependent. These are not the people I know.  These are people who get up and work hard every darn day, and if they  get an extra helping hand out of this, so be it.   We are trying to deal with a health crisis and help these families  get through it. That is where we started on this side of the aisle.   We may talk about something in the future and approach it a little  differently, but I don't think it makes them lazy to receive the  President's cash payment or to receive an extra payment from this  unemployment benefit.
