 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  1218, the ``Data Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act'' which directs the  Federal Communications Commission to identify areas of the country  where poor maternal health rates overlap with deficiencies in broadband  access that are needed to effectively deploy telehealth services.   In the United States, black women are 2 to 6 times more likely to die  from complications of pregnancy than white women, depending on where  they live.   Dating back to maternity mortality analysis from 1979 to 1992, the  overall pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 25.1 deaths per 100,000  for black women, 10.3 for Hispanic women, and 6.0 for non-Hispanic  white women.   During 2011-2015, the pregnancy-related mortality ratios were--   42.8 deaths per 100,000 live births for black non-Hispanic women;   32.5 deaths per 100,000 live births for American Indian/Alaskan  Native non-Hispanic women;   14.2 deaths per 100,000 live births for Asian/Pacific Islander non- Hispanic women;   13.0 deaths per 100,000 live births for white non-Hispanic women; and   11.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for Hispanic women.   Madam Speaker, Black women in the United States experience  unacceptably poor maternal health outcomes, including  disproportionately high rates of death related to pregnancy or  childbirth.   Both societal and health system factors contribute to high rates of  poor health outcomes and maternal mortality for Black women, who are  more likely to experience barriers to obtaining quality care and often  face racial discrimination throughout their lives.   Health inequity stems from economic inequality and its contributing  factors including sexism and racism. To that point, Black women are  typically paid just 63 cents for every dollar paid to white, non- Hispanic men.   Median wages for Black women in the United States are $36,227 per  year, which is $21,698 less than the median wages for white, non- Hispanic men.   These lost wages mean Black women and their families have less money  to support themselves and their families and may have to choose between  essential resources like housing, childcare, food, and health care.   These trade-offs are evident in Black women's health outcomes and use  of medical care.   Compared to white women, Black women are more likely to be uninsured,  face greater financial barriers to care when they need it and are less  likely to access prenatal care.   Black women experience higher rates of many preventable disease and  chronic health conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and  cardiovascular disease.   When Black women choose to become pregnant, these health conditions  influence both maternal and infant health outcomes.   To improve Black women's maternal health, we need a multi-faceted  approach that addresses Black women's health across the lifespan,  improves access to quality care, addresses social determinants of  health and provides greater economic security. Comprehensive data on  maternal health is certainly a part of that approach.   Black women are three to four times more likely to experience a  pregnancy-related death than white women.   Black women are more likely to experience preventable maternal death  compared with white women.   Black women's heightened risk of pregnancy-related death spans income  and education levels.   Black women experience more maternal health complications than white  women. Black women are more likely to experience complications  throughout the course of their pregnancies than white women.   Black women are three times more likely to have fibroids (benign  tumors that grow in the uterus and can cause postpartum hemorrhaging)  than white women, and the fibroids occur at younger ages and grow more  quickly for Black women.   Black women display signs of preeclampsia earlier in pregnancy than  white women. This condition, which involves high blood pressure during  pregnancy, can lead to severe complications including death if  improperly treated.   Black women experience physical ``weathering,'' meaning their bodies  age faster than white women's due to exposure to chronic stress linked  to socioeconomic disadvantage and discrimination over the life course,  thus making pregnancy riskier at an earlier age.   Primarily Black-serving hospitals provide lower quality maternity  care, where seventy-five percent of Black women give birth.   Those same hospitals also have higher rates of maternal complications  than other hospitals. They also perform worse on 12 of 15 birth  outcomes, including elective deliveries, non-elective cesarean births  and maternal mortality.   Many Black women have a difficult time accessing the reproductive  health care that meets their needs. Access to reproductive health care,  which helps women plan their families, improves health outcomes for  women and children.   Black women experience higher rates of unintended pregnancies than  all other racial groups, in part because of disparities in access to  quality contraceptive care and counseling.   Many Black women lack access to quality contraceptive care and  counseling.   For example, in a recent analysis of California women enrolled in  Medicaid, Black women were less likely than white or Latina women to  receive postpartum contraception, and when they did receive it, they  were less likely to receive a highly effective method.   Black women's access to abortion is limited, and they may be more  likely to experience the ill effects of abortion restrictions--such as  delayed care, increased costs or lack of access to care.   Black and Hispanic adults in the United States remain less likely  than White adults to say they own a traditional computer or have high- speed internet at home, according to a Pew Research Center survey  conducted Jan. 25 to Feb. 8, 2021.   In addition, only 40 percent of Black adults report having broadband  access in their homes. This figure is another testament to the  inhibitions black women face in getting the care they need, which this  act aims to resolve.   It is for that reason Madam Speaker I support the ``Data Mapping to  Save Moms' Lives Act.''   Comprehensive data on maternal health will play a role in saving the  lives of pregnant black women, so I am proud to support this Act.   Though there is still much work to be done, this bill is a good first  step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this  potentially life-saving piece of legislation.   For far too long black women have disproportionately suffered lower  maternal health rates and outcomes. The passage of this Act finally  provides us a route to remediation.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  2501, the ``Spectrum Coordination Act'' which requires the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal  Communications Commission to update the Memorandum of Understanding on  Spectrum Coordination to improve the process for resolving frequency  allocation disputes in shared or adjacent spectrum bands and ensure the  efficient use or sharing of spectrum.   The memorandum of understanding formalizes the cooperative  relationship between the two agencies to ensure that spectrum policy  decisions promote efficient use of spectrum consistent with both the  economic interests and national security of the Nation.   Spectrum encompasses a variety of communications, from extremely low  frequencies which are used by military submarines to communicate with  one another, to extremely high frequencies which allow all of us to use  Wi-Fi in our homes and at work.   Spectrum is also critical for air travel, one of the most important  industries in the United States and the world. It provides pilots and  air traffic controllers the ability to communicate from surface to air,  ensuring passenger safety and scheduled arrival at their destinations.   In terms of domestic national security, spectrum is crucial in saving  lives. Due to the devastating effects of climate change, we are seeing  natural disasters that are more devastating than ever before. The  effects of these disasters demand an equally significant response from  our first responders, from local police all the way to FEMA.   Thanks to the manipulability of spectrum, we have created dedicated  interoperable frequencies for first responders, allowing them to  effectively communicate with their counterparts and save more lives.   Madam Speaker, properly designating jurisdiction of spectrum or radio  wave oversight is critical in maintaining this country's economic  prosperity and national security.   Our society is increasingly relying on technology, and therefore  spectrum, every day.   We must update this memorandum to accurately assess and subsequently  assign jurisdiction based on the technological advances we have made  since the memorandum's last update in 2003.   Since 2003, the Internet has transitioned from a luxury to a  commodity, smart phones are mandatory to be able to fully participate  in society, and threats to national security have evolved in ways we  never thought possible.   In addition, spectrum allocation will even be increasingly important  in the distant future.   Astronomers use specialized devices to read radio waves emitted from  outer space, allowing us to learn more about the universe and its  origins. Just last week The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory  released a new image of what it called astronomy's newest mystery: the  Odd Radio Circle or ORC.   Astronomers have spotted only a handful of ORCs. They're huge, about  a million light-years across which is 16 times bigger than our Milky  Way galaxy. Despite this, the ORCs are hard to see. They're visible  only at radio wavelengths.   Right now, we don't know what ORCs are or what causes them, but one  day we will. The case could be made that when we do know more, it will  be objectively critical knowledge because humans are explorers, and  space is our next frontier.   Space is the next place we will go, and maybe not in this generation  nor the one after that, but one day we will go. Humans will need all  the information they can get while exploring the unknown, and all of it  will be thanks to radio waves and those who read them and understood  them. Their importance truly cannot be understated.   Madam Speaker, I firmly believe these factors make updating this  memorandum of the utmost necessity, so I am proud to support the  ``Spectrum Coordination Act'' and urge my colleagues to as well.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  5657, the Medical Marijuana Research Act.   The purpose of this bill is to amend the Controlled Substances Act to  make marijuana accessible for use by qualified marijuana researchers  for medical purposes, and for other purposes.   This bill establishes new, separate registration requirements to  facilitate medical marijuana research.   It will remove the barriers on conducting cannabis research, by  allowing scientists to access products from dispensaries that are  legally authorized by state law.   Current barriers include the burdensome registration process,  redundant protocol reviews, lack of adequate research material, and  unnecessarily onerous security requirements.   The act will speed up the process for researchers to apply and get  approved to study cannabis.   It will also set clear deadlines on federal agencies to act on their  registration applications.   The bill also makes it easier for scientists to modify their research  protocols without having to seek federal approval.   It would additionally require that the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) license more growers.   With this requirement there would be no limit on the number of  additional entities that can be registered to cultivate marijuana for  research purposes.   For half a century, researchers have only been able to study  marijuana grown at the University of Mississippi, because it is the  only federally approved facility.   These researchers have complained that it is difficult to obtain the  medical marijuana at the facility, and when they do obtain it, it is  low quality.   The medical marijuana that researchers at the University of  Mississippi have access to is often compared to industrial hemp, a  botanical class of Cannabis sativa that is grown specifically for  industrial and medical use.   There are many differences between hemp and marijuana such as:  [[Page H4140]]    Hemp is specifically bred to produce plants because of its strong  durable fibers, whereas marijuana is bred specifically for its resin  properties, which is used for recreational purposes.   Hemp is bred to have less than .03 percent THC. THC is the mood- altering compound in marijuana. Regular marijuana has 1 percent to 30  percent of THC.   The hemp plant produces a high level of CBD oil and low levels of THC  resin. Marijuana has a low level of CBD oil, and high levels of THC  resin.   In humans, the CBD oil produced by the hemp plant works on the  inflammatory systems of the brain which is why some patients say they  get relief after using it. Marijuana works on the part of the brain  that regulates mood and hunger.   The cannabis that government-authorized institutions typically access  is more like hemp than marijuana, and marijuana is what consumers use  in the real world.   These researchers need to have access to marijuana and not facility- grown hemp to further our education around the drug.   With this bill, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) and the U.S. attorney general would be required to create a  process for marijuana manufacturers and distributors to supply  researchers with cannabis from dispensaries.   This will allow researchers to be able to study the recreational  marijuana that is being used and sold from state-legal businesses,  instead of having to use only government grown cannabis.   Ninety-nine percent of Americans live in a state that has legalized  some form of cannabis, yet the federal law is still hindering  researchers' ability to study all the full range of health benefits.   Providing researchers with the actual marijuana that consumers are  purchasing is the only way to provide the most efficient and relevant  results.   We need to stop making researchers jump through regulatory hoops in  their efforts to study the medical potential of the plant.   Expanding the marijuana studies will help ensure that Americans have  adequate access to these potentially life changing medicines and  treatments.   There are about 4 million registered cannabis patients in the United  States, and likely millions more are self-medicating.   The United States leads the world in biomedical research yet research  on cannabis, a drug that many of our citizens benefit from and are  already using, lags far behind.   Limiting the resources for this research will leave patients, health  care professionals, and policy makers without the evidence needed to  make sound decisions about the use of marijuana.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 5657 because  providing the resources for this research could make the difference in  millions of lives.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  1916, the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act.   The purpose of this bill is to provide health insurance benefits for  outpatient and inpatient items and services related to the diagnosis  and treatment of congenital anomalies and birth defects.   This bill requires private health insurance plans to cover the  diagnosis and treatment of birth defects, congenital disorders, or  congenital malformations, conditions developed prenatally and may be  identified before or at birth, or later in life.   The coverage must include services and items that functionally  improve, repair, or restore any body part that is medically necessary  for normal bodily functions or appearance, as determined by the  treating physician.   This bill protects patients against increased insurance premiums by  clearly specifying that coverage for these treatments may be subjected  only to the same limits that apply to other injuries or sicknesses  without imposing any greater financial responsibilities on the patient  or family.   This legislation would also close an insurance coverage loophole for  people born with congenital anomalies who need complex oral restorative  care.   It would ensure that health plans cover medically necessary services  related to a patient's anomaly or birth defect, including any serious  dental and oral-related procedures that are necessary to maintaining  health and overall function.   Insurance companies usually cover the preliminary procedures to treat  congenital anomalies, but often deny and delay follow-up reconstructive  procedures.   Denial or delay of these reconstructive procedures could lead to  long-term physical and psychological injuries.   Insurance companies claim these follow up procedures are only  cosmetic in nature, which then places a significant burden on patients  and their families.   It is relatively rare for a child with a congenital deformity or  developmental anomaly to undergo just one procedure that corrects all  the associated health implications the first time.   On average, these children can expect anywhere from three to five  surgical procedures and many more treatments before achieving  structural normalcy and function in the affected body parts.   These families are then forced to pay huge out-of-pocket costs for  treatment coverage or, in worst case scenarios, terminate treatment.   For example, people born with ectodermal dysplasia's are often unable  to properly develop teeth.   Their teeth may be missing, completely absent, have defective enamel  or be shaped differently.   If the teeth are not repaired or replaced, these individuals could  have chewing, swallowing, digestive, speech and self-esteem issues.   Someone born with ectodermal dysplasia spends a significant amount of  money on necessary medical and dental care throughout their lifetime.   This amount of money can become so excessive that families may have  no option other than selling their cars, remortgaging their homes, and  foregoing a college education to afford medically necessary dental  care.   Far more families simply go without care because they can't afford  it.   Dental care is also subject to a double-standard, while some  individuals who lose their teeth due to an accident receive dental  benefits under the existing statutes, those who are missing teeth due  to ectodermal dysplasias, a medical condition they were born with, do  not receive these same dental benefits.   The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act would fix this.   This bill would help more families than those affected by the  ectodermal dysplasias. It would cover a broad range of congenital  anomalies.   Many people born with congenital anomalies suffer from severe oral  defects such as:   Cleft lip or palate   Hypodontia   Enamel hypoplasia   Skeletal defects like craniosynostosis   Vision defects like congenital cataracts or aphakia   Hearing defects like microtia   Other loss of bodily functions   According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one  in 33 babies in the United States is born with a congenital anomaly.   Of those 120,000 children born annually with birth defects,  approximately 40,000 require reconstructive surgery.   Medical professionals and surgeons are fortunately able to correct  many of these problems, however some insurance companies deny access to  care by labeling the procedures as ``cosmetic'' or ``non-functional''  in nature.   Too many children born with congenital anomalies are denied coverage  despite the long-term harm of such conditions.   The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act would address delays and denials in  coverage and guarantee that children suffering from birth defects and  anomalies get the treatment they need.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1916 because this  law guarantees the payment of health insurance benefits for necessary  medical care and treatment due to any congenital anomaly.   These families deserve to see the day when they no longer have to  fight for coverage of medically necessary treatments and their children  and loved ones receive the treatments they desperately need and  deserve.  [[Page H4144]]     Madam Speaker, today, I sat in the Senate Judiciary  Committee as a historic vote was taken.   Since the appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor, only four women have  ascended to the United States Supreme Court.   In particular, longer than any other demographic group, African- American women have been subjected to coercive laws, yet they have been  excluded from the political and judicial positions to impact those  laws.   I am glad that President Biden saw fit to nominate one of the most-- and probably the most--qualified judge ever to be nominated to the  United States Supreme Court--not my words; the words of many others.   So this day that Dr. King died, we know that the dreamer may have  been killed, but the dream still lives.   They voted today. Eleven Democrats voted yes. Unfortunately, 11  Republicans voted no.   I hope, as this goes to the floor, we will stand as Americans, and  Democrats and Republicans will ascend to the United States Supreme  Court this African-American woman, more qualified than ever, again, to  take a rightful place on the United States Supreme Court. I pray that  that will happen.                            ____________________
