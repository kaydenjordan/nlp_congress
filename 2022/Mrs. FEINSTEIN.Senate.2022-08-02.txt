 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of  legislation that I introduced today along with Senators Booker, Wyden,  Duckworth, Padilla, and Warren: the Strengthening Welfare in Marine  Settings (SWIMS) Act. This is a companion to legislation introduced by  Congressman Adam Schiff in the House of Representatives.   Our bill would ban the importation and exportation of orcas, beluga  whales, pilot whales, and false killer whales for public display, with  an exception for animals being released to a marine sanctuary or back  to the wild.   Our bill would also prohibit breeding captive whales to raise their  newborns for public display, ensuring that the current generation of  these whales in captivity would be the last.   The evidence is clear: Orcas, beluga whales, pilot whales, and false  killer whales are intelligent and emotionally complex animals that  cannot thrive in captivity. In the wild, these whales can travel up to  100 miles per day and dive hundreds of feet deep.   However, many animals in captivity live in tanks so small they cannot  even turn around. Often, these whales are so stressed that they gnaw on  the concrete walls of their tanks until the dental nerves of their  teeth are exposed, permanently damaging their teeth and requiring  constant antibiotics.   The inhumane confinement for these animals has consequences, which  are made clear when news breaks of yet another whale dying well before  its time. In the wild, the average orca lives for 40 years. Orcas in  captivity in the United States typically live only 12 years. Although  no orca has ever been documented attacking a human in the wild, in  captivity, these whales have been documented to lash out at their human  trainers, causing severe harm or death.   Despite these well-established facts, more than 50 whales remain in  captivity across the United States. My home State of California has  already banned orca shows and breeding, and some exhibitors like  SeaWorld have promised to end their orca breeding programs.   It is long past time for Federal Government to apply this policy to  the whale species that suffer the most in captivity and end this cruel  practice. Our bill, which is endorsed by 15 animal welfare  organizations, would do just that.   Mr. President, by passing my bill, the Senate can prevent the  needless suffering and deaths of these majestic animals who truly  belong in the wild. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the  SWIMS Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BOOKER:   S. 4749. A bill to improve grants administered by the Office of  Community Oriented Policing Services, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
