 Mr. Chair, I wanted to briefly discuss eating  disorders and how it affects our servicemembers and their families.  Eating disorders affects over 30 million Americans during their  lifetimes, and have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric  illness. Studies show that eating disorders affect our servicemembers  and their families at a higher rate than the civilian population, with  34 percent of female active duty servicemembers and 20 percent of  children of sevicemembers scoring at risk for an eating disorder.   Additionally, a Military Medicine study of female military members  and veterans found significant relationships between eating disorders,  PTSD and sexual trauma. As we have much to learn on how eating  disorders affect our military members and their families, I would  encourage the House to start considering how we can address this issue  within our military.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Tipton). All time for general debate has  expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.   An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of  Rules Committee Print 115-30 shall be considered as adopted and the  bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the  purpose of further amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be  considered as read.   The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                                 H.R. 3219         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
