 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2622) to amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to codify  certain Securities and Exchange Commission no-action letters that  exclude brokers and dealers compensated for certain research services  from the definition of investment adviser, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2622         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF NO-ACTION LETTER; STUDY.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The Securities and Exchange Commission staff first       granted temporary no-action relief in 2017, prior to the       implementation of European rules designed to protect European       investors from excessive costs and conflicts of interest.        (2) The Commission staff did not engage in any meaningful       cost-benefit analysis of the issues raised by the no-action       relief requested either prior to or following the granting of       no-action relief in 2017.        (3) The Commission staff revised and extended the temporary       no-action relief in 2019, again without any meaningful cost-      benefit analysis of the issues raised by the no-action relief       requested prior to or following the granting of the relief.        (4) There are currently approximately 15,300 registered       investment advisers, including affiliates that provide the       vast majority of investment research.        (5) The Commission has received complaints from investors       and investor advocacy groups expressing concerns with the no-      action relief, as it currently exists.        (6) The Commission has received concerns from broker-      dealers related to the potential expiration of the no-action       relief.        (b) Extension of No-action Letter.--The Commission shall       provide an additional 6-month extension of the October 26,       2017, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,       SEC Staff No-Action Letter, set to expire on July 3, 2023.        (c) Study Required.--After the announcement extending the       expiration date of the no-action letter under subsection (b),       the Commission shall conduct, through notice and comment, a       study of the impact of allowing the no-action letter's       expiration or maintenance of the no-action letter, and give       due regard to any comments received in conducting the study.       The Commission or delegated staff shall report their findings       and conclusions, including findings related to the expiration       of the no-action relief, to the Committee on Financial       Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.        (d) Contents of Study.--The study required under subsection       (c) shall include potential impacts on the research market       for smaller issuers, including--        (1) the availability of such research, including--        (A) the number and types of firms who provide such       research;        (B) the volume of such research over time; and        (C) competition in the research market;        (2) any unique challenges faced by minority-owned, women-      owned, and veteran owned small issuers in obtaining research       coverage;        (3) the impact on the availability of research coverage for       small issuers due to Commission rules;        (4) a cost-benefit analysis of regulatory options that will       support research coverage of small entities and increase       transparency in the cost of research provided by broker-      dealers;        (5) the impact of the no-action relief on investors in       registered investment companies and exempt investment funds,       pension funds, endowments, and other asset owners, investment       advisers, broker-dealers that provide both investment       research and trading services, independent investment       advisers that do not provide trading services, broker-dealers       that do not provide investment research, and other market       participants, including issuers of securities; and        (6) the potential impacts of the expiration of the no-      action relief on investors in registered investment companies       and exempt investment funds, pension funds, endowments,       investment advisers, and other asset owners, broker-dealers       that provide both investment research and trading services,       independent investment advisers that do not provide trading       services, broker-dealers that do not provide investment       research, and other market participants, including issuers of       securities.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2622, a bill that would ensure broker- dealers can continue to provide investment research to Europe. This  research is incredibly important for smaller and midsize public  companies that rely on our capital markets.   I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, Representatives  Sessions and Gottheimer, for finding common ground and coming to a  sensible agreement to ensure that policies enacted by the European  Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID, do not  needlessly burden U.S. broker-dealers.   H.R. 2622 extends an SEC no-action letter originally issued in 2017,  and extended again in 2019, for another 6 months, granting U.S. broker- dealers much-needed relief and giving the SEC time to properly study  the impact of the no-action letter's expiration.   Widespread dissemination of research by U.S. broker-dealers to  investment managers is critical to capital formation and to maintaining  the competitiveness and efficiency of the U.S. capital markets.  Moreover, non-U.S. and global investment managers rely on the excellent  research conducted and provided by U.S. broker-dealers to inform their  decisionmaking and fulfill their fiduciary duties to U.S. investors.   Unfortunately, the EU's MiFID II threatens to disrupt the current  [[Page H3185]]  broker-dealer research market by requiring separate payments for  research services and trade execution. This small change would capture  U.S. broker-dealers receiving unbundled payments for research services  and put them under the Investment Advisers Act, subjecting them to an  entirely new regulatory regime.   The SEC no-action letter, which H.R. 2622 extends, permits broker- dealers to accept separate cash payments from investment advisers  without adding new, burdensome regulatory requirements.   Studies have shown that since MiFID II was introduced, there has been  a reduction in the availability of research. Many broker-dealers have  said that they will significantly curtail or eliminate their research  services altogether if this no-action letter expires. Plus, as of last  month, several European Union member states are seeking to reverse  MiFID II.   Madam Speaker, to ensure the continued availability of investment  research and better understand the consequences of allowing the SEC no- action letter to expire, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2622, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the author of this piece of  legislation and my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I would just simply urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2622, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  [[Page H3186]]  bill (H.R. 1548) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  specify that actions of the Advocate for Small Business Capital  Formation are not a collection of information under the Paperwork  Reduction Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1548         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to Small       Business Information Act''.       SEC. 2. EXCLUSION FROM THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT.         Section 4(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78d(j)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(10) Exclusion from the paperwork reduction act.--        ``(A) In general.--Actions taken by the Advocate for Small       Business Capital Formation under this subsection shall not be       a `collection of information' for purposes of subchapter I of       chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code (commonly known as       the `Paperwork Reduction Act').        ``(B) Exceptions.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the       requirements under subsections (c)(1), (c)(4), and (i) of       section 3506 of such title and section 3507(a)(1)(A) of such       title, except that the Commission shall not be required--        ``(i) to submit a collection of information by the Advocate       to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as       described under section 3506(c)(1)(A) of such title;        ``(ii) to display a control number on a collection of       information by the Advocate, as described under section       3506(c)(1)(B)(i) of such title (or to inform a person       receiving a collection of information from the Advocate that       the collection of information needs to display a control       number, as described under section 3506(c)(1)(B)(iii)(V) of       such title); or        ``(iii) to indicate a collection of information by the       Advocate is in accordance with the clearance requirements of       section 3507 of such title, as described under section       3506(c)(1)(B)(ii) of such title.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1548, the Improving Access  to Small Business Information Act.   I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Kim), the author of this legislation, and the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), for working on this  commonsense piece of bipartisan legislation that will help ensure  America's small businesses and entrepreneurs are heard at the SEC.   H.R. 1548 provides a simple fix that will allow the SEC's Advocate  for Small Business Capital Formation, or the Advocate, to become a more  impactful voice in support of American entrepreneurs and capital  formation.   Each year, the Advocate and its staff host events around the country  to support small businesses and to better understand their most  pressing issues when it comes to raising capital. Such interactions  help the Advocate analyze the potential impact of policy changes likely  to affect small businesses and their investors.   Under current law, however, the Advocate may not collect  information--such as through surveys or studies--from small businesses  and entrepreneurs without triggering the burdensome requirements of the  Paperwork Reduction Act. This, in turn, introduces a host of  bureaucratic hurdles the Advocate must navigate in carrying out its  mission.   By clarifying that such actions of the Advocate are not a collection  of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act and providing  exemptions from the most burdensome aspects of the Paperwork Reduction  Act, H.R. 1548 enables the Advocate to engage with American small  businesses with less friction.   With fewer hurdles in place, the Advocate will gain a better  understanding of the capital formation challenges that small businesses  face, which will result in better policymaking decisions here in  Washington, D.C.                                time  1715    Madam Speaker, H.R. 1548 is a balanced and thoughtful bill that cuts  unnecessary and onerous red tape to allow the SEC's Advocate for Small  Business Capital Formation to become a more effective champion in  support of American small businesses and capital formation. For this  reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1548, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), the author of this piece of  legislation, and my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would simply urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 1548, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1096) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins  in commemoration of the 250th Anniversary of the United States Marine  Corps, and to support programs at the Marine Corps Heritage Center.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1096         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``250th Anniversary of the       United States Marine Corps Commemorative Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) November 10, 2025, marks the 250th anniversary of the       United States Marine Corps.        (2) The United States Marine Corps has, over the course of       its illustrious 250-year history, fought gallantly in defense       of the United States.        (3) The United States Marine Corps has established itself       as a leading military force, always prepared for tomorrow's       challenges and to contend with the future character of war.        (4) The United States Marine Corps continues to exemplify       the warrior ethos that has made it a fighting force of       international repute.        (5) All Americans should commemorate the legacy of the       United States Marine Corps and recognize the significant       contributions the values embodied in the Corps have made in       protecting the United States against its enemies.        (6) In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2001, the Congress authorized the construction of the       Marine Corps Heritage Center as a multipurpose facility for       historical displays for the public viewing, curation and       storage of artifacts, research facilities, classrooms,       offices and associated activities consistent with the mission       of the Marine Corps.        (7) On November 10, 2006, the Marine Corps Heritage Center       opened to the public, with exhibits that share the history of       the Marine Corps from 1775 until 1975, and with planned       future exhibits on modern day Marine Corps history from the       end of the Vietnam War through the wars in Iraq and       Afghanistan, to be completed by 2025.        (8) The United States should pay tribute to the 250th       anniversary of the United States Marine Corps by minting and       issuing a commemorative coin.        (9) The surcharge proceeds from the sale of a commemorative       coin, which would have no net costs to the taxpayers, would       raise valuable funding for the continuation of educational       programs of the Marine Corps Heritage Center.       SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.         (a) Denominations.--The Secretary of the Treasury       (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'')       shall mint and issue the following coins:        (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which       shall--        (A) weigh 8.359 grams;        (B) have a diameter of 0.850 inches; and        (C) contain not less than 90 percent gold.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1096, a bill that  will mint a series of coins to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the  United States Marine Corps.   I would like to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Moulton) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), for their  work on this bill and for their service.   The Marines are one of the most storied branches of the United States  Armed Forces. On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress  meeting in Philadelphia, passed a resolution stating that ``two  Battalions of Marines be raised'' for service as landing forces with  the fleet.   This resolution established the Continental Marines and forever  marked the birth date of the United States Marine Corps.   Now, that may be the official inception of the Marines, but if you  ask any corpsman, they will tell you that the Marines were formed in a  bar.   According to Marine legend, newly commissioned Captains Samuel  Nicholas and Robert Mullan organized the first Marine Corps muster at  Tun Tavern, a popular watering hole in Philadelphia.   The two officers are said to have lured potential marines with mugs  of beer and a promise of adventures on the high seas. They were looking  for ``a few good men,'' the ``Few and the Proud.'' Their recruits later  made up the first five companies who served aboard Continental Navy  ships.   Shortly after their beginning, the marines became known for their  unconventional and fierce combat.   The first amphibious assault in Marine Corps history came on March 3,  1776, when a force under Captain Nicholas stormed the beaches of the  British-held island of New Providence in the Bahamas. These 220 marines  captured the town and successfully seized several brass canons and  mortars that were directly shipped to George Washington's Continental  Army.   The Marines served in every American war of the 18th and 19th  centuries, but their role as naval troops was limited until June of  1918.   In 1918, under General James Harbord, marines clashed with German  forces positioned in a French hunting preserve known as Belleau Wood.   Ignoring calls to withdraw, one captain famously said, ``Retreat?  Hell, we just got here.'' The marines held their ground against a  German assault and later spearheaded an Allied counterattack on June 6,  earning their nickname of ``Devil Dogs.''   The Marines have a history that is far too expansive for a floor  speech alone. However, every historical battle the Marines took part in  left a lasting impact.   The ``leathernecks'' of Derna, the Navajo Code Talkers of World War  II, and the Montford Point marines all paved the way for generations of  marines to come, including the 15 corpsmen in the 118th Congress.   In August of 2021, marines were among the last U.S. forces on the  battleground in Afghanistan, going above and beyond the call of duty to  defend Afghan and American civilians alike who were fleeing the  Taliban's advance.   Eleven of the 13 courageous and honorable servicemembers killed in  the terrorist attack on the Kabul airport were members of the United  States Marine Corps. These fearless marines lived and embodied their  motto, ``Semper Fidelis,'' or ``Always Faithful,'' a motto I am sure  will be the centerpiece of the commemorative coin series.   I again thank my Congressional colleagues who answered the call to  service in the Marine Corps, and especially those marines back home in  Missouri's Second Congressional District. It is your warrior spirit  that we are honoring here today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), one of the authors of this  coin legislation for the U.S. Marine Corps and a great friend,  colleague, and patriot.    Madam Speaker, as a proud Army mom whose son is a  graduate of West Point, I insist that the lieutenant general take my  son, Raymond, the good captain, to the mint also.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I  am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I thank my congressional colleagues for  their work on this bill, Captain Seth Moulton and General Jack Bergman.  Their steadfast commitment and determination to commemorate the Marine  Corps truly shows once a marine, always a marine.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. Jackson Lee. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1096, a  bill authorizing the U.S. Treasury to mint commemorative coins in honor  of the Marine Corps' 250th Anniversary in 2025 and to support programs  at the Marine Corps Heritage Center.   The 250th Anniversary of the United States Marine Corps Commemorative  Coin Act will allow Americans to continue their substantial  contributions toward the preservation of the Marine Corps history  without any costs to the taxpayers.   November 2025 marks the 250th anniversary of the Navy Marine Corps'  founding at Tun Tavern, Philadelphia, on November 10, 1775.   Since its founding, the Marine Corps has gone on to safeguard our  freedom in every climate and region, and in almost every war our nation  has fought.   As this House may fervently remember, the coin minted in 2005 for the  230th anniversary of the Marine Corps turned out to be one of the most  popular in U.S. Mint history.   The revenue from that coin supported the funding of the construction  of the National Museum of the Marine Corps--an award-winning cultural  institution which continues to welcome visitors from around the world.   No reason to doubt that a coin marking the 250th anniversary of the  Marine Corps will be just as popular.   Revenue from the 250th Anniversary coin will support Marine Corps  Heritage Foundation's historical and cultural programs that preserve,  showcase, and educate the public on Marine Corps, history, traditions,  and culture and support to the National Museum of the Marine Corps.   H.R. 1096 will also help to take the history, tradition, culture, and  values of the Marine Corps beyond the museum's walls to Americans  across the country.   Today's Marine Corps is an integrated air-ground team, capable of  rapidly deploying to any conflict or crisis location in the world.   The men and women of the Marine Corps, Always Faithful, remain our  nation's finest examples of Honor, Courage, and Commitment for nearly  250 years.   This legislation is an opportunity for Congress to help Americans  honor the Marine Corps legacy of bravery and selfless service on a  national scale, in a way that won't cost taxpayers a single cent.   I am honored to join with a bipartisan group of Marine veterans, and  other veterans of the armed forces serving in Congress, in supporting a  legislation that directs the Treasury Department to issue more than one  million coins in 2025 for the commemoration of the 250th Anniversary of  the United States Marine Corps.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
