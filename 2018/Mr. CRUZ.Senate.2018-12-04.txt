 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  President George Herbert Walker Bush.   This week, American hearts are heavy as we bid farewell to our 41st  President. Since we heard the news of his passing just a few days ago,  there has been a ceaseless stream of communications and commemorations  and testimonies to President Bush's character from every corner of our  Nation--from the worlds of politics, philanthropy, entertainment,  business, the Armed Forces--and from our living ex-Presidents. Even  those who were his rivals and critics during his public life have  returned to praise that life so well and honorably lived.    He will be remembered as a good and faithful servant to his country,  whose great legacy of leadership and love of homeland became a family  tradition. It earned him the admiration of countless Americans and  secured him a special place in the memory of every Texan.   Over his storied career, President Bush was a war hero and a  businessman, a legislator and an Ambassador. His 8 years as Vice  President prepared him well for the heavy burdens of the Nation's  highest office in his steering our Nation with a steady and strong hand  at the helm through the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first Gulf war.  Indeed, of his legacy as President, that calm, steady, strong  leadership as America won the Cold War will, no doubt, be his enduring  legacy.   A great many of us in this body were blessed to know President Bush  personally and to have had experiences in which he and Barbara touched  our lives. For me, my favorite experience with President George Herbert  Walker Bush occurred in 2009.   In 2009, I was beginning a campaign for attorney general in the State  of Texas. It appeared that the job would be vacant, and I was  campaigning to fill it. I had never run for office before. President  Bush invited me to go to the family home up in Kennebunkport, ME. So I  got on a plane, and I flew up to Maine. I remember sitting on that  plane, wondering what to say to him, what to ask of him. I didn't know  President Bush; I didn't know Barbara.   I remember, at the end of the day, resolving that I wasn't going to  ask for anything other than, simply, his advice, to say: Mr. President,  you are an elder statesman who has spent decades in public service.  What advice would you give to someone running his very first campaign  for public office? What path should I endeavor to follow? I had assumed  that the meeting would be a 10-, 20-minute meeting, a perfunctory  meeting. It was very kind of him to take it, but I didn't expect much  from the meeting.   When I sat down, I was amazed, first of all, that he knew everything  about the race--all of the potential players who might be running for  that position. He knew a great deal about my background, which had me  utterly flabbergasted because we didn't know each other. It was obvious  he was briefed and prepared before the meeting. He had put in that  time.   After about 20 minutes, he asked me: Ted, when is your flight back?   I said: Well, it is in a couple of hours. I am flying out of Boston.   He said: Can you, maybe, stay and go out on the boat with Barbara and  me?   I laughed. I said: Mr. President, plane reservations can be easily  changed. I will stay here as long as you would like me to.   He looked at me--I was wearing a suit--and he said: Well, that is,  clearly, not going to do.   We had been meeting in an office, which was in a separate building.  So he took me to a golf cart, and we drove in the golf cart to the  residence. He took me back to his and Barbara's bedroom. He opened his  closet. He pulled out a pair of jeans; he pulled out a shirt; he pulled  out a belt with a buckle that read ``President of the United States.''  It was his buckle.   He said: Here, Ted. Put this on.   So I dressed in the President's clothes, and we went out on the boat.   Now, it is worth remembering that President Bush was a former naval  aviator. He drove the boat and drove it full speed--with the throttle  pushed as far as it would go. It was a beautiful, cool summer's day  along the Maine shore, with waves splashing in the air. There was a  light rain in the mist. Barbara sat at the front of the boat, with rain  pelting her face, and she was smiling and glowing.   At the time, we were in the midst of the so-called Green Revolution  in Iran. So I remember asking ``Mr. President, what do you think about  what is happening in Iran? What do you think about the changes?'' and  just marveling, What on Earth am I doing on this boat, crashing through  the waves, listening to President George Herbert Walker Bush give me  his thoughts on national security and the interests of the United  States? We had, by the way, Secret Service agents in Zodiac boats who  were following as fast as they could and were having trouble keeping up  with the President.   So I ended up having lunch with President Bush and Barbara. We went  to a little restaurant where we had some Maine lobster. I ended up  spending 4\1/2\ hours with them. When I was getting ready to leave, I  was walking to the door, and I was thanking him for spending so much  time. He reached in his pocket, and he pulled out a check--a check for  $1,000 to my attorney general campaign. You could have knocked me over  with a stick. I am not someone who is known for being at a loss for  words, and I, simply, stared at him and stammered. I think I barely got  out the words ``thank you,'' but I was so astonished. The check,  simply, read ``from George and Barbara Bush.''   I got in the rental car and began driving back to the airport. I  called Heidi, and I said: Heidi, I just had the most magical,  unbelievable day.   He didn't have to do any of that. He didn't have to give me the time  of day. Yet he poured his heart into the people around him, into his  family, into his public service, and into his Nation.   That was just one, small illustration of the graciousness, the  generosity, the humility of spirit that characterized his entire 94  years on this planet. President Bush was the last of the ``greatest  generation'' to sit in the Oval Office, but his resolve will not be  lost to the past; it will triumph onward.   In his words:         The old ideas are new again because they are not old; they       are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism       that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.    The 91st Psalm is sometimes called the soldier's or the warrior's  psalm because it asks the Lord for protection against a litany of foes,  and it promises a refuge and a fortress in Him. It ends with the two  most important gifts that can be bestowed on the faithful warrior: ``I  shall satisfy him with a long life and grant him to see my salvation.''   In having enjoyed that first gift, an incredible life of 94 years of  making a difference, may President Bush now enjoy the second, bestowed  upon a good and faithful servant. Now George and his beloved Barbara  are together at last, with their daughter Robin, and they are enjoying  a well-deserved rest from their labors. Now his spirit has joined a  thousand points of light with his Creator, by whose brilliance may all  our works be illuminated and inspired.   President George Herbert Walker Bush leaves behind 6 children, 17  grandchildren, and 8 great-grandchildren. He and Barbara were married  for 73 years--the longest Presidential marriage in the history of the  United States.   God bless the memory of President George Herbert Walker Bush. God  bless the legacy of service that he and Barbara instilled in generation  after generation of the Bush family. Texas and America are far better  for having known and loved him.   I yield the floor.
