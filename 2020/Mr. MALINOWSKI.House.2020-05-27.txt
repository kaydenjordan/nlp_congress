 Mr. Speaker, for the last 3 months, tens of millions  of our fellow Americans have chosen to make painful sacrifices to keep  one another safe.   They made that choice before any Governor of any State told them they  had to. They did what they thought was right, what was decent, what was  responsible. Overwhelmingly, the American people still believe that  social distancing to protect our neighbors is the right thing to do  even where States have lifted stay-at-home orders.   You wouldn't know this by watching the news because the news dwells  on conflict, not consensus. The loudest voices say: ``Reopen everything  now. Yes, people will die, but people die of car crashes, of cancer, of  heart disease. We don't stay home for that.'' The angriest voices say:  ``Go to the grocery store. Throw off your mask. Make them call the  police.'' They pretend to be brave. They shout childish slogans about  liberty, as if liberty meant the right to endanger the lives of others  for our own convenience.   On social media, there is an effort to make everything about this  pandemic partisan; as if whether you are a Democrat or Republican  should determine what medicines you should take or whether you should  wear a mask.   I have been to plenty of countries where everything is made to be  political, where everything is made to be tribal. I never thought I  would see people in the United States of America trying to make our  country like that.   But, Mr. Speaker, America is not like that. The vast majority of  Republicans and Democrats still say that of course we should do what is  needed to protect others. We are still a country that cares whether  people live or die more than we care about the stock market.   In New Jersey this year, we have had 177 road fatalities. Thus far,  we have lost more than 11,000 people to the coronavirus, and that  number would be vastly higher if not for the lockdowns.   Now, nobody is rushing to our State capital with guns, screaming to  keep the economy closed. No one ever loudly clamors for shared  sacrifice. But the quiet majority still say that we should put public  health first. The vast majority still want to be sure that we have to  do this only once, and therefore, we have to do it right.   So, yes, I get a lot of questions back home about when things are  going to reopen. But the most urgent question I get is not when do we  reopen, but: How are you going to help us safely reopen? What are you  doing about that?   Right now, the only responsible answer is that we must vastly expand  contact tracing and testing for the coronavirus so that people can go  back to normal life, knowing it is safe.   Unfortunately, the administration's plan for testing, which we just  received, basically states to the States around our country: We will  give you some supplies, but otherwise, you are on your own.   It is a shameful abdication of responsibility. At this point, I am  done with expecting better from our President. We are on our own in New  Jersey, in Michigan, in Ohio, in California.   So, let's at least give our State and local governments the resources  they need to bear this burden that our national government will not.   The HEROES Act would provide $75 billion to help our States conduct  the testing and contact tracing that we need if we want to go back to  work and school safely. The HEROES Act also provides the funding our  State and local governments have been pleading for to make up for  revenues lost because of coronavirus.    Mr. Speaker, in my district, I represent 75 small towns. We have more  Republican mayors in those towns than Democrats, but this is not  partisan in my district. Every one of them would rather spend money to  pay our cops, our firefighters, and our teachers to do their jobs than  spend money to pay for their unemployment.   My message to those who are stepping down from responsibility is at  least help us to help those who are stepping up. You want to go to the  beach, to a ball game? You want to hold political rallies? Fine, so do  I. Help the people who are risking their lives to make it safer for us  to do those things. Help the people who are working, who never stopped  working, to give us liberty without giving us death.   That is what the HEROES Act does. If the Senate has a better plan,  then let's hear it; let's negotiate; let's find our common ground.  Otherwise, let's send it to the President and get this job done.                            ____________________
