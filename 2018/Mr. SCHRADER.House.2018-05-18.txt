 Madam Chair, as a veterinarian, I agree with my good  friend and colleague, a large animal practitioner from the great State  of Florida, Ted Yoho, that pasteurization is essential to preventing  the reemergence of some of the most basic foodborne diseases that,  unfortunately, we now take for granted in the United States of America.   Prior to the advent of pasteurization, tuberculosis, brucellosis, and  all the diseases my good friend and colleague alluded to were  commonplace. Commonplace, and this is only over a little over 100 years  ago.   Milk, which is high in protein, starch, and fat, is an ideal medium  for bacterial growth. Within days, if not from original contamination  at the dairy, these deadly bacterial diseases develop. Pasteurization  is the modest heat treating of milk that keeps these deadly bacteria  from growing, thereby improving shelf life and allowing widespread  distribution of safe, clean, healthy, uncontaminated milk that makes us  the envy of the world.   It does not denature or impair the nutritional value of this super  nutritional food source. Indeed, do we all not remember just a few  years ago the melamine contamination in China, their milk source?  Chinese mothers now feed their babies American milk.   One of our most basic duties in the Federal Government is to protect  the health of the American people. It would be an unconscionable  dereliction of our duty to not allow this amendment to go forward.  Let's support the Constitution to protect the health and welfare of the  American people.
