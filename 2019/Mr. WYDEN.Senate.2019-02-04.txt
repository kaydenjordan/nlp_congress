 Mr. President, today I recognize the distinguished career  of Kathleen Gardner Cravedi, who is retiring after 41 years of  dedicated Federal service and for whose public service we should all be  grateful.   As somebody who started his career in public service as the co- director of the Oregon Grey Panthers, I appreciate the work of  individuals who are committed to improving conditions for older  Americans. Kathy began her career in public service on Capitol Hill  working on exactly those issues. As a Member of the U.S. House of  Representatives, I had the benefit of working with Kathy when she was  staff director for the Subcommittee on Health and Long-term Care of the  U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging. Working under  her chairman, the late-great Congressman Claude Pepper, Kathy helped  pass legislation ending mandatory retirement and providing hospice care  under Medicare. She worked on fighting elder abuse, health fraud, and  she worked on the first congressional hearing ever on Alzheimer's  disease.   She helped to establish the National Center for Biotechnology  Information and National Institute on Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and  Skin Diseases and the National Institute on Deafness and Other  Communication Disorders.   Following her service in Congress, Kathy continued her healthcare  advocacy by directing a nationwide campaign to bring citizens from all  50 States to Washington, DC, to testify before Congress and talk with  the First Lady on the need for healthcare reform.   In 1996, Kathy moved over to the National Library of Medicine, or  NLM, which is the world's largest biomedical library and a key resource  for some of the most exciting medical science out there. Serving as  NLM's first public liaison, she worked hard connecting NLM's work with  the public, spearheading campaigns that drew huge attention in the  United States and abroad. She brought in lawmakers and celebrities and  athletes and scientists to promote the organization's mission.   Over 23 years at NLM, Kathy steadily moved up the ranks, and she is  now retiring as the director of the Office of Communications and Public  Liaison. Her career at NLM has been key to connecting the American  public with the astounding work this organization does.   Forty-one successful years in public service is a tremendous  accomplishment. So I want to thank Kathy for all her many years of hard  work, and I want to congratulate her on her well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
