 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2617, an omnibus  appropriations package to fund the government through the end of the  fiscal year.   First, I have concerns about the size and the scope of the package,  it totals almost $2 trillion, and it comes after nearly $3 trillion of  spending was pushed through this Congress. This $3 trillion was enacted  completely outside of the normal process and many programs received  staggering increases.   This record-high spending has been a key driver of inflation. It has  led to record-high prices for the American people and for everything  from gas to groceries.   Instead of reflecting the economic realities we face, the package of  bills before us represents continued spending in areas that have  already received large increases.   Second, this omnibus package bails out the administration for many of  their self-inflicted wounds on issues like the border crisis and the  energy crisis.   In closing, I am disappointed that I am unable to support this bill  that funds our Nation's military at the authorized level, but the  excess spending on nondefense programs in this bill is just too much to  gain my support.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,''  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the bill before us does not include and  reflect the economic realities we face. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 225,  nays 201, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 4, as follows:                               [Roll No. 549]                                 YEAS--225       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
