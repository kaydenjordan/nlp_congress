 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R.  3441, cripples the right to bargain for better wages and conditions  when workers have joint employers. By narrowing the definition of a  joint employer, this bill deprives thousands of workers of their right  to negotiate with the parties that really exercise control over their  wages and conditions; and by undermining collective bargaining, this  bill suppresses wages.   One of the biggest problems, if not the biggest problem in the  economy today, has been the lack of wage growth over the last decade to  two decades. This bill will not improve that problem. It will take an  existing problem and make it worse.   Today, workers are under a direct threat from reckless, misleading  legislation like this; and that, ultimately, will do nothing to improve  their wages, improve their benefits, or improve their working  conditions.   Let's reject this bill and, instead, discuss and debate and craft  legislation that can improve workers' wages.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week we honor  America's veterans, a group of men and women with unparalleled courage  and love of country.   We owe our veterans an eternal debt of gratitude. We made a promise  to look out for them in exchange for their promise to defend our  freedom, but gratitude is not enough. That is why I am fighting to  maximize the care homeless veterans receive with my bill to improve  reporting from our VA hospitals, to make sure no veteran, at any stage  in life, falls through the cracks.   I also helped introduce the Patriot Employer Act, which would give  tax incentives to American businessowners who employ veterans.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District,  I would like to thank all of our Nation's veterans for their service on  this Veterans Day and every day.                            ____________________
