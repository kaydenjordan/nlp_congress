 Mr. Speaker, the Senate never quits. When ObamaCare was  passed in 2010, the Senate Democrats refused to use ObamaCare for their  personal insurance. Most Americans know that what is good for the goose  is good for the gander. My staff, my family,  [[Page H4141]]  and I have been on ObamaCare since day one.   Incredibly, the Senate is at it again. They don't want the American  Health Care Act to apply to them because it is not right. They are  special, and so they put a clause to exempt Congress from the American  Health Care Act so they could filibuster the healthcare bill. That dog  didn't hunt in 2010; it ain't hunting in 2017. If it is good for the  American people, our bosses, it is good for their servants, Congress,  us.   I urge my colleagues to be true public servants. Vote for H.R. 2192.
