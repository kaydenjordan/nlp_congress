 Mr. Speaker, there are hard votes and there are easy votes.  The hard votes involve competing values and difficult tradeoffs; the  easy ones give us a chance to express our core American values loudly  and clearly.   H.R. 5 is the right vote, and I thank Representative Cicilline for  his hard work and his heart in bringing this piece of justice to us.   In most States, same-sex couples can be denied service in  restaurants, fired from jobs, and evicted from homes with no legal  recourse. In other words, they can be mistreated or discriminated  against, and their government won't stand up for them.   H.R. 5 will end that. This bipartisan legislation will ban  discrimination against LGBTQ people in housing, employment, credit,  public accommodations, and so much more. It says that we don't care who  you love, but we do care that you are treated with decency and respect.   This legislation takes us the next step in a long American tradition  of expanding civil rights and protections. It affirms that, in this  country, there is no ``us'' and ``them,'' it is just us.   This is a historic day. I am proud to be a part of it. Let's cast  aside old prejudices and cast a vote for justice and equality.
