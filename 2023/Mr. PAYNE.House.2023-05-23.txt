 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the dangers of  fentanyl.   Fentanyl is a powerful opioid that is 50 times more potent than  morphine. Two milligrams, or the size of five grains of salt, can cause  a possible overdose. Fentanyl is so dangerous that illegal drug makers  must wear hazmat suits to avoid contact with the drug. It needs to be  stopped, but H.R. 467, the HALT Fentanyl Act, is not the bill to stop  it.   The bill would make it easier to arrest and imprison users of the  drug, and that would be a major problem in Black communities  nationwide. The Centers for Disease Control said Black Americans died  from fentanyl overdoses at much higher rates than any other community.   We do not need another bill to put more Black Americans in prison; we  need a bill that criminalizes the drug without criminalizing the drug  user.                            ____________________
