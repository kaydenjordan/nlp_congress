 Mr. President, today I wish to remember former  Reno police chief Robert Bradshaw, who recently passed away at the age  of 79.   Mr. Bradshaw served as chief of the Reno Police Department from 1981  to 1991. Before that, he was an assistant chief for the San Jose Police  Department. After working in Reno, Bradshaw served with the Nevada  Highway Patrol and later became chief of the Concord Police Department  in California.   Mr. Bradshaw strongly believed in the role community plays when it  came to reducing and preventing crimes in Reno. The Reno Police  Department said he was widely regarded as an expert in community- oriented policing and is credited with bringing that philosophy to the  force.   In fact, the police department's current motto of ``Your Police, Our  Community'' has been attributed to him.   One of Reno's longest serving chiefs, Bradshaw was a mentor to  countless officers and had a large impact on the city. During his  tenure, Bradshaw developed specialized units and created neighborhood  advisory groups. He also started the community satisfaction survey in  1987, which still continues three decades later.   As Nevada's senior Senator, I know firsthand that Mr. Bradshaw's  tireless efforts while chief made Reno a safer place. My thoughts and  prayers go out to his family and loved ones as they mourn his  loss.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember my friend,  Second Judicial District Court Chief Judge Patrick Flanagan, who  recently passed away in Reno at the age of 64. My deepest sympathy goes  out to his family and loved ones.   All of Washoe County and Nevada's legal community will miss Chief  Judge Flanagan, who only a year and a half ago was unanimously elected  by the Second Judicial District Court to serve as chief judge. He was  one of Nevada's finest, and his loss cannot be understated.   Before being elected to the bench, Chief Judge Flanagan served as an  attorney and an assistant Federal public defender for the District of  Nevada and worked in the appellate division of the Washoe County Public  Defender's Office as a chief appellate deputy. In 2006, he was elected  to serve as the Second Judicial District Court judge in Department 7  and was reelected in 2014.   Chief Judge Flanagan played a large role in the Reno community, as he  regularly spoke to students, opened his courtroom for observation, and  engaged students in public outreach initiatives, including the court's  first annual student Flag Day poem contest.  [[Page S6449]]    His colleagues remember him as a personable, caring, and effective  jurist who repeatedly inserted jokes or random facts about Irish  history in his emails.   He served as the president of the State Bar of Nevada, the Washoe  County Bar Association, and the Nevada Chapter of the Federal Bar  Association.   Chief Judge Flanagan completed his undergraduate degree from Duquesne  University and received his juris doctorate from California Western  School of Law.   As Nevada's senior Senator, I know Chief Judge Flanagan's legacy will  live on in the court. Lynne and my family pray for Chief Judge  Flanagan's wife, their two children, grandchild, and entire extended  family as they mourn his passing.                            ____________________
