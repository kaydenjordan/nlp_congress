 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for her incredible  leadership on this issue.   Rather than working across the aisle with Democrats to grow our  economy, to rebuild older communities, to create new jobs, Republicans  are, again, focused on attacking women's health, undermining healthcare  programs that provide preventive care for over 4 million Americans,  many low-income women who would otherwise be uninsured.   Eliminating this rule makes it harder for women and families to have  access to lifesaving cancer screenings, for example, birth control, and  other vital health services. These funds are providing necessary health  services, Madam Speaker, and everyone in this debate knows what this is  about. These dollars do not support abortion. We know Federal law  prohibits these dollars from being used for that purpose, but to hear  our friends on the other side, they would imply that is the case.   Now, there is and should be a legitimate debate on that subject, but  it has been the law and it continues to be the law that these dollars  are not used for abortion services. This is about health care. This is  about lifesaving health  [[Page H1276]]  care for women, and it ought to be preserved.
