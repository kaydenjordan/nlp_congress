 Madam Clerk, I rise to place in  nomination the name of Byron Donalds of Florida.   I will begin by saying how much I have anticipated the arrival of the  gentleman from Michigan, Congressman James, in this House; not in the  Senate, not in the old, staid, unchanging  [[Page H21]]  Senate, but in the House where we make change. Yesterday, we could have  elected the first Black Speaker of the United States House of  Representatives. Hear me clearly. Had the cascade of votes begun, it  would have extended to every Member of this body. It could begin today.   Last night, I sat within feet of Mr. Donalds as the tweet of another  Member-elect appeared on the screen. That Member-elect wrote and sent  out to America that Byron Donalds is a prop. I have spent a good bit of  time with Mr. Donalds, especially lately. He ain't no prop. If he were  a prop, he wouldn't be sitting where he is sitting. This is the tired,  old, grotesquely racist rhetoric that we have seen far too long.   Today, a Member-elect quote tweeted a FOX News story that incorrectly  reported that I said that if I don't prevail on the question before the  House, I will resign. That Member-elect quote tweeted that incorrect  story for his own political purposes after the story had been corrected  and the actual statement contradicting that report had been provided.  This is the old trafficking in lies from Washington that the American  people know far too well.   And, by the way, I am not leaving.   Kevin McCarthy released to the public on New Year's Eve a document  entitled: ``Restoring the People's House and Ending Business as  Usual.'' To his great credit, Mr. McCarthy made a statement of huge  significance to the country. The nominal leader of a major party  acknowledged publicly that this institution is broken, and he committed  to make changes to fix it.   So let me help my colleagues in the majority understand. We are doing  the people's business. That is what these 3 days have been about. We  are committed to make changes to this institution that has lost its  way. It is epitomized in the $1.7 trillion omnibus rammed through this  institution just 2 weeks ago.   I say to my colleagues that I came to fix this broken system.                                time  1230    America has seen that problem for a very long time, too. The  commitment to change it is new. The genesis of the prospect of changing  it emerges from this moment and those, since June, that led, at long  last, to the New Year's Eve statement of Mr. McCarthy and to these 3  days on the floor.   America needs men and women of courage to do something new in  Congress so that Congress can serve the American people. The Lord said,  Behold, I do a new thing.   We need more Byron Donalds. I know Byron. He is not a prop. He is a  man of personal conviction. He arrived at his convictions through  authentic and genuine life experience.   People ask me, what is the endgame? How does this end?   The answer to this question is that this is a dynamic process. All of  the decisions on this floor result from the coming together of minds,  one way or another.   This is the people's business. We will resolve the people's business,  and when we do, we will go to the mat for the American people because  we will be led by people of conviction, like the gentleman from  Florida, Byron Donalds.   The CLERK. The Reading Clerk will now call the roll.   The tellers having taken their places, the House proceeded to vote  for the Speaker.   The following is the result of the vote:                                [Roll No. 9]                               JEFFRIES--212       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Balint      Barragan      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bowman      Boyle (PA)      Brown      Brownley      Budzinski      Bush      Caraveo      Carbajal      Cardenas      Carson      Carter (LA)      Cartwright      Casar      Case      Casten      Castor (FL)      Castro (TX)      Cherfilus-McCormick      Chu      Cicilline      Clark (MA)      Clarke (NY)      Cleaver      Clyburn      Cohen      Connolly      Correa      Costa      Courtney      Craig      Crockett      Crow      Cuellar      Davids (KS)      Davis (IL)      Davis (NC)      Dean (PA)      DeGette      DeLauro      DelBene      Deluzio      DeSaulnier      Dingell      Doggett      Escobar      Eshoo      Espaillat      Evans      Fletcher      Foster      Foushee      Frankel, Lois      Frost      Gallego      Garamendi      Garcia (IL)      Garcia (TX)      Garcia, Robert      Golden (ME)      Goldman (NY)      Gomez      Gonzalez, Vicente      Gottheimer      Green (TX)      Grijalva      Harder (CA)      Hayes      Higgins (NY)      Himes      Horsford      Houlahan      Hoyer      Hoyle (OR)      Huffman      Ivey      Jackson (IL)      Jackson (NC)      Jackson Lee      Jacobs      Jayapal      Jeffries      Johnson (GA)      Kamlager-Dove      Kaptur      Keating      Kelly (IL)      Khanna      Kildee      Kilmer      Kim (NJ)      Krishnamoorthi      Kuster      Landsman      Larsen (WA)      Larson (CT)      Lee (CA)      Lee (NV)      Lee (PA)      Leger Fernandez      Levin      Lieu      Lofgren      Lynch      Magaziner      Manning      Matsui      McBath      McCollum      McGarvey      McGovern      Meeks      Menendez      Meng      Mfume      Moore (WI)      Morelle      Moskowitz      Moulton      Mrvan      Mullin      Nadler      Napolitano      Neal      Neguse      Nickel      Norcross      Ocasio-Cortez      Omar      Pallone      Panetta      Pappas      Pascrell      Payne      Pelosi      Peltola      Perez      Peters      Pettersen      Phillips      Pingree      Pocan      Porter      Pressley      Quigley      Ramirez      Raskin      Ross      Ruiz      Ruppersberger      Ryan      Salinas      Sanchez      Sarbanes      Scanlon      Schakowsky      Schiff      Schneider      Scholten      Schrier      Scott (VA)      Scott, David      Sewell      Sherman      Sherrill      Slotkin      Smith (WA)      Sorensen      Soto      Spanberger      Stansbury      Stanton      Stevens      Strickland      Swalwell      Sykes      Takano      Thanedar      Thompson (CA)      Thompson (MS)      Titus      Tlaib      Tokuda      Tonko      Torres (CA)      Torres (NY)      Trahan      Trone      Underwood      Vargas      Vasquez      Veasey      Velazquez      Wasserman Schultz      Waters      Watson Coleman      Wexton      Wild      Williams (GA)      Wilson (FL)                               McCARTHY--201       Aderholt      Alford      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bergman      Bice      Bilirakis      Bost      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Burchett      Burgess      Burlison      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cline      Cole      Collins      Comer      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davidson      De La Cruz      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flood      Foxx      Franklin, C.
