 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain  Mark K. Weber who died in a helicopter crash on March 15 while serving  in our Armed Forces in Iraq.   Captain Weber was a combat rescue officer assigned to the 38th Rescue  Squadron based at Moody's Air Force Base in the First Congressional  District of Georgia. He was one of seven in the helicopter crash who  lost their lives serving our country that day. As a combat rescue  officer, Captain Weber's role with his team was to fly into combat and  rescue injured soldiers.   I want to thank Captain Weber and his family for his service. My  thoughts and prayers are with his family and his friends.   Mr. Speaker, I want all of our servicemen and -women to know that we  are ever grateful for their service. They are in our thoughts and  prayers, and I could not thank them enough for the work they are doing  to spread democracy and freedom across the globe.                            ____________________
