 Madam Speaker, liberal Governors across  the country have shown they know nothing about good governance.   Many times I have heard impassioned speeches from my Republican  colleagues on how liberal Governors running their States have gone off  the deep end. Today, I am here to share North Carolina's story.   For months, Governor Roy Cooper has avoided numerous opportunities to  keep North Carolina open for business. He imposed phases of reopening  that only caused more businesses to go under while he claimed it was  the best option.   Now he believes a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew will somehow eliminate  COVID-19 altogether. What this curfew will do in the end is remind  North Carolinians that their Governor has no idea what he is doing.   COVID-19 is not a creature that roams the streets in the dead of  night and retreats to its burrow once daybreak hits. This is a virus.  Necessary safety precautions can be taken to protect yourself, your  loved ones, and those around you.   But when ill-conceived directives from Governor Cooper come into  play, North Carolinians begin to question where the ambition ends and  where leadership begins.   The American people hear time and time again that we must follow the  science, but when we question the science that is used to justify  lockdowns, we seldom receive true clarity.   We can all agree that the imperative here is to protect people from  the scourge of the virus. That is abundantly clear. However, that  imperative becomes horribly diluted when State and local economies  suffer, people lose their jobs, and ends can't be met because of  lockdowns. That is the sad reality of what lockdowns can do.   I have a message for Governor Cooper: Your abject failures during  this pandemic have hurt the livelihoods of people who are proud to call  North Carolina home. The last thing North Carolinians need is a  bureaucrat sitting in the Governor's mansion who hands down blanketed  mandates.   Hopefully, Governors across the country, including yourself, will  look to common sense as a guide moving forward; but based on what has  been done to date, you would probably squander that opportunity, too.   Leadership is not a foreign concept. So why not lead the right way  and put aside your desire to see North Carolina closed for business?   North Carolina is an economic powerhouse because of its hardworking  citizens who show up to work and get the job done. It is high time it  is treated that way.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  Patrolman Tyler Herndon of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, who passed  away on December 11 in the line of duty.   He was a dedicated public servant, and many who knew him knew that he  loved his job and his community immensely.   To his father, Mark; mother, Debbie; sister, Lindsey; and girlfriend,  Holly, Tyler was someone who always put a smile on people's faces.   Tyler always wanted to be in law enforcement. After he received his  bachelor's degree in criminal justice from UNC-Charlotte, he went on to  pursue his dream.   May God bless Tyler's family and the many brave men and women serving  with the Mount Holly Police Department.                            ____________________
