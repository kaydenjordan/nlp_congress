 Mr. Speaker, last week, Penn State  community lost a legend. Mr. Ray Walker passed away Friday at his home.  He was 105 and Penn State's oldest living alumnus.   Ray told our local newspaper that he saw the university grow a lot  over the years from ``just a cow college'' to becoming one of the  largest universities in the Nation.   Penn State truly shaped Ray Walker's life. Back in 1931, he thought  he wanted to be a doctor, but there was a requirement that he needed to  take German. After failing twice, he reevaluated his major and decided  to pursue business.   Around that time, his father told him that he would have to leave  Penn State because the family money was lost in the bank crash. But Ray  went to work: He started selling potatoes and coal to fraternity  houses, and by the time he graduated in 1935, he was sending money home  to help his family.   He founded Bradford Coal and was the driving force in surface mining  all over the world.   Penn State and I will miss Ray Walker. He was a friend. He was a  distinguished alumnus and loved by all who knew him.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
