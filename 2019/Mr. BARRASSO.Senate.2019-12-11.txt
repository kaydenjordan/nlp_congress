 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  rollcall vote scheduled to begin at 4:15 begin at 4:05 p.m.,  immediately.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, the Senate is considering the nomination  of Aurelia Skipwith to be Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service.   The agency needs Senate-confirmed leadership in place, and Ms.  Skipwith is well qualified to serve as the Director. She has a degree  in biology from Howard University, a degree in molecular genetics from  Purdue University, and a law degree from the University of Kentucky.  For almost 3 years, Ms. Skipwith has served as the Department of the  Interior's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.   At her nomination hearing, Ms. Skipwith was introduced by Democratic  Congressman William Lacy Clay, of Missouri. He said Ms. Skipwith was  ``one of the most talented, hardest working and driven persons that I  have ever known.''   I encourage every Senator to support her nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
