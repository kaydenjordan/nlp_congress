 Madam Speaker, workers in our Nation deserve human  dignity. That means the right to fight for safety and fairness in the  workplace, as residents in my district know this all too well because  we birthed the labor rights movement.   One of the most important provisions in the PRO Act provides for  mediation and arbitration if the employer and union cannot agree to a  first collective bargaining agreement.   My amendment guarantees that there will be no undue delay providing  workers that agreement. Currently, almost 50 percent of unions fail to  reach an agreement within a year with the employer. So my amendment  specifies that the arbitration panel must issue a decision within 120  days. This furthers the core purpose of the bill by preventing  employers from delaying this and putting the harm on workers.
