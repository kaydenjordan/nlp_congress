 Mr. Speaker, all gave some and some made the ultimate  sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor The American Legion volunteer  Madelene Macias and her three brothers, Jack Lopez, Clyde Lopez, and  Manuel Macias.   All of Madelene's brothers served honorably and fought in some of our  Nation's toughest battles. Private First Class Jack Lopez was a  technician, Clyde Lopez served in World War II, and Staff Sergeant  Manuel Macias served in the Vietnam war.   Jack Lopez was tragically killed in action in Okinawa, and Madelene  reached out to my office to make sure he was honored 77 years later.  Mr. Lopez's ultimate sacrifice earned him our country's recognition  with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Madelene for her commitment to our country and  our community. I thank each of her brothers for their service and  sacrifice for this great Nation.                            ____________________
