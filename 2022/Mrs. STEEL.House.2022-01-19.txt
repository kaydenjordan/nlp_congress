 Madam Speaker, this administration's failed policies have  led to record inflation and empty store shelves across the country.  Inflation just reached the highest level in 40 years. At the same time  basic goods are harder and harder to find at the stores thanks to the  supply chain mess.   Every day we see a new story about things getting more expensive,  life getting harder for Americans. Hardworking families are sick and  tired of paying more and getting less.   Madam Speaker, I have produced three bills that would help fix the  supply chain crisis and ensure goods make it to the stores and  consumers. These issues are urgent, but there has been no movement on  these bills. Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington continue to spend more  as paychecks get smaller and costs continue to rise.   Madam Speaker, I will continue to fight against these bad policies  and push for solutions.
