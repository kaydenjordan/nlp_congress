 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in disappointment that, once  again, the Federal Government is nearing another debt limit. Our  national debt is a record $22 trillion.   I blame both parties for this reckless and immoral burden that has  been placed on our children. We do not have a taxing problem in  Congress; we have a spending problem in Congress.   Both parties have lacked fiscal responsibility over the past four  decades. Both parties have operated in deficits when they were in  power.   Mr. Speaker, it will take both parties working together to control  our spending. Our national debt is the single biggest challenge that  faces our great country, and, surely, we can make it a bipartisan  movement to cut unnecessary and wasteful spending while still funding  our most important priorities of Social Security, Medicare, and our  national defense.                            ____________________
