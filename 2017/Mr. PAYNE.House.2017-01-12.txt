 Mr. Speaker, one of my constituents, Paul from Montclair,  New Jersey, shared with my office his struggle with bladder cancer,  HIV, and severe depression. He told us that he is scared, like most  people who rely on the Affordable Care Act, because Republicans are  determined to gut this legislation. He told us that he depends on the  ACA for his medications and treatments, without which he fears he will  die.   Paul lives on an unstable income, and it is only because of the ACA  that he is able to afford his treatments. The staffer in my office who  spoke with Paul told me that he could feel the fear in Paul's voice as  he listened to Paul's story. Paul is rightly concerned about  [[Page H396]]  whether he will be able to afford his next urologist appointment and  what will happen if he can no longer pay for his depression medication.   Now, Paul told us that this was the first time that he publicly  announced his medical conditions because he wants people to see the  human face on the problem of the ACA repeal. He wants people to know  that the ACA is keeping people alive.   Over 20 million people now depend on the ACA. They are not empty  numbers. They are real people who deserve affordable, quality health  coverage. ACA repeal would strip them of this coverage and make it  impossible for them to get the care they rightly need.   Democrats will continue to stand our ground on the ACA, and we will  continue to stand up for people who depend on the law, like Paul. We  will refuse to make America sick again and create chaos in our Nation's  healthcare system.                            ____________________
