 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Across the country, the opioid epidemic is devastating families and  communities.   In Rhode Island, the COVID-19 pandemic is only worsening this crisis.  In 2020 alone, accidental overdose deaths in Rhode Island increased by  25 percent, with most involving opioids.   State Opioid Response funding has been critical to combating this  deadly epidemic and helped provide Rhode Islanders with the resources  we need to combat drug abuse, prevent overdoses, and save lives.   The majority of Rhode Islanders who lost their lives to an opioid  overdose in recent years had a history of substance abuse without  treatment, and we need resources to intervene now.   State Opioid Response funding has helped provide the support and  treatment people suffering addiction need so desperately.   It means access to naloxone and training on how to use it. It means  paths to recovery. And it means saving lives.   I thank Representative Trone for introducing H.R. 2379, the State  Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act of 2021 to support States in  their fight against this opioid epidemic.   I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation and save  lives.
