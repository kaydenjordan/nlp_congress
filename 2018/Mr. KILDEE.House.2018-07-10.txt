 Mr. Speaker, a Federal court has ordered the Trump  administration to reunite every child under 5 years old who is  separated from his or her family by today. Unfortunately, the Trump  administration has no plan for family reunifications and will fail to  reunite as many as half of those children who were taken from their  parents. This is completely unacceptable.   Last week I visited some of those young children, one who looked  about 6 months old and many who were 3 and 4. At the facility I  visited, caseworkers there were calling detention facilities around the  country to locate those parents. They had to call the facilities to try  to find the parents. Many of them did.   But it is clear that the administration had no plan other than to  separate these kids from their parents as a tactic to try to dissuade  people who are seeking shelter from violence from coming to the United  States. Shame on them.   This will be a dark period in our history. It is a sad day.                            ____________________
