 Mr. Speaker, today the House is voting on a harmful  bill that puts the most vulnerable members of our community at risk. We  know that millions will lose coverage. And the Affordable Care Act  protects people with preexisting conditions--this bill does not. High- risk pools don't work.   My constituents are scared, and so are people across this country.   Arden from Gearhart, Oregon, wrote to me, distraught, because she and  her daughter, Selah, could lose coverage. Arden took the loving step of  adopting a child with special needs, and now the support program they  rely on is at risk of being terminated by this bill.   This is a critical vote. I implore my colleagues to think about all  of the people like Arden and Selah in their communities. Think about  the millions across this country who risk losing coverage.   I implore my colleagues to do no harm. Vote ``no'' on this harmful  bill.
