 Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from California  for his leadership in this very important amendment, and I am proud to  be an original cosponsor with him.   This amendment would require an intelligence briefing on the  anticipated geopolitical effects of emerging infectious diseases and  pandemics. These threats have serious implications for the national  security of the country. Just ask Director of National Intelligence,  Daniel Coats, who earlier this year warned that the increase in the  frequency and diversity of reported disease outbreaks probably will  continue, including the potential of a severe global health emergency  that could lead to major economic and societal disruptions, strain  governmental international resources, and increase calls to the United  States for support.   An outbreak in a remote village can spread to major cities in all six  continents in less than 36 hours. Such an event can lead nations to  close borders, disrupting the flow of people, goods, and services, and  incurring grave economic, social, political, and security costs.   Nearly 70 percent of the world's nations are underprepared to manage  and control such outbreaks.   These are not just hypotheticals. SARS, for example, spread across  four continents, infected 8,100 people, killed more than 700, and cost  the global economy $40 billion between February and July of 2003. The  Ebola and Zika outbreaks cost the American taxpayers more than $6  billion.   Understanding the ability, Mr. Chairman, of affected nations and  international organizations to detect and manage infectious diseases  and transnational pandemics is a vital step to ensuring an effective  response. I urge all of our colleagues to support Mr. Bera's and my  amendment.   I thank Mr. Bera for his leadership.
