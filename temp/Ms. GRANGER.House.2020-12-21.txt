 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill that will provide  funding for the Federal Government through the end of the fiscal year  as well as provide another round of desperately needed relief for those  affected by the coronavirus pandemic.   The appropriations package we will consider today is critical because  it will allow us to prevent an unnecessary government shutdown and  avoid a wasteful continuing resolution that simply straight-lines  funding until the end of next year.   The bill makes us safer by ensuring we have the funding and the tools  necessary to both discourage our enemies and defend ourselves against  them.   The funds provided in this bill are also critical to continue the  fight against public health threats both at home and abroad.   The bill ensures that longstanding provisions to protect life, reduce  burdensome regulation, and preserve our way of life are retained.   I would like to highlight some specific programs in the  appropriations package.   This bill supports another significant increase for the National  Institutes of Health, including funding for vital research on  Alzheimer's disease and to find cures for cancer.   It provides more than half a billion dollars for NASA, to help  maintain our superiority in space. We will need to continue to do more  in future years to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon.   The bill also funds the U.S. Space Force so the United States has a  leading edge against China and Russia.   The bill keeps us safe by providing the same level of funding as last  year for the border wall. It also rolls back attempts to limit the  President's authority to provide additional funds, if needed.   The bill continues to rebuild our military, modernize our nuclear  weapons stockpile, and strengthen our allies, such as Israel. This bill  strongly supports our veterans and our troops by increasing pay for our  military; addressing the healthcare needs of our brave warfighters and  their families, as well as those who previously served; and ensuring  that the United States military has cutting-edge equipment, such as the  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the V-22 Osprey, so that they can  discourage and take on any fight against our enemies.   The bill retains longstanding Second Amendment and pro-life  protections that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to  eliminate. In fact, it secures the largest pro-life victory in a  generation by maintaining the Trump administration's Title X Family  Planning regulations.   It drops the dangerous policy provisions my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle included in the House bills, including riders aimed  at defunding the police.   Billions of dollars of unnecessary emergency spending that the  majority included in their bills is stripped away in this package. Many  of these provisions are considered poison pills that were opposed by  Republicans and the White House.   Also before us today is another round of coronavirus relief.  Specifically, our package will: ensure the timely distribution of  vaccines across the country; help small businesses affected by the  economic downturn; and provide much-needed relief for airports and the  airline industry, which is so important for thousands of hardworking  Texans in and around my district.    I am glad we were able to come together on this agreement today, and  I want to thank my colleagues, Mrs. Lowey, Senator Shelby, and Senator  Leahy, for working together in good faith.   Plain and simple, this package is good for our economic security and  our national security because it addresses the most pressing threats we  face as a country. I hope it will be supported.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the former chairman of the full committee and  ranking member of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Simpson), the ranking member of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), the ranking member of the Defense  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the ranking member of the Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the ranking member of the Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Nebraska.   Mr. FORTENBERRY: Mr. Speaker, the bill supports rural broadband. And  that is more than wires laid. It is about creating an ecosystem of  livability so that the benefits of telehealth and tele-education and  telework, along with precision agriculture, can be distributed  equitably throughout the country.   The inspiring COVID vaccine approvals by the FDA have shown us what  we can do together, and this bill also protects our drug supply while  keeping unsafe drugs out.   Mr. Speaker, it is important that these provisions make it into law.  That is why I am happy to support this bill.   Again, Chair Lowey, thank you for your leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Fleischmann), the ranking member of the Homeland Security  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I close, I want to take a moment to recognize my good friend  and our full committee chairman, Nita Lowey, as this will be the last  bill that she will take to the floor.   She is the first woman to hold the gavel of the Appropriations  Committee, and her retirement is a huge loss to our country, to our  committee, and to me personally.   When I was named as ranking member and she was named as chair, she  called me into her office. We really had never worked together. We were  on different committees. I will never forget what she said. She said:  We are going to do it on time and on budget, and we will become best  friends.                                time  1930    I wasn't sure she wasn't crazy, but I said: I will do that.   We became good friends, and we did things on time and on budget.  Everything was a joy working with her because she always knew what she  wanted and what she wanted to do. She was inclusive, and we did turn  and have a friendship that I will always cherish.   So I wanted to make sure that you knew that I realized I had a unique  opportunity in working with you. I learned a lot, and we had a good  time, didn't we?   I also want to take a minute to thank the members of our committee  and our staff for their hard work this year. This really is a must-pass  bill that I look forward to getting signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of  these bills, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
