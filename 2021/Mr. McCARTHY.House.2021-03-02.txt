 Madam Speaker, this week Democrats are pushing partisan  legislation that would change how we conduct elections and how we can  speak about political issues. This legislation is the Democrats' most  pressing priority. Every single Democrat is a cosponsor.   Democrats made this bill H.R. 1, which is reserved for the bills the  majority thinks are the very most important.   Madam Speaker, you know--and those who are watching and those across  the country should understand--that when you become the majority, you  reserve the first 10 numbers for whatever you want them to be. So this  could have been H.R. 2, H.R. 3, H.R. 4, H.R. 5, H.R. 6, all the way up  to 10 or go on to any other number.   When I went out to talk to my constituents in the world of COVID who  are out of work and out of school, not one of them would think H.R. 1  would be something for politicians to protect themselves to get  reelected. But every single Democrat believes that is the case.   It wouldn't just be in my district, but I would say that if you talk  to any American, they would say: Back to work, back to school, and back  to health.   Madam Speaker, the priorities here are wrong. But it is not just  because the Speaker thinks it so, because every single Democrat  cosponsored this bill. It was bad when the Democrats introduced it  before COVID, and it is bad that they prioritize this over the children  going back to school, or people going back to work, or making sure  every American who wants a vaccine  [[Page H990]]  gets one. No. It shows the truth about what people think is the worst  about people in Congress. They prioritize themselves over everything  else.   Let's understand this bill. After a year of our country suffering  through a pandemic, the Democrats' first piece of legislation does not  help the millions of students still out of school, and it does not help  the 10 million Americans who are still unemployed. No. Democrat  legislation only helps themselves. Democrats want to use their razor- thin majority, not to pass bills to earn voters' trust, but to ensure  they don't lose more seats in the next election.   Madam Speaker, I know the leadership on the other side predicted that  they would win 20 seats. They only lost. I know that this is the most  razor-thin majority the Democrats have seen in the last 100 years, so I  guess that is why it is the top priority for every single Democrat.   Now, there are problems with this bill, so let's understand it.   First, H.R. 1 sends public dollars to fund political campaigns. Yes.   Can you believe that, Madam Speaker?   Madam Speaker, it is the number one priority you got elected to  Congress to do. Forget everything else, I want to make sure I get more  taxpayer money to fund my own campaign. I have to make sure I get  reelected--not that the kids go back to school and not to distribute  vaccines--to create a slush fund so that politicians can run for  reelection.   Let me explain it to you, Madam Speaker. It is in the fine print.  Let's say someone donates $200 to a preferred candidate. Under H.R. 1,  taxpayers now must chip in not $200, but $1,200.   Where in the world can you get that type of return on your  investment?   That is amazing.   You talk somebody into giving you $200 for your campaign, Madam  Speaker, so the taxpayers now have to give you $1,200. No wonder you  made it the most important bill because it only focuses on you.   Democrats want to raise this money through new fines on corporations  which the government will use to pay for campaigns and political  consultants. I guess Democrats don't actually believe corporate money  is bad in politics.   Today, corporations can't give. I guess they found a loophole to help  them.   Second, H.R. 1 weakens the security of our elections by making it  harder to protect against voter fraud. This bill automatically  registers voters from the DMV and other government databases such as  food stamps. In most cases it would prevent officials from removing  ineligible voters from the rolls and make it harder to verify the  accuracy of voter information. Currently, an estimated 24 million voter  records across the country appear to be inaccurate or invalid, and as  we saw during the pandemic, this created chaos and confusion.   It doesn't matter if you are a Democrat, Republican, or Independent.  Everyone has a personal story of a friend, their family, or their  neighbor receiving a ballot they shouldn't have. Every one of those  stories erodes trust in election integrity. Yet, under H.R. 1, future  voters can be dead or illegal immigrants or maybe even registered two  to three times. I guess Democrats just don't care, as long as they get  reelected.                                time  1045    Third, H.R. 1 rewrites election laws and imposes one-size-fits-all  partisan rules from Washington.   Under the Constitution, we generally defer to States and counties to  run elections. Democrats want to change that. First, they outlaw Dr.  Seuss, and now they want to tell us what to say.   They want to remove reasonable debates about early voting,  registration, and no-excuse mail-in balloting from the States and  counties and resolve them with a single Federal solution decided by the  whims of Washington. It is not unusual, because I know the committee is  also looking at, even though someone didn't win an election, appointing  somebody different in Congress.   They want to stop States from listening to their residents on the  very best way to protect ballot integrity, whether it is passing voter  I.D. laws or using basic safeguards like checking their voter rolls  against the Post Office change-of-address system.   They want to mandate no-excuse mail-in balloting and 15 days of early  voting as the post-pandemic norm.   Madam Speaker, in the last election, at least twice a week somebody  would send me a picture of the ballots that were mailed to their home  of people who had died or of people who had not lived there in 8 years.  This would guarantee that continues.   Fourth, H.R. 1 politicizes the Federal Election Commission by turning  it from an evenly divided commission into a partisan one. But they are  also going to create a speech czar.   Can you imagine? The Federal Election Commission has an even number  of Republicans and an even number of Democrats. You have the smallest  majority you have had in more than 100 years, so your number one  priority is to make sure you can't keep that bipartisan. Let's put our  thumb on the scale and make sure we get one more Democrat than  Republican. Then we can create a speech czar and tell people what to  say and what they can't say.   So they can't tell us in a bill we just passed that there is $140  million for a subway just outside the Speaker's office. That would be  wrong. But we also could get $200, but get $1,200 from the taxpayer.  Who wouldn't want this bill? Every single Democrat does.   H.R. 1 weaponizes the IRS--can you imagine that--by allowing the IRS  to consider an organization's political views before granting tax  exemptions. Now, they are going to pick and choose. You know, I thought  this was unbelievable until I read this document.   If you live in China and you want to fly on an airline, you can walk  up to the desk, you can have your money, but that doesn't determine  whether you get a ticket. You know what determines whether you get a  ticket? Your score; what you have said. And if you said something that  the government doesn't like, you can't fly on that plane. Unbelievable,  right? That could never happen in America.   Well, now we have a speech czar, we have made sure the Federal  Election Commission is where they are, and now we weaponize the IRS to  do exactly that.   Remember, under President Obama's IRS, this power was abused by Lois  Lerner and other bureaucrats to target conservative nonprofits during  the 2012 election. It was a massive scandal, a clear and intolerable  violation of public trust, and a crime, which is why singling out  groups for political views is banned.   One hundred thirty nonprofits wrote to Congress to strongly object to  H.R. 1. Why would nonprofits object to this? They said America should  be able to ``support causes we believe in without the fear of  harassment or intimidation.'' Well, I guess they are right, because if  this majority makes the number one issue--in a world of a pandemic,  unemployment, and kids out of school--the protection of themselves, I  would be afraid, too.   If you are serious about restoring public trust in government, the  ban must remain in place.   Madam Speaker, Democrats call H.R. 1 the For the People Act, but it  really should be called the for the politicians act. It is not designed  to protect Americans' vote. It is designed to put a thumb on the scale  in every election in America so that Democrats can turn a temporary  majority into permanent control. It is an unparalleled political grab.  I urge all my colleagues to oppose it.
