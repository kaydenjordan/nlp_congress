 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Herschel Ryan, an  incredible individual who is not just a close personal friend but a  true American hero.   My personal experiences with Herschel Ryan started when I was a small  child, but the most poignant moment that I ever had with him was when  he chaperoned on our church mission trip in the seventh grade. It was  there that he took a few minutes and shared with me his personal  experiences from the Vietnam war.   Mr. Herschel was a talented pilot in the Army, achieving the rank of  captain and recognition for his skills in flying helicopter missions.   It was while he was supporting a combat operation on February 9,  1968, that his flight encountered intense enemy fire, and he took a  direct hit. His injuries were so severe that he would ultimately lose  his left hand and eye, yet he still managed to direct his flight back  to safety.   For his gallantry and bravery, he was awarded the Silver Star, the  Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Air  Medal with 25 oak leaf clusters.   Mr. Speaker, hearing Mr. Herschel's story was formational for me. It  was the first time I had ever heard a personal perspective from a  veteran. What a gift he gave to me that day.   In this Chamber, we often talk about the need to honor our veterans  and the desire to celebrate our heroes. When I think of those who  served and sacrificed, I think of Herschel Ryan, a glowing example of  some of the finest men and women this country has ever produced.   He fought in a war that was unpopular and came home to a country that  did not want to talk about heroism.                               time  (1115)    But in spite of all that and the personal challenges he faced; he  never lost his joy. I cannot think of a more genuine, warm, and kind  man. He has an infectious laugh and spreads happiness to everyone who  is around him.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Herschel just turned 80 years old and has retired  from a successful career in business. He now travels with his wife,  Debbie, and volunteers his free time working with veterans who suffer  from PTSD, wanting to continue to serve others.   Mr. Speaker, today, here in the House of Representatives, we pause  and pay tribute to a great man and true American hero, Mr. Herschel  Ryan.                            ____________________
