 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I  recognize the legacy of James Boggs, a worker and activist who played a  pivotal role in labor organizing and the civil rights movement in the  city of Detroit.   James Boggs was born in Alabama in 1919. He eventually moved to  Detroit where he became an auto worker. Active in his worker's union,  Mr. Boggs was passionate about the political issues facing workers and  African Americans. His experiences and increasing interest in far-left  philosophies inspired him to pen ``The American Revolution: Pages from  a Negro Worker's Notebook,'' his most well-known work.   Mr. Boggs married Grace Lee in 1953. Their influence as a couple and  individually had tremendous impact on the organizing community, drawing  influence from global history and observations of the everyday  struggles of people.   Together, the Boggs' grassroots efforts to uplift voices of community  members resulted in their founding of a summer leadership program. That  legacy and that program lives on in The James and Grace Lee Boggs  School in Detroit.  [[Page H5164]]    I am proud to acknowledge and uplift Mr. Boggs in many of his  achievements as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of his birthday.                            ____________________
