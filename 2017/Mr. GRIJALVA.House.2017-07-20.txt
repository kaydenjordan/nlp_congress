 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today we are being asked to mandate a land exchange that will put a  road through a designated wilderness area inside the Izembek National  Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. If that sounds familiar, that is because we  have been down this road before.   After years of prodding from the Alaska delegation, the Public Land  Management Act of 2009 authorized this exchange and the eventual  construction of the road. However, that 2009 authorization was  contingent upon a determination by the Secretary of the Interior that  the road was in the public interest.   The Fish and Wildlife Service then spent nearly 5 years preparing a  full environmental impact statement in order to analyze the  environmental impacts of the proposed road, and to determine if viable  alternatives existed. During the lengthy and public process, the agency  held 130 public meetings, reviewed thousands of public comments, 97  percent of which were opposed to the road.   Ultimately, the Interior Department determined that building a road  through the one-of-a-kind wilderness area is not justified because it  will destroy an irreplaceable ecosystem, and there are other ways to  improve transportation in the area.   This is not just a simple trail through the woods. It is a road  through a narrow chain of islands and lagoons. Its construction  requires the development of bridges, installation of culverts and  pipes, and the dredge and fill of nearly 4 acres of wetlands.   The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge supports numerous species of  migratory waterfowl that we have international treaty obligations to  protect, including nearly the entire global population of the Pacific  black brant, and one of the only populations of nonmigratory tundra  swans, in addition to providing prime habitat for bears, caribou, and  other wildlife.   Now, before the point can be made, let me just say, I want to be  clear, I have never been to the refuge. Opposition to this road is not  based on personal opinion or spite, or ignorance, or because we love  birds more than people.   Opposition to this road is based on extensive public comments and a  long, careful, scientific review of its merits conducted by  conservation professionals. The table of contents for the environmental  review--not the review itself, but just the table of contents--is 28  pages long. The EIS comes with 10 appendices.   The Department of the Interior did its homework. They weighed the  costs and the benefits and made an informed decision. Now we are being  asked just to ignore that scientific analysis and ram this road right  through the refuge, despite knowing the damage it will do.   The consequences of a decision like that are known. They are not  unintended. The road through an Alaskan wilderness is not justified.  This particular road is not justified, and it is not necessary.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We have heard the argument, and we will repeatedly hear the argument  that the road connecting King Cove to Cold Bay is needed for health and  safety purposes. While it is true that the road will be used for  medical emergencies, there is a lot of evidence pointing to another  objective.                                time  1015    If you look at the decades-long effort to build this road, it becomes  clear that there has always been a commercial purpose in mind. King  Cove is home to one of the largest fish processing facilities, operated  by Peter Pan Seafoods, a subsidiary of a Japanese company that is one  of the largest seafood companies in the world.   Fishing is the backbone of the King Cove economy, and it has always  been one of the reasons for the road. Let's look at the facts.   In 1994, the city of King Cove passed a resolution to emphasize the  positive socioeconomic impacts of a 20-mile road linking King Cove to  the Cold Bay Airport. The resolution did not mention any need to use  the road for health or safety or for emergency situations of residents.   In 2005, the Aleutians East Borough participated in public scoping  meetings and presented their vision for a hub airport for Cold Bay.  This plan included cold storage capability for fish from King Cove and  other communities awaiting air freight.   In 2010, as part of a Fish and Wildlife EIS for the land exchange we  are debating today, an Aleutians East Borough assemblyman stated that  Peter Pan Seafoods would use the road to transport fresh product.   And finally, on May 25 of this year, Alaska Governor Bill Walker sent  a request to the Trump administration. He asked for: ``Access for  isolated King Cove residents to the airport in Cold Bay in all weather  conditions, enabling access to health services and the movement of  goods and people between King Cove and Cold Bay.''   When you add all this up, the evidence is pretty convincing. Sure,  the road will be used for emergency evacuations, but it will also be  used to transport fresh product to Cold Bay to be sold throughout Asia  and the rest of the world.   Despite language in the bill seeking to prohibit commercial use of  the road, once it is built, this prohibition will be incredibly  difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. This is an incredibly remote  area, and the Fish and Wildlife Service does not have the resources or  staff capacity to police the use of the road.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we are not saying that the residents of  King Cove do not deserve reliable transportation options, and neither  did the EIS. The EIS included an analysis of nonroad transportation  options that would piggyback off the $37.5 million Congress has already  invested in King Cove's infrastructure.   The Interior Department also asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  to analyze the nonroad transportation options to connect King Cove with  Cold Bay. The Army Corps published a report in 2015 that identified  three viable alternatives. These included a new airport that is capable  of supporting aircraft that can fly directly to Anchorage, a heliport  for emergency evacuations, and an ice-capable marine vessel that is  able to make the trip to Cold Bay in weather conditions that the  taxpayer-funded hovercraft could not.   Options exist, and that is why I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Other than myself, no.    Other than myself, no.    Other than myself, no.    Other than myself, no.    Other than myself, no.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, let me deal with one claim.   The claim that people will die if we don't pass H.R. 218 is wrong.  The claim is wrong because there is no evidence to back it up, and it  is wrong because using this kind of over-the-top rhetoric is  irresponsible.   We do not oppose this bill because we think animal life is more value  than human life, and throwing accusations like that around on the House  floor should be beneath all of us.   We do not have to rely on one Member's claim that the sky is falling.  These concerns have been assessed for years through public process, and  the conclusion was that there were viable alternatives that will  address any legitimate public safety concerns.   People's lives do not hang in the balance. We can protect public  health and the refuge if we abandon this bill and work together on a  better solution.   This is, indeed, a remote area. That is why many of the residents  choose to live there in the first place. They are fully accustomed to  the challenges that come with living in the last frontier. To address  these challenges, the Federal Government has appropriated tens of  millions of dollars to this community for better medical and  transportation facilities.   We have remote communities in Arizona, especially Tribal communities,  that would surely appreciate $37.5 million to address their health and  safety concerns as well.   The local government used some of that money to buy a hovercraft that  could make the airport run much faster than this road will ever allow.  The local community, not the Federal Government, elected to stop using  the hovercraft. Surely, if people's lives were at stake, the local  government would not have made that kind of a decision.   We have legitimate policy differences on this bill. The EIS has  convinced many on our side that this is not a worthwhile proposal.  Let's debate these findings calmly and rationally that would serve the  public in this debate and look for a solution that both protects  people's health and the refuge.  [[Page H6124]]    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.  [[Page H6127]]    The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  While it was described as a technical amendment to conform the bill to  the Senate version, it does much more than make a simple technical  correction.   Mr. Young's amendment expands the NEPA waiver in the underlying bill  to exempt all permits associated with the construction of the proposed  road from environmental review and public input. It is bad enough that  the bill waives NEPA for the land exchange, but under this amendment,  any and all improvements would be exempt from review. This could  include a Clean Water Act permit necessary to move forward with the  construction.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes the bill worse. I urge a ``no''  vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment made in order under  the rule at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 6, after line 24, insert the following:       SEC. 8. TAXPAYER FAIRNESS.         This Act shall not take effect until the State of Alaska       has repaid to the United States the $20,000,000 in Federal       funds appropriated and paid to the State of Alaska under       section 353(a) of the Department of the Interior and Related       Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-277).    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chairman, acknowledging that I am running the risk  of being uppity on this particular amendment, but thankfully never  smug, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 218, the King Cove Road  Land Exchange Act.   My amendment simply requires the State of Alaska to repay $20 million  appropriated in 1999 to support the town of King Cove before the bill  can take effect. The American taxpayer has already provided the town of  King Cove with a total of $37.5 million to improve transportation  access and medical facilities in the area. That included $20 million to  build a road, construct a dock, and purchase marine equipment.   Part of this money was used to purchase a $9 million hovercraft. This  Federal funding was provided as an alternative to building a road  through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The hovercraft worked as  it was designed. It carried up to 49 passengers at a time, an  ambulance, and even cargo, making the trip between King Cove and Cold  Bay in 20 minutes--a trip that would take 2 hours on the proposed road  when it is not shut down by extreme weather conditions.   After operating for 3 years and performing at least 30 medical  evacuations, the local government stopped using the hovercraft. The  Aleutians East Borough is now trying to sell the hovercraft on the open  market for $5 million.   As we speak, House Republicans are seeking massive and dangerous cuts  to spending on things like education, assistance to working families,  and even Medicaid and Medicare. Before we mandate construction of a  road through congressionally designated wilderness, it is only fair  that American taxpayers are reimbursed for Federal funding that was  intended to avoid the construction required by this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me remind, the point of the amendment  is that the money, the $37.5 million, and also the decision by the  local residents to purchase the hovercraft, that was not mandated by  the Federal Government. It was their decision, again with Federal  money, $9 million, and so that was all in lieu of construction of the  road.   This legislation mandates a construction of that road, and I think it  is only fair to the taxpayers that if the purpose was in lieu of to  deal with the medical evacuation situations that we have heard about  here again today, then the American taxpayers should be reimbursed for  that. This was not an error caused by, as the levees in New Orleans,  faulty design and construction that bore responsibility to the Federal  Government. These were local decisions made on the use of that money.  Now that the use of that money is moot, then the taxpayers deserve to  be reimbursed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed.                                time  1100     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed.                                time  1100
