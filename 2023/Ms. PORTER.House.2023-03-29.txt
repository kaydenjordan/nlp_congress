 Madam Speaker, back in 2017, I took a public stand  against Wall Street and its efforts to roll back the financial  regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. I opposed S.  2155, a deregulatory bill that ultimately passed into law.   Then, in 2017 and 2018, I was running for Congress for the first time  in a politically divided district. Standing against Wall Street wasn't  a safe position to take. In fact, that is why too many Republican and  Democratic lawmakers alike ended up supporting S. 2155. It was seen as  safer to be pro-business.   Every real capitalist knows there is nothing pro-business about a  bank failure. That is why, in 2010, Congress passed strong regulations  to keep our economy stable, our banks viable, and our businesses  growing. Just 8 years later, in 2018, Washington, D.C., reversed course  and passed S. 2155 at Wall Street's behest.   How did we get from this deregulation to the recent Silicon Valley  Bank failure, the biggest bank failure in over a decade?   In short, S. 2155 made it lawful for Silicon Valley Bank to leave  itself vulnerable when depositors wanted their money back faster than  the bank could pay it out.   When you walk into a bank, Madam Speaker, and you deposit $100, the  bank takes most of that $100 and invests it. They buy securities and  bonds. They don't just have your $100 sitting around. However, the bank  is supposed to hang on to a big enough portion of that deposit so that  if you want your money back, they can give it to you. It is  straightforward when a couple of people come in and want their money,  but sometimes a lot of people want all of their money all at once.   Why wasn't Silicon Valley Bank prepared for that scenario?   The bank's recent failure is a deregulation problem. Title IV of S.  2155 raised the asset threshold at which a bank is considered and  regulated as a systemically important bank. What we saw in Silicon  Valley Bank and other similarly sized banks is a result of Congress'  own actions in 2018 when they were removed from these enhanced  liquidity requirement stress testing and other safety and soundness  rules.   Because of these lax regulations, when push came to shove, Silicon  Valley Bank hadn't kept enough liquid assets to pay out the dollars  being drawn out. If Dodd-Frank were still applied to banks of that  size, then Silicon Valley Bank wouldn't have been able to put its own  profits over the stability of our banking system and our economy.    Let's not give banks that choice again. When Silicon Valley Bank  collapsed, Senator Elizabeth Warren and I partnered on legislation to  restore the regulations that were directly implemented as a result of  lessons learned during the 2008 financial crisis, not on the politics  of the moment or the political power of the bank lobby.   Our new bill, the Secure Viable Banking Act, the SVB Act, would  repeal title IV of S. 2155. It would restore Dodd-Frank regulations as  they are applied to banks the same size as Silicon Valley Bank.   Banking failures are bad. We should all be able to come together and  agree that systemically significant banks need regulations to limit the  risks of failure and to reduce the harmful consequences when a bank  does fail.   Let's agree to let Silicon Valley Bank be our last hard lesson. Let's  not swing regulations back and forth with the political tides and whims  of lobbyists. Let's, instead, keep rules in place that deliver a well- regulated, stable, and growing economy.   My SVB Act would do that.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill that creates a  banking system that works for all of us, not just one that boosts  banks' bottom lines.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, corporate profiteers have no place in  Medicare, but some private insurers don't give patients a choice.   The Biden administration has taken important steps to change the  direct contracting model, which stripped seniors of traditional  Medicare and moved them to private coverage--without their consent.   Its successor program, ACO REACH, still invites private actors to  exploit Medicare to boost their bottom lines. For-profit insurers can  pocket taxpayer dollars that they don't spend on their patients. Too  many have long histories of waste, fraud, and abuse.   Now, the administration is expanding ACO REACH, including doubling  its coverage of underserved communities. As a result, millions on  Medicare may soon face higher costs, smaller provider networks, and  worse care.   Strong guardrails are needed now, and I urge my colleagues to stand  up for patients and get corporate greed out of Medicare.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, our country needs energy to flourish.  Democrats know that means authorizing energy projects.   The law requires corporations to engage with communities, follow our  bedrock environmental principles, and ultimately advance projects that  offer greater benefits than costs.   Whether it is oil, natural gas, solar, or wind, the standard is the  same. We shouldn't move forward until we know that the project delivers  for consumers, taxpayers, and communities.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1 would eliminate that determination and instead  put corporate interests like Big Oil in charge of what energy projects  get authorized.   H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, gives billions of dollars in  taxpayer-funded subsidies to big oil and gas.   It would let fossil fuel companies hoard thousands of unused leases,  require the authorization of drilling on federally protected lands,  give unilateral authority to corporations to create their own  environmental impact statements, and force taxpayers to pay to clean up  hazardous mining waste.   Congress should be doing the right thing by looking at reforms that  protect taxpayers when approving energy projects.   That is why I offered an amendment that would require oil, gas, and  coal companies to put up a bond that actually covers the cost of  cleaning up their messes from drilling and mining.   That way, American taxpayers aren't on the hook to foot the billions  of dollars needed to find and plug abandoned wells.   Unfortunately, protecting the taxpayer from cleaning up big energy's  messes from drilling and mining is too controversial for my colleagues  across  [[Page H1561]]  the aisle, and my amendment was not put on the floor for a vote.   We can still come together in a bipartisan manner. We can and should  enact permitting reform that protects American taxpayers.   That is why I am submitting an amendment for the Record that requires  the Secretaries of Energy and the Interior to certify that this bill  would lower costs for American consumers and ban oil and gas  exploration on protected public lands.   These changes protect us all from footing the cost of big energy's  record-high profits.   To my colleagues across the aisle: You have an opportunity to prove  to your constituents back home that you are putting them over  polluters.   Will you stand up for consumers and taxpayers to lower costs, or will  you do the bidding of big energy?   This amendment puts that question to each of us.   Are we for the people or for polluters?   With this vote, you will show your allegiance.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the text of this amendment.         Ms. Porter of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1       to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to       report the same back to the House forthwith with the       following amendment:        At the end of the bill, add the following:                        DIVISION D--MISCELLANEOUS       SEC. 40001. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act, including the amendments made by this Act, shall       take effect on the date on which the Secretary of Energy and       the Secretary of the Interior jointly submit to Congress a       certification that the implementation of this Act, and the       amendments made by this Act, would lower costs for American       consumers and taxpayers.       SEC. 40002. SAVINGS CLAUSE.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary       shall not authorize any oil and gas exploration activities or       conduct an oil and gas lease sale on any unit of the National       Park System, national wildlife refuge, national trail,       national conservation area, national monument, or national       recreation area.
