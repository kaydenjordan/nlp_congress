 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, even as my Republican friends move to  reconcile their two tax bills in a conference committee, their problems  are far from over.   At the heart of their bill is a toxically unpopular idea--giant tax  breaks on big corporations and the very wealthy, paid for by cutting  care and raising taxes on millions of middle-class families. The new  Republican Party is the party of tax hikes on the middle class to  subsidize corporate welfare. That menacing idea at the core of its bill  is a problem that, like Hydra, spouts many heads.   Slashing the State and local deduction remains a massive problem for  House Republicans from suburban districts like Virginia, New York,  Illinois, Washington, and, of course, California. Multiple analyses  have shown that, despite the so-called compromise that allows families  to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes, the pain inflicted on  suburban families will not be much mitigated. States like California  and  [[Page S7829]]  New York will still experience an exodus of taxpayers, which will drain  local resources and impact services. For those House Republicans,  voting for the conference report is a poisonous vote, substantively and  politically, not to mention that home values will fall in those  districts of those House Republicans. If they are voting to decrease  home values by 10 or 8 percent for every homeowner in their districts,  that is political suicide. Why would they do it? That is what will  happen, and the homeowners will start seeing that right away.   Another problem: The last-minute inclusion of a corporate AMT has  Republicans and corporate leaders scrambling to figure out if it will  have the unintended consequence of functionally eliminating the value  of the R&D tax credit. Remember, the corporate AMT was added at the  last minute because Republicans needed more revenue to offset a  generous rate on passthroughs.   That is what Republicans were working on in the waning hours of last  week, not trying to figure out how we could help middle-class families  with kids in college, with kids who have serious medical expenses, and  not reducing the impact that it would have on our deficit. Oh, no. They  were busy figuring out how to make tax cuts for the wealthy even more  generous as 70 percent of our passthrough income already flows to the  top 1 percent, not the top 20 percent, not the top 10 percent--the top  1 percent. There is 70 percent of passthrough income that goes to the  top 1 percent of earners. The Republican tax bill already slashed the  rate on passthroughs, but several Republican Senators withheld their  votes until that loophole was widened further.   I understand that they wanted to help smaller businesses, but take  the time and figure out how to help the small businesses without  helping the hedge funds, corporate law firms, the big lobbying firms,  and other wealthy individuals. Take the time to figure it out--but no.  In the rush to get a crumb for small business owners, they are giving a  whole, big, nice chocolate layer cake to the wealthy. It is wrong, very  wrong.   The inclusion of the corporate AMT is another reminder that  Republicans cannot have it both ways. You cannot cut every conceivable  tax on big corporations and the wealthy without blowing up the deficit.  If Republicans are forced to go back and look at the corporate AMT,  they will have to find revenue elsewhere. Will they slightly lessen  another corporate tax break or will they ask working Americans to pay  more, which they have done in previous iterations on this bill?   Yesterday, we learned the Republican leadership circulated talking  points that questioned the legitimacy of the Joint Committee on  Taxation--the nonpartisan, independent scorekeepers of tax legislation.  Rather than confront the awful truth that their bill will not pay for  itself as it, instead, costs about $1 trillion even with dynamic growth  estimates, the Republican leadership asked its Members to shoot the  messenger. The JCT, which is widely respected and always accepted by  both parties, is, all of a sudden, a pariah in Republican circles  because it told the truth--that this bill would not cause the growth  they projected, that this bill will increase the deficit far more than  the Republicans had hoped.   The Republican leadership tried to discredit the nonpartisan umpire  it had long praised and had appointed. What a disgrace. It brings up  that what has happened in the last week or two here has been one of the  most disgraceful episodes in the history of the Senate--a major bill  done behind closed doors, rushed through. Then, adding insult to  injury, the truthtellers--the independent, appointed-by-Republican  monitors--were discredited because our Republican colleagues didn't  like hearing the answer.   There is still time to avert this awful bill. If my Republican  friends vote no on the conference bill, we can do a bipartisan tax  reform bill. We can pursue a much better process and get a much better  product and go so far as to heal a Senate that has been wounded by  partisanship and strife, greatly aggravated by the majority's actions  on this tax bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, instead of rushing a bad tax bill through  the conference, the Senate should focus on the bevy of year-end issues  confronting us. First and foremost, we must reach a spending bill that  would have us meet our commitments to support the military and also  urgent priorities here at home, such as combating the opioid crisis,  shoring up pension plans, supporting veterans' healthcare, relieving  student loan debt, and building rural infrastructure.   In previous budget agreements, Democrats have always strived to  achieve parity between our investments in defense and jobs and economic  development here at home. It has continually been a sticking point with  Republicans as we go through these negotiations. They want to increase  the spending for defense, the military, but shortchange important  domestic programs such as infrastructure, education, scientific  research--measures that create jobs and help the middle class. We  Democrats support an increase for our military, but we want to make  sure other crucial programs don't get left behind. So we will fight  just as hard in this budget agreement to ensure that for each dollar we  add for defense, a dollar is added for domestic economic development,  50-50.   We care about our soldiers. They are the greatest. They are risking  their lives for us, but we also care about a pensioner who spent his  whole life working in the steel mills, working driving a truck, working  building buildings. They religiously put money away every month so they  would have something when they retire, and if it is not there--they are  important too.   General Mattis came to see me and told me how badly our Defense  Department needs help. I agree, but I told him to go back to the White  House and tell the White House the domestic side of the ledger needs  help as well. Spending on the domestic side of the ledger is lower than  it was in 2010, despite increased costs.   We also need to provide funding for Community Health Centers, the  Children's Health Insurance Program, relief for millions of Americans  still recovering from national disasters, and we must come together on  a bipartisan bill to support the Dream Act along with tougher border  security measures. So it is a lengthy to-do list. It will require hard  work, steady cooperation, and compromise on both sides.   Last night, however, there was a concerning spectacle on the House  floor. The freedom caucus held up an unrelated vote on the tax bill-- who could figure--because they were unsatisfied with the Republican  leadership's plan to keep the government open. If we are going to solve  all the problems that confront us before the end of the year, House  leaders cannot let the Freedom Caucus--a small band of hard-right  reactionary conservatives--run the show. If they cooperate with  Democrats, they can accomplish something. To just let the Freedom  Caucus dictate is a recipe for chaos.   Once again, negotiations broke off because we were at an impasse on  the 50-50 parity for defense and nondefense. That has been very  important to Democrats for years. We have settled our budget  agreements, our spending policy, omnibus agreements always with 50-50,  and we believe it is still important today--parity, parity, parity.   As we continue to negotiate with our Republican counterparts, we hope  the Republican leadership can avert more of this unnecessary hostage- taking like we saw on the House floor last night that can only impede a  serious, ongoing bipartisan negotiation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
