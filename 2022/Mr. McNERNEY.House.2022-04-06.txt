 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the mathematical  and statistical sciences.   Fundamental research in mathematics and statistics touches all of our  Nation's scientific and technological priorities and provides tools to  address societal changes.   As recent examples, mathematical scientists model the spread of  pandemics and help assess the effectiveness of vaccine programs.   They produce research needed for artificial intelligence and help us  understand and predict dangerous weather patterns.   And their theoretical work fortifies imaging technologies used to  detect diseases, including cancer.   We are at a critical time for building and ensuring a stable and more  diverse STEM workforce in the future.   Mathematics and statistics support all of the STEM disciplines and  are critical to our educational system.   Every day, mathematicians and statisticians enable advances across  all science and technology, making our Nation more secure and globally  competitive, and training the next generation of researchers and  educators.   Please join me and my fellow mathematicians on the Joint Policy Board  for Mathematics in celebrating April as Mathematics and Statistics  Awareness Month.                            ____________________
