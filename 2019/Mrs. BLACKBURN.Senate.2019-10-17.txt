 Mr. President, in Nashville, we have a saying: it all  starts with a song; but a song is just the beginning of the story.   This Sunday, Nashville's unbroken circle of elite artists, producers,  entertainers, and musical masterminds will welcome four new members  into the Country Music Hall of Fame.   Kix Brooks, Ronnie Dunn, Ray Stevens, and Jerry Bradley represent  different sectors within the music industry, but they have all  contributed to country music's evolution.   Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn--we know them as Brooks & Dunn--began  their careers as solo singer-songwriters but rocketed to stardom as a  duo. Their fusion of classic rock composition and heartfelt songwriting  spoke to country music fans craving an edge to the genre's traditional  ``Nashville Sound.'' Nearly three decades after their first album  dropped, their music still inspires emerging generations of fans.   From the beginning of his career, audiences and fellow artists alike  were drawn to Ray Stevens' wonderful sense of humor, open heart, and  commitment to entertainment as an art form. Known for his work in  musical comedy, Ray stretched his legs and also made a name for himself  as a studio musician, producer, songwriter, publisher, label owner,  gospel singer, and country star.   Jerry Bradley, this year's final inductee, may not have invented  country music, but no one on Music Row would deny the impact his work  has had on generations of country stars. Jerry began his career in  Nashville when the industry was on the brink of a major transformation.  He drove the format into a new era defined by rebels, outlaws, and  crossover superstars.   Today, I encourage my colleagues to take a moment to think of their  favorite song and to remember how it made them feel the first time they  heard it.   Kix, Ronnie, Ray, and Jerry are responsible for making millions of  people feel that exact same way about their favorite song.   Their body of work represents more than just a series of  accomplishments. It represents the best of Music City.   It is a gift.                            ____________________
