 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 844, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 79) removing the deadline for the  ratification of the equal rights amendment, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 79.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this is long-overdue legislation to ensure that the  equal rights amendment can finally become the 28th amendment to the  United States Constitution.   This year, we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of women gaining  the right to vote. Despite the century that has elapsed, our  Constitution still does not recognize or guarantee full equal  protection of the law for women and gender minorities, but H.J. Res. 79  would bring us one step closer.   The resolution removes the previous deadline Congress set for  ratifying the ERA and will, therefore, ensure that recent ratifications  by Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia are given full effect.   The ERA offers a basic and fundamental guarantee: Equality of rights  under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or  by any State on account of sex.   That is it. Very simple.   In the years since it was passed by overwhelming bipartisan  majorities in the House and the Senate, we have made great strides to  secure that equality, including through existing case law decided under  the 14th Amendment.   The ERA would enshrine those principles and take the final critical  step of ensuring that laws disadvantaging women and gender minorities  are subject to the most rigorous form of constitutional scrutiny.   In recent years, we have seen a series of breakthroughs for women's  rights and gender equality. We have seen millions of women march in  support of their rights and dignity as equal citizens. Through the  #MeToo movement, we have had long-overdue and sometimes painful  conversations about the violence and harassment that women and gender  minorities experience, whether in the workplace, at home, or in schools  and universities.   We have seen women get elected to Congress in record numbers. And  just weeks ago, Virginia became the necessary 38th and the last  necessary State to ratify the equal rights amendment. We are on the  brink of making history, and no deadline should stand in the way.   The Constitution itself places no deadlines on the process for  ratifying constitutional amendments, making it doubtful whether  Congress had the authority to impose such a deadline in the first  place. But if it had such authority, then Congress clearly also has the  authority to remove any deadline that it previously chose to set.   I want to thank Representative Jackie Speier for introducing this  resolution, which takes that important step. This resolution will  ensure, at long last, the equal rights amendment, having been proposed  by Congress years ago, having now been ratified by three-quarters of  the States, can take its rightful place as part of our Nation's  Constitution.   I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier), the chief sponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, again, the deadline was not part of the  amendment. It was a resolution by Congress. And if Congress can set a  deadline, it can remove a deadline.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  distinguished majority leader of the House.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)                                time  0930     Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Madam Speaker, I would remind everyone that the equal  rights amendment simply says: Equality of rights under the law shall  not be denied on account of sex.   If people on the other side want to admit that equality of rights  under the law means there must be a constitutional right to abortion,  well, that is wonderful. Of course, the constitutional right to  abortion is already established under current law.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from the State of Virginia (Mr. Beyer), who is from the 38th  State.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).    Madam Speaker. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case).    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Once again, if Congress can enact a resolution putting a time limit,  it can enact a resolution removing a time limit. And when the Senate  passes this resolution, the ERA will be part of the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
