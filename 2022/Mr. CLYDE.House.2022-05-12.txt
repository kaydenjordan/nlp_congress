 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2022  Georgia High School Association 5A State champions, the Johnson Knights  boys soccer team.   Last week, the Knights appeared in their fifth finals since 2014 and  earned their second State championship.   After having a player sustain an injury that took him out of the  game, and then trailing behind in the second half, the Knights focused  on the remaining time they had and turned the game around.  [[Page H4865]]    Fueled by adrenaline and filled with talent, these determined young  men, led by Coach Frank Zamora, ultimately went on to defeat the St.  Pius Golden Lions, boasting a final score of 4-2.   Congratulations to the Johnson High School boys soccer team on an  impressive win and another exciting State championship title.                      Honoring Law Enforcement Officers     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor our brave men and  women in blue.   Our Nation is blessed with heroic law enforcement officers who pursue  a thankless career dedicated to maintaining law and order, keeping our  communities safe, and answering the call when criminals strike.   Law enforcement officers are heroes in our communities. They are the  heroes that are desperately needed, but they don't often receive the  recognition that they deserve.   This week, National Police Week, we honor our local, State, and  Federal law enforcement officers. As far as I am concerned, every week  should be National Police Week. These men and women always deserve  gratitude for their service and sacrifice.   Yet, law enforcement officers nationwide are facing increasingly  challenging conditions, forcing many to leave the force and causing  others to avoid it altogether, leaving police departments across the  country struggling to keep staff and fill vacant positions.   The horrendous conditions that are generating the low morale are  skyrocketing crime rates, rising attacks on law enforcement, and  growing calls from the left to advance soft-on-crime agendas.                                time  1015    In fact, last year alone, a record breaking 73 police officers were  tragically killed in the line of duty. As of this month, 123 have  already been shot in 2022, including 19 murdered by criminals.   Unfortunately, in Georgia's Ninth District they know horrific reality  all too well. Back in November of last year, my home county, Jackson  County, lost both a mother and a heroic law enforcement officer, Deputy  Lena Marshall. After responding to a domestic call that escalated to a  violent shootout, Deputy Marshall's life was taken while serving to  keep Georgians safe.   Make no mistake, this attack--and any attack of criminal violence  toward law enforcement--is an assault on justice.   Despite the radical left's persistent efforts to disarm, demonize,  and defund the police, policies that weaken law enforcement simply  empower criminals, worsening the ongoing crime crisis.   In contrast, I remain dedicated to providing our law enforcement  officers with the community support, the resources, and the political  backing needed to address surging crime across the country.   Undermining the authority of the heroes that protect and serve is  despicable, which is why we continue the fight to ensure that all law  enforcement officers are fully equipped in their mission to keep our  community safe.   May God bless all the men and women in blue who willingly put their  lives on the line for ours, and may we honor all of the fallen officers  who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. May God bless all  of the loved ones of current, fallen, and future law enforcement  officers who provide tremendous support both on and off duty.   We thank you and we honor you for your selfless service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I object.    Americans are blessed to have brave men and women  protecting our precious freedoms, including the more than 400,000  members of the National Guard. These servicemembers selflessly put  their lives on the line in defense of our Nation. Today and every day,  we honor their service and sacrifice.   Guard members serve a unique mission, safeguarding our country as a  whole and protecting the individual States that make up our Nation,  including my home State of Georgia.   From assisting at COVID-19 testing sites, to maintaining law and  order during violent demonstrations, to helping out during extreme  weather emergencies, the Georgia guardsmen always answer the call to  serve.   This service regularly extends beyond the Peach State such as at the  southern border, where there are over 100 Georgia National Guard troops  assisting Border Patrol agents in handling President Biden's out-of- control border crisis.   Additionally, Georgia currently has combat forces at all six  geographic combatant commands, serving our great State and our Nation  around the world.   In fact, members of the Georgia Air National Guard's 165th Airlift  Wing were deployed to Europe in response to Russia's unlawful invasion  of Ukraine. Georgians are tremendously thankful for their service in  this vital mission, and we continue to pray for their safety overseas.   Our Nation is forever grateful for all the past, the current, and the  future men of the National Guard, and we thank you for your duty to our  Nation and dedication to our freedoms.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Perry for leading the House  Freedom Caucus and for leading this Special Order.   The Declaration of Independence--what an incredible document that  was--that was truly the birth certificate, I believe, of our Nation. It  was the promise, I would call it, and the Constitution was the  fulfillment of that promise.   In the Declaration of Independence, it says--and you have heard this  mentioned tonight, but I echo it: ``We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''   The very first among those unalienable rights is life. ``That to  secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.''   So who is responsible for securing that right of life? Well, that is  the government--``deriving their just powers from the consent of the  governed.'' That is us. That is the American people. That is who  consents to the government.   That right of life is endowed by our Creator--by God. God gives you a  right. Who can take it away? I don't think anyone can take it away. Our  Declaration recognizes that some people will try, and so our government  is supposed to protect that right.   I am so thankful that our Supreme Court, which is one of our coequal  branches of government, that they actually stood up after 49 years to  defend that right to life.   I echo my friend, Congressman Jody Hice from the great State of  Georgia--Georgia's 10th District, just a little bit below mine--I echo  his sentiments in thanking the Justices that stood for life: Justice  Samuel Alito, who actually had to be moved from his residence because  of the threats; Justice Clarence Thomas; Neil Gorsuch; Brett Kavanaugh;  and Amy Coney Barrett.   I think we as a nation should be telling these Justices: Thank you,  thank you, and thank you. How many millions more lives will be saved  because of this decision that--though it is not final--we believe will  be final and will come out in a month? We need to encourage them for  standing up and defending life.   I think that is so very important because what we have seen so far  has been absolutely despicable when it comes from the radical left and  their threats to the Supreme Court.   There is a reason that the Supreme Court Justices are confirmed for  life on the bench, and that is so they are not intimidated. Here we  have someone in the Supreme Court that leaked a draft decision with  what I believe was the intent to intimidate, so maybe one of those  Justices would change their mind. I am praying that they don't. From  what we see, they will not. Thank God for that.
