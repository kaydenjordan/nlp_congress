 Mr. Speaker, today, the Sun will set in Washington, D.C.,  at 4:47 p.m. Washington is known as a partisan place and labeled the  capital of gridlock. However, there is one issue most Members of  Congress agree on: Making daylight savings time permanent.   Earlier this year, Senator Marco Rubio introduced this legislation to  help boost economic activity and improve physical and mental health.  The bill passed the U.S. Senate unanimously.   My colleague, Vern Buchanan from Florida, introduced companion  legislation in this Chamber that also has strong bipartisan support.  Unfortunately, however, it has never been reported out of committee.   Today, I initiated a discharge petition to bring this legislation up  for immediate consideration. In the last 5 years, 19 States have  enacted similar legislation. The time to make daylight savings time  permanent is now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sign this discharge petition and  never reset your clocks again.                            ____________________
