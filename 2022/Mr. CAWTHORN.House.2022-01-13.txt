 Madam Speaker, I was raised with one brother. But I  truly felt like I had dozens and dozens of siblings. You see, my  cousins and I grew up a little differently than most families. We had a  patriarch of our family who made sure that multiple times a year we all  got together for a big hoorah. Fourth of July, kids' week, Christmas,  many of my favorite memories in my entire life stem from the times we  all gathered at the mountain house. Wayne Smith, my great uncle, taught  us, the way to be truly wealthy was to have a strong family.   Pappaw passed away on January 10. He was about to celebrate 63 years  of marriage. He was able to touch people's souls with the way he  talked. He would skip classes in high school so that he could work, yet  still managed to be one of the wisest men I have ever known.   He taught all of his grandsons how to drive a stick shift in a pickup  truck he had since 1993. He made a bet with his son to quit smoking and  held up his end of the bargain for 43 years.   He was the original grill master in our family. He drank his coffee  black or didn't drink it at all.   I am very proud to say that he got to see the Braves win the World  Series last season.  [[Page H83]]    Pappaw, we all love you so much. Thank you for imparting so much  wisdom in our lives. Thank you for making sure we all grew up with  endless cousins who are truly brothers and sisters now.   Go Braves, and rest in peace, Wayne Calvin Smith.                            ____________________
