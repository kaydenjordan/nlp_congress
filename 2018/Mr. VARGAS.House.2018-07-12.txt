 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support my amendment to H.R. 6237.   By adding the use of virtual currencies to section 1505, we will  ensure it is included in the assessment of threat financing related to  Russia.   This assessment includes officials of the government of Russia,  persons subject to sanctions with respect to Russia, Russian nationals  subject to sanction, and Russian oligarchs or organized criminals.   Mr. Chairman, as you may know, a virtual currency is a digital  representation of value that can be digitally traded.   Since the creation of Bitcoin, the first and most widely known  example of a cryptocurrency, thousands of cryptocurrencies have emerged  that are designed to serve a variety of purposes.   Just as virtual currencies have grown in use in legitimate commerce,  they have become an increasingly popular financial payment method for  criminals and other transnational bad actors.   Virtual currencies have been and continue to be exploited to pay for  goods and services associated with illicit activities and as an  effective tool to launder money or avoid sanctions.   If we are to craft effective solutions to combat Russia's threat  finance, we need to fully understand how virtual currencies may be used  to finance activities against the United States and our allies,  especially NATO. By including the use of virtual currencies in the  report, we will ensure a robust analysis that will help us to impede  Russian financing of cyber operations.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Murphy).    Mr. Chairman, I would simply then urge my colleagues to  support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
