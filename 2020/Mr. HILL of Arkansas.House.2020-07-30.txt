 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my longtime  friend, Eddie Drilling, who recently announced that he will be retiring  later this year after a 41-year career with AT&T.   Eddie currently serves as the senior vice president for External and  Regulatory Affairs at AT&T, where he leads the national regulatory  organization. His ties to Arkansas remain strong. He currently serves  the University of Arkansas Board of Advisors, the Sam Walton College of  Business Dean's Executive Advisory Board, and the Razorback Foundation  Board.   Eddie has been a leader in Arkansas for four decades, and a member  and mentor of many organizations. He received the Pinnacle Award from  the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce, the highest award our  chamber gives for service to the community. He also received the  Lifetime of Service Award from the city of Little Rock.   Mr. Speaker, I join all Arkansans in congratulating Eddie Drilling.       Recognizing Ken Reeves on his Retirement from the Game and Fish                                 Commission     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ken  Reeves' outstanding contributions to conservation in Arkansas and his  dedication at keeping Arkansas the ``Natural State.'' Ken served on the  Game and Fish Commission as chairman for 5 years.   He grew up in Harrison, Arkansas, where he attended Harrison High  School and went to the University of Arkansas School of Law. Ken's love  of fishing and passion for conserving wildlife from a young age made  him an easy and successful appointment to the commission.   Ken has demonstrated his passion for making a positive change as the  chairman of the commission. He is leaving behind a legacy of improved  outdoor services that will be enjoyed for generations to come.   My congratulations to Ken Reeves.                  Jerry Evans--Outstanding Coach of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jerry  Evans for being named one of Arkansas' Outstanding Coaches of the Year.   This year, Coach Evans led the Searcy High School Girls Wrestling  Team to victory as the girls Arkansas State champions, also picking up  two individual championships on the team.   In 2019, he was the 5A Wrestling Coach of the Year for the Arkansas  Wrestling Coaches Association, and was chosen by the Arkansas Democrat- Gazette as the All Arkansas Preps Wrestling Coach of the Year, and  named the Arkansas High School Coaches Association Wrestling Coach of  the Year through the Arkansas Activities Association.   Coach Evans received his master's in kinesiology at Harding  University in Searcy, graduating as the first member of his immediate  family to earn a college degree. In an interview with the Arkansas  Democrat-Gazette, Coach Evans said, ``I knew I wanted to be a coach  ever since I was in 8th grade. I knew I wanted to be in education and  become a teacher.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank Coach Evans for his commitment to his students  and his leadership as their coach.                  Guy-Perkins PTA Purchasing School Supplies     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Parent Teacher Association at the Guy-Perkins School District for once  again providing students with school supplies for the upcoming academic  year. All students in grades K-12 will have school supplies provided to  them, regardless of whether students have chosen on-campus instruction  or distance learning for this fall.   As parents, teachers, students and educators begin a uniquely  challenging school year, the PTA's long tradition will help parents  with back-to-school costs and ensure that our teachers do not have to  purchase their own supplies.   According to Betty Vickers, Guy-Perkins PTA's secretary and  treasurer, the initiative helps boost the community's economy because  all the supplies are purchased locally. I am happy this wonderful  tradition has continued into the 2020-2021 school year, especially  during these extraordinary times where educating our kids presents  unique challenges.                   Jennifer Carnahan Receives Service Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jennifer  Carnahan as CHI St. Vincent's recipient of the 2019 Sister Teresa  Joseph Babcock Service Excellence Award.   Jennifer was born in Dumas, Arkansas, and received her nursing degree  from the University of Houston before attending the Academy of Health  Care Professionals for surgical technology.   Jennifer has been serving in the medical field since she was 19 years  old, starting in the ER, and she currently works in neurosurgery.  Sister Teresa Joseph worked at CHI St. Vincent for nearly 30 years,  exemplifying St. Vincent's core values of reverence, integrity,  compassion, and excellence. Jennifer currently works in the neurology  area in the North Campus.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jennifer Carnahan.                            ____________________
