 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1799, the PPP  Extension Act of 2021.   This targeted, bipartisan 60-day Paycheck Protection Program  extension is exactly the type of relief that Congress should be focused  on providing. This bill contrasts sharply with the nearly $2 trillion  partisan monstrosity of progressive wish list policies this body passed  just a week ago.   With optimism on the vaccine front, Governors around the country  finally loosening their arbitrary restrictions on small businesses and  schools, and $1 trillion from previous relief measures still unspent,  this bill is a responsible and appropriate way to ensure relief reaches  our small businesses that are most in need. Our small businesses must  have the tools necessary to compete and contribute to our local  economies as we move past this pandemic.
