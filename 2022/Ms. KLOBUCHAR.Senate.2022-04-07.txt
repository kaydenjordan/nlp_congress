 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Albert  Lea Fire Lieutenant Brett Thomas Boss, who passed away on February 5,  2022, at the age of 38 after a decade-long battle with stage 4 Ewing's  Sarcoma.   Brett was born to Karen Boss on November 30, 1983, in Fargo, ND, and  was later adopted by Todd Boss in 1992. From a young age, he  demonstrated a clear drive to help others. In high  [[Page S2088]]  school, he participated in the local Fire Explorers program, which gave  him both the skills to save lives in his community and a dedication to  public service that guided his entire life.   Brett's 17-year firefighting career was nothing short of  extraordinary. As an EMT, a hazmat technician, a fire investigator, and  a firefighter instructor, he worked every day to keep the people of  Albert Lea safe. Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Laskowske put it best: Brett  was a true hero.   Brett's heroism only became clearer following his diagnosis. In the  words of his loving family, he ``fought cancer like a boss.'' But Brett  didn't just fight for himself; following an alarming string of cancer  cases among firefighters in Albert Lea and Austin, he became a fierce  advocate for his brothers and sisters in the field. He played a key  role in passing State legislation that secured funding for equipment to  keep firefighters safe from carcinogens as well as a grant program for  firefighters living with cancer or heart disease. In 2018, we held an  event together in support of legislation to create a national  firefighter cancer registry, and days later, the President signed it  into law. Brett also collaborated with the Firefighter Cancer Support  Network, a group of firefighters that worked to provide resources,  support, and education to first responders in need.   While Brett had a lot to be proud of in his career, he was even  prouder of his family. He married his wife Danielle in 2006, and they  went on to have two great kids, Jaelyn and Aiden. Brett could often be  found cheering them on from the sidelines of sporting events or sharing  with them his love of camping and fishing.   While it is hard not to feel like Brett's life was cut short, his  legacy as an incredible firefighter, advocate, son, husband, and dad  will last forever. He changed lives; he saved lives; and he made the  world a better place.                            ____________________
