 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memories of  Michigan's 13th District Strong mother, friend, sister, and community  advocate, La'Shon Marshall; her partner, Aaron Benson; and her 5-year- old son, Caleb, all of whom we lost to senseless gun violence this past  week.   I knew La'Shon Marshall as a loving mother, a daughter, and a friend,  but I knew her also as a constituent and as part of a group called  RESULTS. It is an antipoverty advocacy organization, and RESULTS would  meet with me every year to talk about adjusting poverty and access to  quality housing for our families.   In one of my first meetings, I met La'Shon, and she was passionate.  She talked about renters' rights. She talked about access to safe  housing. We made an instant connection based on our mutual passions:  housing stability, ending childhood poverty, and ensuring a better  quality of life for all.   Hearing of her murder was devastating not only to my team and me but  to our community. This is a tragedy that no community should endure.   La'Shon was truly a beacon of light. She will be remembered as an  incredible mother, and we will always remember Caleb as the light of  her life. She truly loved him. And I will always remember knowing her  as an exceptional advocate for the 13th District Strong.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in remembering La'Shon Marshall, Caleb  Marshall, and Aaron Benson of our community as we mourn their loss.            Mourning the Loss of Terrance Armour and Carly Taylor     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my outrage and deep  sadness about the deaths of Wayne County teens Terrance Armour and  Carly Taylor, whose lives were lost to gun violence last year.   Carlesa and Terrance were accomplished high school students with  bright futures ahead of them. Terrance had plans to attend college in  Nevada. Carly was a standout on the Ecorse High School basketball team  who was being recruited for college athletic scholarships and  opportunities.   This past weekend, I hugged both of their mothers, and I remember the  tears from Dionne Weathers and Tikia Armour-Brooks. There is a saying  that the most painful good-byes are the ones that are never said and  never explained.   As we mark this grim anniversary, I offer my deepest sympathies to  Terrance and Carlesa's families and loved ones and commit to stopping  gun violence in our country. And as they continue to mourn their loss,  I want them to know we are working on behalf of them and also in honor  of their memories.                     Supporting the Honoring Our PACT Act     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak today in support of the  Honoring Our PACT Act.   Our soldiers put their lives at risk every day and became severely  ill as a result of burn pit exposure. We owe it to them to care for  them in their time of need. I am voting ``yes'' on the PACT Act because  they deserve nothing less.   I greatly appreciate the work of Chairman Takano, the members of the  committee, and the staff in getting this task done. It was not easy.  However, I must be clear. While this bill is clearly the best attempt  yet to pay our Nation's debt to our sick and dying veterans, it is only  a first step. It does not cover all the illnesses believed to be caused  by burn pit exposure, and it does not fully invest in new, innovative  treatments that could drastically improve their quality of life and  recovery chances.   To hear some of my colleagues, including many who happily vote for  every absurd defense budget without a blink of an eye, complain about  the cost of treating our veterans is downright insulting. It is time  for Congress to do its job and care for our veterans.   Let's start by passing the Honoring Our PACT Act and then immediately  get back to work on new legislation that comprehensively covers any  veteran who has become ill as a result of exposure to toxins during  their service to our country.
