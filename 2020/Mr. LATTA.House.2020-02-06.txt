 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican leader of the Energy  and Commerce Committee for yielding.   I rise in opposition to H. Res. 826. This resolution is solely a  political talking point. The administration's proposal does not harm  Medicaid. I applaud the Trump administration for moving in the right  direction. Block grants give States the flexibility to invest in their  citizens' best interests, while spending an estimated $1.4 trillion  over the next 10 years. That is trillion.   It is plain and simple. Children, seniors, and individuals with  disabilities will not be negatively affected by this option, and those  in low-income communities will be greatly benefited.   Additionally, CHIP and many of the other Medicaid demonstrations are  currently running under similar structures.   As earlier stated by the Republican leader, States do know what is  best for their residents. By giving States the options to voluntarily  participate in this program and to share in the Federal savings, it is  a win. This resolution is simply a Democrat health scare tactic, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to oppose H. Res. 826.
