 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and honor the  life and legacy of former Congressman Bob Smith. An Oregon native--born  in Portland and raised in Burns--he had a deep understanding of what it  meant to be an Oregonian and he knew the needs of the surrounding  communities, especially the rural part of our State.   He went to Willamette University in Salem and received a degree in  agriculture. He would go on to put that degree to work on his own  ranch.   In 1960, Bob's career as a public servant began when he was elected  to the Oregon House of Representatives. He served in the State house  until 1972. He was speaker of the Oregon House during the 1969 and 1971  sessions.   I remember as a 13-year-old youngster going with my father, whom they  were recruiting to run for the legislature, down to Salem to see Bob  Smith and the speaker of the house. I was about this tall. I looked up,  and here was this giant of a man. He was a giant of a man in Oregon  politics, but a very kind soul.   He then served in the State senate from 1973 to 1982. When Oregon got  its fifth congressional seat, he ran for that and was elected. He  actually ran 31 different times for election and never lost a single  one.   In the State house, Bob passed a number of pieces of legislation. He  always stood up for farmers and ranchers in eastern Oregon and for  lower taxes. He led the effort in the Congress to pass a balanced  budget amendment. In the State senate, he actually helped pass the  kicker law, which said when Oregon collects more tax revenue than  anticipated, that goes back to the taxpayer. That went into the  constitution eventually.   Bob went on to serve here, as I said, for 14 years, from 1983 to  1995, and then came back to chair the Agriculture Committee when he  returned from 1997 to 1999.   I am joined here on the floor today by a colleague from Oklahoma (Mr.  Lucas), who served with Chairman Smith on the Agriculture Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma.   Mr. Speaker, Bob did live life to the fullest in every measure. And  when he and Kaye and Matt and Tiffany and Chris all lived back here,  they had a farm outside in Virginia, and then he would commute to  Oregon. But on weekends when he was here, he and then-Commerce  Secretary Mac Baldrige would rodeo. They would go out and rope and  participate in rodeos around, and here you had a sitting Member of  Congress and the Secretary of Commerce out in the rodeo grounds.   Mr. Speaker, Bob lived a life big and bold. And ``free man,'' like  his middle name, he believed in freedom. He believed in freedom in  America. He stood up for eastern Oregon and for our farmers and  ranchers and our communities.   Those of us who fly in and out of central Oregon owe a big thank-you  to him as well since he used his ability in this body to get us a tower  there so we could have real flights in and out of central Oregon, and  improved, certainly, the interchange of I-5 and Highway 62.   Mr. Speaker, Bob did so much for our State. He stood strong for our  country. He believed in freedom. He was a dear friend.   And to Kaye and to Matt and Chris and Tiffany and the whole Smith  family, we extend our deepest condolences. What a life well-lived, a  public service career that will be tough for anybody to ever top.                            ____________________
