 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Religious Freedom Day, which was celebrated last week on  January 16.   Religious Freedom Day commemorates the Virginia General Assembly's  adoption of Thomas Jefferson's landmark Virginia Statute for Religious  Freedom on January 16, 1786. The statute became the basis for the First  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and led to freedom of religion for  all Americans.   We are blessed to live in a country where a person is able to  practice whatever religion they so choose without fear of persecution  from government.  [[Page H268]]    The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, along with the  freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. This assurance of  freedom gives us all the opportunity to openly practice and speak our  beliefs and allows me to speak on the House floor right now.   The United States is a place where all faiths can be peacefully  practiced, free from fear of persecution. The very foundation of our  Nation, a place of freedom and liberty for all, was conceived by  individuals in search of religious freedom.   Mr. Speaker, the United States of America will always be a beacon of  light in the world, and we will always protect our fundamental, unified  commitment of religious freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Minnesota for her leadership with this incredibly important  Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight during this Special Order to reaffirm my  commitment to protect and defend the sanctity of life.   From the moment I stepped foot into this Chamber in 2009, I cemented  my promise to protect our most vulnerable, the unborn.   Our Founders enshrined in the Declaration of Independence three  inalienable rights. The first is the right to life.   Tonight, we celebrate the right to life. Last year, the Supreme Court  made it clear, determining the right to an abortion is the  responsibility of the State, through the people and their elected  officials.   Mr. Speaker, life matters. Friday marked the first March for Life  since the end of Roe v. Wade. Tens of thousands convened in Washington  to celebrate the change from a national culture of death to one of  life.   The evidence that life matters goes well beyond the Supreme Court,  however, and the Supreme Court ruling that was finally delivered in  2022, shifting the defense of the innocent unborn to 50 State capitols.    Here is the evidence of why we should also celebrate, in addition to  that ruling. In the United States, there are 2,500 pregnancy resource  centers that support unborn babies and their parents. There are only  800 abortion clinics in this Nation. That is an amazing shift in  numbers. Of the practicing OB/GYN doctors, 90 percent do not perform  abortions.   God bless the pregnancy resource center staff that educate,  encourage, and empower men and women to make informed life choices  based on Christian principles and values, their trained client  advocates and medical personnel, including registered nurses, certified  phlebotomy technicians, and registered diagnostic medical sonographers.   Mr. Speaker, my position on life has always been clear. You can't be  a champion for the future of this great country if you are going to  limit its potential. It is my strong belief that every child, every  human life, is sacred and has a purpose in this world.
