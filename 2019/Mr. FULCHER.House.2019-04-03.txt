 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and I ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot be  entertained, I urge that the Speaker and the majority leader  immediately schedule the born-alive bill so that we can stand up for  the sanctity of human life.
