 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask and highlight which  Americans will see their taxes go up every April 15 under the  Republican tax scam. Middle class families, teachers, firefighters,  nurses, veterans, folks paying off student loans, seniors with medical  expenses, small businesses, and every homeowner will pay more in taxes.  Over 50 million Americans will see their taxes go up every April 15.   Both students and teachers are hurt by this tax scam. This tax scam  will make it harder for teachers to afford supplies for their  classrooms. The Republican tax scam eliminates medical expense  deductions. The adoption tax credit goes away. Student loan deductions,  gone. State and local tax deductions for homeowners, forget about it.  This tax scam is just wrong.   Mr. Speaker, it hurts hardworking American families and it benefits  the largest corporations.                            ____________________
