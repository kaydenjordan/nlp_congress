 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4258) to promote the development of local strategies to  coordinate use of assistance under sections 8 and 9 of the United  States Housing Act of 1937 with public and private resources, to enable  eligible families to achieve economic independence and self- sufficiency, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4258         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4258, the Family Self- Sufficiency Act. This legislation will streamline a program designed to  help those unable to purchase a home while reducing their dependency on  welfare assistance and rental assistance provided by the government.   I want to thank my colleague and friend from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver)  for all of his bipartisan and helpful work on this legislation. It  passed out of our committee 58-0, which is somewhat historic for the  Financial Services Committee.   Now, the Family Self-Sufficiency Act, or FSS program, is focused on  helping families in public housing and the housing choice voucher  program. The goal is to utilize a number of services coordinated  through the program to help families with individual training to  increase their employability and become less dependent on assistance.   These services can include basic education, childcare,  transportation, education, financial literacy, mental health referrals,  and homeownership counseling. While receiving services, an interest- bearing escrow account is established for the family that can be used  for any purpose once the family has graduated from the program.   Currently, HUD operates one program for families served by the  housing choice voucher program and a separate program for those  families served by the public housing program. This legislation will  combine those two separate FSS programs into one to streamline and  reduce regulatory burdens.   The bill also broadens the scope of supportive services that may be  offered to these families to include attainment of a GED, education in  pursuit of a postsecondary degree or certification, and--I think this  is important--training in financial literacy. Lastly, H.R. 4258 opens  the FSS program to families that live in privately owned properties  that are subsidized by project-based rental assistance.   Mr. Speaker, 4,793 families have successfully completed the program,  with 1,557 graduates exiting rental assistance, within a year and  another 606 graduates that eventually went on and were able to purchase  a home. So more than 10 percent of the people who graduate from the  program go on to buy a home.   I want to leave you with just a quick anecdote on written testimony  that came to our committee from the Compass Working Capital Group. It  is a story about Tanya. She graduated from the FSS program in Lynn,  Massachusetts.   Now, when Tanya enrolled in the FSS program, she had been receiving  housing assistance for about 4 years. She was working full-time and  raising two children, but she had bigger dreams. One of those dreams  was to one day own a house. At the time, Tanya believed that owning a  home was, in her words, ``not for families like mine,'' a low-income  single mother who came from a family where no one has ever owned a  home.   So when Tanya graduated from the program, she got the assistance, got  the counseling, and in the end, she was able to increase her annual  income by $8,000, improve her credit score 140 points, pay down her  debt, and save $3,000. She graduated from the program in 2015 and  achieved her dream of becoming a homeowner, the first person in her  family to do so.   She said: But what makes me happiest of all is seeing my children  love their new home. Thanks to the Compass FSS program, now I, too,  believe that families like mine can get ahead, live better, and  accomplish our big dreams and goals such as buying a home.   This is a remarkable story of a program that actually works, that  helps people get from public assistance into self-sufficiency and  hopefully into homeownership.   I think it is this kind of artful review of policy that our committee  has done on a bipartisan level that brings us to reforms that can look  at the successes of a program and build upon those successes and make  them work for more families.   Again, I want to thank my colleagues and friends across the aisle for  working on this legislation and, again, bringing it out with such a  bipartisan vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to briefly say in closing that we oftentimes find  people who get stuck in a cycle of poverty. I think the goal of the  program should be to help people get out of poverty and get to self- sufficiency.                                time  1630    If you look at this program, it takes an initiative by the person in  FSS to say: I am going to raise my hand; I want to take advantage of  these opportunities. It is about helping them get an education.   I have 8 kids, and I have a wife. For a single mom with a couple of  kids who is trying to go to school or do job training or get a job,  without some help on child care, that can't work. You can't make that  happen. That is offered in this program.   Again, it offers additional education, financial literacy training,  and counseling on home ownership. If you have some mental health  issues, you can get training in that.   It is what is right about government, in the sense we don't want  people to get stuck. We don't want people to get caught in a cycle of  poverty, we want to help lift them up, and it is this kind of a program  with these kinds of reforms that I think we have worked together on  that accomplishes that goal: help people live the American Dream, which  is get a job that allows them to eventually save enough money and buy a  house. On the escrow part of this, when you get out of the program, you  might have a small, little nest egg that you can use as a deposit for  that home.   So I think this is a great program that does the right thing. If you  are a Liberal or a Conservative, no matter what side of the political  spectrum you sit on, this program is making the government work for  people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 770) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in  recognition of American innovation and significant innovation and  pioneering efforts of individuals or groups from each of the 50 States,  the District of Columbia, and the United States territories, to promote  the importance of innovation in the United States, the District of  Columbia, and the United States territories, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 770, the American  Innovation $1 Coin Act, introduced by my friend from Connecticut (Mr.  Himes). The legislation seeks to honor that which is best about  America: her innovative spirit.   If enacted, the legislation would authorize a program under which the  Treasury Department's United States Mint would produce a series of $1  coins celebrating the innovative capacity of the United States. By the  way, it is that innovative capacity that makes us so great and  competitive and allows our salaries and incomes to rise.   Under the program, the front of the coins would have the standardized  image symbolic of liberty, and the design on the reverse would be an  image or images emblematic of one of a significant innovation, an  innovator or pioneer, or a group of innovators or pioneers.   Four different reverse images would be issued annually, representing  innovations or innovators from each State, territory, or the District  of Columbia. The order of issue would be strictly alphabetical. That  means the first issue would go to the great State of Alabama.   The number of coins of each design would be determined by the  Treasury Secretary. While the coins technically would be circulating  coins and usable in ordinary commerce, there is no real demand for  circulating $1 coins at present. So the demand would strictly be  determined by collector interest.   The program would be produced at no cost to the taxpayer. I think  that is important. Mr. Himes made sure of that. Depending on the  collector demand, it actually might produce a surplus that would then  be returned to the Treasury's General Fund.   The legislation explicitly states that minting of the innovation  coins would in no way interfere with the minting and issuing of the $1  coins honoring Native Americans. Those coins similarly have a  standardized front design  [[Page H183]]  and a reverse design that changes regularly, honoring the great  contributions that have been made to this country by Native Americans.   So, Mr. Speaker, the Presidential dollar, when produced for  collectors, had a demand of a little more than 5 million coins per  design. That seems to indicate enough interest that would and should  approve this program, as it can proceed at no cost to the taxpayer,  while allowing the Mint to fully use its facilities. The language we  are considering contains some minor technical amendments that will  allow the coin production to begin more swiftly, which I think makes  sense.   I think this is a good bill, and Mr. Himes has kind of thought  through any red flags that could be risen by any Member on the floor.  He has addressed those.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I think it is important to note that we are using  the capacity of the Mint, which costs no additional money. But as Mr.  Himes pointed out, we are celebrating innovation. As a country, we  continue to innovate and create in a way that no one else does in the  world. It is that innovation and creation that creates more and better  jobs for our society, our community, and our families. So I think it is  a wonderful idea to celebrate that by way of a coin that costs the  taxpayers no money but celebrates this great American trade.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4279) to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise  any rules necessary to enable closed-end companies to use the  securities offering and proxy rules that are available to other issuers  of securities, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4279         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Investment       Opportunities Act''.       SEC. 2. PARITY FOR CLOSED-END COMPANIES REGARDING OFFERING                     AND PROXY RULES.         (a) Revision to Rules.--Not later than the end of the 180       period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the       Securities and Exchange Commission shall propose and, not       later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act,       the Securities and Exchange Commission shall finalize any       rules, as appropriate, to allow any closed-end company, as       defined in section 5(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of       1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-5), that is registered as an investment       company under such Act, and is listed on a national       securities exchange or that makes periodic repurchase offers       pursuant to section 270.23c-3 of title 17, Code of Federal       Regulations, to use the securities offering and proxy rules,       subject to conditions the Commission determines appropriate,       that are available to other issuers that are required to file       reports under section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m; 78o(d)). Any action that       the Commission takes pursuant to this subsection shall       consider the availability of information to investors,       including what disclosures constitute adequate information to       be designated as a ``well-known seasoned issuer''.        (b) Treatment if Revisions Not Completed in a Timely       Manner.--If the Commission fails to complete the revisions       required by subsection (a) by the time required by such       subsection, any registered closed-end company that is listed       on a national securities exchange or that makes periodic       repurchase offers pursuant to section 270.23c-3 of title 17,       Code of Federal Regulations, shall be deemed to be an       eligible issuer under the final rule of the Commission titled       ``Securities Offering Reform'' (70 Fed. Reg. 44722; published       August 3, 2005).        (c) Rules of Construction.--        (1) No effect on rule 482.--Nothing in this section or the       amendments made by this section shall be construed to impair       or limit in any way a registered closed-end company from       using section 230.482 of title 17, Code of Federal       Regulations, to distribute sales material.        (2) References.--Any reference in this section to a section       of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or to any form or       schedule means such rule, section, form, or schedule, or any       successor to any such rule, section, form, or schedule.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within  [[Page H184]]  which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous  material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, closed-end funds are important retirement savings and  investment vehicles for retail investors and serve as a long-term  source of capital for operating companies, which helps promote job  creation, research and development, and economic growth.   Despite the many benefits of closed-end funds, the number of closed- end funds has been declining over the last several years.   Closed-end funds occupy a unique space within a framework of  regulated investment companies. They have opportunities to invest in  small enterprises and stocks and bonds that they may issue that would  not necessarily be ones that are open-ended or invested in by mutual  funds.   Since the SEC has adopted its 2005 offering reform for traditional  operating companies, the SEC has had more than 12 years to consider a  parallel framework for closed-end funds, but has failed to do so. H.R.  4279 would direct the SEC to draft rules as appropriate to permit  closed-end funds to take advantage of the 2005 offering reforms.   If the SEC does not finalize these rules within 1 year, closed-end  funds that otherwise meet the requirements could take advantage of the  2005 offering reforms until the SEC adopts a rule. By simplifying the  closed-end fund offering process and liberalizing existing restrictions  on communications, the legislation would reduce unnecessary regulatory  burdens that raise cost for investors. In turn, this would enhance the  ability of closed-end funds to act as a source of financing for the  economy.   I think this is a commonsense piece of legislation. I would also note  that, in a committee that often doesn't see a lot of bipartisanship,  this bill passed out of committee with a vote of 58-2, signifying broad  and wide support amongst the parties and from our committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this is a unique space where, oftentimes, we  would look to the SEC to actually act. Because they haven't acted, I am  proud to say I am part of a group in Congress that are willing to act  proactively to make sure, again, we are protecting investors,  protecting savers, but also helping capital flow into spaces that are  so needed by this reform.   Mr. Speaker, again, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
