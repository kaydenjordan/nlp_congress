 Mr. President, another giant has fallen. I rise today to  recognize the passing of James William Ratzlaff.   As a conservationist, an avid outdoorsman, a philanthropist, and,  most of all, a dear friend, Jim was one of Oregon's great civic  leaders. He passed away on August 26 at home on his beloved ranch  surrounded by love. Jim is survived by Jane, his loving wife of 54  years, and their children, Jim, Jr., and Susan, as well as Jim, Jr.'s  wife Leinani and her sons, Lowell and Larkin, and Susan's son, Marcus  James.   For decades, Jim and Jane have exemplified and renewed our sense of  what it means to be outstanding community leaders: patiently listening  and learning, actively seeking equitable solutions, and, above all,  leading by example.   Jim's legacy of good deeds extends far beyond mere philanthropy. He  threw himself headlong into the complex challenges facing communities  in and well beyond his home in Roseburg, OR. His abiding love for  nature and healthy watersheds always went hand-in-hand with his deep  concern for the well-being of our communities. Jim always believed and  worked to prove that community health, ecology, and economy are  inseparable and that, together, we can strengthen all three.   Jim's notable success in business served merely as a means to an end  much bigger than himself. Those that knew him well would agree that he  saw his good fortune as a blessing allowing him to expand his ability  to do good in the world. Always with humility, always with deference,  always true to his core values, Jim taught us once again how to lead by  example.   Jim and Jane moved to Oregon, to the beauty of Crane Creek Ranch, and  exercised their good fortune to make the world a better place. Through  his work with the Oregon Community Foundation and service on boards  across the Pacific Northwest--including Pacific Rivers Council, Wild  Salmon Center, the North Umpqua Foundation, Oregon Public Broadcasting,  and Mercy Medical Center--Jim was tireless in his efforts to maintain  healthy forests and rivers and to elevate the lives of those around  him.   Jim's great love of his family and the land stood as an inspiration  to everyone around him. While, yes, a giant has fallen, a forest will  rise in his place, growing from all those whose lives he has touched  with his love, friendship, generosity, wisdom, and lifelong commitment  to building a better future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the  Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Throughout its half century, this landmark  conservation law has played a critical role in maintaining the natural,  free-flowing qualities that make the country's wild and scenic rivers  so special.   The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed October 2, 1968, by President  Lyndon B. Johnson, has protected rivers across the United States for  recreation, salmon and fish habitat, important geology and cultural  values, and countless other important benefits. This bedrock  environmental law is especially important for Oregon where, in 1968,  the remarkable wild Rogue River received protection as part of the  first eight rivers protected by the Act.   Since then, Congress extended Wild and Scenic designations to many of  Oregon's most iconic rivers, including important segments of the  Chetco, the Deschutes, the Elk, the John Day, the Lostine, the Owyhee,  and over 50 other rivers and streams in every corner of my State. In  total, Oregon has more river segments designated than any other State  in the Union, with over 1,900 miles in the National Wild and Scenic  Rivers System.  [[Page S6354]]    A free-flowing, unencumbered river is truly a sight to behold, which  is why I am working now to add even more miles to Oregon's already  impressive list of Wild and Scenic rivers through passage of the Oregon  Wildlands Act. The Oregon Wildlands Act adds a total of nearly 200  miles, including many of the important tributaries to the Rogue River  and the Elk River--home to one of North America's healthiest salmon,  steelhead, and cutthroat trout populations along the Pacific Coast--and  the Molalla River, to name a few.   Over the last 50 years, Congress designated 209 units of the National  Wild and Scenic Rivers System, totaling nearly 12,600 miles of Wild and  Scenic rivers and streams in 40 States and Puerto Rico to protect and  provide remarkable habitat for endangered salmon and steelhead,  drinking water for millions of Americans, and recreation opportunities  for countless recreation enthusiasts who come from all over the world.   This is precisely what makes the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act so  important after all these years as a tool to protect, for this and  future generations, the very qualities that make America's and Oregon's  natural treasures so unique and wonderful.   As Henry David Thoreau noted in his book, ``A Week on the Concord and  Merrimack Rivers,'' ``He who hears the rippling of rivers in these  degenerate days will not utterly despair.'' Fifty years ago, the Wild  and Scenic Rivers Act started as a novel idea to protect and enhance  the Nation's waterways from pollution, dams, and construction that  could interrupt their free-flowing condition. By 2018, it has become a  remarkable success story deserving of celebration and commemoration.   As climate change and other environmental factors continue to  threaten the health of America's rivers, it is important to build on  the successes of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and continue to protect  rivers across the county. It is in our best interest to do so, and I  remain committed to continuing the legacy of the Wild and Scenic Rivers  Act and to work to further its protections throughout the Nation.                            ____________________
