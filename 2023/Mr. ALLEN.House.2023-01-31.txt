 Mr. Speaker, the pandemic is over. The President said so  himself. So why, then, are our friends on the other side of the aisle  fighting  [[Page H548]]  to keep in place an authoritarian mandate on our healthcare workers?   When the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued its  vaccine mandate in 2021, the emergency situation with respect to the  delta variant was cited as its justification. The problem isn't just  that the delta variant has come and gone, it is that we have an  administration that has made a habit out of violating Americans' basic  freedoms.   Our frontline workers were the heroes of the pandemic, but this  vaccine mandate robbed those very workers of the right to make medical  decisions for themselves.   All of the President's vaccine mandates are wrong. They have been  wrong from the start. Today, House Republicans will begin to set things  straight by prohibiting this administration from enforcing COVID  vaccine mandates on our healthcare providers.   During a time of workforce shortages, especially among healthcare  staff, no American should be forced to choose between the jab and the  job.
