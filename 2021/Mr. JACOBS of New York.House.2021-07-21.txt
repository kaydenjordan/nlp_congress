 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  18, the No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act. This bill would make the  Hyde amendment permanent and government-wide.   Mr. Speaker, Hyde saves lives. For more than 40 years, this amendment  has protected vulnerable, unborn life by preventing taxpayer dollars  from funding abortions. Named after Illinois Congressman Henry Hyde,  the Hyde amendment has enjoyed decades of broad, bipartisan support.   During this time the Charlotte Lozier Institute estimates the Hyde  amendment has saved over 2 million lives. I am proud to stand up for  vulnerable life. As the father of a beautiful two-year-old girl, I have  come to appreciate the sanctity of newborn life in a profound way. We  owe it to them, and to each other, to protect their lives in every way  possible.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
