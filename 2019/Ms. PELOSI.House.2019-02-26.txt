 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for the eloquent way that he has presented this legislation  to the floor of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to quote from the Constitution of the United  States. It begins with our statement of purpose of the Nation, with the  preamble.  [[Page H2140]]    ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect  Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.''                                time  1700    Immediately following that sacred purpose, it says: Article I, the  legislative branch.   Perhaps it is time for our country to have a values-based civics  lesson. I applaud our colleague, Congressman Castro, for his leadership  in ensuring that this House was ready to reassert our responsibility  under the Constitution and its systems of checks and balance.   In their wisdom, our Founders rejected the idea of a monarch. They  didn't want to live under that. They made that clear. They fought a War  of Independence to free themselves from that. Therefore, in their  wisdom, they put forth in this Constitution a heart, soul, and core of  it: the separation of powers, coequal branches of government to be a  check and balance on each other.   They saw the wisdom of that and then, of course, added the Bill of  Rights with further freedoms enumerated. But the core of the  Constitution is the separation of power.   Today, we are on this floor of the House, and our colleagues have  spoken eloquently about the reality or mythology of the crisis at the  border that the President contends. They have spoken eloquently about  the opportunity cost of the money that the President wants to use for  this ill-conceived wall and what it means to our national security.   But we in this House of Representatives, each one of us, and everyone  in public service in our country, takes an oath of office to support  and defend the Constitution of the United States. It is our oath. We  promise.   That Constitution is about the separation of powers that is being  usurped by the executive branch. We in the legislative branch cannot  let that happen.   In fact, I appeal to our Republican colleagues because I do believe  and trust that they are people of their word, and if they take an oath  to uphold the Constitution, they will honor it with their vote on the  floor today, in keeping, by the way, with, under the previous House  Speaker, our colleagues across the aisle placed a high priority on the  separation of powers and Congress' constitutional prerogatives.   The Republican A Better Way agenda, which they put forth in 2014,  read as follows: ``The people granted Congress the power to write laws,  raise revenues, and spend and borrow money on behalf of the United  States. There is no power more consequential. . . . Yet for decades,  Congress has let this power atrophy, thereby depriving the people of  their voice.''   Their Better Way goes on to say: ``The Founders insisted on a  separation of powers to protect our constitutional liberties.''   Their proposal goes on to say that James Madison ``warned that the  Constitution is a `mere parchment barrier' unless each branch asserted  its powers to keep the others in check.''   That is all in the Republican agenda for A Better Way of 2014, so you  would think it would be in keeping with their vote today.   In that spirit, then-Speaker Ryan often lamented that Congress  ``keeps forfeiting the game, yielding to the executive branch, giving  the President a blank check, not even bothering to read the fine print  in some cases.''   We are not going to give any President, Democratic or Republican, a  blank check to shred the Constitution of the United States. We would be  delinquent in our duties as Members of Congress if we did not overturn  what the President is proposing. He is asking each and every one of us  to turn our backs on the oath of office that we took to the  Constitution of the United States.   I do not believe that the Republicans want to do that. I don't think  it is consistent with what they had advocated in the near term and  historically.   Is your oath of office to Donald Trump, or is your oath of office to  the Constitution of the United States? You cannot let him undermine the  strength of your pledge to protect and defend the Constitution.   Again, our colleagues have talked about the opportunity cost of  taking money from our national security and spending it in this way.   I was at the border this weekend. We all have our stories and the  rest, but whatever you think about the wall, let's just put that aside  for the moment. Whatever you think about where you take the money from  and where you put it, which is substantial, put that aside for the  moment. The question is: What do you think about yourself, your  Congress, your conscience, and your oath of office? I trust that our  colleagues will be consistent in their beliefs and join us in honoring  the oath we all take to support.   The resolution is not about politics. It is not about partisanship.  It is about patriotism. It is about the Constitution of the United  States, which I hold in my hand here. George Washington on the cover of  this says: ``Its only keepers, the people.''   We in the people's House are the keepers of this Constitution. We in  the Congress are the keepers of this Constitution. We in this Congress  are in Article I, the Congress of the United States, spelled out very  clearly in the Constitution that the powers given to the legislative  branch are the power of the purse, the power to declare war, powers  enumerated very carefully by our Founders.   How can you ignore that? I urge strong bipartisan support of this  vital resolution to honor our oath to bear true faith and allegiance to  the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
