 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further  consideration of House Resolution 759, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 36 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order and pursuant to House Resolution 759,  the House adjourned until Monday, March 5, 2018, at noon for morning- hour debate, as a mark of respect to the memory of the late Billy  Graham.                            ____________________
