 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Koch  Enterprises, a fifth-generation Hoosier company, on its 150th  anniversary.   Founded in 1873 as a tin shop, the Evansville-based company now  employs more than 2,600 people in 13 States and four countries. The  George Koch Tin Shop stayed afloat in the early years by doing repairs  and manufacturing cookware, but soon, the business grew and  diversified. When George Koch died in 1903, his three sons took over  and renamed the business George Koch Sons. During World War II, the  company supported the war effort by building a new manufacturing  facility and fabricating parts for LST ships and aircraft wings and  engines. In 1999, the company reorganized to Koch Enterprises, Inc. The  organization currently has eight subsidiaries and is the ninth largest  private company in Indiana.   Koch Enterprises' core values include integrity, respect for people,  customer focus, continuous improvement, and community involvement.  Indeed, the Evansville area and the State of Indiana as a whole has  benefited from that spirit of community involvement. Koch employees are  encouraged to volunteer for local charities and have logged more than  20,000 hours annually in recent years. Additionally, company Chairman  Bob Koch has been a driving force behind the completion of Interstate  69 and helped establish Signature School, which is consistently ranked  as one of the top high schools in the country.   It is my honor to congratulate the Koch family, the company's  leadership, and the thousands of Koch employees who have contributed to  our State over the years.                            ____________________
