 Madam Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I rise today  in support of National Gun Violence Survivors Week.   Every year, over 36,000 Americans are killed in acts of gun violence,  and almost 100,000 more are shot and injured. This includes nearly  3,000 children and teens who are shot and killed and nearly 15,600 who  are shot and injured.   Firearms are the second leading cause of death for children and teens  and the first leading cause of death for African American children and  teens in the U.S.   Gun violence overly affects people of color. African Americans  represent most gun homicide victims and are 10 times more likely than  White Americans to die from gun violence.   Gun violence continues to bring agony every day to communities and  families around the country. While we cannot bring back the many loved  ones lost to gun violence, we must act to prevent more casualties. It  is past time for the Senate to act to save American lives.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to improve the  efficiency of the union election process. This amendment will reverse  an antiworker rule adopted by the National Labor Relations Board  several months after the PRO Act was marked up in the Education and  Labor Committee.   The PRO Act strengthens workers' rights to a free and fair union  representation election. It does so by preventing unnecessary delays.  If we allow these delays to occur, then we are allowing employers more  time to engage in antiunion campaigns designed to erode support for the  union.   Democracy in the workplace should be a right, not a fight, and the  workers who request a union representation election should not be  denied their right to vote through unnecessary delay.   In 2014, the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, updated its  union election procedures by enacting reasonable deadlines and  preventing employers from stalling elections through frivolous  litigation. The PRO Act codifies many of those requirements, including  the timelines for pre- and post-election hearings.  [[Page H915]]    The 2014 election rule protected the integrity of the union  representation process and was upheld in every court where it was  challenged. However, on December 18, 2019, the Trump NLRB rescinded  parts of the 2014 rule, burdening the employees with unnecessary delays  and giving employers more opportunity to stall a timely election with  frivolous litigation.   One important change in the 2014 election rule was that, once the  NLRB's regional director decides that a representation election should  be held, the director must ordinarily issue the notice of election at  the same time as that decision. The notice of election must be posted  in the workplace. It is crucial to informing employees of the time and  details of the voting process.   However, the Trump NLRB changed this policy to allow delay before the  regional director issues a notice which details the election. This  amendment removes the delay by requiring the decision directing an  election and the notice of an election to be issued at the same time,  unless extraordinary circumstances warrant otherwise.   In doing so, my amendment provides clarity to employees so that they  may know the details of their election as soon as possible.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Unnecessary delays in union representation elections enable employers  to have more time to campaign against unions through lawful or unlawful  means.   Once the NLRB determines that an election should go forward, the  details of the election must be settled expeditiously so employees  understand their rights as quickly as possible.   Employers engage in all kinds of tactics designed to scare employees  out of supporting the union, from holding captive audience meetings, to  issuing threats to specific employees.   Unnecessary delays only provide more time for employers to undermine  employees' free choice. The choice of whether to join a union belongs  to the employee. The PRO Act prevents employers from interfering with  employees' freedom of association.   Moreover, the provisions of my amendment apply except under  extraordinary circumstances.   When the NLRB created this rule initially in 2014, it found the  details of the election, included in the notice, would often be  resolved either in a pre-election hearing or in an agreement between  the union and the employer.   If there is still an issue with the details of the election after the  pre-election hearing, and at the time the regional director issues the  direction of election, these would count as ``extraordinary  circumstances.''   Minimizing these delays preserves employee free choice by ensuring  that their vote is untainted by employer interference.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Unions created the middle class in our country. And all of the things  that we enjoy, the safety that we have in our manufacturing, the 5-day  work week, all the opportunities that women have, and people of color,  all those came because unions stood up for these rights.   My amendment strengthens the opportunity for people to choose to  become a union.   I ask for an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
