 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2591, Modernizing the Pittman-Robertson Fund for Tomorrow's Needs  Act.   As a lifelong outdoorsman and current vice chairman of the  Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I am honored to be here today to  discuss this bipartisan legislation.   If enacted, H.R. 2591 would provide national, broad-based support to  State fish and wildlife agencies to develop, guide, and enhance  collective efforts to recruit new hunters and sportsmen, all while  continuing to protect our Nation's natural resources.   Through a system of user pay, public benefits, Pittman-Robertson is  the foundation of wildlife conservation funding in the United States.   In the early 1900s, many wildlife species were beginning to dwindle  and disappear. To address this decline, State fish and wildlife  agencies and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service partnered with hunters  and conservationists to help draft and enact the Federal Aid in  Wildlife Restoration Act. Known today as the Pittman-Robertson Act,  this legislation became law in 1937.   Since it was first enacted, the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife  Restoration Fund has collected over $11 billion from sportsmen and - women to be used by States to fund wildlife conservation efforts,  habitat acquisition and management, public access to lands, hunter  education, and development of ranges affiliated with hunter safety  programs. These funds are collected from an excise tax on sporting  equipment, which is coupled with State funds from the sale of sporting  licenses.   Over the past century, States have spent these funds to restore game  and nongame species that were on the brink of endangerment and  extinction. Specifically, Pittman-Robertson funds have helped rebuild  white-tailed deer, turkey, duck, beaver, elk, osprey, and bald eagle  populations. Effectively, Pittman-Robertson creates a direct link  between those who hunt and participate in sportsmen activities and the  health of the resources needed to expand and enhance those  opportunities.   However, in recent years, the increasing urbanization and  suburbanization of our population has made it more difficult for the  public to participate in hunting and outdoor recreational activities.                                time  1615    Correspondingly, the average age of Americans purchasing hunting  licenses and equipment is steadily rising as younger Americans are not  joining the sportsmen population.   This has a significant ripple effect, not only on the key Federal  funding models that support the conservation of fish and wildlife, but  also on the base of support for our public lands and on thoughtful  natural resource policy.   H.R. 2591 seeks to address this growing issue head-on.   Without any Federal mandate or any increase in existing user fees or  taxes, H.R. 2591 will preserve the current user-pay, public-benefit  funding of wildlife conservation for generations to come, while further  expanding flexibility of States to make decisions that are best fit for  them and the preservation of their natural resources.   Specifically, H.R. 2591 would clarify that a purpose of the Pittman- Robertson funds is to extend public relations assistance to the States  for the promotion of hunting and sportsmen activities.   For the first time, State fish and wildlife agencies could use  Pittman-Robertson funds for proactive recruitment, including promotions  on television, in printed publications, and on social media;  educational field demonstrations to better teach the role that hunting  plays in wildlife conservation; as well as initiatives aimed at  enhancing access for hunting and range construction.   These modernizations are essential in addressing the issues currently  affecting Pittman-Robertson funds.   To ensure that traditional wildlife conservation remains the primary  focus of Pittman-Robertson, H.R. 2591 puts a maximum cap of 25 percent  on the percentage of Pittman-Robertson funds that can be used for  public relations by a State agency.   Moreover, H.R. 2591 would expand the Multistate Conservation Grant  Program by providing an additional $5 million per year from archery tax  collections to provide for hunters and recreational recruitment project  grants that promote a national recruitment program.   While this legislation provides the authority for the existing  Pittman-Robertson funds to be used on programs that will help ensure  participation in outdoor recreational sportsmen activities and secure a  funding base long into the future, it is important to note that H.R.  2591 does not mandate how PR funds must be spent.   The discretion to determine the amount, if any, of Wildlife  Restoration Funds spent on recruitment would remain entirely with each  individual State fish and wildlife agency.   Conservation organizations and State wildlife agencies alike have  long advocated for increased flexibility for Pittman-Robertson funds.   H.R. 2591 is supported by all 50 State fish and wildlife agencies as  well as a significant number of the Nation's leading sportsmen  conservation groups--just to list a few: the Association of Fish and  Wildlife Agencies, the Archery Trade Association, the Congressional  Sportsmen's Foundation, Conservation Force, Council to Advance Hunting  and Shooting Sports, Delta Waterfowl, Ducks Unlimited, Izaak Walton  League, Mule Deer Foundation, Pheasants Forever, Quail Forever, Rocky  Mountain Elk Foundation, the Sportsmen's Alliance, the Theodore  Roosevelt Conservation Council, Wildlife Forever, the Wildlife and  Hunting Heritage Conservation Council, and the Wildlife Management  Institute.
