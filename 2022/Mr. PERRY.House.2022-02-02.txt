 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the House  Freedom Caucus held an offsite unsanctioned hearing on our  circumstances at the border.   Now, we did that because we can't have a hearing right here in the  Capitol. It is not allowed. The majority won't allow us to talk about  it, doesn't want to talk about it themselves.   We are expecting the State of the Union Address from the President in  about a month, and I suspect he won't talk about it then either. But  the American people want to talk about it. They want to know about it,  and they deserve to know about it. It is happening in their country.   Madam Speaker, Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution says that  the President shall faithfully execute the laws. We have laws on the  books, passed in the House, sent to the Senate, and ratified with a  signature by the President of the United States that are being  violated. They are being violated--not just disregarded--but actively  violated by the President of the United States.   Actively violated. What does that mean? What is that? What would you  call it when the Chief Executive Officer, the President of the United  States, who takes an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and the  law of the land, not only disregards them but actively works to subvert  them? What do you call that? I will let you decide that.   We learned a lot of things at the hearing. It was a great time. One  of the things that you might not know as the Speaker's designee, as  citizens, is that there is an organization, the International  Organization for Migration within the United Nations, the United  Nations that your tax dollars pay for. We don't know how much it spends  on IOM, but the IOM is counseling people to come across our border  illegally, counseling them so they can subvert the laws that your duly- elected legislature has passed, have been signed by the President and  should be enforced by the executive branch.   And you are paying. Your tax dollars are going to pay for people to  break the law to come into your country illegally, up to 2 million-- probably over 2 million--that the border has touched in the last year.  Who knows how many there are that they haven't even interacted with?  And that is just 1 year.  [[Page H910]]    Madam Speaker, how long? How long will this go on?   Today is Groundhog Day. I am from Pennsylvania. We had the chief  prognosticator, Punxsutawney Phil, who is predicting another 6 weeks of  winter. Right? This is Groundhog Day in America for every citizen  because every day when they wake up, it is not another 6 weeks, it is  not another 6 minutes, it is not another 6 months. We hope, the good  Lord, it is not going to be another 6 years. But this keeps happening.  This keeps happening every single day. It is unacceptable.   There was a movie made about it, which was a comedy, but this isn't a  comedy. This is a tragedy. This is horrific for our country. It is  undermining the very things that we stand for, and we ask, we beseech  our President to make it end.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany),  a great member of our effort here.     Right.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and so well said.   Look, we all want to help. All of us want to help. We earned this  position to speak on behalf of our constituents in our home districts.  We all want to help; America is the most generous country on the  planet. And we know that there are people that are wanting, that are  hurting, that are seeking a better opportunity.   We have a process here. If you ask the American people to obey the  law, why is it too hard to ask people that aren't American citizens to  obey the law? Yet, that is exactly what is happening. That is exactly  what's happening. It is unacceptable.                                time  1930     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia  (Mrs. Greene).    Madam Speaker, I don't know if I can help her with that. I  was also in business, we had a mechanical contracting business. It is  hard, heavy work, and we too hired American citizens. We had to have  documentation for the folks that we hired.   Wouldn't it be great though, since you brought it up, the COMPETES  Act, we all want to compete better with China. We know that they are  our adversary. They consider us the enemy. First of all, the COMPETES  Act doesn't do that, it doesn't do anything to secure America from an  aggressive bellicose China.   Shouldn't the COMPETES Act be about a competitive America? What about  the competition that American citizens are in in their own country for  their own jobs with people that are here illegally. Shouldn't the  COMPETES Act be about making sure people don't come here illegally?   Let's face it, some folks already talked about the policy that is-- the Border Patrol said, we need the policy. Policy is in place. Laws  are in place. Article II, section 3 says the President will faithful  execute. But if the President doesn't faithfully execute the laws that  are in place, whether we call the COMPETES Act something against China  or whether the COMPETES Act is about American citizens who have to  compete in their own country against foreigners, if no one is going to  faithfully execute it, it is not going to matter.    Madam Speaker, I think that is a great question. There are  over 100,000 dead from overdose due to fentanyl coming through our  southern border from Communist China, and yet we are locked down in  many places. In the United States in our capital city, people from  across the country can't come here and get a meal. You can't even come  into the Capitol.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde),  maybe he can answer his colleague's question because I sure can't.    Madam Speaker, I inquire with the Chair the time  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy), who has been on the front lines of this issue.   Madam Speaker, I don't want to take from his time, but I just want to  add this. People often say to me: What would you cut? What would you  cut? Well, you know what I would cut from the State and foreign ops  budget, money going to the UN to pay for people to come to our country  and cross our border illegally. How about cutting that, sir.    Madam Speaker, if Mr. Roy would join me in a colloquy in  the remaining 2 minutes. Mr. Roy sent a letter asking for the report on  these Border Patrol agents that had been suspended for allegedly  whipping these Haitian illegal crossers. Of course it never happened.  Even the photographer that took the pictures said that it never  happened.   The only thing that was abused or whipped was the truth and the  reputation of our fine Border Patrol agents. Where does that stand  right now?    Madam Speaker, no apology. What about for lying to the  American people and creating this division. Didn't our Chief Executive  run and say that he was going to unite the country? Didn't he say that?  He was going to unite the country. Isn't this an opportunity. Release  the report--look, none of us are perfect, we all fall short. I think  that is one thing we can agree on.    Madam Speaker, when you fall short, is there something  wrong with apologizing for your failures?    Madam Speaker, the Secretary knows it and the Secretary  just went to the border and talked to Border Patrol. What did they tell  him?    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues from the Freedom  Caucus for coming and talking about what is happening on the border. I  know that the left and the majority party in this House refuse to do  it, certainly the President refuses to do it, but we don't refuse to do  it. We are going to do it because our country is in peril; our families  are in peril; our communities are in peril, and somebody has got to say  something and do something about it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
