 Mr. Speaker, I share the same goals as Mr. Crow and my  colleagues. And I have tremendous respect for Representative Omar, who  has brought this amendment forward for debate.   I don't think there is anyone who wants to bring the troops home more  than someone like Mr. Crow, who has served on the ground in Afghanistan  in combat. But there is an objective for this war. There is a reason  why he went and put his life on the line for this country, and that is  to prevent another terrorist attack here at home.   It is our solemn duty to protect the people of the United States and  maintain our national security. We didn't end World War II by saying to  the Germans: ``We are going to withdraw by a certain deadline.'' We  came home when the job was done.   We can have a very wise and important debate about whether we are  doing the job well in Afghanistan and as quickly as possible. We can't  forget why we have gone. We can't forget what it takes to come home.
