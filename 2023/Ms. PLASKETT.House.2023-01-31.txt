 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight a major  legislative win which was the designation of the National Heritage Area  Act for my home of St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.   I thank Senator Angus King for his support, who introduced the Senate  companion bill, which was signed into law by President Biden.   St. Croix, with its place of landing, is the only place in the United  States in which Christopher Columbus actually set his foot. It is home  to native Caribs, as well as Taino Indians, who engaged and fought with  Christopher Columbus. It is the home of Alexander Hamilton. We have a  history of enslavement and struggle to maintain our African ancestors'  culture on that island.   Seven nations have owned the U.S. Virgin Islands at one point or  another, adding to a rich blend of many cultures and ideas; the epitome  of Americanism, how the innovation and continual change in our country  takes place.   St. Croix's National Heritage Area designation is the culmination of  nearly 20 years of advocacy and work. We look forward to what it brings  to our island.                            ____________________
