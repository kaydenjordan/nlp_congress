 Mr. Speaker, America has lost a national treasure, one  of the world's greatest fighters and defenders of freedom and justice.  Congressman Lewis' words and work and legacy will live forever.   I am so fortunate to have traveled to Africa with him and to have  marched in my hometown with him. You see, Mr. Speaker, when Mr. Lewis  spoke, you heard the voice of history, a voice that helped stir the  conscience of America at a time of ugliness and struggle, but also at a  time and in an era of hope and accomplishment.   My colleagues, there is no greater time for us to stand up against  injustices that we are facing, no greater time for us to fight for  justice and fairness at the ballot box. So, my colleagues, let us make  some noise. Let us get in trouble, good trouble.   God bless you. Rest in peace. Rest in power, my friend. Good trouble.
