 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Scanlon for  [[Page H1480]]  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this bill has six main aspects that I have major  concerns with.   First, the bill eliminates TSA's unique personnel management  authorities created in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of  2001, commonly known as ATSA.   This legislation moves employees of the TSA into the government pay  schedule. In 2001, when Congress created TSA, the decision was made not  to do this in order to give the agency flexibility. At present, the TSA  Administrator has authority over employee pay, hiring, termination, and  discipline.   TSA has repeatedly told us that placing the screener workforce under  title 5 would tie the agency's hands related to national security  policy, workforce management, and collective bargaining.   Specifically, TSA would not be able to continue a one-step removal  process for employees found to have committed serious security breaches  or misconduct, such as allowing unauthorized access to secure areas or  allowing threat items and illicit contraband through the security  checkpoint.   TSA's ability to move employees to different checkpoints based on  passenger volume would also be curtailed. Currently, TSA can set new  security policies TSOs must follow and move TSOs between checkpoints to  manage passenger volume. Under this bill, however, both actions would  be subject to collective bargaining and the security measures could be  limited as a result.   TSA's ability to set security screening policies, such as when and  how to conduct pat-downs, would be negotiable with the union instead of  being driven by national security imperatives.   In fact, the bill eliminates the TSA's authority to immediately fire  employees for serious misconduct, including sexual assault, drug and  alcohol abuse, arrest, theft, and intentional security breaches, such  as allowing guns, knives, and explosives past the checkpoint. In recent  years, there have been several incidents of TSOs assaulting passengers,  stealing passenger items, and allowing drugs past the checkpoint. Now,  we all know the majority of TSOs are good people doing good jobs. But  there are some bad actors.    On February 6, 2020, the State of California announced the arrest and  prosecution of a former TSA screener resulting from a joint  investigation effort by Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies  and the TSA.   According to the criminal complaint, the TSA screener used fraud or  deceit to falsely imprison a woman going through security while  stationed as a travel document checker at Los Angeles International  Airport in June of 2019. The screener allegedly insisted that the woman  passenger needed extra screening in an elevator, where he told the  passenger to reveal her full breasts and to lift her pants and  underwear. The victim in the case stated that she complied with the  TSO's instructions out of fear that he would inappropriately touch her.   This sort of horrible incident is why it is imperative that TSA  retain its one-step removal process for employees who sully the  integrity and honor of the TSA mission and put American travelers at  risk.   Under title 5 protections, this TSA screener that I just talked about  could remain on the Federal Government's payroll for years before  removal. That is wrong. Under this bill, TSA leadership would lose the  flexibility to respond effectively to incidents such as the one I just  described.   The second reason I have concerns about this bill is just recently in  2019, the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Panel for the Transportation Security  Administration on Human Capital Service Delivery specifically  recommended that TSA not--I repeat not--switch to the general schedule,  GS, system, calling it overly rigid and outdated.                                time  1245    This panel is comprised of former officials from both Republican and  Democratic administrations, and it is led by a Department of Homeland  Security official from the Obama administration.   They all pointed out that, under the current system and law, TSA can  pay its employees more than they can make under title 5. It called on  TSA to use the statutory flexibility Congress provided it to provide  targeted pay increases, which I support. The Blue Ribbon Panel  specifically recommended against the policies contained in H.R. 1140.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Blue Ribbon Panel report,  titled ``Final Findings and Recommendations, Blue Ribbon Panel for the  Transportation Security Administration.''                     Final Findings and Recommendations    Blue Ribbon Panel for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)         The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has faced       numerous challenges with human capital policy, operations,       and services to support mission requirements. The Agency       determined it needed a third-party review to identify the       underlying problems and recommend solutions. ICF was       contracted to perform the work and convened a Blue-Ribbon       Panel (the Panel) to review, analyze, and make       recommendations for improvements. This Report documents the       ``As Is'' state and recommendations for improvement. It is       based on extensive interviews with Office of Human Capital       (OHC) and other headquarters (HQ) stakeholders, interviews       with airport leaders, and focus groups with the National       Advisory Council (NAC) and Transportation Security Officers       (TSOs). In addition, the Panel reviewed documents and data       provided by TSA. ICF also analyzed TSA data to look for       trends, corroboration, or potential root causes of identified       issues.        Because of the nature of the Panel's work--identifying       problems and recommending solutions--this report documents       difficult, long-standing challenges. The Panel also found       areas of excellence. The TSO workforce, for example,       demonstrates a remarkable level of dedication to their work.       Even during the seven-week partial government shutdown, the       vast majority of TSOs showed up and did their jobs. Some even       participated in recruiting events to help TSA recruit new       officers. Given the low pay and difficult working conditions       that are inherent in TSA's screening work, the dedication       these officers show is extraordinary.        TSA's low ranking in the Partnership for Public Service's       Best Places to Work in the Federal Government may lead some       to conclude that there are no great leaders in TSA. That is       not true. The Panel found there are airports with outstanding       leaders whose work clearly demonstrates excellence. The       challenge facing TSA is to take the lessons learned from       those airports, feedback from employees and stakeholders, and       Panel recommendations to transform human capital operations       agency-wide.        The Panel's key findings and recommendations are       categorized into two major areas: Examining Human Capital       Service Delivery and Supporting the Transportation Security       Officer (TSO) Workforce.        TSA human capital challenges include ineffective use of       Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA)       flexibilities, an ill-defined service delivery model that       relies on contractors with insufficient oversight and       inadequate Human Capital Information Technology, poorly       trained field staff, and a headquarters human capital office       that lacks strategic focus and demonstrates insufficient       teamwork.        The policy and human capital operations challenges appear       to result from deficiencies in the Office of Human Capital       (OHC) and an inconsistent approach to field delivery of human       capital services. The OHC suffers from a lack of teamwork and       leadership challenges. Interviews with customers,       stakeholders, and OHC staff make clear that human capital       programs are not designed in the context of a cohesive       strategy. OHC customers gave negative feedback on key       programs, particularly human capital information technology       systems, classification and position management, and hiring       and pay, with a few bright spots in employee relations and       training. OHC leaders consistently reported a culture where       cooperation across OHC organizations was lacking and peer       relationships are poor.        TSA's Human Capital Office issues are significant, but the       Panel has encountered other human capital organizations with       such issues that have been transformed into effective units.       With significant leadership support, the Panel believes the       improvements in Human Capital Office leadership, work       processes and policies required for TSA to have acceptable       human capital services are achievable and has included       recommendations for implementable and substantive changes       that will provide a way forward for TSA. This report       includes multiple recommendations. The most pressing among       those recommendations are the need for more effective       human capital leadership, a well thought out process for       human capital service delivery, greater use of ATSA       flexibilities, modern human capital technology, and       standardizing and realigning the field human capital       structure. Adoption of these recommendations, coupled with       actions TSA is already taking to make improvements, should       result in significantly improved human capital policies       and services.        The 2018 TSA Exit Survey report indicated employees were       concerned about leadership issues, having experienced a       ``lack of management skills,'' ``unfair practices (e.g., in  [[Page H1481]]       performance appraisal, disciplinary actions, career       advancement, etc.),'' ``unequal levels of respect,'' a       ``hostile work environment,'' and ``inadequate communication       with the workforce.'' TSOs perceive favoritism and express an       inability to voice complaints about issues.        The Panel believes the systemic problems with TSO pay may       be a major contributor to some of those perceptions, due to       the inability of TSOs (even those with exceptional       performance ratings) to advance within their pay bands.       Employee perceptions of leadership and organizational       fairness may undermine their commitment to stay at TSA.        Surveys and Focus Groups reveal that TSO pay is a key issue       for the screening workforce, and a complex problem. These       officers work long hours, have difficult working conditions,       and are the backbone of the TSA mission. By some measures,       TSO annual pay in some locations lags well behind industry       counterparts. TSO perceptions regarding inequity in their pay       are aggravated by the fact that their pay averages about one-      third of that of TSA employees in Management, Administration       and Professional (MAP) positions. The Panel recognizes that       the nature of the TSO's work and that of employees in MAP       positions means a disparity in pay is always going to exist.       While there is no indication it was deliberate, TSA's use of       its flexibilities has boosted MAP pay above government       averages, with TSO pay remaining below those averages for       comparable jobs.        The disparity is driven in part by a pay and performance       management process that provides little hope of movement,       especially within the E-Band. A TSO at the bottom of the E-      band, even with exceptional performance ratings year after       year, would take more than 30 years to reach the top of the       E-Band. This produces the effect that the E-Band pay range is       illusory, with few TSOs in the middle or at the top of the       band.        TSO turnover is high in the first three years in comparison       to other positions in TSA and in the federal workforce. TSO       turnover is somewhat consistent with other low wage jobs in       the private sector with comparable skill requirements for       initial hiring, where annual turnover rates of 20 percent or       more are common. That does not mean TSA should accept high       turnover as a given. The cost of turnover (in terms of       recruiting, hiring and training replacement officers and       lower productivity of newer and less skilled officers) is       high and the effect on the workforce which carries the       screening workload in absence of a full TSO cohort is       significant. If TSA can retain Officers beyond the first       three years, turnover reduces to a much more manageable       level.        Turnover among longer term employees may be driven by the       stability of employment and benefits TSOs receive. Although       TSA operates outside of the general government pay and       classification statutes found in Title 5 of the U.S. Code,       the agency offers the same or better benefits as other       agencies and provides greater job security than many private       sector employers. As a result, if TSA can address pay,       leadership, and turnover issues, the Panel believes the       agency will see reduced costs, better morale, and a more       stable workforce.        This report includes recommendations to address TSO pay and       advancement, and other critical issues for the TSO workforce.       Although we often find that pay is a secondary issue for       employees and other leadership issues tend to drive turnover,       Focus Group findings highlight pay as the greatest issue       driving turnover.        The Panel acknowledges that TSA recognizes the pay issues       and is seeking ways to address them. The scale of TSA       operations means that even small across-the-board pay       increases can cost tens of millions of dollars. The Panel       recommends targeted pay raises, rather than across-the-board       increases that might consume precious salary dollars to raise       pay in locations where pay is not a problem.        Although TSOs identify pay as the key driver of turnover,       the Panel believes other problematic issues must be addressed       as well. If pay problems are reduced, the other issues will       continue to affect morale and turnover. Other key       recommendations address the hiring process, which the Panel       believes should be significantly modernized, and leader       selection and development, which is essential to address many       of the morale issues that are contributors to morale problems       and turnover. The Panel also recommends changes to the       promotion process and support for Information Technology       improvements that can simultaneously increase operational       efficiency and transparency, likely reducing concerns of       favoritism expressed by the TSO workforce.        One recommendation the Panel heard repeatedly from       employees was moving TSA into the General Schedule (GS). The       Panel does not agree. The General Schedule is a 70 year-old       classification and compensation system from the last century       and is the subject of countless studies and recommendations       from good government organizations who consistently find it       is too inflexible to meet the needs of the 21st century       workforce. A better course of action is to use existing ATSA       flexibility to improve the TSA pay system so that it operates       at a level superior to the GS system.        This Report provides a high-level roadmap for changes to       TSA's Human Capital policies and processes, which if adopted,       should have a significant positive impact on TSA workforce       and mission operations.     Madam Speaker, third, some benefits currently available  to the screener workforce under ATSA would not be possible if this bill  were to become law.   The bill does not fix the morale problem.   The bill does not guarantee additional pay or benefits for TSOs. It  may actually make situations worse. The bill eliminates the authority  TSA has to pay TSOs more than other Federal employees under title 5.   It also eliminates several benefits, such as the broadest application  of veterans' hiring preference in the Federal Government, meaning that  veterans may not get the same preference that they do now; shift trades  between employees; voluntary leave transfers; partial overtime pay as  compensation for schedule changes; and career progression bonuses of up  to 5 percent of a screener's salary.   Fourth, we have yet to receive a CBO score. However, TSA estimates  the bill will cost $1.2 billion over the next 5 years. To cover the  cost, funding for security priorities would be reduced. The bill does  not even have a specific authorization of appropriations or means of  paying for moving these employees under title 5.   The fifth reason I have a concern on this bill, H.R. 1140, amounts to  a forced unionization of the TSA workforce and a forced designation of  the union that will represent that same workforce. It does not allow  for an intervening election for TSA screeners to choose their labor  representation.   As such, this bill benefits one specific union, the American  Federation of Government Employees. The bill does not provide for an  intervening election to give screeners the right to choose which union  they want to represent them.   In 2011, AFGE was recognized by the Obama administration to represent  the screener workforce after two elections. Approximately 8,900  screeners voted for the union. However, today, there are approximately  45,000 screeners subject to this bill. While TSA employees did select  AFGE as their bargaining agent in 2011, it is remarkable that this bill  specifically dictates which union will be representing TSA employees  without a more recent vote or all employees voting.   Sixth, this bill, once again, is a partisan messaging bill that will  not become law. We know that because I highly doubt the Senate is going  to hear this bill. Yet again, the majority refuses to work with the  minority to move viable legislation to address real problems.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, support increasing pay for our TSOs. I am the  ranking member, Republican member, on the Homeland Security  Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, so we have had  hearings on this.   I do believe that they need to get a pay increase. It is a tough job.  The ones I go through, in the Phoenix and Washington DCA airports, do a  good job. So I am not opposed to that at all, and I am hoping I can  work together with my Democratic colleagues on the budget so we can try  to increase the budget so that they can increase pay for good TSOs who  are doing a good job.   But what I do know is that I don't like this bill. I already said the  reasons why I don't like this bill, but one of them is specifically  about the case I talked about where a bad TSO officer, someone who did  a bad thing--sexually assaulted a woman--that then they wouldn't be  removed immediately if this bill came into law.   My colleague, Representative Scanlon, said: Well, under title 5  rules, they could be removed from their post.   Well, that is good, but they are still getting paid. And I can tell  you what, I bet if I went out on the street right now and I said: Do  you think it is fine if a TSO officer sexually assaulted a woman on an  elevator under false pretenses, do you think that Federal employee  should still be getting paid?   They would say absolutely not. They would be outraged. That is one of  my major concerns on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will bring to the  floor H.R. 5595, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions  campaign, commonly known as BDS, is anti-Israel, anti-peace, and  damaging to U.S. interests.   This bill amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to prohibit  boycotts or requests for boycotts imposed by international governmental  organizations against Israel. This will protect American companies from  being forced to give information to international organizations for the  furthering of boycotts against Israel.   This bill establishes Congress' opposition to the Boycott, Divestment  and Sanctions movement, and establishes that Congress considers the  United Nations Human Rights Council's creation of a database of  companies doing business in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the  Golan Heights in March 2016 to be an act of BDS.                                time  1300    We cannot be quiet when it comes to combating anti-Semitism and anti- Israel mentalities. We need to work together in Congress and pass  commonsense legislation on this issue. H.R. 5595 does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Zeldin), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I want to urge my Democratic colleagues to vote against  this rule and H.R. 1140 and the previous question so we can assert my  anti-BDS amendment.   The bill, as I stated, would eliminate TSA's ability to immediately  fire employees for serious misconduct, like what happened in  California. The bill would also take away TSA's ability to give the  TSOs many of the benefits that they currently get, such as bonuses and  overtime pay.   I really think we need to work together to ensure TSA employees are  happy and enjoy their work, and that is why I said I am supportive of  increasing their pay, especially that of good and productive TSOs. We  need to provide incentives to help bring good morale to these  hardworking employees, not the opposite.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
