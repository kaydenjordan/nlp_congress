 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with an aching heart for the  innocent children being ripped from their parents' arms at our Nation's  borders.   Families fleeing violence with legitimate claims of asylum are having  their children taken from them thanks to an inhumane policy put in  place by this administration. Weeping 2- and 3-year-olds have been  forced onto immigration buses specifically equipped with car seats to  be held in overcrowded cages, a crisis of this President's own making.   What kind of a country tears hundreds, if not thousands of families  apart, inflicting trauma on the young and vulnerable? What happened to  ``give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses''? What happened  to America being a beacon of hope?   This zero tolerance policy betrays our core values, and it must stop  immediately. I have joined my friend and colleague, Congresswoman  DeLauro, as a cosponsor of her resolution condemning this policy, and I  call on the administration to halt this horrendous practice and  exercise some compassion for those who need it most.                            ____________________
