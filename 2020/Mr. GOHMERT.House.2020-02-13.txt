 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to be able to stand in  this hallowed Hall and address some things that have occurred that are  worthy of attention.   Of course, there was applause in the gallery today on the passage of  trying to restart the ERA. It is an amendment to the Constitution, and  it was started back in the seventies. The amendment to the Constitution  had a deadline as part of the amendment. The amendment did not get the  required 38 states. The time lapsed. There was, as I recall, an attempt  to extend the time, but some States that had been in favor of the ERA  backed off.                                time  1145    So it is very clear to anyone who pays attention to the Constitution  that, when an amendment to the Constitution by its own wording has a  time deadline and that deadline is passed, then that amendment has not  been ratified, is not part of the Constitution, and any efforts to  change the amendment itself, including the deadline for ratification,  would require beginning again.   There is no more iconic liberal judge on the Supreme Court, not in  history, than the former head, as I recall, of the American Civil  Liberties Union. She was there back when the American Civil Liberties  Union cared deeply about civil liberties and even took on some clients  and some causes of people that most of us thought were not worthy of a  lot of attention. But they were so committed to civil liberties back in  those days, they were more concerned about civil liberties than they  were the client. That was in the old days.   Now, if it is not a liberal, then they are not concerned about civil  liberties and abuses, since the Obama administration was the  administration that so far appears to be the most abusive of the FISA  courts, committing fraud upon the FISA courts.   But in fairness to the administration, it appears the FISA court  judges did not have sufficient integrity or pride in their position  that they were offended by having fraud committed upon them, because,  apparently, the disdain for Donald Trump, then President Trump and his  administration was such that it was okay. They were okay to be  defrauded as judges, which sure brings  [[Page H1146]]  the issue of the FISA courts into focus as that issue will be taken up,  as I understand it, as will issues over parts of the PATRIOT Act and  other provisions that give the Federal Government tremendous latitude  to spy on American citizens.   So it is an interesting time, though, where you never know where  judges are going to come down. If somebody was appointed by a liberal  judge, it is amazing; they appear to stay liberal, with disdain for  conservatism and the strict language of the Constitution, wanting it to  be a liberal, breathing, living document.   On the other hand, Chief Justice Roberts has pointed out he doesn't  believe there should be Obama judges or Trump judges or Bush judges  because you can't characterize them that way.   To an extent, he is right about that, because there are some  Justices, particularly on the Supreme Court, who have been appointed by  conservative Presidents who were liberals in conservative clothing, and  they got on the Court and became some of the biggest flaming liberals  we have ever had.   So you can't tell that someone is conservative if they are appointed  by a conservative President, but you sure can tell if somebody is  appointed by a liberal President. They have shown that they will stay  liberal and not change. So it has been interesting to see that kind of  conversion.   It appears pretty clear that some of these Justices, including Chief  Justice Roberts, got into the position and began to care deeply about  what the media and others thought about things they were doing.   So, for example, with ObamaCare, he was, apparently, from the  reports, concerned that he might go down in history as being too  political of a Chief Justice if he struck down ObamaCare. So he took  something that was clearly unconstitutional, in effect, rewrote it, and  had a very hypocritical opinion.   At page 14, I believe it was, he said, clearly, this is not a tax,  because if it were a tax, Congress would have called it a tax, and they  made clear it was not; and it is only a penalty, a fine, if you don't  conform your conduct to the requirements of the legislation. Therefore,  it is not a tax.   Since it is not a tax, then the anti-injunction law that prevents a  plaintiff from filing suit until a tax is not only assessed but paid  and keeps the court from having jurisdiction to hear it until the tax  is assessed and paid, that doesn't apply, so the court can take this  matter up. And now that we take it up, 40 pages later, he said it is  constitutional, in effect, because it is a tax.   So he had to go through all kinds of mental gymnastics to what, in  his mind, would prevent him from being classified as a political Chief  Justice; but, as a result, he has become one the most political Chief  Justices we have ever had--unfortunately for him and the country.   So who knows. Maybe there will be people on the Supreme Court who  will decide to rewrite the Constitution as he, in effect, rewrote the  ObamaCare statute. But if you are actually going to follow the  Constitution the way it is written and you are not going to rewrite the  Constitution at the Supreme Court level, then the truth is, when an  amendment fails by its own language and is not ratified, then anybody  with any sense would understand you have got to start over.   Though I have plenty of disagreements with Justice Ginsberg over some  issues, she has tried to be a person of integrity. Talking about the  ERA, she says:         I would like to see a new beginning. I'd like it to start       over. There is too much controversy about latecomers--      Virginia--long after the deadline passed. Plus, a number of       States have withdrawn their ratification. So if you count a       latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard the States       that said, ``We have changed our minds''?    So it is interesting. Yes, this legislation passed.   Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin appropriately brought up the point  that this is actually amending the Constitution; it is amending the  constitutional amendment. So, to be appropriate, it is going to require  a two-thirds vote in the House, a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and  then 38 States, I believe it is, in order to have it ratified.   That was overruled to reinforce the fact that what we did today is  really not constitutional. If we had tried to ratify it as a new  amendment, like Justice Ginsberg was talking about, a new  constitutional amendment, then, actually, you would, as Justice  Ginsberg said, have to be starting the process all over again, and that  does require a two-thirds vote here and in the Senate.    So what we did today made people that support it feel good, but it is  not going anywhere; and even if it were, hypothetically, it just simply  can't pass constitutional muster at the Supreme Court. A majority of  the Court appears to believe that the Constitution means what it says.   We had one vote today. It was on the ERA. So we didn't do anything  terribly effective today as the House of Representatives.   Also, I noted before I came over for the vote that, apparently, the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, it was reported--I don't know if  other members of the majority signed the letter, but there was a letter  to Attorney General Barr, and it expressed what sounded like the  distress of the committee over Attorney General Barr's action in  reining in prosecutors who have simply gotten out of hand.   Attorney General Barr has the distinct advantage of having a bigger  picture than these four very politically motivated prosecutors who were  pushing so hard for virtually the maximum amount of time for Roger  Stone to serve in prison.   Anyway, if that letter was going to be truly accurate, it needed to  say that this majority that has been trying to throw President Trump  out of office, that has been using taxpayer funds for a number of years  now to try to defeat President Trump in the 2020 election, which voted  for impeachment knowing that President Trump was not going to be  removed from office--so it seems the logical conclusion is, again, they  were using taxpayer funds to campaign against President Trump, hoping  they could besmirch him sufficiently, slander his name sufficiently,  that it would help them defeat him in November.   Whereas, the minority of the committee did not agree with the letter  because it appears clear to all of the minority I have talked to that  Attorney General Barr is trying to do something and incorporate  something called fairness in our legal system, because he has seen you  had people in the previous administration who strong-armed salespeople  into selling guns to people they knew should not have them and that  they would end up in the hands of, most likely, Mexican drug cartels.  And that is what the administration wanted to do. They were assuring  they would be able to follow the guns and intercede, but that is not  what happened.   Then we even saw emails that, after this was all exposed, there was  an idea that, gee, maybe we can still use the fact that these guns went  into criminal hands, even killed one of our own United States agents, a  brave soul, Brian Terry, they were hopeful they could still use that to  get antigun legislation passed simply based on their criminal activity  in trying to get these guns into the hands of criminals who shouldn't  have them.   So nobody was held accountable for that. Nobody was held accountable  for the guns that were forced into the hands of criminals, ultimately,  one of which killed Brian Terry. Nobody was held accountable for any of  that.   Nobody was held accountable for destroying evidence after it was  subpoenaed, even with a hammer, even with applications like BleachBit,  destroying subpoenaed evidence. Nobody was held accountable for any of  that.   So across the Nation, it appears maybe a small majority, but a  majority, understand and believe that there are two forms of justice in  America: one for those high-ranking Democratic officials who are never  held accountable at all, and one for Republicans whose lives are  attempted to be destroyed and, in some cases, are destroyed.                                time  1200    In some cases, they did nothing wrong. In other cases, they agreed to  plead to something just because the bully Federal prosecutors have  threatened to go after their family and continue to harass them.   I saw a former Member of Congress from Pennsylvania who had been  blasting the FBI back during my first term,  [[Page H1147]]  2005-2006, and he was blasting them because he said--and I had not  heard of it before, at the time--but a program called Able Danger had  been able to identify a majority of the 9/11 hijackers. The FBI had  that information. They did nothing with it.   I didn't know if Curt Weldon, the Member of Congress from  Pennsylvania, was accurate in what he was saying, but hearing him make  these speeches over and over about how the FBI should have acted. They  could have prevented thousands of lives from being taken, all of those  people from having to jump to their deaths because they didn't want to  be burned at the top of the World Trade Center. All of that could have  been avoided if the FBI had stepped in and used the information they  had to stop 9/11.   I didn't know if that was true or not, but I was thinking, you know,  Mueller and the FBI have to respond to Congressman Weldon in some way.  They have to. This is really serious stuff. I thought they would make a  statement and that they would come back with evidence to refute what he  was saying, but they never did that.   What Mueller's FBI did, though--it had to be with his approval, going  after a Member of Congress. It was believed that they got a warrant  because they raided his daughter's law office. They alerted the media  for the early morning raids so there was plenty of media there and  plenty of media at his congressional office. People were apparently  warned in advance by the FBI because nobody else knew.   They showed up with preprinted signs condemning Curt Weldon, caught  red-handed, all of this stuff. It turned out, there was nothing ever  done. He told me that, months later, he was contacted by the FBI and  told: You can come get all of this material we seized in the raid.   They did the raid 2 weeks before the election, as I recall, about 2  weeks before the election. So the FBI, under Mueller, was able to  singlehandedly defeat Curt Weldon. It helped the Democrat opponent to  defeat Curt Weldon in the narrow loss that he had.   So the FBI didn't respond with evidence. They just helped manipulate  the election system so Curt Weldon would lose. He did, and he said that  they told him to come pick up all of this stuff. They never did present  it to a grand jury anyway. That was kind of shocking.   So, clearly, Mueller and his FBI were motivated by shutting him up so  he couldn't make speeches on the House floor anymore, and that is why  the raid was conducted. But in his last most recent visit, Curt was  telling me that--by the way, before I wrote about Curt Weldon, I had  not seen him nor talked with him since 2006 when he left. I put that in  the booklet I wrote titled ``Robert Mueller: Unmasked.'' I wrote about  what happened to Curt.   At this most recent visit this year, he told me that, as he  understands, it turns out the FBI never even got a warrant. They just  raided the office without a warrant, like any good dictator would have,  the brownshirts. Law enforcement does, in places: We don't need a  stinking warrant. We will just go harass and destroy.   That is really shocking if there was not even a warrant. But Mueller  was irritated, apparently, with Ted Stevens, so the FBI framed Ted  Stevens. It turned out, after he was convicted right before his  election--he lost narrowly as a U.S. Senator--an FBI agent filed an  affidavit and established how they had created a case against Ted  Stevens that didn't exist.   Actually, Ted Stevens had overpaid for improvements to his home. It  wasn't an illegal gift. He had overpaid, at one point telling the  contractor: Look, I know I am overpaying, but I have people watching. I  have to do everything by the book, so just cash the check--that kind of  thing.   Anyway, Mueller and his FBI helped defeat Ted Stevens by convicting  him right before his election. But then that conviction was thrown out  due to the prosecutorial misconduct and, I would say, crimes committed  by at least one FBI agent, if not more, and also by prosecutors.   They should have gone to prison for what they did, but I can't help  but think that between what the FBI did to Curt Weldon, what they did  to Ted Stevens, what they have done to other people with whom they  disagree, that it had become a very dangerous place where, if you were  in the right political persuasion or took the right positions on the  right issues, then you could commit crimes, and the FBI would leave you  alone.   If you were of the wrong political positions, on the wrong issues,  they would come after you even if they had to frame you or set you up,  as they did Ted Stevens and Curt Weldon, destroying their political  careers.   So we are at a very dangerous time in this country's history. It used  to be that the FBI had the reputation that it was the most trustworthy,  effective law enforcement agency body in the world. But that has  changed.   Unfortunately, we have an FBI Director--an article said, at one time,  back in the Bush administration, he had told James Comey, who has lied,  obviously committed crimes--and we can debate about how high or low of  a level. But he told Comey: Look, if you and Mueller are going to make  a move, I want to be with you guys. I want to go where you are going,  when you are going.   Well, that guy who thought so highly of Mueller and Comey was put in  a place he never should have been, and that is FBI Director at a time  that needed cleaning up.   So I am hopeful that in the days, weeks, or months ahead, we will get  a new FBI Director who will be serious about punishing wrongdoing in  the FBI, which I believe will help them get back their reputation.   The more Christopher Wray appears to do more covering up than he does  making accountable, he really needs to go sooner rather than later.  They are not going to get their reputation back simply by ignoring  things.    Of course, the FISA court pointed out in an order, after going for  years without having any pride or integrity in enforcing their  jurisdiction and being offended by fraud upon the court, it finally  came out and said: Okay, this one guy, Clinesmith, had changed the  wording, basically going from saying he did work for the U.S.  Government or the CIA to saying he did not.   So, clearly, 180 degrees opposite of what the truth was, knowing it  was false, he submitted it to the court. But that had been clear for  months, if not years, and the courts did nothing.   It is what keeps compelling me to think maybe we just need to get rid  of the FISA court system and come up with a new way, because I am not  sure that the court with the judges who have been appointed to be FISA  judges, that we can save that system, that Americans can feel  comfortable that their privacy and their civil rights are not being  violated by an overzealous group, especially when you look at the  thousands and thousands of FISA orders. In 2018, out of mass  applications for warrants from the FISA court, I think there was only  one they turned down.   Some say: Well, maybe if we have an amicus, a friend of the court who  will stand up for the party against whom a warrant is sought, maybe  that would help provide enough protection for American civil liberties.   But then we saw in December, I believe it was, FISA court, feeling  the heat of all of those who have come to distrust FISA courts,  appointed an amicus. It turned out the judge appointed the very lawyer  who for years had been trashing Devin Nunes and others, who it turns  out were 100 percent right in the things they said in their report.   So it appeared clear that the FISA court was not serious about making  fixes or changes or protecting civil liberties, but also it had gone  into the Christopher Wray mode of covering up, hoping people wouldn't  notice that so much illegality and impropriety had been going on.   We are going to be taking up these issues, the controversial section  215 from the PATRIOT Act and other things. Hopefully, we will take up  the FISA court.   I am hopeful that we will have bipartisan action because I know from  my time on the Judiciary Committee, there have been Democrats-- previously, Chairman Nadler had been a staunch proponent of protecting  civil liberties, but that appears to be more, nowadays, only protecting  civil liberties if you are a Democrat, but not so much if you are part  of the Trump administration or a friend of the President.  [[Page H1148]]    Hopefully, we can get past some of that and do some good and actually  do the job of protecting civil liberties.   I have talked to Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren over the years, including  more recently, because she, in the past, has been quite zealous for  civil liberties. I understand she has a bill. Hopefully, that will be  helpful in dealing with some of these issues.   But I am still concerned that the abuses may have grown so profound  that we may not be able to fix the FISA court system. We may need to do  as some have said--I think Rand Paul has talked about just getting rid  of it. But we will see where we go.   That same kind of duality justice or dual justice has raised its ugly  head in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. Jessie  Liu was the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, and she had  some people, it turns out, who were extremely partisan.   In fact, in a case involving Imran Awan, an IT technician here,  involved with working with computers for dozens of Democrats on Capitol  Hill--since 2004, he had worked, like I say, for dozens of Democratic  Representatives. And it is one of the things up here on the Hill, if a  Member of Congress tells you, ``Oh, this is my computer person. He is  great. She is great,'' then others will say, ``oh, I need somebody, so  I will hire them.''   Normally, somebody who does that, since you don't need them full  time, they work part time. Under the rules, they are allowed to work  for multiple offices as long as their income does not exceed the  maximum amount allowed--I think it was around $170,000, something like  that. You could work for multiple offices and accumulate up to that  maximum. You can have multiple part-time employees. Apparently, that is  what Imran Awan did, and he had a brother.   If you are going to do that kind of work, you have to file financial  information, financial statement information. It turns out, he didn't  disclose about selling cars or some of the assets or businesses he had,  and that is a Federal felony.                                time  1215    He also had filed under the requirements here if you buy something,  and I think it is $500 or more, then you have to have the serial  number, you have to keep track of it, and you have to be able to  document where that item is at all times if it costs more than $500.   When I came into office in 2005, there was some couch that was on my  inventory. Nobody had seen the couch in many years, but I was told you  can't take it off your inventory because it is part of your office.  Well, if it had cost less than $500 then that would not have been an  issue. I have no idea where that couch was or is. It wasn't around when  I got here.   But Imran Awan, apparently to get around the requirement of keeping  serial numbers and keeping track of things that he purchased allegedly  on behalf of Congress Members for whom he worked, he would list iPads  that cost $799 as costing $499 and then say that an insurance policy  for it cost $300, and that way it got around the requirement of keeping  information on where those specific items were.   It turns out from, what I have read, it appears he and his brother  owed six figures to somebody foreign, I believe. And so instead of  paying the person back, they put this guy, who was not a computer  technician--just had various Members, oh, apparently he told them, this  guy is going to help with your computer system, so we need you to put  him on part-time for your office. So he had the Federal taxpayers  paying their debt to this guy.   It turns out he had two wives, and one was saying he had a tremendous  amount of money. He is from Pakistan, and when he goes back, he is  treated like a king by the secret police there, I believe it was ISI.  He is constantly sending all kinds of computer equipment back to  Pakistan since he was a Pakistan national.   Anyway, he had some ties with some very questionable people. It  sounds like maybe the FISA court should have been issuing warrants to  look at some of his stuff.   He was arrested in July of 2017 over his alleged involvement in  double charging House Democrats for House IT equipment, House computer- type equipment, and privately exposing private information online. A  probe of him found more than tens of thousands of dollars in computer  technical equipment had been stolen.   He was indicted by a Federal District Court in August of 2017 for  ``conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, making false statements  on a loan or credit application, and engaging in unlawful monetary  transactions.''   As I recall, he had, I believe it was a cousin who worked at  McDonald's. He got him listed on the payroll for different House  Members. I am sure they didn't know that he wasn't working. So he  helped out the family by bringing in extra income for family members.  Each one of those events would have been a Federal felony.   Evidence indicates that Imran Awan and his team members were copying  data from the computers of House Members to the House Democratic Caucus  server and then even to private Dropbox accounts--totally inappropriate  and absolute wrongdoing.   He and his associates were even tossed off the House computer system  because they provided false information to Capitol Police that being a  fake copy of the Democratic Caucus' server. But incredibly none of that  was used by Jessie Liu's attorneys against him. Instead, the U.S.  Attorney's office for the District of Columbia opted to let him plead  to a charge of just making a false statement on a loan application,  disregarding the many, many felonies that could have been charged and  pursued to just find out: Why are you such a hero back in Pakistan?   What equipment are you sending back there?   Where are you getting it from?   How come you committed a felony by not listing your car dealership?   Because as our intel people can tell you, Madam Speaker, one of the  ways that money is raised for terrorist activity is through bogus car  dealerships where cars are stolen and then shipped. We don't know what  the situation was with Imran Awan's alleged car dealership because he  didn't have a dealer lot anywhere.   It is handy, though, no matter who you are, if you can have taxpayers  pay back your loans by just listing them on the payroll of people whom  you lied to about who is doing the work.   The problem, though, if Jessie Liu and these Democrat attorneys in  the D.C. U.S. Attorneys' Office had pursued Imran for anything other  than making a false statement on his loan, then there would have been a  lot of embarrassment for Democratic Members of Congress because they  had some guy like that who was cheating taxpayers, cheating the  government, and committing crimes working for them. In fairness, it is  hard to believe they would have known the kinds of things he was doing  and getting away with. Anyway, the Federal judge sentenced him.   He filed saying he was broke, and he had no money. One of his wives  said she was threatened by the FBI to keep her mouth shut, but she had  indicated that he had all kinds of money. He had gold, and he had all  kinds of money that he had been able to save while working for all  these different Members of Congress. But he said he was broke. He filed  something saying he was broke, and he couldn't pay anything. But then  it came down to, in order to get probation he had to pay back six  figures to the government. Somehow, he magically came up--I can't  remember if it was 100 or $200,000--he came up with it. He paid it,  even though he alleged he was flat broke.   So when we hear about four Federal prosecutors who worked for U.S.  Attorney of D.C. Jessie Liu being all upset over the Department of  Justice wanting fairness for Roger Stone and not political vengeance,  four of them quit. In analyzing who it is and what they were doing and  why they quit, I think it is important to see who they are. There have  been some good articles written about these people just in the last  week.   Jonathan Kravis was appointed by former President Obama to be  associate White House Counsel where he served in 2009 and 2010. He  worked for Williams & Connolly, a lobbying firm for which Kravis had  worked. It has a long history of its employees donating large sums of  money to Democratic candidates, organizations, and causes.    He worked with Adam Jed to prosecute Paul Manafort. They went after  [[Page H1149]]  him with a vengeance for working for the Ukrainian Government. Manafort  was cleared of all charges except two counts of conspiracy to defraud  the U.S., for which Manafort is serving a 5-year prison sentence.   Kravis and his wife are connected with Codepink that most people  around here know is a far left, anti-war organization.   Then Adam Jed, himself, apparently did work in 2003 or was a fellow  at Humanity in Action group, a far-left-wing organization blatantly  against political diversity.   He defended the Affordable Care Act contraceptive mandate in the case  Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius. That is where the Federal  Government was going after these nuns who took a vow of poverty but  also a vow to help people, and they believed it was against their  religion to help pay for abortions. Mr. Jed had no problem in pursuing  these poor nuns. That is his choice, but it does give an indication of  where he stood, and it is certainly not anywhere close to the beliefs  on the pro-life positions of Donald Trump.   Adam Jed also provided oral arguments to strike down the Defense of  Marriage Act in the Defense of Marriage Act v. Windsor.   He contributed $1,000 to Josh Kaul's candidacy for Wisconsin State  Attorney General. Of course, Kaul was a lawyer for Perkins Coie which  funneled money from the Hillary Clinton campaign to Christopher Steele  who was the British spy who also apparently utilized other foreigners  to try to affect the U.S. election in 2016. So, obviously, Adam Jed  would have been supporting Kaul who worked for Perkins Coie.   I know we don't hear a whole lot about it from the other side of the  aisle, but the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC actually paid  foreigners to try to affect our 2016 election.   I constantly hear about how outrageous it was that the now-debunked  allegations that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to affect our  election, they don't want to talk about what is slam-dunk proved that  the DNC and the Clinton campaign absolutely did pay foreigners to try  to affect our election. One foreigner from Italy was involved and a  foreigner from Australia.   I know people like to say that there were no Ukrainians involved.  That is totally debunked. The mere fact that Russia has constantly  tried to affect our elections--so has China and so have other  countries--does not mutually exclude the fact that there were  Ukrainians who tried to affect our 2016 election. Exhibit A to me,  Madam Speaker, would be you had the ambassador from Ukraine to the U.S.  write an op-ed trying to prevent Donald Trump from being elected  President.   That is foreign interference within an election. So, anyway, I don't  know where they are getting this stuff, oh, that is Russian propaganda.  The only Russian propaganda that has been the most effective is  propaganda from Russia that wants to divide America, and they have done  a marvelous job at dividing America instead of bringing us together.   One of the other attorneys who resigned all upset about the treatment  of--well, Attorney General Barr wanting them to pull their fangs back  in and not try to be so vengeful simply because Roger Stone was a  friend of the President. There is no indication the President had hired  him to do anything, but they sure went after him because of a  connection.   Michael Marando prosecuted the Imran Awan case. He is the guy who let  him get away with all of this other activity without proper  investigation.   In fact, there was an inspector general here. She ended up being, I  think, president of some international technology organization. She was  amazing. She had all kinds of evidence to prove felony cases against  Imran Awan, but representatives from the U.S. Attorney's Office, I  don't know if it was Michael Marando himself, the FBI, working at their  behest, ended up threatening her: Don't you bring your notebook with  all that evidence.   Then they turned around and later reportedly said: Oh, we interviewed  her, she didn't have anything.   Yes, when you ordered her not to bring it to show you the cases  against Imran Awan.                                time  1230    But that is Michael Marando. He laid him off with a wrist slap. I  don't see how you can find any other basis other than Marando's  political motivation. But he didn't pursue any of these other charges,  and the question still exists.   As I understand, Imran Awan has filed a lawsuit, and it appears his  intention is to try to get back on the gravy train here where he was on  Capitol Hill, to get people to sign up to use him. I think there are  enough people who got burned that it would probably be hard for him to  do.   But a lawsuit, of course, when I heard that he has a lawsuit, that  means discovery is in order. I am hopeful discovery will bring out all  the lies and the crimes that it appears that he has committed. But no  thanks to Michael Marando. He certainly didn't do anything that would  have hurt Democrats on Capitol Hill but went out of his way to want to  destroy Roger Stone.   Aaron Zelensky started his career as a special assistant to Koh, who  was the State Department legal adviser in the Obama administration, but  he has also clerked for what I felt was one of the most liberal judges  ever, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.   He played a key role in obtaining a guilty plea from a guy who was an  adviser at one time, Papadopoulos. This poor guy, he didn't have money.  When the FBI and the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office came after him,  Mueller's people, he didn't have money to fight.   He was being overwhelmed. They intimidated him enough into his  agreeing to plead guilty to a minor charge.   But Zelensky was handpicked by Mueller when he was selecting people  who hated Trump. Zelensky was handpicked to be an investigator in that  probe. Before joining the Mueller team, Zelensky worked for Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.   Anyway, these people certainly had a lot of political baggage. They  were clearly on a vendetta. They weren't pursuing justice. They were  pursuing political vendettas, trying to get at President Trump.   There are tens of millions of dollars that were spent investigating  what we now know was the Russia hoax. There was no collusion or  conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite what people  are trying to allude to now. It wasn't. The evidence wasn't there.  Mueller was disappointed. Weissmann was disappointed. All of these  left-wingers were disappointed that, despite all the intimidation, all  the threats, they couldn't find somebody who could actually implicate  any kind of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and  Russia.   But on Roger Stone's sentencing, when he was convicted, one of the  charges was witness tampering. It sure sounds like he was kidding  around by saying: Hey, I may have to come over and kill your dog.   I mean, who says that if they are not kidding? That is not all that  effective of a threat. But when you have a judge who can't stand the  Trump administration, and you have a juror who gets on--I would really  like to know what kind of questions the jury was asked during voir  dire. If Roger Stone's attorneys did not ask the jury panel their  feelings about Donald Trump, then it sure sounds like that would have  been malpractice. Roger should have a great case against his own  lawyers, plus a great case on appeal for their impropriety as his  attorneys.   But I find it hard to believe they wouldn't ask something about that  because there is clearly some type of Trump derangement system. Some  very smart, well-balanced people get so angry and frustrated over  President Donald Trump that they don't think as straight as they  normally would.   But to have the foreperson of the jury, the head juror who controls  the discussions, shut people down, encourage other people to speak--the  head foreperson hates Donald Trump.   Anyway, it is amazing the efforts that the Department of Justice, at  least the U.S. Attorney's Office, had gone to, to become a tool for  injustice. They wanted to max this guy out, the poor guy. Unbelievable.   I have sent people to prison for life. I have sent people to prison  for 10 years, 9 years. I have had to look people in the eye and order  them to be taken to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and put to  death. Those are serious matters, and you simply cannot let any  [[Page H1150]]  type of vengeance or political persuasion affect you.   I know in east Texas, we have assistant U.S. attorneys who vote  Democrat. But when it comes to enforcing the law, they enforce the law.  They don't care what party you are. And it is so tragic, right here in  our Nation's Capital, our own Justice Department, in our own D.C. U.S.  Attorney's Office, you have people who are not nearly as just and fair  as you find all over the country in most U.S. Attorney's Offices.   Another issue of the local D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office was a guy  named James Wolfe. He was indicted by a Federal grand jury on three  counts of violating title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001. At the time he  made the alleged false statements to the FBI, James Wolfe was director  of security for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and that  was a position he had held for about 29 years.   As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence director of security,  James Wolfe was entrusted with access to classified, secret, and top- secret information provided by the executive branch, including the  United States intelligence community that they provided to the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence.   Wolfe was alleged to have lied to FBI agents in December 2017 about  his repeated contacts with three reporters, including through his use  of encrypted messaging applications. Wolfe is further alleged to have  made false statements to the FBI about providing two reporters with  nonpublic information related to the matters occurring before the  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.   He was sentenced to 2 months in prison, 4 months supervised release  for lying to the FBI. He has to complete 20 hours of community  service--20 hours a month during his release for those 4 months--and  pay a $7,500 fine.    You compare what he did with what Roger Stone did. Roger Stone wasn't  dealing with any classified information, secret or top secret. He used  some bad judgment. But Jesse Liu's attorneys, these four who have now  quit--thank God they quit.   We need to get some people in there where, when it comes to  prosecuting, it doesn't matter what the defendant's political  persuasion is. You seek justice. And there are Democratic and  Republican attorneys, prosecutors, around the country who are quite  capable of doing that. So I sure hope that we will get some better  attorneys in the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office.   It is amazing. I thought about Sergeant York, that movie. I believe  Gary Cooper played Sergeant York. They were in the trenches, and they  couldn't see the bad guys to stop them. He ends up using a turkey call  that he used back when he was turkey hunting. One after another, enemy  soldiers would stick their head up, and he was able to knock them off  and eventually capture this huge group. But in order to prevail, they  had to get them to stick their heads up.   I think that is what this Trump derangement syndrome has done. There  are people who have been working pervasively and, apparently, with  political vendettas, but they have been able to stay below the radar.  Along comes President Trump, and they get so deranged that they expose  who they are.   So I thank all those political opportunists and zealots who use their  position in the U.S. Government, including the Department of Justice,  who have now exposed themselves.   Vindman is one those people who have exposed his animosity, and it is  really good that he is no longer part of the National Security Council.  It is good his brother is no longer in the Office of General Counsel. I  think we will see less leaks now that he is gone from there.   Anyway, we are starting to see those people who have exposed  themselves as political operatives, rather than doing justice, or  following the orders of their Commander in Chief, we are seeing them  exposed. We are seeing them moved out.   I am hoping, in the days ahead, there will be a lot more of that  occurring. I think justice will be served better so the American people  can feel more like--and not one party or another. People need to be  able to feel, as a whole, regardless of the political persuasion of  some prosecutor, that justice is being pursued and done, as it is being  done in so many Federal districts all over the country. It has been a  problem here in Washington, D.C.   When that happens, we will all be better off.   Madam Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
