 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LaHood and  Congresswoman Bustos. It is so good to be here with my friends and  colleagues to join in mourning the loss and celebrating the rich life  of Illinois' own Bob Michel, who passed away this month at the age of  93.   Bob absolutely embodied a uniquely American combination of decency,  civility, a commitment to public service, and a deep patriotism  throughout his long life. Observers across the spectrum agree Bob  Michel defined public service and bipartisanship during his long tenure  in Congress as minority whip and as minority leader.   Bob seemed to be uniquely called to the legislature and the  legislative process. A workhorse instead of a show horse, Leader Michel  steadily pushed forward conservative priorities in the House under both  Democratic and Republican Presidents.   Building relationships across the aisle and promoting civility and  debate helped move legislation through the House Chamber. To him,  treating others with respect and care was essential to making deals and  moving forward solutions to American problems.   And he cared little if he obtained credit for his efforts. As  commented in the National Review, Bob ``made little noise, but made  things work.''   Bob was also a patriot. This son of Illinois was a war hero who  landed at Utah Beach at Normandy. During the war, he was wounded and  awarded two Bronze Stars and the Purple Heart, among other  recognitions. He now joins fellow Americans of that Greatest Generation  whose humble and steady love for country carried us through difficult  seasons.   I wish his family peace and hope during their time of mourning. He  will be deeply missed.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Hultgren for those  wonderful words for Leader Michel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  minority whip.
