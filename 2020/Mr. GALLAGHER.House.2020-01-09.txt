 Mr. Speaker, actually, it takes a lot to get me to  come down to these things, but I have been deeply troubled by some of  the rhetoric I have been hearing about this. In fact, I was deeply  troubled after yesterday when my colleagues, many of them, left a  classified briefing only to immediately and recklessly trash the  quality of intelligence they received, and in some cases, suggest there  was no imminent threat from Soleimani.   To suggest that would require you to ignore the death of Americans  recently in Iraq, as well as ignore the history of Soleimani's campaign  of terror across the Middle East.   We learned this weekend, while this body was still in recess and  before anyone had reviewed any of the classified information, that it  was the intention of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  introduce this flawed War Powers Resolution without having even seen  any of the underlying intelligence. That suggests that this is not a  serious effort.    Mr. Speaker, this is not a serious effort. This is a  political effort that will have the practical effect only of  undermining our military deterrent in the Middle East, which for the  first time in a long time is actually stronger.   I think this does a service not only to our personnel in the region,  but ultimately to the Iranian people. And what the Iranian regime fears  more than anything else, more than the American military and the  President of the United States, is its own people. And that is the  reason Soleimani's death squads have gunned down Iranian civilians in  the streets.    We look forward to the day when the Iranian people can be free of  their evil, barbarous, reckless regime, and I applaud the  administration's actions.
