 Mr. Speaker, it is with deep regret that I rise today to  recognize the lost life of USDA Forest Service official Charles Morton  who died while fighting the El Dorado fire in the San Bernardino  National Forest last Thursday in southern California.   Charlie began his career as a corpsman with the California  Conservation Corps at the Butte Fire Center in Magalia, California, up  in my area, where the Camp fire was known to have raged through there  in 2018. No doubt some of the work that he and his colleagues did in  the area of Magalia then saved a portion of Magalia in what they did.   During the 2006 fire season, he worked with Firestorm Wildland Fire  Suppression in Chico, California. His 14-year forest service culminated  as a Big Bear, California, Interagency Hot Shot Squad Boss in San  Bernardino National Forest.   Charlie's untimely passing is a risk that is, unfortunately, part of  what our valiant firefighters and forest service workers deal with on  the front lines every day. I pray that his family will find peace.   I also pray for the firefighters across the West right now risking it  all to save our public lands, property, families, and wildlife from  wildfire season.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Oregon for  yielding and for his leadership on this bill today. I appreciate the  work in this current bloc on forestry as Oregon, California, and so  much of the West is experiencing yet another year of such devastating  fire.   I want to hearken back to a previous bloc here while I have the  opportunity. It has to do with the Klamath dams that are owned by  PacifiCorp in northern California and Oregon.   Now, there is the need to continue those dams' ability to operate.  Unfortunately, my California colleague on the other side of the aisle  is insisting on an amendment that would make it impossible to continue  that operation even during a time of uncertainty as to the efficacy of  dam removal or whatever the disposal of those will be. It is up in the  air. The science is not clear.   The amendment that is being proposed might be the worst attempt at a  veiled threat that I have seen in a long time on threatening a company  in the operation of current dams. Rather than work with PacifiCorp, the  hope seems to be that the House of Representatives can be used in this  en bloc for a personal vendetta in defying the will of the people in  the area.   The owner of these dams has signed on to both agreements that  contemplated removal under the right conditions. Congress didn't bring  an agreement up for consideration. Local voters overwhelmingly rejected  the dam removal. The corporation that my colleague is attempting to  attack has been supportive for nearly 15 years.    Under the guise of what my colleague would call ``more stringent  reporting requirements,'' this amendment would directly increase power  costs on tens of thousands of rural Americans across the West,  requiring six new studies, reports, and disclosures every year at the  cost of PacifiCorp. Complying with all of this will not be free.  Regular families will see their power costs go up at a time when our  power grid in California especially is in big trouble. This is wrong- headed.
