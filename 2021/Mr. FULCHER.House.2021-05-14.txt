 Mr. Speaker, there is no question that pregnant workers  should be treated fairly and be provided with reasonable accommodations  in the workforce. We are all in favor of commonsense guidelines to  ensure this.   Serving as a subcommittee ranking member in the Education and Labor  Committee, I had the opportunity to dive deeply into this bill and  participate in the full committee markup.   While much of this law is redundant to the two laws that currently  protect pregnant workers, I agree with many of the provisions in the  bill, and it was substantially improved from the version introduced in  2019.   During our markup, I asked for an amendment to clarify one specific  provision before lending my support. My provision singles out religious  organizations by removing the exemption found in nearly every civil  rights bill, including the Civil Rights Act.   Because each religion has its own unique customs, requirements, and  traditions, it is not reasonable to mandate employment decisions that  conflict with people's faith.   By not including this longstanding Civil Rights Act provision, H.R.  1065 is likely to create legal risk for religious organizations.  Pregnancy-discrimination or pregnancy-accommodation laws in at least 16  States and the District of Columbia also include a provision similar to  the Civil Rights Act religious organizations protection.   By adding a simple reference in H.R. 1065 to the Civil Rights Act, we  can harmonize the bill with current law and ensure that religious  organizations receive the same protections as outlined in the Civil  Rights Act. This is the only reasonable thing to do.
