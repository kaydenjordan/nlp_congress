 Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2021 National Defense  Authorization Act stands apart from previous years. Our military  continues countless measures abroad to ensure our security here at  home. This year, they are also called upon to battle the COVID pandemic  at home.   The chairman's bill aligns our national security interests with our  National Defense Strategy. It enables forward movement on the future of  disruptive innovation, challenging business as usual.   Importantly, this bill creates a Pandemic Preparedness and Resilience  National Security Fund. It directs $1 billion to proactively prepare  for and respond to future pandemics.   Additionally, it authorizes an Assistant Secretary to provide  important guidance and support to undergird our defense industrial base  to ensure a supply of materials critical to our national security and  provide extra support to expand the small business industrial base.   Further, it creates a more inclusive military. This range of talents  will benefit our national security as much as weapons and ammunition.   Our obligation as Congress is not to flinch in the face of crisis and  pandemic. We must provide our military with the means to remain a  vigilant and ready force able to defend against any threat to American  values and our way of life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the fiscal year 2021 National  Defense Authorization Act.                            ____________________
