 Madam Speaker, America does not need or  want a war with Iran.   There are no political objectives we can reasonably achieve through  force, and the President must not be allowed to fabricate a pretext for  a conflict that will leave America, our allies, and the whole region  less safe. But that is what he has been doing since tearing up the Iran  nuclear deal and beginning a campaign of maximum pressure.   Today's War Powers Resolution reasserts Congress' authority to  declare war and imposes crucial restrictions on the President; namely,  he cannot start a war without demonstrating an actual threat. This is  something the administration has failed to do, according to  [[Page H77]]  both Democrats and Republicans from yesterday's intelligence briefing.   The best way to constrain the true threat of Iran is through the  multilateral diplomacy that achieved the historic nuclear deal. With  this clear congressional statement that Congress has not authorized a  war, I urge the President to immediately stop his erratic and impulsive  provocations and take us back from the brink.
