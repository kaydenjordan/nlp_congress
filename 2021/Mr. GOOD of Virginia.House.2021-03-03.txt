 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this bill, which represents the worst of Washington: defunding police  in a surprise vote in the middle of the night.   This bill advances the far-left Democrat platform, and would defund  the police through unfunded mandates that cost State and local  departments millions of dollars.   If this weren't bad enough, the bill advances an antipolice agenda  with Washington-knows-best regulations, and puts a target on the backs  of everyday officers by creating a national database of complaints that  have not been adjudicated.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the bill. I stand with law enforcement, and I  am grateful for those who serve on the thin blue line.
