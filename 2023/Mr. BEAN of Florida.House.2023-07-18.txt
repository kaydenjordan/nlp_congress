 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Foxx for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, what do parents worry about? According to a National PTA  survey, American parents worry most about their child being bullied,  and they worry about their child struggling socially and emotionally.   What is not on the list? Their school being taken over by illegal  immigrants. You would think American parents wouldn't have to worry  about that, but yet here we are, because this is crazy town, and here  in crazy town, the Biden administration is fixated on transforming  America's public schools, our institutions for learning, into shelters  for illegal immigrants.   It is happening now, and we are already seeing elementary and  secondary school facilities in cities like New York being converted  into housing for immigrants who have illegally crossed our border.   Let me be clear. This type of activity emphasizes the notion that an  open border is the new normal. This is an attack on law and order and  on American families who pay taxes into these schools so their children  can get a good educational foundation.   Housing illegal immigrants in school facilities creates a host of  issues, including safety hazards, security threats, health risks for  our children, and let's not forget, America's students are facing  severe learning loss because of school closures during the COVID-19  pandemic.   I believe our schools are for educating students, not for supporting  unhinged policies.   I believe teachers should be our educators, not ICE agents.   I believe school gyms and rec spaces should be for physical education  and not for motel rooms.   House Republicans are calling President Biden into the principal's  office. We refuse to let this happen, and that is why we are tackling  this issue head-on with H.R. 3941, the Schools Not Shelters Act.   It says no to this dangerous initiative that threatens our children  and distracts our schools from their core mission--to educate America's  kids.
