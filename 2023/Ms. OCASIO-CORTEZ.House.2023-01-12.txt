 Madam Speaker, I wish to congratulate the nurses  of Mount Sinai and Monetfiore Medical Center who, after 3 days on  strike, reached a tentative agreement for safe staffing ratios this  morning. Our hospitals are facing extreme nursing shortages, and it is  affecting patient care.   Montefiore Medical Center, which is in my district, has had 760  vacancies. But thanks to the tentative agreement and the courage and  efforts of our nurses on the picket line, hospital management is now  committing to an aggressive hiring plan and to immediately implement  staffing ratios, including an increase of over 170 nursing positions  and a 19.1 percent wage increase and additional benefits to help with  retention.   I thank so much the New York State Nurses Association, NYSNA, for  their work. It is our privilege to stand in solidarity with them.                            ____________________
