 Mr. Speaker, we are here today to fulfill one of Congress'  most basic responsibilities: to fund our government and keep it working  for the people.   We are not doing that very well. It is the 23rd of December, the day  before Christmas Eve. The weather is bad, Members--we will see how  many--are here to fulfill their duty. This sweeping package is anything  but garbage, as the previous speaker intoned.   It is, in fact, the essence of supporting our national security, our  domestic security, and the welfare of our people. That is not garbage.   This sweeping package secures full-year appropriations for fiscal  year 2023.   In reality, Mr. Speaker, this bill should have been passed in  September of this year.   Why?   Because the fiscal year ends on September 30, and fiscal year 2023  begins on October 1 of this year.   The Senate had not passed a single appropriation bill by the end of  the last fiscal year to provide for the fiscal year in which we are now  operating. That ought to be unacceptable for the 535 of us who have  been sent here to represent the American people in a responsible way  and in a way that reflects that we are adults seized with the  responsibility that the American people expect us to meet. Today, too  late--but never too late to do the right thing--we will meet that  responsibility.    I thank Chairwoman DeLauro, Ranking Member Granger, their colleagues  and staff on the House Appropriations Committee, and the staff  director, all who have worked round the clock to help us achieve an end  which must be achieved every year. This does not come as a surprise to  any of us that we have to fund the government of the United States of  America.   So I thank each and every member of the staff of the House  Appropriations Committee.   Indeed, I thank Mr. Leahy and Mr. Shelby, the chair and ranking  member of the Appropriations Committee in the United States Senate.  They wanted to get this job done. They wanted to get this job done in a  timely fashion. But unfortunately, the United States Senate has become  enamored with doing an omnibus at the last second. That ought to be a  disappointment for every Member of this body and every American.   As an appropriator myself, I know how much work the committee and the  staff perform behind the scenes to keep our government operating, and I  commend them all for advancing all 12 of the regular appropriation  bills for fiscal year 2023 out of their committee in June of this  year--in June--while our colleagues in the Senate had not passed any by  September 30.   We passed six of those bills through this House, Mr. Speaker. We sent  them to the Senate, and they have not been taken up.   Indeed, for the last 4 years, our House majority has passed  legislation to fund almost all of the government by the end of summer.  Only, Mr. Speaker, by fulfilling this most basic duty can Congress  start to make progress on its other obligations to the American people.   Now, Mr. Speaker, as you know and as my colleagues know, I am  stepping down as the majority leader. But I am returning to the  Appropriations Committee, and I pray that I will have some ability and  can make some contribution to effecting a rational appropriations  process which pursues regular order, and which understands that we  ought to pass every appropriation bill through this House, every one,  all 12, by the end of June, which accepts the premise in the United  States Senate they ought to pass their appropriation bills by the end  of June.   Then we ought to spend July, August, and September in resolving the  differences that exist between the Senate and the House on funding  priorities. Then by September 30, we will have passed all of those  bills and we will have avoided this funding by crisis and avoided this  last-minute, Christmas Eve performance of our duties.   Only by fulfilling this most basic duty can Congress start to make  progress. We have a responsibility to address issues that undermine the  strength and prosperity of American workers and families. That is why  this omnibus includes measures to lower costs for Americans by  expanding nutrition assistance programs, increasing  [[Page H10062]]  funding for childcare, making a greater investment in reducing monthly  utility bills, and enhancing retirement savings.   That, Mr. Speaker, is not garbage. That is critical action that this  House has a responsibility and a duty to our country and to our  constituents to perform, and we should have performed it in a timely  fashion. But as I said earlier, it is never too late to do the right  thing. This is simply not the right way to do it, but it must, should,  and will be done today.   From hurricanes to wildfires, natural disasters and the climate  crisis are a growing threat to Americans across the country.  Fortunately, this bill secures $38 billion in supplemental  appropriations to help these communities rebuild after disasters and  strengthen themselves against future ones.   That is not garbage. That is essential action that this House and  that the Senate and the President of the United States ought to  perform. We ought to perform it in a timely fashion. But let me again  repeat: it is never too late to do the right thing. And we will do that  today.   This omnibus also advances Congress' sacred obligation to uphold  American democracy. I congratulate the Thompson-Cheney committee for  the report that it has issued to protect and preserve our Constitution  and our democracy and to call attention to the American public that one  person--one person, albeit a President of the United States--was the  reason that our democracy and our Constitution and the election of our  President was put at risk. I congratulate the members of that  commission for the extraordinary courage that they have shown standing  up, telling the truth, and letting the American people know why January  6 occurred and letting the American people know who was responsible-- one person--for that threat to our democracy, our Constitution, and the  election, a peaceful regular order election of the President of the  United States.   This bill that we are going to consider includes provisions that  reform the Electoral Count Act which we saw on that day of January 6  were wanting, were unclear, and were used incorrectly to put at risk  our democracy.   The Electoral Count Act included in this bill will clarify, once and  for all, that the Vice President's role in overseeing the count of  electoral votes is purely ceremonial.   Let us thank Vice President Pence who had the courage and the  intellectual integrity to pursue that premise that his duties were  ceremonial only. Indeed, this provision points out that no individual  neither can nor ought to be able to overturn the will of the American  people.   This precaution, I tell my colleagues, will ensure that we never see  a repeat of the shameful and malicious attack on our democracy on  January 6 last year. Our obligation, Mr. Speaker, to uphold democracy  and freedom also extends beyond our borders, especially to the people  of Ukraine as they fight courageously and at great cost for their  democracy and, indeed, for the democracy that exists in every nation  that embraces democracy on this globe.                                time  0930    On Wednesday, President Zelenskyy made the perilous journey to speak  with us about his country's struggle for freedom and democracy.   Winston Churchill, as Speaker Pelosi pointed out, visited this  Chamber shortly after that day of infamy in December of 1941. His  Nation, like President Zelenskyy's, was under siege from the Nazis, and  he came to speak to us of freedom. He came to speak to us of our  critical role in helping to defend freedom.   As John Kennedy said here and around the world, we are a beacon of  freedom, a beacon of light; a city on the hill, a shining city, that  Ronald Reagan referred to.   We are a Nation to whom other nations look for helping them to  protect their freedom, but in a much larger sense, the freedom of all  freedom-embracing people of the world.   That President Zelenskyy chose to come here to this Capitol on his  first visit outside Ukraine since Russia's criminal invasion, risking  his own life and safety, says as much about his personal courage as it  does about our role in preserving democracy around the world.   On 9/11, people who hated freedom, people who hated the symbol of  freedom, flew three planes: one into the World Trade Center; one into  the Pentagon; and one, Mr. Speaker, that I am convinced was designed to  decapitate the dome of the Capitol, that symbol of democracy for all  the world, that symbol of our democracy.   They failed because of the courage of the passengers on the airliner  designed to decapitate the Capitol and took it down and gave their own  lives that that mission would not be completed as that plane crashed  into a field in Pennsylvania.   This bill invests in freedom. It invests in democracy. It invests in  a world order based upon law and not based upon threats and military  might.   America has the power to provide Ukraine with the tools needed to  defend its freedom. This legislation includes nearly $45 billion in  additional aid to help Ukrainians in that critical, important, world- saving effort.   In his remarks on Wednesday, President Zelenskyy said that he needed  our help, that he needed our support. He needed weapons with which to  respond to Russia's criminal activities.   Today's counteroffensive by those who defend democracy has already  liberated the people of Kherson, Kharkiv, Lyman, and other places in  the Donbas.   Reporters ask me, Mr. Speaker: How much are you willing to spend to  defend Ukraine?   My response, Mr. Speaker: Whatever it takes.   Freedom, as we know, is not free. Our Founding Fathers pledged their  lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor against a great power,  Great Britain, to give us freedom, to establish, as Lincoln pointed  out, on the face of the Earth a ``government of the people, by the  people, for the people,'' not a government of force, not a government  of intimidation, not a government of military might, but of the people,  for the people, and by the people.   This bill reflects the American people's will to do just that.  American aid allowed the Ukrainians to hold the line and push their  invaders back.   As President Zelenskyy made clear to us on Wednesday night, his  country will need our continued support to bring an end to this war,  which must come by way of a strategic defeat for Vladimir Putin, one of  the great war criminals in the history of the world. This aid is an  investment in the future of democracy and the safety of the free world.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a critically important piece of  legislation, not only to keep our government funded and to keep our  people being served, but also to show that the United States of  America's government works.   The vote last night, Mr. Speaker, in the United States Senate was 68- 29. Over two-thirds of the United States Senate stood and said that it  is time to do our duty. They did it not because each and every one of  those Senators thought that this bill was perfect. It is not.   This bill should, as I said earlier, have been passed in one form or  another to fund all the objects of our government spending by September  30 of this year, but we must do it today--the earlier, the better.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes,'' showing the  world that we will never remain idle in the face of those who believe  they can terrorize civilians, devour territory, and commit war crimes  with impunity.   Vote ``yes'' to fulfill our duty to the American people and our  Nation's founding principles.   Vote ``yes'' to keep our government open and serving the people.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, I will return to the Appropriations  Committee, and I look forward to working with Ms. DeLauro; with the new  chair of the committee; with Mrs. Murray, who is going to chair the  committee in the United States Senate, Senator Murray; and with all of  my Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues to do our duty in a  timely, effective fashion.   I urge all of my colleagues, as you listen, as you sit in this  Chamber, as you reflect upon your service in the Congress of the United  States and to our constituents, that you make a pledge to yourself, to  your people, and to your country that this coming year, we will do our  work in a timely and responsible fashion. Vote for this critically  essential piece of legislation.  [[Page H10063]]                                ____________________
