 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an El Paso  hero, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Eugene Chisolm, who was inducted  yesterday into the 82nd Airborne Division's All American Hall of Fame.   Colonel Chisolm, known affectionately as Colonel Bob back home, is a  true role model of service to our Nation.   A combat veteran of three wars, Colonel Chisolm has a storied past.  He made a combat parachute jump into Normandy on D-day and another into  Holland, where he would assume command of more than 80 men after higher  ranked officers fell, earning him the only Legion of Merit awarded to a  noncommissioned officer in World War II.   He sustained grave injuries during the Battle of the Bulge and went  on to command a company in the 31st Infantry during the Korean  conflict. He later led soldiers in the Joint U.S. Military Advisory  Group in Thailand and as Chief of the War Games Branch at Fort  Leavenworth.   The All American Hall of Fame at Fort Bragg preserves the legacy of  service and the iconic contributions of the 82nd Airborne Division. It  is fitting that this courageous, lifelong soldier be honored.   To Colonel Chisolm, whom I am so honored to know, we thank him for  his incredible, courageous leadership and service, and I offer him my  heartfelt congratulations.                            ____________________
