 Madam Speaker, ``Our Nation honors her sons  and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew  and a people they never met.'' This is the quote you will find at our  Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.   Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the 71st anniversary of the Korean  war, to honor the more than 5.7 million Americans who served, including  the 2.25 million Korean war veterans alive today, and to remember the  more than 36,000 Americans and 1 million South Korean civilians and  soldiers who gave their lives to protect freedom.   As an immigrant from South Korea whose family lived through the  Korean war, and as a wife and sister of veterans, I know that I am here  because of the sacrifices of our brave Korean war veterans.   This is personal to me. Words alone cannot express how grateful I am.   Freedom is not free, and each of you stands as a reminder of our  Nation's commitment to freedom and to the safety and security of our  allies in South Korea.                            ____________________
