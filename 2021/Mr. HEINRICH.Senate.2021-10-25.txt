 Madam President, Rudolfo Anaya's writing  captured the beauty of New Mexico's landscapes and the strength and  resilience of our people. It is a testament to the power of his  literary work that so many New Mexicans recognize themselves and their  families in the characters of his award-winning novels. Known to many  as the godfather of Chicano literature, Mr. Anaya taught all of us to  cherish the rich traditions, cultural heritage, and deep-rooted  communities in our State.   Mr. Anaya was born and raised in Pastura and Santa Rosa, small  communities in Guadalupe County. His childhood experiences on the  desert flatlands of the Lllano Estacado later inspired much of his best  work. After his family moved to the historic Barelas neighborhood of  Albuquerque, Mr. Anaya attended Albuquerque High School and the  University of New Mexico. Through many decades as a lifetime educator,  Mr. Anaya taught and mentored students in Albuquerque Public Schools  and at the University of New Mexico.   In 1972, Mr. Anaya published his coming-of-age novel, ``Bless Me,  Ultima,'' about a young boy's search for spirituality and his sense of  place. The novel broke new ground by centering the unique experiences,  complex cultural identities, and deep-rootedness of Hispanic and  Chicano New Mexicans. ``Bless Me, Ultima'' has stirred the hearts of  countless readers over the years and inspired adaptations for theater,  a feature film, and an opera. On a personal note, reading ``Bless Me,  Ultima,'' was also an important part of the experiences and events that  led my wife, Julie, and I to settle and raise our family in New Mexico.   Over the course of his prolific literary career, Mr. Anaya wrote a  wide range of novels, stories, nonfiction essays, and poetry that  captured the spirit and culture of New Mexico. In 2002, he was awarded  the National Medal for the Arts by President George W. Bush and the  National Endowment for the Arts. He was awarded the National Humanities  Medal by President Barack Obama and the National Endowment for the  Humanities in 2016.   Rudolfo Anaya leaves behind a legacy that will never be forgotten. As  we remember his incredible life, my thoughts are with his family, the  countless people he mentored and taught, and everyone who experienced  the power of reading his work. I am certain I join so many others in  our State in honoring and lifting up the life of this quintessential  New Mexican.                            ____________________
