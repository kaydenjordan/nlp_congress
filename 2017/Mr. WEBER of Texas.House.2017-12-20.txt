 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, December 15, Brazoria  County lost one of its great community leaders, Ms. Evelyn Wright  Moore.   Evelyn dedicated her entire life to early childhood development and  education. In 1975, in fact, she started her career as the Brazoria  County Head Start coordinator; and, after a very short 8 years with  that organization, she was running the show and continued running that  show for the rest of her life. Evelyn made sure her students were  receiving the support that would allow them to thrive in that  community.   Brazoria County Head Start now enrolls just over 490 students, thanks  to her. That program was championed by Evelyn's passion and her devout  dedication to those same students.   She and I met many times over the years, both in Brazoria and here in  Washington, D.C., and I will greatly miss our conversations. The legacy  of Evelyn's servant heart will long be remembered and cherished.   Evelyn, my dear friend, you are now safe in the arms of Jesus.                            ____________________
