 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  service of Alfred ``Al'' Hoffmeister.   Throughout his life, Al had shown incredible dedication to his  community and his country. He was a World War II veteran, serving in  the U.S. Army Air Corps, and later in life when he returned home to  California, he worked as a metal trading manager at Kaiser Aluminum of  Oakland, California.   Al worked for Kaiser for 25 years, retiring in 1989. In his  retirement, he was a strong advocate for our community's youth, serving  as a leader with the YMCA and the Concord American Little League board.  He also worked with the Boy and Girl Scouts of America.   Al was dedicated to his faith and was an original member of the St.  Bonaventure Catholic Church in Concord where he served as an usher for  many years.   Sadly, Al passed away recently, but he will be remembered for his  humility, hardworking nature, and devotion to his family, his  community, and this country.   Please join me in honoring Alfred Hoffmeister for his many  contributions to our country.                            ____________________
