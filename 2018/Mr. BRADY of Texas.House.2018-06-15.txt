 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of World Blood  Donor Day and to celebrate and thank the 7 million Americans who choose  to donate blood each year.   Generosity saved the life of my dear friend and roommate, Congressman   Steve Scalise, after a shooter attacked our fellow colleagues and  teammates on the ball field during an early morning baseball practice a  year ago.   Blood can't be manufactured, so our entire national supply depends on  the selfless generosity of our blood donors. Because donated blood is  perishable, it has a limited shelf life and has to be continually  replenished.   Volunteer blood donations ensure that patients in need always have  access to the lifesaving gift of blood. In the summer, we see a big  drop in donations exactly at the time when people are out and about and  need it the most.   I encourage my colleagues to visit their local blood center and help  promote awareness. Be there for someone else. Give blood and share  life.
