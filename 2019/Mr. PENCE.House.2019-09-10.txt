 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support for the Army  National Guard's proposal to station a cyber battalion at Atterbury- Muscatatuck in Indiana's Sixth District.   The Indiana National Guard's existing capabilities, programs, and  infrastructures make the Hoosier State an  [[Page H7564]]  ideal location for a cyber battalion. Home to the Department of  Defense's only live, full-scale cyber range, Muscatatuck Urban Training  Center boasts cutting-edge technology that is only a stone's throw away  from national experts at the Naval Surface Warfare Center--Crane.   I am thankful for the opportunity to have visited Camp Atterbury and  Muscatatuck a few weeks ago, and I hope that soon we are able to  welcome the next cyber battalion to the Hoosier State.          Supporting the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Federal  Motor Carrier Safety Administration Hours of Service proposal to  improve safety and increase flexibility for truck drivers.   Over 80 percent of Hoosiers depend on the trucking industry to keep  their businesses moving. Reducing these burdensome regulations will  help Hoosiers and all Americans.   As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  providing flexibility for our truckers is my top priority. Thank you,  Secretary Chao, for supporting commonsense proposals to increase the  safety of our Nation's roads.                       Supporting Passage of the USMCA     Madam Speaker, I rise today to reiterate my commitment to  passing the USMCA, a deal that will lead to strong economic growth for  Hoosiers and the American people.   The USMCA will generate tens of billions of dollars and create over  175,000 new American jobs. Why won't Speaker Pelosi act? This agreement  would rebalance trade for American manufacturing, increase market  access for agriculture, and level the playing field for our small  businesses.   While back in my district, I met with Hoosier farmers and  manufacturers who told me the same thing: Congress needs to act now.  Pass the USMCA. I urge my colleagues to put partisan politics aside and  ratify the USMCA on behalf of our farmers, ranchers, businesses, and  all American workers.                 Thanking the U.S. Department of Agriculture     Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the U.S. Department  of Agriculture for standing with Hoosier farmers. They have faced  hardship due to adverse weather conditions. Indiana farmers experienced  prolonged rains, negatively impacting their ability to plant corn and  soybeans before crop insurance deadlines passed.   Just 2 weeks ago, Secretary Perdue declared 74 counties across the  Hoosier State eligible for Federal assistance. On behalf of Indiana's  Sixth District, I want to thank the Secretary for assisting farmers  faced with a shortened growing season and a small harvest with access  to this critical help.                         Supporting Broadband Access     Madam Speaker, I rise today regarding an issue impacting  constituents in every corner of Indiana's Sixth District. My district  ranks among the lowest in the Nation in regard to broadband access.   According to the FCC, 42 percent of Hoosiers in rural areas of my  district are without high speed broadband internet. That puts almost  half of my constituents in rural communities at a disadvantage. This is  not unique to my district. Over 16.8 million rural Americans across  this Nation are lacking adequate access to a broadband connection.   We must ensure rural America is not left behind. We must close the  digital divide.                            ____________________
