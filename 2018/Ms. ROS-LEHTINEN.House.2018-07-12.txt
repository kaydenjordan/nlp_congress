 Mr. Speaker, next Wednesday, July 18, marks 24  years since the horrific terrorist attack on the AMIA Jewish community  center in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   This attack, carried out by the Iranian-backed terror group  Hezbollah, left 85 innocent people dead and many more wounded. It shook  the entire Jewish community in Argentina, and all across South America,  who were targeted by Hezbollah just 2 years earlier with a deadly  attack at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which left 29 dead and  250 wounded.   The AMIA bombing remains the deadliest terror attack in Argentina's  history, yet its perpetrators and those responsible for the Embassy  bombing have yet to be brought to justice. But that has not been for  lack of trying. In fact, Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman had  dedicated his life to identifying those responsible and to bringing  them to justice.   Indeed, my friend Alberto ultimately gave his life in this pursuit,  having been assassinated just hours before he was to present his  complaint to a court implicating then-President Cristina Fernandez de  Kirchner and other high-ranking Argentine officials for covering up  Iran's role in the bombings.    In 2015, President Macri of Argentina made the brave decision to  assign a special prosecutor to investigate and uncover the truth  surrounding  [[Page H6118]]  Nisman's death, which, under the Kirchner government, was ruled a  suicide. But we knew the truth all along, and ultimately the official  report released in 2017 confirmed that Nisman was, in fact, murdered,  no doubt by those close to Iran and Hezbollah, or those implicated in  Alberto's investigation.   Mr. Speaker, this is just the first step in vindicating the work for  which he was murdered. But we still have a very long way to go to bring  Alberto Nisman justice and see the culmination of his work, which is to  hold Hezbollah accountable for these brutal terror attacks against the  Jewish community in Argentina.   Last year, I, along with Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and  Congressmen Ted Deutch, Jeff Duncan, and Albio Sires, introduced H.  Res. 201, which expressed support for the government of Argentina for  its investigation of the AMIA bombing in 1994 and the bombing of the  Israeli Embassy in 1992. The resolution also calls on our government to  assist Argentina in ensuring all those responsible for these heinous  acts are held accountable.   I would urge the Argentine authorities to do everything within their  power to bring all responsible parties to justice and to bring at least  some form of closure to the families of over 100 killed by Hezbollah in  Argentina. Argentina owes them that much. And we all owe them a chance  to see Iran and Hezbollah held accountable for their horrific acts of  terror.   Though the AMIA bombing was 24 years ago, and the embassy bombing 26  years ago, the Jewish communities still feel the pain, and because  Hezbollah is allowed to go unchecked in many places around the globe,  they know that another attack may be possible anywhere in the world.   To commemorate the AMIA bombing, and in remembrance of the lives  brutally taken, the American Jewish community's Belfer Institute for  Latino and Latin American Affairs will be co-hosting a memorial and  candle lighting ceremony with the Skylake Synagogue in North Miami  Beach. The south Florida Jewish community holds this event annually to  not only commemorate the victims of this attack, but to bring attention  to the threat that is Iran and Hezbollah, as well as the hostility and  the discrimination that Jews around the world are still facing and the  rising tide of anti-Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, as the 24th anniversary of the AMIA bombing nears, let  us remember the lives lost and continue working so that these acts do  not happen again, and let us work to ensure that Iran and Hezbollah may  never be able to carry out such terrible acts again.   Thank you to the south Florida community members for putting together  this event and for their work to help bring justice to the families of  the lives lost.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  friend, the Honorable Judge Cindy Lederman, upon her retirement from  the Miami-Dade juvenile court.   Upon starting her work in a juvenile court in 1994, Judge Lederman  quickly discovered a child welfare system in turmoil. She witnessed the  voices of the children coming in and out of the court being lost in the  maelstrom of domestic violence and endless custody hearings. Cindy  campaigned to tie the science behind child psychology to the law,  making it her mission to transform the system into one that focuses on  the well-being of the children.   In her career, Judge Lederman has tirelessly and gracefully presided  over some of the most important cases of our State, including striking  down the State's discriminatory gay adoption ban.   Mr. Speaker, Cindy has my appreciation for her transformative impact  on the Miami-Dade children's court. Her retirement marks the end of an  era, and she leaves an impressive legacy. I truly wish Judge Cindy  Lederman all the best in the next chapter of her life.                            ____________________
