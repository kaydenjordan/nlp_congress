 Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to the Make  America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a constrained fiscal environment, and we need  to make smart choices about the future of our country. I am  disappointed to see that many of the choices that the Republican  leaders have made in this bill are completely out of balance with the  needs of the American people.   Republicans have chosen to exclude eight of the appropriations bills  from this legislation: funding for roads and bridges to drive on,  quality healthcare for our family, protecting our clean air and our  drinking water, and the education of future generations. These critical  investments that all Americans depend upon are left by the wayside with  no path forward.   Republicans have chosen to put forward a bill that exceeds the  defense caps by $72 billion. With no budget agreement in sight, this  bill would trigger sequestration cuts that our military leaders have  warned us would have catastrophic consequences for our men and women in  uniform.   Republicans have also once again declined to make commonsense cuts to  defense spending by denying the Pentagon's request for a new BRAC  round. Make no mistake: this will waste billions of dollars over the  next decade.   At a time when countries like China are emphasizing research and  investments in clean energy, Republicans have chosen to eliminate  funding for ARPA-E, doing great harm--great harm--to America's global  competitiveness in advanced research energy.   Mr. Speaker, these choices are simply unacceptable to my constituents  and to the American people, and I urge my Republican colleagues to work  with Democrats to put forward appropriate funding bills that will  advance the appropriations bills for all of America and to make America  the strong country it should be.
