 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment  that I coauthored.   In my home, California's Central Valley, communities are running out  of clean water, we would consider drinking water. They are unable to  shower, unable to cook for their families, and unable to stay cool  during intense heat.   Madam Chair, the thought of having to bathe your children, cook food,  and to stay alive with small bottles of water, that is the gist of this  amendment.   Extreme drought and outdated water infrastructure have forced small,  rural communities to truck in water every day. This amendment  authorizes $250 million in grants to improve water access for small  rural communities suffering from drinking water shortages.   My amendment is supported by small communities, local nonprofits, and  those dedicated to helping underserved communities like Self-Help  Enterprises and the Tulare County Board of Supervisors.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter from Self-Help  Enterprises.                                          Self-Help Enterprises,                                                      July 26, 2022.      Re Conway/McCarthy Amendment to H.R. 5118, Wildfire Response           and Drought Resiliency Act.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Connie Conway,      Washington, DC.        Dear Minority Leader McCarthy and Representative Conway: I       am writing on behalf of Self-Help Enterprises to extend our       support for your amendment to the Wildfire Response and       Drought Resiliency Act (H.R. 5118). The McCarthy/Conway       amendment will provide much-needed funding to facilitate       drought resiliency and water system consolidations.        This amendment ensures access to funding to augment water       supplies by larger water systems who extend water service to       smaller disadvantaged communities. It will also allow them to       cover the costs of service extension. One example of this       need is found in Tulare County, California, where Self-Help       Enterprises has been working with the community of Tooleville       (population 500) to connect to the City of Exeter's water       system (population 10,400). Exeter, while an incorporated       city with a mid-sized population, is still small and lacks       the resources or legal authority to spend City funds on the       water system consolidation project. Meanwhile, Tooleville's       small water system is struggling with the effects of drought       and overpumping of groundwater by surrounding uses, and its       two wells (drilled in the 1970s) fail on a regular basis. For       that reason, Self-Help Enterprises has installed temporary       storage tanks and is hauling water to fill these tanks on an       as-needed basis.        It's important that cities and larger communities can       access this type of funding regardless of their own       population size, so that they can work in good conscience to       help their neighbors without jeopardizing the well-being of       their own residents.        Therefore, we urge the adoption of the Conway/McCarthv       amendment to H.R. 5118 by the House of Representatives. We       thank you for your attention to the needs of the rural       communities of the San Joaquin Valley. For questions or more       information, please don't hesitate to contact Jessi Snyder of       our staff.            Sincerely,                                               Thomas J. Collishaw,                                                     President/CEO.     While there are many more issues to be addressed in the  larger bill, this will directly help rural Americans in critical need  of assistance and underserved members of our communities.   Madam Chair, I urge Members to support this amendment.
