 Mr. Speaker, later this month, Prime  Minister Narendra Modi of India will return for a state visit to  Washington.   As the son of a World War II Army Air Corps Flying Tiger who served  in India, I grew up with an appreciation of the hardworking people of  India.   The existing U.S.-India partnership has been highlighted by Prime  Minister Modi being warmly welcomed here in the House Chamber, Madison  Square Garden, and ``Howdy, Modi'' in Houston.   The 4-million-strong Indian-American community has achieved the  highest per capita income of all immigrant populations in America, with  political success symbolized by Governor, Ambassador, and Republican  Presidential candidate Nikki Haley of South Carolina.   With India as the largest democracy and America as the oldest  democracy, both have shared values of democracy with rule of law  opposing authoritarians with rule of gun. India is well represented by  Ambassador Taranjit Sandhu and Atlanta Consul General Dr. Swati  Kulkarni.   Congratulations Houston Zachary Wilson graduating today from Beaufort  High School, South Carolina, to attend Southern Methodist University in  Dallas, Texas.                            ____________________
