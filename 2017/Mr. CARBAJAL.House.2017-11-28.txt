 Mr. Speaker, as the Member of Congress representing the  ``Camp 4'' property addressed in H.R. 1491, which would reaffirm the  action of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for the  Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians, I would like to take this  opportunity to express my support for the amended version of the bill  under consideration today which incorporates the recently completed  local agreement between Santa Barbara County and the Chumash Tribe.   I have a unique perspective on this issue, having previously served  as a Santa Barbara County Supervisor for twelve years. During my  tenure, the issue of Camp 4 was deliberated before the Board of  Supervisors on several occasions. During those discussions, I was one  of the first elected officials to consistently call for direct  government-to-government discussions between the Chumash Tribe and the  County. I am pleased to see that those ensuing negotiations have now  resulted in an agreement that addresses the Tribe's well documented  need for tribal housing while providing for important mitigations to  address potential impacts on public views, traffic, local tax revenues,  and the natural environment.   I believe that the locally negotiated agreement concerning Camp 4  between the Tribe and the County, which is incorporated in today's  amended version of H.R. 1491, is in the best interest of my  constituents and is an important step toward establishing a long-term  collaborative relationship between all parties involved.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1491, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
