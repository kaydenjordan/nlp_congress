 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American pioneer  and one of the greatest heroines of our time, Mrs. Rosa Parks on the  66th anniversary of her arrest in Montgomery, Alabama.   Today, 66 years ago, Rosa Parks took a bold stand against racial  discrimination by refusing to give up her seat on a public bus in  Montgomery, Alabama. Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat did more  than simply desegregate the bus systems of Montgomery. Her dignified  courage inspired a movement that changed our Nation.   Rosa Parks' quiet refusal to surrender her seat to a White passenger  on December 1, 1955, sparked a city-wide boycott of the Montgomery bus  system that lasted 1 whole year and broke the very will of a city  heavily steeped in segregation.   Biographer Douglas Brinkley recounted the powerful moment in his  biography of Rosa Parks, he writes:         Are you going to stand up? the driver demanded. Rosa Parks       looked straight at him and said, No. Flustered and not quite       sure what to do, the bus driver retorted: Well, I'm going       to have you arrested. And Rosa Parks sat next to the       window, and quietly said: You may do that.    Her soft yet forceful response led to an arrest, a $10 fine, and the  beginning of the most important demonstration in American history. The  Montgomery bus boycott stands as a powerful testament of the will of a  disenfranchised people to work collectively to achieve extraordinary  social change.  [[Page H6716]]    Today, while we commemorate the progress that has been made, we must  also recommit ourselves to the struggle and the fight for equal  justice. We must remain vigilant in the struggle for voting rights,  criminal justice reform, and economic equity.   Foot soldiers like Rosa Parks, Claudette Colvin, and Attorney Fred  Gray, whose lifelong work in the fight for justice and equality still  resonate with us today and reminds us that we cannot take for granted  the battles endured by those before us; nor must we neglect our own  responsibility to ensure liberty and justice.   As benefactors of the sacrifices of these brave men and women, we  must be willing to answer the modern day call and to dare to be  trailblazers on our own. Rosa Parks' quiet refusal to surrender her  seat on December 1, 1955, inspired generations of others to continue  her legacy by standing up for the values that our democracy holds dear.   Because of her contributions, I am proud to join with Congressman    Jim Cooper and CBC Chairwoman Joyce Beatty in introducing the Rosa  Parks Day Act, which would designate today, December 1, as a new  Federal holiday in her honor.   This bill will ensure that her brave sacrifice lives on in American  history and serves as a reminder to continue to protect the gains that  we have made over 60 years ago while tackling the challenges that  plague this Nation today.   While we honor the guardian of the Montgomery bus boycott today, we  must also acknowledge her sacrifices and do our own responsibility as a  call to action. Though Jim Crow is no more, there are modern-day  challenges that require the time and talents of each of us. We must  remain vigilant in seeking justice for the countless Black Americans  that fall victim to police brutality.   We must remain vigilant in our commitment to continuing the fight to  protect the sacred right to vote. We owe Rosa Parks and so many others  nothing less.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 389.       members recorded pursuant to house resolution 8, 117th congress       Barragan (Beyer)      Bucshon (Walorski)      Bustos (Brownley)      Cardenas (Soto)      Casten (Foster)      Crist (Wasserman Schultz)      DeFazio (Carbajal)      Demings (Soto)      Fulcher (Johnson (OH))      Hagedorn (Moolenaar)      Johnson (TX) (Jeffries)      Khanna (Raskin)      Lawrence (Johnson (GA))      Lawson (FL) (Evans)      Lesko (Miller (WV))      Moore (UT) (Curtis)      Palazzo (Fleischmann)      Payne (Norcross)      Porter (Wexton)      Posey (Cammack)      Ruiz (Aguilar)      Rush (Quigley)      Schneider (Wasserman Schultz)      Stewart (Curtis)      Swalwell (Gomez)      Tiffany (Arrington)      Underwood (Quigley)      Vela (Gomez)      Watson Coleman (Norcross)      Wilson (FL) (Hayes)                            ____________________
