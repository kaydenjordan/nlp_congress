 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  public servant, community leader, philanthropist, and cherished Hudson  County legend, former Congressman Frank Guarini, who celebrated his  99th birthday last month.   Congressman Guarini served in the House for 14 years on behalf of  many of the cities and towns that I today have the privilege to serve.   He started his career in public service when he joined the Navy,  protecting our country and the Pacific theater during World War II  aboard the USS Mount McKinley.   He was later elected to the New Jersey State Senate, where he was  known as a relentless advocate for the residents of Hudson County,  helping to pave the way for the development of our waterfront  communities.   After he was elected to Congress in 1978, he worked to support our  communities and future generations of Americans, spearheading the  Educational Assistance Act, which created tax incentives for those  seeking a college education.    Congressman Guarini also quickly became known as an expert on  international affairs, serving as a delegate to NATO, promoting trade  with Caribbean and Latin American countries, and supporting diplomacy  through economic development.   After retiring from Congress in 1993, he continued his service to our  country as a United States representative to the General Assembly of  the United Nations.   As a private citizen, Congressman Guarini found success as an  attorney and real estate developer, success that he has shared many  times over as a philanthropist.   Today, the Congressman Frank J. Guarini Library at New Jersey City  University stands to recognize his service and selfless generosity.   His name also stands on the Frank J. Guarini Post Office Building,  Jersey City's main United States Postal Service facility, as well as  the Frank J. Guarini School of Business at Saint Peter's University in  Jersey City and John Cabot University in Rome, Italy.  [[Page H4304]]    I am honored to congratulate him on his 99th birthday in the place  where he so strongly advocated for our communities time and time again.   On behalf of our many residents whose lives were touched by his work,  I wish a happy 99th birthday to Congressman Guarini.                            ____________________
