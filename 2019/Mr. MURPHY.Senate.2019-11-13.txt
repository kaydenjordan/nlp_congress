 Mr. President, I am here to speak about the topic of  healthcare, but while my friend from Alaska is on the floor, I hope we  can bridge the policy disagreements we have right now over the Defense  appropriations bill, the appropriations process and the authorization  bill.   I have been in Congress long enough to have heard this argument be  trotted out over and over again that if you vote against a defense  bill, then you aren't supporting the troops, even if you have a  legitimate policy disagreement you are trying to work out. I have heard  that enough to know that it just doesn't match up with reality.   I was told that because I opposed the Iraq war, I didn't support the  troops. People in the 1970s were told that if they didn't support the  Vietnam war, they were opposing the troops. The fact is, we have a  legitimate policy disagreement that we are trying to figure out.  Democrats don't think we should be taking money from defense  construction projects that are housing and protecting our troops to be  used to build a border wall with Mexico that doesn't do anything, in  our opinion, to protect the United States compared to the benefit of  the spending on military construction projects. We think that,  ultimately, we are serving our troops by making sure those military  construction projects get funded instead of this wall that doesn't make  sense if not for the President's campaign speeches.   So we have some policy disagreements over the budget. I would hope  that my colleagues wouldn't try to use this tired argument that if  anyone here ever votes against a defense budget, then they somehow are  opposing the troops. That is just irresponsible and disingenuous  rhetoric.
