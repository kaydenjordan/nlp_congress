 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, the Senate will pass the  60th annual National Defense Authorization Act. Every year, this  legislation lets the Senate make our top priorities for protecting our  homeland, our allies, and our global interests into law, and,  certainly, the recent behavior of our adversaries world over shows why  this task is as urgent as ever.   Even as our Nation is focused on fighting the pandemic at home, our  servicemembers have contended with dangerous behavior from would-be  competitors all around the world. The Russian military has kept probing  the bounds of U.S. airspace, and Putin's regime has kept its sights on  cyber war and destabilization by proxy.   China continues to treat international commercial lanes like its own  private pond, choke freedom and autonomy out of Hong Kong, and try to  ethnically cleanse Xinjiang.   Both countries continue to modernize their military capabilities from  sea to space. And Iranian meddling, North Korean saber-rattling, and  the persistent violence of terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaida  demand our attention as well.   Amid these threats and many others, the American people and the  entire free world look to the men and women of the U.S. military to  preserve order and peace. The open and bipartisan process led by  Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed has produced strong legislation  that will advance their missions.   It is the product of intense committee work; it contains more than  200 bipartisan amendments; and it builds on the historic progress which  this administration and this Republican Senate have secured over the  past 3 years.   After years of cuts to our military that weakened readiness,  imperiled modernization, and called into question our commitment to  preserving our global interests, we have reversed the tide. We have  invested in strength. We built a new national defense strategy and are  investing in rebuilding and modernizing our military to help achieve  it.   This legislation will carry the progress even further--more support  for defense research and innovation, resources for military housing and  healthcare, tools to deepen our commitments with regional partners in  Europe and the Pacific.   For most Americans, investing in the greatest fighting force in the  world is not controversial. It is a no-brainer. But lest we forget, the  radical energy  [[Page S4364]]  on the far left is sparking some truly extraordinary behavior among our  Democratic colleagues.   Case in point, later today, we will vote on an amendment that was  advertised in an opinion essay by the junior Senator from Vermont  titled ``Defund the Pentagon: The Liberal Case.'' This is the junior  Senator from Vermont--an essay titled ``Defund the Pentagon: The  Liberal Case.''   You heard correctly. We have moved on from defunding local police to  defunding the U.S. Armed Forces. Maybe we will be sending social  workers on overseas deployments, when they aren't too busy responding  to violent crimes. I am not sure. Senator Sanders' amendment would  literally decimate the defense budget. It would rip 10 percent of it  right out and pour the money into all the socialist fantasies--free  rent, free college, free everything for everyone.   Now, in light of the long-held views of our colleague from Vermont, a  proposal like this may not be particularly shocking. What is remarkable  is that the Democratic leader--the leader of their caucus--felt  pressured into endorsing it.   Let me say that again: The Democratic leader, who in almost every  floor speech tries to accuse this administration of being too soft on  America's adversaries, wants to literally decimate our defense budget  to finance a socialist spending spree.   This turns out to be something of a pattern. On the Democratic side,  it sometimes seems like we have hawks when it comes to speeches but  chickens when it comes time to make policy. When they are on the  sidelines, there is plenty of bark, but whenever they actually call a  shot, there is zero bite. Lots of bark, little bite; all hat, no  cattle.   That is how we end up with spectacles like the Democratic leader  play-acting as a Russian hawk, when about a decade ago, he was publicly  arguing we should cozy up to Putin, send Russia billions of dollars of  cash, pull the plug on NATO missile defense pacts that hurt Putin's  feelings, and concede to him, ``Russia's traditional role'' in the  Caspian Sea region.   That was the Democratic leader in 2008. Pay off Putin, and let him  have his sphere of influence. And now today, he wants to decimate  defense spending. But in between, he spent years insisting that  Democrats want to get tough--want to get tough on foreign policy.   You see how the game works: sound like hawks on television, act like  chickens when making policy.   Defense spending demonstrates our will to defend ourselves and our  interests in a dangerous world. Keeping our Nation safe is our foremost  constitutional duty. We cannot shirk it.   My colleagues who profess concern over Putin's efforts to interfere  in our politics, or Xi's efforts to rewrite the rules of the  international system, must know that we will never--never be able to  deter such behavior if we sell our own soldiers short and surrender our  technological edge.   I assure you, Beijing and Moscow will be watching this vote. I ask my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reject this far-left  fantasy. Defeat this amendment. Throughout the Cold War, we maintained  a bipartisan commitment to American strength, American alliances, and a  global peace built on American values. We will reinforce that stand  when we sink--sink the reckless Sanders-Schumer amendment and again  when we pass this bipartisan bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a final matter, since the spring,  our Nation has engaged in important conversations about racial justice  in policing.   Most people understand that continuing our Nation's tremendous  progress toward justice does not mean battling against American  principles or American history. Progress means fulfilling our values,  not attacking them.   Yet a group of radicals have latched onto this moment to say we  should repudiate our country itself. We have watched as mobs have  dragged statues of Washington, Jefferson, and Grant through the dirt.  And, in parallel, inside many elite institutions, self-styled  intellectuals say we should similarly discard the basic principles they  fought for.   One of the key pillars of our Nation is the rule of law. In a  civilized society, the same laws need to apply to everyone. The times  our Nation has fallen short on this score, particularly for all the  years when Black Americans were completely denied the equal protections  of law, it has been to our great shame. This has been central to the  cause of civil rights. There is a reason the 14th amendment insists on  ``the equal protection of the laws.''   Yet, in recent months, local leaders have violated this basic tenet.  As riots rocked major cities, we saw politicians decline to act. They  seem to fear far-left critique more than looting and chaos. And we saw  the uneven application of other rules, like when mayors cheered on mass  demonstrations but continued to prohibit religious gatherings. That is  the rule of law in jeopardy. Of course, the last example is also a  First Amendment issue. And the freedom of expression itself is another  principle that has come under threat.   As I said a few weeks back, this goes deeper than just constitutional  law. America has always prized the spirit of the First Amendment. We  citizens must want to protect an open, civil discourse--a true  marketplace of ideas. But, lately, the political left has embraced  something totally different.   Today's far left is not interested in winning debates with better  arguments. They prefer to shut down debate all together. They don't try  to win the contest. They just harangue the referees to stop the game.  If they don't like an op-ed, they want it unpublished. If they don't  like a tweet, they want to track down the author and get them fired. If  they don't like a tenured professor, they throw around Orwellian  accusations that his or her ideas make them feel unsafe.   This hostile culture is getting results. According to one brand-new  survey, it is only the far-left Americans who do not feel compelled to  self-censor their views because of a hostile climate. Everyone but the  left feels the threat.   And 50 percent of self-identified strong liberals say that simply  contributing to the Republican Presidential candidate ought to be a  fireable offense for a business leader. Let me say that again. Fifty  percent of self-identified strong liberals say that simply contributing  to the Republican Presidential candidate ought to be a fireable offense  for a business leader. In this country?   We recently saw the New York Times apologize for publishing a  straightforward policy argument from a U.S. Senator. Since, an  editorial staffer resigned from the paper because even center-left  opinions were not liberal enough and led to her constant harassment.  That was a recent editorial staffer resigning from the New York Times  because her center-left opinions were not liberal enough and led to her  constant harassment at the times. You see, the safe spaces only go in  one direction.   On elite campuses such as Princeton, we see faculty turning on their  tenured colleagues and even administrators weighing in to chastise  people with unpopular views.   We see online platforms such as Facebook threatening to ban political  advertising altogether, chilling our democracy, because far-left  employees and outside pressure groups berate them for letting the very  speakers use their platform.   Even at a time when there is significant appetite in Congress to take  a second look at the legal protections afforded to those supposedly  neutral platforms, they still contemplate giving an angry minority of  agitators a veto over Americans' political speech.   The author Salman Rushdie, who was himself threatened with death for  controversial speech, once said this:         Two things form the bedrock of any open society--freedom of       expression and rule of law. If you don't have those things,       you don't have a free country.    Free expression and the rule of law--exactly the two things we have  seen eroded in recent months.   Rushdie recently signed an open letter with other intellectuals--many  liberals--sounding the alarm on this cultural poison. ``Editors are  fired,'' they wrote, ``books are withdrawn . . . journalists are barred  from writing on certain topics . . . professors are investigated . . .  steadily narrow[ing] the  [[Page S4365]]  boundaries of what can be said without the threat of reprisal.''   Well, you can guess what happened next. The grievance industrial  complex came after the letter itself. The authors were accused of  advancing bigotry and the cycle of nonsense started all over again.   The United States of America needs free speech. We need free  expression. And all of us, from all perspectives, need the courage to  speak up and defend it                            ____________________
