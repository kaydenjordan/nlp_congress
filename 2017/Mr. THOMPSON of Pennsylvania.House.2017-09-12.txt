 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the outstanding work of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation in its  mission to help our schoolchildren lead healthier lives. The alliance  works closely with schools in Pennsylvania and nationwide to improve  student health and wellbeing.   Over the past decade, Healthier Generation's groundbreaking work with  schools, communities, and businesses have benefited more than 25  million children across this country. More than 950 Pennsylvania  schools have teamed with Healthier Generation, helping more than half a  million children in the Commonwealth make healthier choices.   Since 2007, 18 Pennsylvania schools have been recognized with  National Healthy School Awards for their exceptional work. The Healthy  Out-of-School Time program has helped more than 11,000 Pennsylvania  children have access to healthier foods and focus on more active  community programs outside the classroom.   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Nutrition, I am so  proud of our schools and our students who work to serve healthier meals  and snacks, get students to move more, offer high-quality physical and  health education, and empower school leaders to become healthy role  models.                            ____________________
