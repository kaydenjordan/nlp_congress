 Mr. President, in Colorado we have come out of one of the  worst wildfire seasons that we have ever seen. In fact, you can't  really call it a season, I think, when the fires are still going on  when the snow falls, but that is what happened this year, incredibly.   Three of the largest fires in our history all happened in the same  year, and these fires displaced thousands of people in my State. They  obscured the views of the mountains for weeks at a time. They forced  families to pack their entire lives into duffle bags while their homes  went up in flames. They shut down major highways for weeks and  paralyzed local economies and blanketed our communities with smoke.   If you ask anyone in Colorado why this is happening, they will tell  you it is because our State is becoming hotter and drier each year. If  you ask farmers and ranchers in Colorado--and a lot of them are  Republican--they will tell you they are facing drought that is longer  and more intense than their parents or grandparents ever had to deal  with.   Our mountain towns will tell you that they are struggling with ski  seasons that are growing shorter each year. Our water officials will  tell you that they are planning for a future with a lot less water to  go around, and there wasn't enough water to begin with. And the reason  for all of this is climate change.   That is why in Colorado, a purple State, a swing State in the middle  of the country, there is absolutely a consensus that we have a moral  responsibility to deal with climate change as a threat to our economy,  to our environment, and to our way of life.   That responsibility extends to the U.S. Senate, but for most of the  time I have been here, we have treated climate change like it was going  to somehow solve itself or, in some cases, that it didn't even really  exist. And nothing could be further from the truth. This is a problem  for all 50 States and every American. It is a problem for humanity, and  we can't deal with it in an enduring way unless the hundred people in  this body take action, until a hundred people here are willing to lead  on a challenge that is existential, yes, and also global, yes, and is  crying out for the leadership of the Senate.   There is nobody else to ride to the rescue. We have to do this, and  we can start tomorrow by voting to reverse--and I hope it will be a big  bipartisan vote tomorrow on voting to reverse--the last  administration's terrible, counterproductive, self-destructive policy  on methane pollution.   Methane is not something people ever think about, and it is one of  the most powerful greenhouse gases behind climate change. It can be  over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and it is responsible  for a quarter of all the warming that the planet has seen since the  Industrial Revolution.   Today, one of the biggest sources of methane pollution is the oil and  gas industry in my State and in the great State of Texas, where the  senior Senator is from, and all across the country, where methane leaks  into the atmosphere from old pipes, broken vents, and outdated  practices like burning excess gas.   Methane pollution is terrible for the environment because it  accelerates climate change. It is terrible for our health because it  puts toxins in the air we breathe, especially for the nearly 10 million  Americans who live near oil and gas wells or go to school near oil and  gas wells. It is also terrible for industry because it makes their fuel  much dirtier and it cuts into their bottom line.   That is why, years ago--I think it was 2014--in Colorado, under the  leadership of then-Governor Hickenlooper, now Senator Hickenlooper, we  adopted as a State the country's first-ever rules to limit methane  pollution for oil and gas facilities. Governor Hickenlooper worked by  bringing environmentalists and industry leaders together to craft a  policy that reflected the consensus in my State around climate change  and our economy. Our approach worked so well that the EPA and the  Bureau of Land Management drew on it for methane rules at the Federal  level.   When the last administration went after the rules at BLM, our late  friend Senator John McCain led a bipartisan majority in this body to  keep them in place. At the time, the Trump administration claimed that  the Federal methane rules destroyed energy production and killed jobs.  That was never true, to be polite about it.   In Colorado, our natural gas production has grown. Our oil production  has nearly doubled. Our innovation and jobs have increased. Today,  there are 52 different businesses in my State hiring people to repair  pipes, to track pollution, and to develop new technologies to reduce  pollution. This has strengthened our economy.   Colorado's approach worked so well that we have gone back and  strengthened--strengthened--our methane rules another three times in  2017, in 2019, and 2020, each time with support from both environmental  groups and industry.   But instead of learning from our example, the Trump administration  went ahead with its plans to dismantle methane rules at the Federal  level, and it did that over the objection of leading oil and gas  operators in my State and across the country. And the result was a  self-inflicted wound on our economy and our environment, and it  compromised our leadership in the world.   Now I hope we will pick up the pieces in a bipartisan way, because  here is what I think: We are not going to solve climate change until we  have an American climate policy, just like we once had something we  called U.S. foreign policy, where every President who was elected,  whether they were Republican or Democrat, they roughly knew what their  job was with respect to the Soviet Union, with respect to the  transatlantic alliance. There were differences, of course, and we made  lots of mistakes with that organizing principle, but it was an  important organizing principle--that thing we called American foreign  policy.   And we are going to need something called American climate policy. We  didn't win the Cold War 2 years at a time, and we can't accept the  politics in here, where I put in my ideas for healthcare and 2 years  later they get ripped out, and we put in somebody's ideas for  infrastructure and 2 years later they get ripped out. We can't tolerate  it for those things--for education, for taxes. People want  predictability. They don't want us to succumb to the political antics  of Washington, DC, and this floor.   But when it comes to climate change, that is really true, because we  can't fix it 2 years at a time. I often hear people say that we have to  act urgently on climate change. We do. It is true. But we also need a  solution that is durable--one that will last through changes in the  majorities in the Congress and changes with who is in the White House,  so that we can actually pass off that durable solution to our kids and  grandkids, who can then pick up the baton.   So let me say this. You cannot accept, if you want to fix climate  change, the broken politics that we have here. We can't accept the  rubble that we sometimes have here. We have to do better, and I think  we can. I think by starting with this methane rule--and hopefully doing  it in a bipartisan way--it will be a great beginning.   Coming together on methane pollution is the perfect place to start.  In Colorado, 91 percent of the people support limits on methane  pollution. It has the support of environmental groups and industry, as  I said earlier, including America's largest natural gas producers. It  has a record of bipartisan support in this body, and it has the  potential to create thousands of jobs--  [[Page S2213]]  high-paying jobs--mostly in rural areas, where people are reasonably  concerned about what this energy transition is going to mean for them.  Let's pay people to capture methane, to make the industry viable, to  make the product less harmful, and to create high-paying jobs in rural  areas in America that need them.   I know I don't have all the answers for how to build a durable  climate policy in America, but I know that a sensible approach to  methane has to be part of the solution, and that approach has to  address not only new oil and gas facilities but existing ones like we  have done in Colorado, and that is what this resolution will do. It  will restore EPA's obligation to regulate all sources of methane  emissions, including existing oil and gas operations, where there are  hundreds of thousands of older wells that are responsible for 75  percent of methane emissions from the industry.   It will help us protect the environment and create jobs, and it will  show the world that America can come together and that this Senate can  come together in a bipartisan way to deal with climate change because,  when I think about it, I don't want any of us to come back to this  floor 10 years from now or 20 years from now and describe how we have  just gone through the worst wildfire season ever or the worst hurricane  season ever--more likely in the Presiding Officer's State than in my  State--or the worst drought in our history.   I want them to come back and celebrate how America led the world to  overcome the climate threat. I want them to praise the era of  innovation and job creation unleashed across the country, and I want  them to point out what we did in this Congress with this vote to put  America on a path to protect our planet, grow our economy, and fulfill  our responsibility to our kids and our grandkids.   So I urge my colleagues, every single one of them, to cast a vote for  this important methane policy and to set us on the bipartisan course we  need to create if we are going to have durable climate change policy in  this country and if America is going to lead the world.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 13 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
