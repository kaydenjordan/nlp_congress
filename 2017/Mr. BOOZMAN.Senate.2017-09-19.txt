 Mr. President, I rise to speak in honor of the 70th  anniversary of the United States Air Force.   In the seven decades since its inception on September 18, 1947, the  U.S. Air Force has bravely fought to protect freedom, liberty, and  peace on every continent around the globe. From active participation in  major international conflicts to providing humanitarian support  throughout the world, the U.S. Air Force has continued to be the  Nation's leading edge across every domain and throughout every location  by meeting the challenges of an ever-changing world with limitless  strength, resolve, and patriotism. Today, more than 100,000 airmen are  standing watch at 175 global locations, committed to continuously  defending the people and interests of the greatest Nation in the world.   As cochair of the Senate Air Force Caucus and the son of a retired  Air Force master sergeant, I have been personally touched by the proud  history of this distinguished service. From the earliest days of  aviation when the Department of War accepted its first military  airplane to the present-day delivery of global airpower, the U.S. Air  Force has made tremendous strides in the technological innovation and  operationalization of air, space, and cyberspace warfighting  capabilities.   The earliest aviation pioneers believed in the notion of airpower and  fought for its development into a force so formidable that its  responsibilities  [[Page S5832]]  and contributions would eventually be recognized as being equal to  those of land and sea power. In essence, the birth of the U.S. Air  Force began the dawn of a new era, where the skies became the ultimate  high ground.   As we celebrate this historic occasion, we must also remember and  honor the courageous men and women of the U.S. Air Force, as the  service would not be what it is today without these fine airmen.   I had the privilege of speaking at the Department of Defense's  National Prisoner of War/Missing In Action Recognition Day last week.  It served as a poignant reminder of the many sacrifices made by our men  and women in uniform.   One such airman, Brig. Gen. Kenneth Newton Walker, played an  important role in building the organization that would later become an  independent air service. General Walker's direct contributions to  crafting doctrine and policy were instrumental to the creation of the  modern U.S. Air Force.   General Walker was reported missing in action after his B-17 Flying  Fortress went missing over Papua, New Guinea, in 1943, and was  posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Roosevelt. The  actions of fearless warriors like General Walker symbolize a continuing  commitment to meeting the demands of an increasingly dynamic and  dangerous world with limitless strength, resolve, and determination.   These dedicated airmen and their values of integrity, service before  self, and excellence that they uphold in all they do embody a proud  heritage, a tradition of honor, and a legacy of valor. We owe them a  tremendous amount of gratitude for the sacrifices they have made  defending the greatest country on Earth on this, the 70th anniversary  of the United States Air Force.   I am especially proud of my home State of Arkansas and its  contribution to our air superiority. The Little Rock Air Force Base and  the 188th Wing in Fort Smith play an important role in our national  security. I am proud to support these missions and look forward to  continuing to support our airmen stationed in Arkansas and throughout  the world.   I am pleased to be here speaking on behalf of a grateful nation,  remembering, honoring, and commending our airmen and the world's  greatest Air Force.   I yield back.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, September 18, 2017, was the 70th  anniversary of the U.S. Air Force. Since its inception, it has  repeatedly proven that it is indeed the finest air force in the world.   Among the greatest strengths of the U.S. Air Force is its enlisted  corps, which is recognized worldwide as being comprised of the best  educated, best trained, best motivated, and most dedicated men and  women of any air force anywhere.   The office of the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force was created  in 1967 based in large measure on strong advocacy by the Air Force  Association and has been filled by 18 brilliant leaders, including the  present Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Kaleth O. Wright.   The U.S. Air Force core values of ``Integrity First, Service Before  Self, and Excellence in All We Do'' are embodied in the office of the  Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, in the Air Force enlisted  corps, and in all men and women serving in the U.S. Air Force.   The Senate Air Force Caucus joins the Air Force Association and  airmen worldwide in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the creation of  the Office of the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.                            ____________________
