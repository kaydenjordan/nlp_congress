 Mr. Speaker, it is glaring hypocrisy when you have  Republicans on the other side of the aisle trying to create definitions  and say Rashida wants to annihilate people when Max Miller himself went  on TV and said we are turning Gaza into a parking lot and we want to  annihilate Palestinians. Nobody condemned him on that side of the  aisle.   What is true here is that every single one of them has not  acknowledged the fact that Palestinians are dying in the tens of  thousands but will continue to say it is us who are not acknowledging  humanity.   Rashida will stand strong, and the Palestinian movement will continue  for liberation until every single Palestinian has the right to live in  liberty.
