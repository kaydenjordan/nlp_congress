 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important  part of Colorado history and of our Nation's history, the case of  Francisco Maestas et al. v. George H. Shone et al. (1914)-- ``Maestas''--one of the Nation's oldest school desegregation cases.   In 1848, at the end of the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of  Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded most of present-day Colorado from Mexico to the  United States. The resulting influx of Mexican settlers brought major  economic, industrial, political, linguistic, and cultural challenges to  the region, including questions regarding public education.  [[Page S1459]]    In the early 1910s, railroad foreman Francisco Maestas and other  Mexican American parents sought to place their children into the public  school on the ``White side'' of town in Alamosa, CO. After the school  district repeatedly denied to enroll their children, Maestas and other  parents formed the ``Spanish-American Union'' and brought together 180  parents on a petition to challenge Alamosa's school segregation. Their  petition was denied, as was their attempt to seek assistance from the  Colorado State superintendent. Following these denials, the community  staged a boycott for 3 months to protest these injustices, to no avail.   Colorado's Constitution has long prohibited public schools from  classifying and distinguishing school children based on color and race,  but as the Maestas case demonstrates, school districts sometimes fell  short of ensuring equity before the law. Faced with these repeated  denials, the community continued to organize with the help of the  Society for the Mutual Protection of Workers--SPMDTU--one of America's  oldest mutual aid societies, and Father E.J. Montel, a Catholic priest,  who helped them raise funds to hire legal representation and file a  lawsuit against the Alamosa Board of Education.   The school district contended that since it viewed Mexican American  students as part ``of the Caucasian race,'' it was not discriminating  based on race but rather addressing its Spanish-speaking students'  needs. However, the school district was disproven of its assertion when  students answered questions in English while on the stand.   In March of 1914, the district court ruled in favor of Francisco  Maestas, stating that ``the only way to destroy this feeling of  discontent and bitterness which has recently grown up, is to allow all  children so prepared, to attend the school nearest them''--an early and  important step toward desegregation and a victory for Colorado's  Mexican American community.   In recent years, bipartisan leaders in Colorado have worked to ensure  this landmark case gets the recognition it deserves. After the Colorado  Legislature and the State board of education recognized the case as a  significant Colorado court decision, it is now taught as part of the  revised social studies curriculum for all Colorado high school  students. Now, schoolchildren across Colorado will learn about  Colorado's early steps toward ensuring equity in education for students  from all backgrounds.                            ____________________
