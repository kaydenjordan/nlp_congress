 Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to say a  couple of words about Senator Alexander.   I was very sad, as many of us here were, to hear that he will be  leaving the Senate in 2 years--in other words, not running for  reelection when he comes up in 2020.   While I am sure he will enjoy having more time to relax at home in  his beloved Tennessee, his gain is our loss. Over the course of his 16- year career in the Senate, he has been a leader and a model for many of  us, including me.   As a former Secretary of Education, he has, unsurprisingly, been a  leader on education issues. He has also been a tremendous leader on  healthcare. He combines an impressive knowledge of the issues with an  ability to bring together Members of both parties to get things done.   He and I share the unusual distinction of having both been  congressional staffers before becoming Members of Congress. We also  both served as chairmen of the Senate Republican conference. I have to  say that Lamar was definitely a tough act to follow.   I will miss his presence in the Senate, but I am glad we have 2 more  years to work together to improve the lives of the American people. I  expect that in his last couple of years, he will get a lot done around  here because there isn't anybody in the Senate who is a more effective  or a more results-oriented legislator.   I look forward to the things we can get done together in the course  of the next 2 years. But like many in this Chamber, I am going to be  very sorry to see Senator Alexander leave.                              Tribute to Jon Kyl    Mr. President, I also want to mention Senator Kyl, who announced he  is retiring from the Senate for the second time.   Senator Kyl initially retired at the end of the 112th Congress after  a distinguished Senate career but stepped up to fill in after we lost  Senator McCain earlier this year.   Senator Kyl is rightly renowned in this body for his statesmanship  and his deep knowledge, and it has been a pleasure having him back in  the Senate, even if that was just for this brief time.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, the 115th Congress is drawing to a close, and it is  time to finish up our work. More importantly, of course, we need to  fund the government.   While this year's Senate was the most efficient in two decades in  terms of passing appropriations bills, we still have a significant  amount of funding left to pass this week.   A critical part of this funding is border security. As all of us  know, protecting our border is protecting our Nation. When we can't  control the flow of goods and people across our borders, dangerous  individuals and products enter our Nation without our knowledge.   The fact is, our borders are not sufficiently secure. As we have  recently seen with the migrant caravans, they are a target for illegal  entry.   Over the past year, illegal border crossing apprehensions shot up by  more than 30 percent. A porous border leaves us susceptible to illegal  entry by gang members, human traffickers, drug dealers, and weapons  traffickers. Federal agents have seen a substantial increase in  seizures of deadly drugs, including a 115-percent increase in the  amount of fentanyl seized between ports of entry. Fentanyl is one of  the most dangerous opioids out there and a major contributor to the  opioid crisis raging in this country.   In 2017, opioids were involved in the deaths of almost 50,000  Americans. Roughly half or more of those deaths involved fentanyl. If  this is what is being caught at legal points of entry, we know more is  coming over our unsecured border.   Then there is human trafficking. Every year, between 14,500 and  17,500 individuals are trafficked into the United States--predominantly  women and children. Then they are sold into domestic slavery or, more  frequently, forced into pornography or prostitution.   Of course, there is the ever-present and very real danger that  members of terrorist groups will exploit loopholes in our border  security to enter our country and endanger our citizens.   I don't need to explain this to Democratic Members of the Senate.  They know all of this, and they have supported measures in the past to  protect our borders. In 2006, the Democratic leader and the ranking  member on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted for legislation to  authorize a border fence. They were joined in their vote by then- Senators Biden, Clinton, and Obama.   In 2013, every Senate Democrat supported legislation requiring the  completion of a 700-mile fence along our southern border. This  legislation would have provided $46 billion for border security and $8  billion specifically for the border wall. Nothing has changed. Border  security is still a national security imperative, and it still needs to  be funded. So I hope that Democratic support for border security will  not change either.   In 2013, Nancy Pelosi said that a shutdown was ``an unthinkable  tactic to use in the political debate.'' I have to agree that it is  unthinkable that Democrats would jeopardize government operations and  services to block funding to secure our border.   The American people are certainly not interested in a government  shutdown. They made that clear back in January when Democrats shut down  the government over illegal immigration. I know Democrats and  Republicans in Congress are not interested in shutting down the  government for Christmas.   I hope that an appropriations bill will pass this week. It is time to  get the government funded.                     National Defense Strategy Commission    While I am on the issue of national security, I would like to take a  few minutes to discuss the recent report from the National Defense  Strategy Commission. The report is sobering, and it should give our  work to restore military readiness a new level of intensity.   I would just like to highlight a few excerpts from that report:         The security and wellbeing of the United States are at       greater risk than at any time in decades. . . . The U.S.       military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss       of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might       struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or       Russia. The United States is particularly at risk of being       overwhelmed should its military be forced to fight on two or       more fronts simultaneously. Additionally, it would be unwise       and irresponsible not to expect adversaries to attempt       debilitating kinetic, cyber, or other types of attacks       against Americans at home while they seek  [[Page S7755]]       to defeat our military abroad. U.S. military superiority is       no longer assured and the implications for American interests       and American security are severe.    Those are all findings from that report. I would say that the threats  to our national security are many, and they are growing in complexity  by the day. But it is not our strength that tempts our adversaries; it  is our weakness.   The best way to ensure our security and that of our allies is to  project strength, and the best way to project strength is to make sound  investments in our men and women in uniform and the right investments  in sustainment and modernization.   I hope that this report will be a wake-up call, and the Democrats  will come to the table to continue the work of rebuilding our military  in this next Congress. We need to continue the momentum led by  President Trump in restoring our military readiness so that bad actors  will rethink their actions.   If I can remind my colleagues, providing the Pentagon funding  certainty allows it to leverage its greatest asset, and that is the men  and women of our military. Investing in our national defense is an  investment in the men and women who are currently standing watch around  the world this holiday season, forgoing the comforts of home so that we  can celebrate with our friends and family.   This last weekend, I had the honor of attending an activation  ceremony of the Bravo Battery of the 1-147 Field Artillery of the South  Dakota National Guard. Those in it are deploying in support of  Operation Atlantic Resolve and demonstrating, yet again, America's  commitment to security in Europe at a time of heightened tensions.   We thank them for their service, and we wish them a safe deployment.  May we think of Bravo Battery and extend our thanks to all of the men  and women in uniform who are defending our freedoms at this time of  year. May we return in the 116th Congress with a renewed commitment to  supporting their mission and needs.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
