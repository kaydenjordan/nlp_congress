 Madam President, we are here today on a unique  Saturday, a day that is not normal, a day when the coronavirus is  setting new records across the United States for infection--just  yesterday, 85,000 new cases, which is the very highest since July-- ravaging the United States, and creating untold hardship and  heartbreak.   We are in the midst of a raging pandemic, but we are not considering  measures to deal with the pain and grief and loss that it has created,  the threat that it poses to many States across the country, providing  memories for many of us in Connecticut who went through the worst of  these ravages and still suffer, in Connecticut, the threat of a new  wave. Economic crisis grips this country, people are out of jobs, and  small businesses are failing, but we are considering a nominee who  would threaten to decimate our healthcare system in the midst of a  healthcare crisis as we go through this pandemic.   It is a day that is sad, shocking, surreal, and it is not normal. It  is not normal to rush through a nominee for the highest Court in the  land--a lifetime appointment--while Americans are going to the polls in  record numbers. Their voices should be heard, and the next Senate and  the President should choose this next Justice. It is not normal because  we are, in effect, ignoring and disregarding the duty we have to  consider and pass real measures to address this pandemic and the  economic crisis we face.   It is not normal for real people whose lives are impacted so severely  and potentially even more so in the weeks ahead and whose healthcare,  reproductive freedom, protection from gun violence, workplace rights,  civil rights, and civil liberties are all threatened by this nominee.   We brought into the hearing room those real people from Connecticut  and all around the country through the posters that we had, watching  those hearings and the nonresponses that Amy Coney Barrett gave to our  questions. We brought real lives and the real harm they will suffer  into that hearing room.   I brought Connor Curran, whose treatment has kept him alive only  because his parents were able to use the Affordable Care Act for his  preexisting condition; Julia Gonzalez, who is alive because she  received treatment for her cancer as a result of the ACA making it  affordable, protecting her as a preexisting condition survivor;  Samantha, a rape survivor, who was able to get an abortion because of  the protections of Roe v. Wade; Tracey, who was able to use in vitro  fertilization because of reproductive freedoms that are guaranteed by  Griswold v. Connecticut and its progeny--Amy Coney Barrett has refused  to say whether she thought Griswold was correctly decided; Ethan Song,  who lost his life because of an unsafely stored firearm in a friend's  home--his parents, Michael and Kristin Song, were with me, and so was  Ethan; Janet Rice, whose son, Shane, then 20 years old, was killed in  downtown Hartford; and, of course, the Barton family, who lost their  beautiful son, Daniel, along with 19 other wonderful children, in Sandy  Hook in that massacre, and sixth grade educators as well.   Those lives and real people and real harms are what are at stake in  this debate, and so this Chamber seems so surreal on this day, in the  midst of hardship and heartbreak that would only be aggravated by the  Justice who may be confirmed as early as Monday evening.   She has been selected, screened, and vetted to be an activist judge  who would strike down the Affordable Care Act and overturn Roe v. Wade.  We know that she has passed that ``strong test''--the President's  words, ``strong test''--to legislate from the Bench and accomplish  through the Court what they have been unable to achieve in this body,  in this Chamber, and in this Congress through the legislature.   They have failed to overturn the Affordable Care Act because the  majority of American people want that protection for preexisting  conditions. We have stood strong on this side against those 10, 20, 40  efforts to strike down the Affordable Care Act.   Madam President, she has been vetted and screened for a position on  gun violence protection that she herself has admitted in a speech she  gave at Hillsdale College. It sounds kind of radical. It sounds kind of  radical, as I said to her during the hearing, because it is radical. It  is part of a radical, extremist agenda to deny the American people  State and local laws that protect them against assault weapons and  large-capacity magazines, people who are dangerous and should be denied  the purchase of firearms because they should be screened out through  background checks and through emergency risk protection orders and safe  storage laws, and repeal of PLCAA. That gives gun manufacturers near  complete immunity from any responsibility.  [[Page S6440]]    We are still in the middle of an epidemic of gun violence, and among  those real people who have spoken out is a young woman, 19 years old,  named Tabitha Escalante. I was on a phone call with her yesterday with  other advocates.   She is the judiciary advisory associate at March for Our Lives, and  she is advocating, along with other groups, grassroots groups, that  have created a movement--Giffords, Brady, Everytown, Moms Demand  Action, Students Demand Action, Connecticut Against Gun Violence, Sandy  Hook Promise, Newtown Action Alliance--along with March for Our Lives.  They have created a movement that is prevailing, just as we prevailed  and stopped the legislative branch from overturning the Affordable Care  Act.   The strength of this movement has caused the NRA and the extreme  radical groups that are supporting it to go to the courts, as we  documented in a report that we released just yesterday. I thank my  colleague Sheldon Whitehouse for spearheading this effort. I have been  proud to join in various efforts on captured courts. And the report  ``What's at Stake: Gun Safety'' was the reason that Tabitha and I and  others joined that call yesterday: ``How a Corrupted Organization Has  Radically Transformed the Second Amendment.''   It shows how the NRA has been at the tip of the spear, working for  special interests, the gun lobby--dark money channeled to put on the  court judges, at every level, who will stop commonsense measures on  protecting people against gun violence. Justice nominee Amy Coney  Barrett is only the most recent of them who have been screened and  vetted to carry forward that agenda.   These interlocking groups--the firearms industry, retailers, and  private organizations like American Encore, American Future Fund,  American Action Network, Judicial Crisis Network--have spearheaded this  effort, and the NRA has been their tool and instrument, and judges in  the Federal courts have been the result.   The fact of the matter is that they are turning to the legislatures  because of the strength of this grassroots movement--not its weakness-- and their efforts to repeal the ACA have failed. So have their efforts  to block those measures in State legislatures and local governments.   In fact, gun violence prevention was on the ballot in 2018, and gun  violence prevention won. That is the reason that the House of  Representatives passed a universal background check measure and other  steps that are so important and should be done here.   In the past 10 years, in fact, this scourge and epidemic of gun  violence has continued with more than 236 mass shootings in this  country. Those mass shootings have taken 1,300 lives, including those  innocent children and educators at Sandy Hook.   In the past 10 years, gun violence has taken more than 350,000  lives--in rural communities, urban communities, and every community  across the United States. Gun violence is an insidious public health  menace, a public health epidemic that affects every community.   Amid this public health epidemic, Republicans have vetted and  screened this nominee to take Justice Ginsburg's place on the Supreme  Court because of her extreme views, as she articulated in her dissent  in Kanter v. Barr. She showed an alarming willingness to stretch the  founding-era history to support her extreme and expansive view of the  Second Amendment. Her views are not only out of the mainstream; they  are out of the position articulated by Justice Scalia, her mentor.   But the fact of the matter is that the threat to these gun violence  prevention measures is real and urgent. Cases are literally one step  away--remember, one step away--from the Supreme Court. There are three  cases challenging restrictions on assault weapons and large-capacity  magazines, two of them from California that are about to be petitioned  for a review of certiorari at the U.S. Supreme Court. Two cases  challenging limits on open carry and three cases challenging background  check and licensing requirements are one step away from the Supreme  Court, possibly this term, when Amy Coney Barrett would take her seat.   With her nomination, every single commonsense violence prevention  measure at every level of government is in great peril. The public  safety and health stakes of her nomination could not be greater. As  Tabitha said, ``Nothing less than everything is at stake.'' ``Nothing  less than everything is at stake''--and not just now when these cases  are one step away, but for decades to come.   Tabitha's generation may have children, even grandchildren, who will  see Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court Bench, if she is confirmed,  and district court and appellate court judges whom we have confirmed  through this effort to reshape the courts in the image of the far  right, of what used to be the Republican Party--one step away from this  disaster.   Likewise, on the issue of reproductive freedom, Judge Barrett was  also vetted and screened. At the hearing, she refused to say-- absolutely refused to say--whether Roe was correctly decided. As you  know, Roe protects a woman's right to choose after being raped, as  Samantha was. We presented her story.    It is constitutional to make in vitro fertilization a crime if Roe is  overturned. It is constitutional to make it a crime for doctors to  perform abortions. She refused to answer that question as well. But, in  a way, she didn't really need to answer those questions because we know  where she stands. She described Roe's legacy as barbaric in a letter  and ad that she aligned herself with.   She has called, in effect, through organizations with which she was  aligned, for the unborn ``to be protected in law.'' She aligned herself  with a group on legal positions--I am not talking about moral beliefs-- pushing the most extreme legal views on reproductive care, which  include criminalizing IVF, criminalizing doctors, ending legalized  abortion in this country.   Her extreme views on reproductive freedoms once were disqualifying,  but it is the reason why Donald Trump chose her in the first place--his  strong test on that issue.   Right now, there are 17 abortion-related cases that are one step away  from the Supreme Court. There are challenges to bans on abortion as  early as 6 weeks into pregnancy, before many women even know they are  pregnant. There are bans on abortion later in pregnancy, when women can  face the most severe health risks and rely on their doctors for  accurate information and compassionate care.   They are reason-based bans that merely exist as a pretext--and I say  ``reason-based ban''--for interrogating and intimidating women who seek  an abortion. They are redtape laws that require abortion providers to  jump through hoops that serve no medical purpose but merely exist to  burden them and make necessary abortion services harder and harder to  obtain--and numerous other abortion laws designed to limit access-- strictly to limit access in the name of healthcare, particularly for  poor, rural, and immigrant women who simply cannot afford to make trips  to clinics hundreds of miles away. They are laws that impede racial  justice, human justice.   Access to reproductive care is already hanging by a thread across the  country. Judge Barrett's nomination imperils what access remains. Those  cases are just one step away--one step away--from decisions by the  Court that Judge Barrett would join.   So there is a great deal of our fundamental rights at stake here. As  Tabitha said, ``Nothing less than everything is at stake.'' These cases  that are one step away from decision are only 17 cases involving  reproductive freedom, 14 cases involving gun violence prevention, and  there are numerous others involving workplace safety.   The Affordable Care Act will be argued a week after the election,  when she would sit on the Court. Her hostility to the Affordable Care  Act is well documented by now in her criticizing Chief Justice Roberts  for his vote to uphold the act, saying he had to stretch the meaning of  it to keep it alive, her saying in King v. Burwell, when she spoke  about that case, that the dissent had the better of the argument. These  are real rights for real people that would be lost.   Instead of imperiling healthcare and other rights that should be  enjoyed by the American people, we should be enacting measures that are  before us  [[Page S6441]]  right now that have been passed by the House of Representatives, by  bipartisan majorities, that would actually address the needs and  challenges of the American people during this extraordinary time in our  history.   They are before us right now. There is no need to write them anew.  There is no need to invent the words or the purposes for these acts.   In order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1112, the Enhanced  Background Checks Act--bipartisan legislation to close the Charleston  loophole, extending the initial background check review period from 3  to 10 days, and eliminating that loophole for gun purchases which  enabled the Charleston shooter to get his weapon and murder people in  the basement of a church and others around the country to endanger and  kill innocent Americans, embodying the principle of ``no check, no  sale,'' that must be the rule--I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session.    Madam President, what my colleague calls procedural  harassment, it is actually democracy. It is legislation. It was passed  by the House. It is bipartisan. The majority was bipartisan. It will  save lives. I fail to understand why my Republican colleagues will not  allow this loophole--it is a fatal and defective loophole in our  current laws--to be repaired.                      Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 7    Madam President, let me move to another measure. In order to proceed  to the consideration of H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act--again,  bipartisan legislation that would empower women to challenge pay  discrimination in the workplace, passing the House by a bipartisan  majority and giving women the power to hold employers accountable for  discriminatory practices, making a tremendous difference in their  lives--I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative  session on the Paycheck Fairness Act.    Madam President, the so-called external matters go to  the heart of fairness in the workplace, equal pay for equal work,  discriminatory practices, other kinds of injustices that have existed  for years--women ought to have the right to challenge them and hold  their employers accountable. What could be more fundamental and  important?                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1423    Madam President, let me move now to H.R. 1423, in order to proceed to  consideration of the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, also  known as the FAIR Act, which passed the House on September 20, 2019-- again, a bipartisan measure, which would increase Americans' rights to  seek justice and accountability through the court system.   We are in the midst of considering a nominee who has expressed a  hostility to seeking justice in the workplace and in jobs and in other  areas. So this measure to eliminate forced arbitration clauses in  employment and consumer and civil rights cases is especially relevant.  It would allow consumers and workers to agree to arbitration after a  dispute occurs, but it would not force them to do so.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, in order to proceed to the  consideration of the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection  Act--because millions of women are still at risk as a consequence of  this loophole in our present laws that enables dangerous, estranged  spouses or partners to have access to weapons during the most perilous  time in a domestic dispute right after separation, because that  loophole endangers innocent women because it provides access to weapons  to those dangerous people--I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session.    Madam President, just to remind my colleague, this  measure doesn't pertain only to dangerous felons. It protects innocent  women against dangerous people. There is already the provision for  protective orders to provide that kind of safeguard after a period of  time. This measure would close a loophole for the first period when, in  fact, women and others are at greatest risk.   It is a public safety measure that is particularly relevant because  of the hostility expressed by this nominee to commonsense steps in the  name of a very extreme view under the Second Amendment                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 840    Madam President, I would like to ask that we proceed to consideration  of H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act--what could be less  controversial, a bill that provides childcare assistance to veterans  receiving covered healthcare services in a VA facility?  [[Page S6442]]    The bill highlights the troubling fact that lack of childcare can  dissuade parents from receiving essential healthcare services. It would  make permanent a VA childcare pilot program--make it permanent.   It was first introduced in 2011, and it expands access to childcare  assistance nationwide, allowing veterans to receive medical treatment  with confidence that their children are receiving high-quality care-- our veterans.   Whatever motions have been made in the past, this measure certainly  needs to be considered. It was passed by a majority in the House on  February 8 of 2019, more than a year ago, a bipartisan majority in the  House--no action here.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, as more important as that health for  veterans is, equally so is assistance for our election system. We are  going through an election right now. Even as we consider this nominee,  tens of millions of Americans are voting. The threat to our election  security is well-known. We face not only foreign interference but also  domestic threats, as has been documented.   I have been through those absolutely chilling briefings in a  classified setting; we are sworn to secrecy. But the malign foreign  interference makes 2016, in my impression, look like child's play from  Russia, Iran, the Chinese.   In order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2722, Securing  American Federal Elections Act, a bill that would, in fact, make  critical investments to upgrade our voting systems to protect against  foreign interference in our elections and democracy by requiring all  voting systems to produce a verifiable paper ballot and by authorizing  funding for States to bolster election security--what could be more  urgent and important at this moment in our history?   It was passed by the House of Representatives on June 27, 2019-- again, more than a year ago. No action here.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, in order to proceed to the  consideration of H.R. 4894, Congressional Budget Justification  Transparency Act of 2020, a bill that requires Federal agencies to make  budget justification materials available to the public--it is a  transparency measure. It requires disclosure, and it requires the  Office of Management and Budget to make certain details regarding the  materials available to the public, including a list of agencies that  submit budget justification.   It also forces disclosure of the dates that materials are submitted  to Congress and posted online and links to the materials--a basic  disclosure measure. It was passed, again, overwhelmingly by the House  of Representatives on September 14 of this year, without any action so  far in this body.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative  session.    That measure was a basic disclosure step proposed to  address secrecy in government. Nothing is more fundamental than  transparency in a democracy. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.   The people of the United States deserve that information, and so,  too, they deserve all of the information about Amy Coney Barrett. Even  on the morning of her approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee, new  documents were disclosed, new statements and speeches by her, adding to  the ones that hadn't been disclosed properly previously.   This process is a sham. It is rushed. It is not normal. As I said  during our hearings, my great fear is not only the damage and the harm  that this nominee can do, but the damage and harm to the Court itself.   The President said the quiet part out loud. He wants this nominee  rushed to the bench so she can decide the election, not the voters--so  she can sit on the Supreme Court when the election goes to the courts.   Well, my Republican colleagues have the majority. They may have the  votes, but they don't have the American people, and they don't have  history on their side. Might does not make right. They can do it  because they have the votes. They are doing it because they can.   Amy Coney Barrett could stonewall our questions because she could and  establish a new standard--call it the ``Barrett rule''--of not  answering. But the damage to the Court will be great.   The Court has power because of its legitimacy. The trust and  confidence of the American people are in its independence. Our  Republican colleagues are whittling away and eventually devastating not  only the authority of the Supreme Court, but all of our Federal courts,  by politicizing and polarizing it.   She would not even commit that she would recuse herself in the event  an election case went to the Supreme Court. I have tremendous respect-- even reverence--for the Court, having served there as a law clerk with  Justice Harry Blackmun, having argued four cases before the Court,  including three with Justice Ginsburg.   This imperils the legitimacy of the U.S. Supreme Court, is a grave,  lasting, potentially devastating disservice to the American people. It  is a dagger at the heart of the Court and of our democracy. Therefore,  I will continue to oppose this nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator  Scott has sought unanimous consent for a bill that would restrict the  issuance of nonimmigrant visas to Chinese journalists and a number of  other steps that, frankly, are already within the President's power to  do.   The bill, in many ways, is an attempt to codify authorities that the  State Department already has. In that sense, there is no reason to take  legislative action. If the President wants to use this power, he can.   But I want to emphasize the point that we share the goals that are  behind this measure. No. 1, the goal of increasing transparency around  the pandemic has to be done so that the Chinese and other authorities  around the world--states that suffer from the pandemic--make the facts  known to this country and the world health authority.   We share the goal of condemning China's absolutely despicable human  rights abuses, its deplorable record of subjugating human liberty,  including the Uighurs, at least 1 million of whom are being held in  Chinese Government-run detention centers that the President of the  United States has completely ignored.   But this legislation would really do nothing to address these  incredibly oppressing issues. It uses the pandemic and China's human  rights abuses as a pretense for deflecting blame for the President's  shameful mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis. The President's ineptitude  and incompetence are widely known to the American people.   We share the goals of stopping Chinese human rights abuses, of making  them more honest and accurate in what they disclose, and other goals,  but to this measure, I object.
