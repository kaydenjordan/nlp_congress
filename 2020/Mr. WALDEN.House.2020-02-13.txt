 Madam Speaker, on February 14, Oregon celebrates her  161st birthday. As a lifelong Oregonian whose ancestors came there by  wagon train in 1845, I may be a little biased, but I can confidently  say there is no place like Oregon.   She boasts of so many unparalleled wonders and sights from the  mighty, powerful Columbia River and the winds of the Columbia River  Gorge to the majestic Painted Hills to the rugged landscape of the  Umatilla National Forest, the clear, deep blue waters of Crater Lake,  the deepest lake in North America. Then think about the great Cascade  Mountains or Steens Mountain or the Wallowas or the Blues, and then all  the way down to the depths of Hells Canyon.   The late great Republican Governor Tom McCall said it best. He said,  ``Oregon is an inspiration. Whether you come to it, or are born to it,  you become entranced by our State's beauty, the opportunity she  affords, and the independent spirit of her citizens.''   Madam Speaker, I wish a happy birthday to Oregon. She truly does fly  with her own wings.                            ____________________
