 Mr. President, watching the wrapup by our friend from  Connecticut and the Presiding Officer, I don't know anybody who could  argue that the Senate is incapable of getting a lot done in a short  period of time, given the will. That was pretty remarkable.   Mr. President, nearly 10 months after the Senate passed bipartisan  legislation to fund the CHIPS Act, we are finally inching closer to the  finish line. The House and the Senate are moving forward to a formal  conference process to supply the CHIPS Program with $52 billion and  make other investments in our competitiveness.   Yesterday afternoon, Members of the Senate and the House heard from  administration officials about how important this legislation is.  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo spoke about the economic risks of a  weak semiconductor supply chain.   I might just pause here for a minute in case people are wondering why  semiconductors are so important. Well, the fact of the matter is that  semiconductors are essential to run everything from your cell phone to  the most advanced stealth fighters made by the U.S. Government, the F- 35, and everything in between. And during the pandemic and the  mitigation efforts that we undertook, with kids studying remotely on  their laptops, that would not be possible, nor would the Wi-Fi  connections be possible without access to semiconductors. So these  microcircuits have become absolutely essential to our way of life.   Over the last couple of years, manufacturers have had to halt  production of the various products that they make, shift their  offerings, or even lay off workers because of a shortage of these  semiconductors, these microcircuit chips. Now, at the micro level, this  disruption is having a big impact on consumers: empty car lots,  backordered electronics, higher prices on home appliances. But at the  30,000-foot level, the macro level, this is terribly damaging to our  national economy.   The semiconductor shortage has shaved an estimated $240 billion off  of our gross domestic product last year--  [[Page S2104]]  $240 billion lost because of an inadequate access to these  semiconductors, these microcircuits. Based on the way that things are  trending, the strain is only going to get greater. Global demand for  these semiconductor chips is expected to increase by 56 percent over  the next decade.   If you think about it, our dependency on technology is going to do  nothing but get greater and greater and greater; hence, the demand and  the need for these semiconductors and the demand that will go up by 56  percent, it is estimated, in the next decade.   It is absolutely critical that we start investing in domestic, made- in-America semiconductors now to insure that we have the capacity to  meet that need in the future. And it is not just our economy. This has  a very clear connection with our national security.   Not only will the CHIPS Program, as it is called--introduced  originally by the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, and  myself--this program will help us pave the way for new jobs and big  investments in cities all across our country.   If you want an idea, a glimpse, of just what those benefits would  look like, my State is an example of one place that will change  dramatically as a result of this demand for these microcircuits.   Last fall, I joined leaders from Samsung, a South Korean company that  has a large presence in Austin, TX, and they announced a $17 billion  investment in a new chip fab--that is what the manufacturing facilities  are called, a fab, fabrication unit--in Taylor, TX, which is just  outside of Austin. This facility is expected to directly create 2,000  high-tech jobs, as well as thousands of related jobs, once it is  operational. And each of these fabrication manufacturing facilities  will create a whole ecosystem of suppliers that will grow up around it.  So the $17 billion spent by Samsung for just this one fabrication  facility will be multiplied by many times in terms of the economic  benefits and the jobs created.   This is great news not just for my State, for Texas, but also for the  national economy and for our global competitiveness. Our friends and  allies are going to need a reliable chip supply, too, and I hope that  we can soon send advanced semiconductors, made in America, to countries  around the world.   Once this CHIPS Program is funded, I expect more announcements like  the one I mentioned from Samsung to follow, both in Texas and other  States across the country. We have already seen Taiwan Semiconductor in  the process of building a new fab, or manufacturing facility, in  Arizona. You have seen new investments announced by Intel in Ohio,  along with the one by Samsung in Texas, and I believe there are more to  come.   This legislation would open up about $3 billion for each new or  expanded semiconductor fabrication facility, providing a huge incentive  for companies to make this level of investment right here in America.   The potential economic benefits speak for themselves, but the biggest  reason to pass this legislation is to protect our national security.  Chips are critical components of far more than just the cell phones and  washing machines that I mentioned. Advanced fighters, quantum  computers, missile defense systems--you name it--5G, all of those rely  on semiconductors. A single rocket interceptor like we have seen used  in Iron Dome in Israel, knocking down rockets coming from Gaza, each of  those interceptors alone uses 750 of these microcircuits.   An overreliance on other countries to produce these key components of  our most vital defenses is a huge, huge risk. Yesterday, in addition to  Secretary Raimondo, we heard from Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen  Hicks, who talked about the immense national security risk that the  failure to produce these most advanced semiconductors in America has  opened up. Just to be clear, we produce zero of these most advanced  semiconductors that we depend upon for the most complex technology,  including our national security.   Our military superiority really hinges on state-of-the-art  technology. That is the one thing that we do better than any other  country in the world. If we can't produce these products because of a  lack of chips, well, the risk is obvious. And when you look at who is  producing the lion's share of the world's chips, you can see the danger  to which we are very clearly exposed.   Now, I blame COVID for exposing these vulnerable supply chains,  whether it is PPE or it is chips, but now, it is as plain as the nose  on your face, and we need to do something about it.   So here are the facts. The vast majority of semiconductors are made  in Asia, with 63 percent of the most advanced semiconductors in the  world made in one place, and that is Taiwan.   Even more concerning is the 92 percent of the world's most advanced  semiconductors that come, as I said, from Asia. But if that supply  chain, both from Asia and Taiwan in particular, were cut off, it would  lead to disastrous consequences. Unfortunately, this prospect is not  some farfetched conspiracy theory or doomsday scenario.   Xi Jinping has made no secret of his desire to invade and unify  Taiwan with the People's Republic of China, even saying he wants to be  ready to do so by the year 2027, just 5 years from now. But we can't  depend on his stated timetable because he could do it any time he  wanted to start that invasion and jeopardize our access to these chips.   We don't want to be in a position--we can't be in a position--where  the belligerence of one nation impacts our most critical supply chains.  The war in Ukraine has made that clear. Put simply, we need to bolster  domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and we have not a moment to  waste. Chip making is a very big endeavor.   A number of our colleagues and I traveled to Taiwan a few months back  to Taiwan Semiconductor's facility there, where they, as I said, make  the world's leading-edge semiconductors. It is a big operation, and it  is highly automated and very complex and expensive. In order to build  one chip, you need very expensive, highly advanced equipment; you need  skilled workers; and you need a lot of time. It can take literally  months to build a single chip, and that is assuming you have the  facility and the equipment ready to go.    So it is clear, in light of this vulnerability that we have in this  essential supply chain, that we have squandered enough time already.  After the Senate passed our version of this legislation, it took 8  months to get it back from the House of Representatives. Even then,  their bill fell short in nearly every regard. Rather than mirror the  bipartisan process here in the Senate, the Democrats in the House  negotiated a bill just among their fellow Democrats. In other words, it  was a partisan bill. That type of legislating does not lead to good and  sustainable results here in Congress.   The House-passed bill sends a whopping $8 billion to a U.N. climate  slush fund which has provided more than $100 million to China. The  entire purpose of this effort is to counter threats from China, not to  bolster China's economy with taxpayer dollars. So it defies all logic  to send billions of dollars to an unaccountable fund that could end up  helping our chief competitor, the People's Republic of China.   The House COMPETES Act also added provisions relating to immigration,  from creating new types of visas to removing green card caps. I am fine  with having a discussion and debate and votes on immigration issues,  but they do not belong in this legislation, certainly not in a partisan  fashion.   In true fashion, our colleagues in the House who are the majority  party added a range of handouts to their political base, especially  organized labor. From massive slush funds to burdensome new labor  requirements, the unions would have won big in this bill.   And, as I said, unfortunately, the House decided to undertake this  effort in a purely partisan fashion, which leaves us with very little  common ground to work with. I am frustrated, and I know that I am not  the only one. There are Democratic Senators who have joined me in  expressing their frustration over how slow it is to get this process  moving. But it is more important to get it done right away so we can  get the job done as thoroughly as necessary.   Well, there is broad bipartisan support for this effort. I have a  hard time explaining to my friends and constituents that when the White  House is in favor of something, when Democrats are in favor of  something, Republicans  [[Page S2105]]  are in favor of something, the House is in favor of it, and the Senate  is in favor of it, we still can't seem to get it done. But I hope that  we will take advantage of this opportunity--now that conferees have  been appointed by the House and the White House--to get the conference  committee to work, to do our job, and to get this bill on the  President's desk as soon as we can. I fully expect the final version to  look very much like the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate rather  than the partisan bill that came from the House.   I expressed to the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, that I hope  we can work efficiently and reach a final agreement as soon as  possible. It is critical that we get a strong bill to the President's  desk and finally back this CHIPS Program with funding and protect  ourselves from this, really, almost existential economic threat and  threat to our national security.   The bill has undergone a number of name changes over the years. It  started out as the Endless Frontier Act. Then it became the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act. Then the House called it the America  COMPETES Act. Then we gave it a new name: the Made in America Act. But  now, we have a new name--and hopefully the final name--called the  Bipartisan Innovation Act.   I hope we can work together to craft a truly good bill that lives up  to that title, the Bipartisan Innovation Act, and delivers economic and  national security benefits for all of the American people.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
