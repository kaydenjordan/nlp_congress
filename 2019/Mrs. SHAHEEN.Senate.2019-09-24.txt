 Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues and  very much appreciate Senator Udall's leadership on the joint resolution  we are speaking to today. This is the resolution that would end the  President's unconstitutional emergency declaration, which is diverting  money from critical military construction projects to fund a costly and  ineffective border wall.   Congress has made it abundantly clear that we did not provide funding  for the President's border wall and that we don't approve of raiding  military resources to fund his campaign promise--which, by the way, the  President vowed Mexico would pay for.   It is important to note that Congress works on a bipartisan basis to  provide funding to secure the southern border. According to the  Constitution, it is Congress and not the President who holds the power  of the purse. Just 6 months ago, in a strong bipartisan vote, a  majority of this body--59 Senators--successfully passed the resolution  disapproving of the President's emergency declaration. Unfortunately,  President Trump chose to veto that legislation, which is why we have  brought it to the floor again for a vote.   It is imperative that this legislative body--this Senate--defend its  authority as derived from the Constitution and protect funding that is  vital to our troops and to our national security.   I think it is difficult to overstate the critical role military  construction projects play in maintaining military readiness and  supporting our national defense. Yet this administration is treating  funding set aside for our national security like a slush fund.   Take military construction, for instance. At the Portsmouth Naval  shipyard in New Hampshire and Maine--it is on the border between New  Hampshire and Maine--any disruptions for funding in construction  projects can result in costly delays to our military's carefully  crafted plans to upgrade aging infrastructure. Delays in projects that  support the shipyard's mission threaten to exacerbate the Navy's  already high demand for submarine maintenance and the projected  submarine shortfall in the coming years.    In addition, New Hampshire's National Guard readiness centers are in  desperate need of modernization, and they can't afford further delays  to readiness center improvements. All those projects are funded through  the military construction program.   While New Hampshire's and Maine's shipyard and National Guard were  spared from President Trump's latest money grab, the same can't be said  for 127 other important military construction projects across this  country.   The 552 middle school children at Fort Campbell in the majority  leader's home State of Kentucky will have to wait for a new school as  President Trump diverts construction funding to the border.   Critical projects in Virginia that would improve a cyber operations  facility and replace hazardous materials in warehouses are another  casualty of President Trump's political games.   The Child Development Center in Maryland, the missile field in  Alaska, the weapon maintenance shop in Alabama--the list of projects  that are affected by the President's unconstitutional mandate just goes  on and on. It includes hundreds of millions of dollars for critical  infrastructure to support the Defense Department's European Deterrence  Initiative. What message does that send to our European allies  [[Page S5658]]  on our efforts to deter Russian aggression?   The impact of the President's actions and Congress's own complacency  is painfully real to the men and women who serve our Nation. These are  the same men and women who are being deprived of the resources they  need to complete their mission.   Perhaps not surprising, there are now reports indicating that the  Trump administration is again planning to take military construction  funds appropriated by Congress to build the border wall. According to  the Washington Post, you can see this pretty clearly. The  administration plans to pitch its appropriations request to Congress as  replenishment money to the Department of Defense for the money they  took this year to fund the border wall.   A Trump administration official said:         The plan is to sell it as replenishment money. . . . Then       once they got it from Congress, they would take it again.    This isn't just a one-time deal. We are talking about the  administration setting us up to do this again and again and again. This  type of deception from the administration makes funding the government  extremely difficult for Congress because we can't trust--we don't know  if the President is negotiating in good faith.   The Members of the legislative branch are endowed by the Constitution  with the power to fund the government. We must be sure that the  resources we provide in spending legislation are being used as they  were intended by the Congress. This constitutional duty is particularly  salient when the President has shown such a flagrant disregard for  congressional intent and the constitutional separation of powers. The  authority of the Congress is very clear: The power of the purse is held  by the legislative branch. Those powers were enumerated for the very  reason that we are here today--to shield against an overreaching  Executive.   This isn't about Democrat versus Republican; this is about whether  Congress votes to uphold its powers and responsibilities--powers and  responsibilities that are enshrined in the Constitution. We must take  action now in defense of both our Constitution and our national  security.   I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect our  constitutional authority as Members of Congress, to defend our national  security, and to support the resolution to terminate President Trump's  emergency declaration.   I yield the floor.
