 I just wanted to thank the majority leader for his very  generous comments, as well as acknowledge the good wishes and  congratulations from so many of my colleagues, including my colleague  from Maine, Senator King.   This is a momentous occasion for me, a real milestone. I am proud of  the fact that I have never missed a rollcall vote during the time I  have been privileged to represent the great State of Maine in the  Senate. There have been some close calls over the years, but  fortunately I have been able to be present for each one. I realize that  I have been blessed with good health and that when I had broken ankles,  including one that required surgery, it fortunately happened over the  Christmas break, so once again I was able to come back and not miss a  vote.   But it is the embodiment of how seriously I take the responsibilities  with which I have been entrusted by the people of Maine. Voting is a  Senator's most solemn responsibility, and I feel strongly about making  sure that my State is represented on each and every rollcall vote we  take in this Chamber. It hasn't always been easy, but it is such a  privilege and honor to represent the people of the great State of  Maine.   I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for acknowledging  this  [[Page S3640]]  milestone in my tenure in the Senate and in my service to the people of  Maine and this Nation.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Madam President, in 1969, General Electric opened  a factory in Bangor, ME. At that time, it was a small operation using  old machinery to produce components for turbines that powered only  7,000 homes. Today, 50 years later, the skilled workers at GE Power  manufacture equipment that powers more than 1 million homes. I am  delighted to congratulate this outstanding company and its dedicated  workforce on their golden anniversary.   GE Power is a center of excellence for steam turbine rotors and  blading. It specializes in gas turbine component manufacturing, which  is especially important as natural gas has become an essential  contributor to America's growing energy independence and has helped  reduce harmful emissions. As this facility has grown, so has its global  reputation for innovation and problem solving.   That reputation is earned every day by the nearly 400 employees at GE  Power. Their ingenuity and dedication have made their plant one of  Bangor's most significant employers. They have embraced GE's  companywide ethic of philanthropy and service to others, and they  contribute to their community in countless ways.   The General Electric Company was founded in 1892 by Thomas Alva  Edison. The famed inventor and electricity pioneer could well have had  Bangor in mind when he said, ``The three great essentials to achieve  anything are hard work, stick-to-itiveness, and common sense.'' The men  and women of GE Power demonstrate those essentials every day, creating  opportunity for themselves and our city, and I congratulate them on  this landmark anniversary.                            ____________________
