 Madam President, the Senate is continuing our  productive summer. This week we have been focused on confirming more of  the President's qualified nominees. After his confirmation yesterday,  Andrew Oldham, of Texas, will now bring his impressive credentials and  years of distinguished service to his new role on the Fifth Circuit  Court of Appeals. Today, we are considering the nomination of Ryan  Bounds to serve on the Ninth Circuit. Each of these nominees has been  selected by the President and his team for their credentials,  reputations, and commitment to the rule of law. Each has been  thoroughly examined by our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee.   Ryan Bounds is no exception. He has earned degrees from Stanford and  Yale. He clerked for the very Ninth Circuit judge he has been nominated  to succeed. For the past 14 years, he has distinguished himself as a  public servant at the Department of Justice and in his current role as  an Assistant U.S. Attorney for Oregon.   Along the way, he has earned the respect and recognition of legal  professionals from across the country and the political spectrum.  Forty-six of his colleagues in the District of Oregon describe his  ``admirable work ethic,'' ``keen judgment,'' and ``masterful writing''  as ``skills that colleagues and opponents alike seek to emulate.''   In a letter to our Senate colleagues from Oregon, criminal defense  attorneys who have litigated against Mr. Bounds testified to his  ``fairness,'' ``diligence,'' and ``legal acumen.''   They write:         He has shown time and time again that he is a man of his       word. . . . He is an excellent lawyer and would make an       outstanding judge.    A number of law professors from across the country seem to agree.  They remind us about the standards to which this body is charged with  holding judicial nominees--fairness, impartiality, intellectual rigor.  To sum it up, in the words of one legal peer, ``Ryan has all of this,  and more.''   So I look forward to voting to confirm this excellent nominee, and I  urge all of my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Madam President, speaking of excellent nominees, I  would like to speak for a moment about President Trump's outstanding  [[Page S5080]]  choice for the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.   This week, even more of our colleagues have had an opportunity to  meet with Judge Kavanaugh. I am sure they will agree that it is hard  not to come away impressed--the academic achievement, the judicial  credentials, the esteem of his peers and fellow legal professionals.   Of course, that hasn't stopped the far-left special interest groups  from grasping at straws and trying to smear this nominee any way they  can. They don't seem to care whether it is honest or not. They don't  seem to care whether it is accurate or not.   The latest made-up controversy is an attempt this week to make hay  out of comments Judge Kavanaugh made about the long ago expired  independent counsel statute. But, once again, there is no ``there''  there, whatsoever.   Here are the facts. Judge Kavanaugh's apparent concerns about the  independent counsel law appear in line with mainstream views that have  been widely held on both sides of the political aisle--views that were,  in fact, strongly held by many of my Democratic colleagues, at least  until there was an opportunity to try to make political hay.   Congress chose to let the statute expire back in 1999, based in large  part on constitutional concerns.   Let me say that again. The Congress, in 1999, on a bipartisan basis,  decided to let the independent counsel statute expire.   My colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, the assistant  Democratic leader in the Senate right now, explained this well when he  was fighting any attempt to renew the statute. Here is what he said in  1999 about the independent counsel: ``Unchecked, unbridled,  unrestrained, and unaccountable.''   My friend from Illinois punctuated his enthusiasm for the demise of  the independent counsel law by saying: ``I would like to say to Judge  Starr and all of the other counsels, your days are numbered.''   I agreed with him about the independent counsel statute. A number of  us, in both parties, saw it the very same way. So we happily allowed  the law to expire.   This has nothing to do with special counsels. That is different from  the independent counsel. The day the independent counsel statute  expired, the day we actually finished with the impeachment trial of  President Clinton in the Senate, Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut  and I went upstairs and had a press conference, stating that we agreed  that the independent counsel statute ought to be allowed to expire, and  it did. That has nothing to do with any special counsels or any tools  that are currently in place for elected officials to be held  accountable. This has nothing to do with any investigations that are in  the headlines today.   What Judge Kavanaugh was talking about is a law that has not existed  for two decades and which the Supreme Court upheld with only a single  dissenting vote. One of the dissenters in the case that upheld the  independent counsel statute was Justice Scalia.   The irony or hypocrisy is that our Democratic colleagues are now  criticizing Judge Kavanaugh because he may hold the same views on this  subject that they did, at least until Judge Kavanaugh was nominated. It  is a view that was shared and acted upon by Members of this body on  both sides of the aisle, as I have explained.   So it is another day, another off-base attack.   Here is how Newsweek dismissed this tempest in a teapot: ``Law  experts told Newsweek that Kavanaugh's view on independent counsels has  nothing to do with special counsels or Mueller's probe and, in fact,  the two types of federal investigations are completely different.''   Yet again, the far-left special interest groups that are desperate to  deny Judge Kavanaugh fair treatment are hoping the media will buy their  latest made-up charge.   Do you remember the outrage when it was learned that Judge Kavanaugh  enjoys baseball? My goodness--shocking.   Well, I am proud the President has chosen a nominee who is as strong  as Judge Kavanaugh. We should put aside these unfair attacks and  misrepresentations and give his nomination the fair treatment it  deserves.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a final matter, this week I  discussed a number of converging reports that highlight the strength of  this economy for middle-class families and job creators.   U.S. retail sales just increased for the fifth consecutive month.  Earlier this year, consumer confidence hit its highest level since  2000. More than a million new jobs have already been created in 2018.  There are more job openings than job seekers for the first time in 15  years. Over 95 percent of U.S. manufacturers are reporting confidence  in their companies' outlook--an all-time high.   Just this morning, there was this announcement from the Department of  Labor: In the second week of July, new claims for unemployment benefits  fell to their lowest level--listen to this--since 1969.   All of these favorable trends are interrelated. Jay Powell, Chairman  of the Federal Reserve, testified before our colleagues on the Banking  Committee this week that ``robust job gains, rising after-tax incomes,  and optimism among households have lifted consumer spending this  month.''   To put it even more simply, American employers are doing better. So  American workers are doing better. So American families are doing  better. So American businesses are doing better. This is how a vibrant,  growing economy works. This is what happens when Washington, DC,  swallows up less of the American people's money in taxes, when it  imposes fewer heavy-handed regulations that make it hard to do  business, and when it gets the bureaucracy's foot off the brake of our  economy.   This is among the best--quite possibly the best--of economic moments  for jobs and opportunity that Americans have seen in recent memory.   The policies of this united Republican government helped to bring it  about, and they are helping to sustain it.   Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported:         Tax cuts appear to be propelling robust consumer demand.       Many households are experiencing less withholding from their       paychecks thanks to the tax overhaul.   According to a recent survey, fewer than one in five American  manufacturers now say an unfavorable climate due to things like taxes  and regulations is a primary obstacle to their businesses. Back in  2013, during the Obama economy, more than two-thirds of the  manufacturers said that. Two-thirds said it was a problem in 2013, and  only one in five considers it a problem now.   All across the country, as job creators of all sizes have announced  worker bonuses, pay raises, and business expansions, many say loud and  clear that tax reform is what made it possible.   The American people voted. Republicans kept our promises. Now middle- class families are seeing the effects of the pro-growth policies they  asked for in 2016, and the whole world has seen what the American  people can accomplish when their government gets off their backs.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding Senate rule XXII, postcloture time on the Bounds  nomination expire at 1:45 p.m. today; further, that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  following disposition of the Bounds nomination, the Senate resume  legislative session and proceed to the immediate consideration of a  Schumer resolution that is at the desk; further, that the Senate  immediately vote on the resolution; that if agreed to, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the Bounds nomination be vitiated.    For the information of all Senators, the nomination  will be withdrawn.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Monday, July 23, the Senate proceed to executive  session for the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 1000. I ask consent that the time until 5:30 p.m. be  equally divided in the usual form and that following the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination with no  intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements related to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the disposition of the Wilkie nomination, the Senate resume legislative  session and proceed to the consideration of H.R. 6147.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  July 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I ask that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session under the previous  order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Sullivan.
