 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this action to overturn  Secretary DeVos' misguided policy against defrauded students.   Predatory, for-profit colleges are scamming students and taxpayers  out of millions of dollars. Secretary DeVos is helping them to get away  with it.   I held an oversight hearing in my Committee on Appropriations  subcommittee, and what did we find? While accounting for only 9 percent  of all students enrolled in post-secondary education, predatory, for- profit colleges account for 34 percent of all defaults.   Under Secretary DeVos' new rule, students may not receive the  financial relief that they deserve and are entitled to under the  borrower defense to repayment provision of the Higher Education Act.   While the Obama administration created a streamlined process to help  students access the relief, the Trump administration is making it  nearly impossible.   Under the Secretary's new rule, if borrowers cannot prove the school  intentionally defrauded them or if they cannot file their claim fast  enough or if they cannot document their exact financial harm, they lose  out. As little as 3 percent of eligible debt will be forgiven now.   With the Secretary's rule, what little relief there is will likely be  shouldered by taxpayers, not the schools that are committing the fraud.  It is wrong.   In Connecticut, 1,100 defrauded students are waiting to be made  whole. They need help, not Secretary DeVos' cruel policy.   We must pass this Congressional Review Act resolution and stop her.
