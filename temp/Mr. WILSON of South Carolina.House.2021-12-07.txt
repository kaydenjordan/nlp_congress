 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize  the 2021 Army Congressional Fellow, Major Brett Tinder, for his service  to the citizens of the Second District of South Carolina. His year-long  stay with the office is concluding and Brett will be sorely missed. Not  only has he been an indispensable contributor to legislative goals,  including the FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, but a valued  member of the team.   After graduating with a political science degree from Rutgers  University, his already impressive military career has included  numerous commendation and leadership positions in Fort Benning and Fort  Carson. Brett has also been deployed to Poland, Germany, Romania, and  to Afghanistan, where he was successful in his part with Operation  Resolute Support--Freedom's Sentinel.   His next assignment is with the Pentagon, where Major Tinder will be  a valued participant for peace through strength.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   We will remember Pearl Harbor.                            ____________________
