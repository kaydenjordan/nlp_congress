 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of S. 544 to eliminate  the sunset on the Veterans Choice Program.   This bill will basically allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to  continue spending previously appropriated resources in the Veterans  Choice Program to provide direct and timely patient care to veterans.  It allows the VA to charge a veteran's healthcare insurer for  nonservice-connected care so that veterans aren't sent expensive  medical bills, wasting time trying to figure out how to get them paid.  Finally, it allows the VA to share medical information with community  care providers so patient care is better coordinated.   This legislation is identical to H.R. 369, which passed unanimously  in our Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It includes amendments offered  by members of that committee.   I would like to take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to congratulate and thank  the chairman of the committee for the bipartisan way that he approached  this. The issue of veterans care is a passionate issue for all of us.   The issue of the Choice Program arose out of the crisis in Phoenix  and other places in 2014, and a sunset that needed to be addressed was  handled in a professional manner. It brought all parties together. I  think the chairman is going to get a unanimous vote. They have got one  in the Senate.   I can see that, under less steady hands, where this may have bogged  down, and I appreciate the chairman's sense of urgency in getting it to  this point. It puts us in a good place. So thank you for that.   It also gives us the time we need to come to a bipartisan fix for the  Choice Program. We know, under the Choice Program, veterans are still  waiting too long to receive care. As we said, in 2014, we all supported  the Choice Act because of the crisis. Throughout the country, veterans  were waiting, and in some cases dying, because they were waiting for  care. If we recall right, an honorable and decent man, the VA  Secretary, resigned over this crisis. So this was an important issue  that needed to be addressed. We passed the Choice Act so that veterans  could get that care.   The Choice Program was created as a temporary fix, designed to end  this summer or when the VA spent the $10 billion. As the chairman said,  there is about $1 billion left in Choice. With veterans still in need  of care, we cannot possibly allow that to go back without addressing  where it needs to go. It would be a waste of money, a waste of time,  and it would make veterans' wait times even higher.   The bill gives us time to rewrite the Choice Program. The bill will  give us time to address all of the problems with Choice so that  veterans' care is managed and coordinated with VA and community care  providers and so that veterans do not have wait times. It will also  make sure the money will continue to be spent on veterans' health care.   I look forward to working with the chairman. As I said earlier, his  steady hand and visionary leadership has gotten us to this point. It  will ensure that we can figure out what the next iteration of  community-based care looks like, and we can come together, bring that  to the floor, and get it passed.   For this reason, I would urge my colleagues to support this  legislation so veterans can receive their care now while Congress  continues to work to improve upon that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), my good friend and a friend of all veterans,  our ranking member on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to commend our  chairman, Mr. Roe, and ranking member, Mr. Walz, for their bipartisan  efforts.   I rise to speak on S. 544, the bill that will eliminate the sunset on  the Veterans Choice Program.   The Veterans Choice Program was a bipartisan effort to quickly help  our veterans in need by ensuring they had access to quality health care  after the crisis in Phoenix. However, it was a temporary program. It  was not intended to last longer than a few years until Congress could  have developed the future of VA community care. As many of my  colleagues note, the Choice Program needs an update. This bill  represents the first step of that process.    It is expected that the Veterans Choice fund will still have funding  by August 2017, as noted, when the Choice Program is scheduled to  sunset. This bill will ensure that our veterans will be able to use  those resources, and it will ensure those who have long-term care  through the Choice Program will not suddenly find themselves without  care.   But, as we design a new program to replace the Choice Program, we  must ensure that it is an effective and efficient system of care that  follows the very best practices of American health care. Part of that  is ensuring that these healthcare practitioners do not discriminate on  the basis of race, sex, gender, or sexual orientation.   The current Choice Program eliminated those protections to facilitate  faster implementation, and while I am concerned of the regulatory  burden these antidiscrimination measures could provide, I am committed  to working with my colleagues across the aisle on a commonsense and  reasonable compromise. We can make a program that not only provides  effective and accessible care for our veterans, but also prevents  discrimination in the workplace and upholds the finest ideals of the  United States of America.    Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my privilege to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), my good friend  and also a good friend of veterans, the vice ranking member of the full  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), the ranking member of our Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), the ranking member of our Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. O'Rourke), my good friend, the ranking member of our Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee.   Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the  chairman of the full committee, and I join the ranking member of the  full committee in honoring the work of Chairman Roe, his staff, and his  ensuring that we do the right thing for every single one of the  veterans in this country that we are here to serve.   It would be easy just to criticize the Choice Program which has not  worked fully as intended. Too many of the veterans that we represent  are still getting bills when their provider in the community, the VA,  and the third-party administrator can't resolve their differences.   Too many veterans are having too hard of a time in getting an  appointment in a timely fashion. And as we learned recently, the VA  still is not fully measuring the true wait time for the more than 3  million appointments that have been made through the Choice Program  right now. We don't have the kind of accountability that we must have.   All the same, the Choice Program is bridging care for veterans who  need it in millions of instances. To simply allow the sunset to take  place without having the time necessary to work on some of the  necessary fixes would be irresponsible. So thanks to the chairman and  the ranking member, we are able to do that today.   We also ensure that the VA becomes the primary payer, which is going  to reduce some of the billing headaches that veterans have  unnecessarily been subjected to.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to point out that the bill contains the Vet  Connect Act, which I was able to author with Congressman Benishek, a  bipartisan bill, last session, re-introduced this session.   It is bicameral, as well, in the Senate. We have Senators Tester,  Isakson, and Manchin, who authored this bill that ensures that  veterans' private medical information follows them from the VA to their  provider in the community and then back to the VA, ensuring that every  appointment, every provider, and every doctor can make informed medical  decisions on behalf of those veterans. Right now, at the current rate  of inclusion of veterans' personal medical information, it would take  60 years to get all the data into the hands of the doctors who need to  make that care.   This brings the VA and the veterans under the VA's care into modern  medical record keeping and sharing. It honors all of the HIPAA  regulations; ensures privacy of veterans' medical records; but, most  importantly, ensures that they are going to get better, more informed  quality care, better outcomes, better treatment. It is what the  veterans that we serve have earned and deserve.    I am very proud to join my colleagues in this to work for its  passage. I hope that the other Members of this body will join us in  supporting this unanimously.  [[Page H2726]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?  I have two speakers to go.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall). The gentleman from Minnesota  has 7\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), a good friend, a new member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, someone who came to the House of Representatives and  asked to serve veterans and be on the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Kihuen), who has taken a keen interest in veterans' issues. I am  grateful that he is here today.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I would like to thank the  chairman, the staff, and everyone who has been here.   I think, of all the committees that are modeling the behavior of  democracy, bipartisanship, and what our government stands for, the  Veterans' Affairs Committee is one that takes that responsibility  seriously. The chairman always models it. I think this is a case of  that.   You heard the speakers come here. This is a big issue. There may be  some differences in how the delivery, long term, looks, but there is no  division on getting the best and most timely care to our veterans.   With that, I encourage my colleagues to support S. 544.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
