 Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government's  primary role is to protect the country by securing our borders.   The Biden administration has allowed, even facilitated, an invasion  of more than 8 million foreign nationals led by drug cartels,  terrorists, and human traffickers.   Joe Biden has created a fentanyl crisis, a national security crisis,  and a child trafficking disaster, making the U.S. vulnerable in every  way. In addition, this invasion costs taxpayers billions of dollars  every year.   Cartels are bringing unaccompanied minors across the border, and  these taxpayer dollars are being used to fly unaccompanied children  across the country on secret flights.   Secretary Mayorkas has lost track of 85,000 children, and he must be  held accountable through impeachment.   Americans miss President Trump. He made border security his top  priority. In Congress, I will always defend children and fight for  strong borders.                            ____________________
