 Mr. Speaker, America is heavily in debt  and living beyond its means.   Last month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a  report projecting a Federal budget deficit of $1.4 trillion for 2023.  Further, the net interest on our national debt will amount to a $10.5  trillion burden in taxes for families over the next decade destroying  jobs.   The Nation has had a record increase in revenue, but unfortunately,  under Biden and the Democrats, spending has surpassed the amount of  money raised. This reckless and irresponsible spending has led to  horrific debt as a threat to our children and grandchildren.   The newly elected House Republican majority led by Speaker Kevin  McCarthy is committed to creating jobs with an economy that is strong  and fiscally responsible.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   I thank Tucker Carlson for last night's ``Tucker Investigates'' about  January 6, which Glenn Beck has correctly identified as every level has  been lying about January 6.   The truth has finally been revealed.                            ____________________
