 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a young man whose  thoughtfulness and generosity has stirred the hearts, souls, and  patriotic spirits of people across my district in Arkansas.   Earlier this year, 6-year-old Huck Plyler from Hope, Arkansas,  started what is now known as Huck's Military Care Package Project.  Huck's project is comprised of putting together care packages for  nearly 700 members of the Arkansas National Guard currently deployed to  the Horn of Africa.   Huck's care packages include items such as nonperishable snacks, lip  balm, sunscreen, personal hygiene products, socks, and more.   When asked why he decided to start this project, Huck's answer was:  ``We do this because they help us, so we help them.''   Though simple, this reply is wise beyond his years.   Huck's dedication to this project has enabled him to collect enough  donated items and monetary donations to send over 50 boxes to our  troops thus far.   Mr. Speaker, Huck's kindness and thoughtfulness brings honor to  himself; his parents, Caleb and Brianna Plyler; and to the benevolent  people of Hempstead County and Arkansas.   I commend and thank Huck for his hard work and commitment to our  military members serving overseas. It is young men and women like Huck  that give me hope for the future, hope that the giving and caring  spirit is still alive and well in our young people and country today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was delayed in returning to the floor.
