 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a man from  my district for his commitment to keeping Iowa beautiful and preserving  some of our most treasured historical sites.   Marc Moen, a developer in Iowa City, was recently presented with the  Iowa Architectural Foundation's 2021 Community Enhancement Through  Architecture and Design Award. The awards program recognizes  individuals, organizations, agencies, or communities outside the  architectural profession who have demonstrated consistent and effective  leadership, vision, and support for architecture, or have continually  championed the cause of architecture in ways that contribute to the  betterment of Iowa communities.   Marc began his architectural work in 1985 when he advocated to save  the first brick house in Iowa City from being razed and began restoring  the building instead. Since then, Marc has worked to make Iowa City the  beautiful community it is today.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Marc for his dedication to our  community and to our State.            Lewis Payne Is Carrying on Iowa's Family Farm Heritage     Mr. Speaker, today I recognize a man from my  district for continuing his family legacy of leadership in Iowa  agriculture.   This year, Lewis Payne of Kalona was awarded the Heritage Award by  the Iowa Farm Bureau. The Heritage Award recognizes agriculture  industry leaders who have carried on the tradition of farming family- owned land.   Known as the Pickard Farm, Lewis' 261.4-acre plot of land was  originally purchased by his great-great-grand uncle over 172 years ago  and was passed from Lewis' great-grandfather down to his grandfather,  then eventually to his mother, who then passed the land down to Lewis,  who had been raised on that farm helping his parents.   When asked about the future of his family farm, Lewis said that his  goal is to be a steward of the land and eventually pass it down to the  next generation.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Lewis for continuing a fantastic Iowa  family tradition and for making Iowa a better place to live, work, and  raise a family.                              4 Paws for Ability     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share a heartwarming  story about total strangers coming together to make a positive impact  in a child's life in my district.   Six-year-old Keagan Berding of Bettendorf, Iowa, loves to run.  Diagnosed with autism at the age of 2, Keagan is nonverbal, but he is  very social and has several passions, including playing outside with  other children, showing affection through hugs, and watching videos on  his tablet.   Because of Keagan's love of running, extra measures are needed to  ensure his safety, and this is where a fantastic organization has come  in to assist Keagan and his parents. 4 Paws for Ability is a group that  provides and trains service animals to assist people like the Berding  family across the globe. Currently the organization has raised over  $43,000 toward providing Keagan with a fully trained service dog, with  the largest single donation being $10,000 from a complete stranger  whose own child has benefited from a service animal.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for 4 Paws for Ability and everyone who  has contributed for striving to make positive impacts in the lives of  children like Keagan all over the world.                            ____________________
