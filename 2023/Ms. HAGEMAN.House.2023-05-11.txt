 Mr. Speaker, we have a crisis at our southern border. It  is a crisis that started in earnest on the day this President was sworn  into office. On day one of his Presidency, he began issuing executive  orders to end the successful policies implemented by the Trump  administration. In total, President Biden issued 94 executive orders  related to the border within his first 100 days in office.   The results have been disastrous. Over 10 times the population of my  home State of Wyoming has illegally crossed the border since Joe Biden  has been President. At the same time, over 14,000 pounds of fentanyl  have come across the Southwest border--enough to kill over 3.1 billion  people.   Through the first 6 months of 2023, 80 people who appeared on the  terrorist watch list have been caught trying to cross into the United  States--more than the last 5 years combined.   How many slipped through?   We don't know.   These numbers show that without a doubt, Joe Biden has enabled the  largest drug smuggling and human trafficking operation in U.S. history,  and he has made our country less safe in the process.   Stopping illegal immigration is the number one issue for my  constituents in Wyoming. We must fix the situation, and H.R. 2 does  just that.   It is time to finish the wall, end catch and release, protect women  and children from human traffickers, stop the illegal drugs flowing  into the country, fix our broken asylum process, and force this  administration to finally address the disaster that they have created.
