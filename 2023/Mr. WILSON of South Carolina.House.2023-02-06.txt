 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, the catastrophic Chinese  spy balloon spectacle clearly threatened American families from Alaska  to Missouri to North Carolina and to my home community in South  Carolina with Fort Jackson and the Savannah River Site.   This confirms that President Biden and Vice President Harris should  resign.   My call for their resignation was valid in August 2021 due to the  surrender and the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan with 13 dead,  creating a safe haven for terrorists to attack American families.   It was not political in 2021 when the succeeding President, then- Speaker Nancy Pelosi, would have been a Democrat.   And it is not political now in 2023 when the succeeding President  would be Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who is a Republican.   It is irrelevant for American families which party is in power  because the first criterion of a leader should be their capability  regardless of party, and sadly, Biden and Harris are failures.    Resignation now is further reinforced by their open border policies  having allowed hundreds of identified terrorists  [[Page H689]]  into America to commit mass murder. When the domestic attack occurs,  Biden and Harris will not be able to adequately respond. Credible  leadership is imperative to protect American families.                            ____________________
