 Mr. Speaker, I was not present today, June 21, for  rollcall votes. I was attending a memorial service in my district. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 311, ``yea''  on rollcall No. 312, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 313, ``nay'' on rollcall  No. 314, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 315.                            ____________________
