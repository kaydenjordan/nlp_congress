 Mr. President, first I want to recognize my colleague  from Connecticut, his moving tribute to a great American, and also  thank him for his steadfast leadership on issues of gun safety in this  country.   I am standing here with my colleagues today to talk about what is  going on in this country around empowering children. We have a big  thing happening tomorrow with the vast majority of families with kids  across the country.   As of tomorrow, they will start seeing more money in their bank  accounts every year for the rest of the year. These payments are the  result of changes that we have made to the child tax credit, which was  signed into law by President Biden as part of the American Rescue Plan  because of the changes we advocated for.   What President Biden made law, more families and children are going  to benefit from the child tax credit. More than ever before in history,  in fact, this will be the greatest cut in overall child poverty in the  history of America for this coming year.   So starting tomorrow, 90 percent of kids in America--90 percent of  their families across the country--will start to see these payments for  the rest of this year, up to $300 for every child in a household under  6 and $250 for every child in the household ages 6 through 17. For  families in suburbs and cities and rural areas, for families across the  country, this policy is transformative.   For the family of people with essential workers in Florida, the  grandmother raising three children in California, a single mom in  Pennsylvania working the same job for 20 years, for a parent in Utah-- you can go on and on and on--this is one of the most transformative  policy changes made in our Nation in more than a century.   This policy means stability. It means help is on the way. It means  hope is here.   In my home State, Margarita from Passaic, NJ, who is raising three  kids on her own while working two jobs, one before sunrise, starting  tomorrow, she will see hundreds of dollars a month to help her pay the  electric bill, help her make rent, and help her children succeed in  school.   For the family of two educators with kids in New York, tomorrow is  transformative. Washington State, North Dakota, blue State, so-called  red State--all over this country, we are seeing a transformation.   This is what a mom from Kansas said:         [This child tax credit] would help so much for single moms       like me to be able to feel secure as a parent. If at any time       something were to happen to me, such as a car repair, a       doctor visit, even a book fair for my children, I am just not       making enough to have any extra for anything other than       bills. Shoes and coats, maybe a ball glove. Karate or dance       lessons to improve social skills and athletic abilities and       teach children teamwork would be possible; [and] maybe even       at Christmas since they didn't get one in 2020.    For middle-class families trying to stay afloat, lower income  families desperate to make ends meet, and families living in poverty  struggling to put food on the table, tomorrow is a new start. For  millions of Americans across the country, from this body, our  President, tomorrow will begin a historically unparalleled moment.   Senator Brown, Senator Bennet, Senator Warnock, and I, along with our  House colleagues, are going to continue to do what must be done. This  change for this year--cutting child poverty, empowering millions of  families, 90 percent of whom with kids will see a benefit--we must make  this permanent. I will fight alongside my colleagues to see that this  is not a one-time benefit for 1 year but a permanent change that we-- change our status. We are the 36th wealthiest Nation on the planet, and  we are 4th from the bottom in child poverty. We are second to last in  terms of child allowances. We in America have to make this country live  up to its promise to every child that we are the cornerstone of the  idea of the American dream; that we are the most fertile soil for which  a child could thrive; that we love our children not just in words but  in the policies we make. This is a historic moment.   The one thing I will say to anyone listening to my words, because, as  my colleague knows, some families are eligible but might not benefit,  please, we need to make sure that portal--that people know to go to  childtaxcredit.gov to get the information. All of us have an obligation  to help everyone avail themselves of this policy. I believe, God  willing, we will make it permanent.   I now turn to my colleague Senator Bennet from Colorado, Mr.  President, with your permission.
