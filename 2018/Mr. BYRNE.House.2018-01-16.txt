 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1532, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians  Land Reaffirmation Act, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will  provide much-needed certainty to an Indian Tribe in my district.   The Poarch Creek Indians are a valued and trusted part of our  community in southwest Alabama. Their economic impact in Escambia  County, Alabama, speaks for itself. From their help with funding for  community projects to their business enterprises that employ thousands  of Alabamians, the Poarch help make life better for so many people in  our area.   This legislation is necessary due to the legal uncertainty caused by  the Supreme Court decision in Carcieri v. Salazar. This decision has  unnecessarily created legal ambiguity about whether the Poarch Creek  land is actually in trust or not.   To be clear: this legislation would not have any change over the way  the Poarch Band or their land are currently being treated in Alabama.  In fact, this legislation simply provides legal certainty to help  prevent future challenges regarding the status of the Tribe's land.   I am pleased we were able to attract bipartisan support for the  legislation, including a unanimous vote out of the Natural Resources  Committee last year. I also want to extend my gratitude to Chairman  Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and the committee staff for their  commitment to Indian issues and their work on this legislation.   Ultimately, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  commonsense, straightforward legislation to give much-needed legal  certainty to the Poarch Band of Creek Indians.
