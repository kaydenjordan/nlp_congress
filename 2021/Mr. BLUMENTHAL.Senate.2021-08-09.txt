 Madam President, I am here to talk about the Build  Back Better proposal and the budget resolution that we will shortly  take up, but let me just respond briefly to my good friend and  colleague from Iowa's remarks on the interview that was conducted with  Jeffrey Rosen on Saturday and the previous interview with Rich  Donoghue.   I agree completely that the facts and the evidence are what are  important here, and this investigation is supremely significant. I hope  that we will join, on a bipartisan basis, to follow the facts and the  law wherever they lead and encourage voluntary cooperation by the  witnesses and collect all of the documents and other evidence that is  necessary to fairly and fully present the truth to the American people.  They deserve to know what we have heard so far, which amounts to a  chilling and shocking picture of a President seeking to corrupt the  Department of Justice and overthrow an election. That much has been  clear from the evidence that we have seen   But I agree that we should not talk about the specific facts at this  point because it is an ongoing investigation. And I hope that we will  join, in a bipartisan way, not only to encourage voluntary cooperation  but to seek testimony and documents by subpoena where necessary, where,  as a matter of resort, if that evidence is denied, we need to do so  because the interests of our Nation are best served by the truth.   All of it should be made public. Eventually, these transcripts from  interviews and other evidence should be made public so that the  American people can see the truth. I know that my colleague from Iowa  has been a staunch and steadfast champion of whistleblowing, of making  available the truth to the American people. Nobody in this body has  been a stronger advocate of whistleblowers and protecting them so that  the American people could see the truth than my colleague from Iowa. So  I am hopeful that we will work together toward that end.                            Budget Reconciliation    Madam President, the Build Back Better proposal that will soon be  coming before the Senate is literally a milestone for this country.   The bipartisan infrastructure proposal that we will shortly pass is  transformative for our Nation and for Connecticut. It will enable us to  do long-overdue work on our roads and bridges, our railroads and  broadband, on the physical assets that are essential to this country  creating jobs and remaining competitive around the globe. This work has  been too long delayed, and I will be proud to support it.   I thank all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have  contributed so critically to making this vote possible; final passage  of a measure that will enable the bridge across the Connecticut River  to be truly safe and reliable; the Mixmaster in Waterbury--so-called  because it mixes several roads at once--to be finally done; a proposal  that will enable, we hope, eventually, the tracks between New Haven and  New York to be really reliable, to be maintained properly.   On every one of those transportation byways, there are people who  depend on them, people who are going to work or to visit their family.  Those people are, at the end of the day, who this infrastructure  serves. And the freight that will be on railroads or the goods and  produce transported on our highways go to people. They serve our  economy. They create jobs. We need to do much more for those people.   Just today in the New York Times, in the Business section, there is  an article about a young mother who wants to go back to work, reenter  the workforce, but she has two children. One is awaiting the beginning  of school, and the other, she feels, needs and deserves daycare before  she can go back to work. That road that enables her to drive or the  railroad, to commute, won't be a link to the workplace for her until  she has daycare.   Our economy is interconnected in ways that we understand intuitively  when we look at individual people, but too often, we have mounds of  paper--no longer for all of us truly paper but mounds of print--and  numbers and statistics. The real story is in that young mother whose  account is so important to us, the human story.   Universal daycare, paid family leave, affordable medical care, and  housing--they are also the stuff of human needs. They are part of our  human assets.   Seniors need dental care and eyeglasses and hearing aids so that they  can appreciate all of the benefits that we are trying to bring them  through this infrastructure program.   The American people need jobs so that they can afford prescription  drugs, and the cost of prescription drugs needs to be lower so they  don't have to make these choices that we describe day after day between  paying the mortgage and putting food on the table and clothing their  kids.   The pandemic has affected health, food, shelter, and the financial  and overall security of families across the country. It has taken a  toll on small businesses. They, too, need help. The Restaurant  Revitalization Program should be replenished and small businesses given  a lifeline they need because they have been so direly injured and  threatened.   We need to build back America and the assets--the roads and bridges  but also the systems--that serve Americans, and we need to build it  back better.   I am proud to support this budget resolution that will make  investments for working families, the elderly, our environment.   Over the past year, I have spoken to countless families who need that  childcare and providers who furnish it across the northeast. Childcare  is critical not only to those jobs and the people who fill jobs, but  also to the emotional and educational development of children--allowing  moms and dads, and grandparents, to go back to work, but also for  children to have the basics in preparation for education that they  need.   By establishing a universal pre-care system and providing families  with incentives, like the child care tax cuts, to help them afford  care, we can ensure that children are prepared for success and parents  can go to work.   But it isn't enough to ensure that families can just afford  childcare. We have to ensure they are able to live healthy lives. And  we know healthcare is complicated; it is confusing; it is expensive,  especially for our aging seniors and people with disabilities and our  fellow Americans with preexisting conditions.   Over this past year, we learned clearly and dramatically how  resource-deprived our healthcare system has become--individuals forced  to make choices between keeping a roof over their head or going to the  doctor or paying for medications. No American family should be forced  to make those choices.   And we need to invest. It is not about spending; it is investing in  our healthcare system. This budget proposal will accomplish exactly  that goal.   Lower prescription drug costs, lowering those burdens, providing  broader access to medical providers, including that dental care,  hearing aids, and vision for individuals--all individuals--on Medicare  should be our paramount goal.   And it is critical that home healthcare workers and patients  understand their value. Individuals with disabilities were left  struggling to find affordable home- and community-based services  throughout the pandemic. We need to appreciate the home care workers  and support them and pay them adequately, just as we need to provide  that home care for seniors who need it. Healthcare is more than access  to care; it is the basic system that provides that access.   And there should be no delay when we are talking about the air we  breathe and the water we drink, because those assets also are essential  to healthcare.   Rail will be supported--better railroads, tracks, cars--by this  proposal that we are passing today or tomorrow, but there is more that  needs to be done to ensure high-speed rail. Right now, the link between  New Haven and New York is slower than it was 50 years ago. We need to  make sure that it is quicker--not just more reliable, but faster and  more reliable and safer.   Too often, the impacts of unsafe air and unhealthy drinking water  fall on minority and low-income communities.  [[Page S6081]]  They have disproportionately faced adverse impacts from public and  environmental health grants, and the American people are counting on  our leadership to authorize funding for investment in programs that  support clean energy resources. Climate change is an enemy that we must  conquer, just as we are working to conquer the pandemic.   In the Senate, I have worked with the administration to meet the goal  of conserving 30 percent of our country's lands and 30 percent of our  waters within the next decade. That goal is ambitious, but it is a  vital effort that takes an important step toward reducing environmental  justice and ensuring healthy lives for all.   This proposal is comprehensive, and that is exactly what is needed  now--a comprehensive program that deserves our support and our  leadership. We must invest in our country's leadership by putting the  American people and what they need--childcare, healthy homes, and  environments--put it first.   I am proud to support this proposal, and I look forward to advancing  it on the Senate floor.   I yield the floor.
