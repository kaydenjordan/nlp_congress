 Mr. President, this past December, H.R. 1865, the Further  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, was enacted into law as Public  Law 116-94. I want to take a moment to offer some clarity regarding  section 903 of division J of the Act, which is a modified version of  the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of  2019.   I commend the Republican and Democratic Senators who have dedicated  their time to pursuing justice for American victims of terrorism. We  all want these victims to have their day in court and to be  appropriately compensated. It is also important that we do so in a  manner that does not do more harm than good. That is the balance that  was sought in section 903 on a bipartisan basis.   One component of section 903 is a provision that enables the  Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, PA  and PLO, to conduct certain activities in the United States  ``exclusively for the purpose of conducting official business'' and  activities ``ancillary'' to those listed in the provision without  consenting to personal jurisdiction in civil cases. The provision was  included because Senators of both parties understand that it is in our  national interest to permit certain activities related to the official  representation of the PA and PLO. Having been part of the negotiation  that resulted in this language, I believe it is important that we have  a clear understanding of the types of activities that are considered  ``ancillary'' to the conduct of official business.   While the official business of any foreign mission necessarily  includes meetings with Members of Congress and their staff,  representatives of the executive branch, and other public officials,  ancillary activities are those which may not be essential for the  minimal functioning of the mission but which support the mission's  primary operations. By way of example, I am confident that every Member  of this body would, as I do, consider a public statement, the issuance  of a press release, or a meeting or public appearance--while not  essential--to be ancillary to his or her primary functions as a U.S.  Senator and would reject any attempt to define such activities  otherwise.   That is also why, with regard to the PA and PLO, while we may or may  not agree with the statements of its representatives, the law  contemplates that its representatives may meet with advocates regarding  relevant issues, make public statements, and otherwise engage in public  advocacy and civil society activities that are ancillary to the conduct  of official business without consenting to personal jurisdiction. Such  jurisdiction is provided for elsewhere in section 903.   The message in this bill is clear: Congress is committed to pursuing  justice for American victims of terrorism while ensuring appropriate  standards regarding the ability of foreign missions to conduct official  business in the United States. This is a solution that protects U.S.  national interests, and I thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle  who have worked together to find a way forward on this measure.                            ____________________     Mr. President I want to take a few moments to discuss an  issue that has garnered some attention in recent months, which is our  relations with the Government of the Philippines, including President  Duterte's counter-drug strategy and his government's treatment of those  who have openly criticized that strategy.   It is important to first recount the long history of friendship and  strategic cooperation between the United States and the Philippines.  Family and cultural ties that extend back many generations bind us  together, as do our shared goals in East Asia and the Pacific. Our  Armed Forces regularly engage in joint exercises to enhance regional  security. Despite our differences, relations between our two countries  are strong and based on mutual respect.   We should also extend our deepest sympathies to those harmed by the  recent eruption of the Taal volcano in Luzon. It has displaced tens of  thousands of families and destroyed the livelihoods of many. The U.S.  Agency for International Development and international organizations  that receive U.S. funding like the World Food Programme are responding  with humanitarian aid to those in need, which I and others in Congress  strongly support.   One of the manifestations of our longstanding, close relations with  the Philippines is the assistance we provide annually to promote a wide  range of interests there, from humanitarian and economic assistance to  military assistance, which in fiscal year 2019 totaled more than $150  million. However, as is the case for other recipients of U.S.  assistance, those funds are not an entitlement and they are not a blank  check. For example, in the Philippines they may not be used to support  police counter-drug operations. We condemn the thousands of  extrajudicial executions of suspected drug users and drug-traffickers  by police and their collaborators. Such a strategy is not consistent  with due process and the rule of law, nor an effective way to combat  the trafficking and abuse of illegal drugs that every country,  including the United States, is struggling with. We do support  treatment programs for Filipinos suffering from drug addiction.   We also stand strongly in support of freedom of expression, whether  in the Philippines or anywhere else, including in our own country, and  that, as well as President Duterte's counter-drug strategy, is what  underlies our current  [[Page S628]]  disagreement with his government that is illustrated, most recently, by  the passage without opposition of S. Res. 142, which condemns the  imprisonment of Senator Leila De Lima and calls for her immediate  release. It also calls on the Government of the Philippines to  guarantee freedom of the press and to drop charges against Maria Ressa  and the online news network Rappler.   As said by Senator Durbin who, like I, cosponsored that resolution,  ``[i]n the end, [De Lima's] freedom and the end of government  harassment against journalists like Maria Ressa will be important tests  of whether cherished democratic norms we share with our long-standing  Filipino allies will be respected by President Duterte.''   The response of the Duterte government was regrettable, albeit not  uncharacteristic. Like Senator Durbin, I have become accustomed to  being on the receiving end of baseless personal attacks by President  Duterte's spokesman, as if those attacks might intimidate us or boost  domestic support for his government. Rather than respond substantively  to legitimate concerns about extrajudicial killings, impunity, and  freedom of expression that I, Senator Durbin, Senator Markey, our  Democratic and Republican colleagues, the U.S. State Department, the  United Nations, and respected human rights organizations have raised  over the years, we are told that S. Res. 142 is based on ``bogus  narratives . . . promoted by Duterte's usual antagonists.'' We are  accused of being ``prejudiced'' and ``misguided,'' our support for  Senator De Lima ``a direct and shameless affront to the Republic of the  Philippines, which has long ceased to be a colony of the United  States.'' Our actions are called ``brazen and intrusive to the dignity  of an independent, democratic and sovereign state'' which would ``not  be bullied by any foreign country or by its officials, especially by  misinformed and gullible politicians who grandstand at our expense.''  Going a step further, the Duterte government inexplicably threatened to  deny visas to Americans who seek to visit the Philippines and who have  nothing to do with these concerns.   Such vitriolic hyperbole is barely deserving of a response, but  suffice it to say that none of us remotely regards the Philippines as a  colony of the United States, nor are our concerns about the treatment  of Senator De Lima and Maria Ressa an intrusion of the Philippines'  sovereignty, which we respect. S. Res. 142 is based on consistent  reporting by the Trump administration's State Department, the United  Nations, and other credible observers, including in the Philippines,  who share the conviction that defending freedom of expression has  nothing to do with sovereignty. To the contrary, it is everyone's  responsibility, wherever it is denied. If there is any ``intrusion of  dignity'' or ``shameless affront'' in this instance, it is the  harassment, threats, false charges, and imprisonment of those who have  dared to criticize the Duterte government's lawless counter-drug  strategy.   None of us here, nor in the Philippines, has an interest in  prolonging this dispute. To the contrary, we want to enhance our  cooperation in a multitude of areas of common interest--from maritime  security to human trafficking to climate change. What 100 U.S.  Senators--Republicans and Democrats--have urged is succinctly spelled  out in the resolution. Rather than deny visas to Americans, many of  whom have family in the Philippines, and rather than resort to ad  hominem attacks, there is, as Senator Durbin has said, ``an easy and  honorable way forward.'' As I have said for months, we are not aware of  any credible evidence that Senator De Lima, who has been detained for  nearly 3 years, is guilty of the crimes she has been accused of. If  such evidence exists, it should be promptly produced in a public trial,  and she should be provided the opportunity to refute it. Otherwise she  should be released. As a former prosecutor, I know that is the minimum  to which anyone accused of a crime is entitled.   And respected, courageous investigative journalists like Maria Ressa  should be able to publish without fear of retaliation. There is no  surer way to destroy the underpinnings of democracy than by using  threats and unlawful arrest to silence the press.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have spoken repeatedly about the unlawful  imprisonment and abuse of human rights activists by the Saudi  Government, which continue despite promises of reform by Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman. In fact, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the  botched coverup and sham investigation, and the ongoing, systematic  repression of Saudi activists have only served to confirm what we  already knew, which is that the Crown Prince is no reformer but,  instead, a ruthless autocrat intimidated by non-violent dissent from  his own people.   One such activist being unlawfully detained by the Saudi royal  family--which for all intents and purposes is the government--is  Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent and outspoken women's rights defender  known for her activism against the women's driving ban and the male  guardianship system. In 2014, Ms. al-Hathloul, who had a driver's  license from the United Arab Emirates, UAE, was detained for 73 days  after attempting to drive into Saudi Arabia from the UAE.   She was arrested again in May 2018 along with several other women's  rights activists, weeks before the Saudi Government lifted the ban on  female drivers. She was detained and forcibly deported via private  Saudi jet from the UAE and remains in a Saudi prison today. According  to Ms. al-Hathloul's family and several human rights organizations, she  has been tortured, sexually harassed, and threatened with rape and  murder by Saudi officials.   For the first 10 months of her detention, Ms. al-Hathloul was held  without charges or trial and for the first 3 months, without access to  her family or lawyer. In her first trial session on March 13, 2019, she  was charged with promoting women's rights; calling for an end to the  male guardianship system; and contacting international organizations,  foreign media, and other activists. It is hard to believe that in the  year 2020, advocacy that has been protected under international law for  nearly half a century is grounds for imprisonment and prosecution in  Saudi Arabia, a country whose leaders enjoy the best of what oil  revenues can buy while subjecting their critics to treatment  reminiscent of the 1800s.   Imprisoned, tortured, and charged with multiple ``crimes,'' Ms. al- Hathloul's last court appearance was on April 3, 2019, more than 250  days ago. She remains in prison without any information regarding when  her next court session will take place. The right of due process simply  does not exist in Saudi Arabia.   This is typical of how Saudi Arabia treats those who dare to exercise  their rights to free expression, association, and assembly. We should  all be outraged, and in fact Republicans and Democrats in Congress as  well as dozens of foreign governments have called for Ms. al-Hathloul's  release and the release of others facing politically motivated charges  in Saudi Arabia. Until there are consequences for these violations of  human rights and misuse of the judicial process, nothing will change.   Fortunately, our hands are not tied. The United States can do more  than simply call for Ms. al-Hathloul's release. Section 7031(c) of  division G of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, which  applies to all foreign countries, states that ``[o]fficials of foreign  governments and their immediate family members about whom the Secretary  of State has credible information have been involved, directly or  indirectly, in . . . a gross violation of human rights shall be  ineligible for entry into the United States.''   Secretary of State Pompeo unquestionably has such information. Ms.  al-Hathloul's prolonged, arbitrary detention and abuse in custody are  gross violations of human rights. Secretary Pompeo should apply section  7031(c) and immediately impose visa restrictions on all Saudi  Government officials involved, directly or indirectly, in her detention  and abuse. That is our law.   It is as ironic as it is unconscionable that the Crown Prince has  been praised for ending the ban on a woman's ability to drive a car in  Saudi Arabia, at the same time that his government is unjustly and  cruelly imprisoning a courageous woman for advocating for that  [[Page S629]]  very right. The Trump administration should apply the law as required  in this case.                            ____________________
