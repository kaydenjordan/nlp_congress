On this vote, the yeas are 59, the nays are  36.   The motion is agreed to.   The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, from all indications, our Republican  friends continue to negotiate amongst themselves, behind closed doors,  to revive the healthcare bill they had to pull from the floor on  Tuesday.   I would suggest to my friends on the other side that there is no  tweak or change or modification that will fix what is wrong with this  Republican healthcare bill. The core of the bill is the problem. The  American people are opposed to tax cuts for the wealthy and the  reduction of the social safety net of Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid.   The Republican TrumpCare bill is built on a crumbling, decrepit  foundation, and that is because it is based on the premise that special  interests and a very small number of wealthy Americans deserve a tax  break while millions of Americans--middle class families, older  Americans in nursing homes, folks with a preexisting condition--ought  to receive less healthcare at a higher cost.   That idea is so backward, so out of step with what America wants and  what actually works, it can never succeed, no matter how it is tweaked.   The one thing my Republican friends are latching on to--that their  bill will bring down average premiums several years down the line--is  really a bait and switch. The bait is lower premiums, but the switch is  higher deductibles and copays so that, in the end, the average American  pays more than they would have otherwise. They are luring people in  with a lower premium, but then they have to pay such a high percentage  of their medical costs, the insurance policy is virtually worthless.   The Republican TrumpCare bill tells insurers they can offer much less  generous healthcare plans than under the current system, even allowing  States to opt out of covering essential benefits like treatment for  opioids, mental health coverage, prescription drug coverage, and  maternity care.   The result of these changes is that insurers may charge smaller  premiums on some plans, but they will cover way less and, in fact, the  deductibles and copays will go up--way up--in order to make the  difference. So this isn't: Oh, you are not paying for some esoteric  item; your insurance policy will pay for virtually nothing at the  beginning if you have a high deductible.   The CBO report estimates that for an average 40-year-old with an  income of $26,500 a year, looking at insurance on the marketplace,  deductibles would increase by thousands. If that 40-year-old decided on  a ``bronze'' plan, for instance, their deductible would be $6,000 a  year, the CBO estimates. That is $5,200 more than under current law. So  we know what that means: They have to pay the first $6,000 of  healthcare, no matter what your insurance policy is. What good is that?  Not much. Good for the insurance industry, maybe; not good for the  average citizen. Some of my colleagues on the other side are claiming  they want lower premiums, but if those lower premiums come with higher  deductibles and higher copays, nobody benefits. It is a bait and  switch.   What the Republican bill gives with one hand in this area, it more  than takes away with the other because the lower premiums are made up  for by higher deductibles and copays, so the average person pays more,  not less, even when their premium goes down.   Who in America believes that folks should have higher out-of-pocket  costs than before? Who in America believes that folks making over $1  million a year--God bless them; they are doing well--deserve another  $57,000 tax break? Who in America believes that we should be making it  harder to afford nursing home care or maternity care or opioid abuse  treatment? Who in America believes a child born with a preexisting  condition should hit their lifetime insurance limit before they even  leave the hospital for the first time? Who believes in that in this  America?   It turns out, almost no one. A poll yesterday showed that only 12  percent of Americans support the Republican bill. No amendment or  compromise or tweak or adjustment in formula can solve that.   So I repeat the offer I made to President Trump and my Republican  friends yesterday: Let's start over. Drop this fundamentally flawed  approach--abandon cuts to Medicaid, abandon tax breaks for the  wealthy--and we can discuss the problems that Americans are actually  concerned about: the cost, quality, and availability of healthcare.   I suggested that President Trump invite all Senators to Blair House  to begin anew on a bipartisan approach to healthcare. Unfortunately,  the President said I wasn't serious. Mr. President: Try me. The minute  you make the invitation, we will take it in a very serious way. It is  not that audacious of an idea. President Obama did the same thing early  in his Presidency to discuss healthcare with Members of both parties in  front of the American people. Our only condition: Drop the wrong-headed  idea of slashing Medicaid to give tax breaks to the wealthy. It is  perfectly reasonable, and a vast majority of Americans agree with us.   Nonpartisan institutions like the American Medical Association, the  National Association of Medicaid Directors, AARP, and America's largest  nursing home groups are all against the Republican approach. The  Congressional Budget Office and other expert analyses say that it will  not actually fix the problems in our healthcare system--high  deductibles, high premiums, counties with too few insurance options-- and the American people are as roundly against it as any piece of major  legislation I have ever seen.   So I don't believe it is unserious to ask my Republican friends to  drop this particular bill and talk to us about actually fixing the  problems in our healthcare system.   I don't believe it is unserious to say to President Trump: You  campaigned on bringing costs down and providing care for everyone. You  campaigned on not cutting Medicaid and controlling the outrageous costs  of prescription drugs. These are all your words in the campaign. Well,  we Democrats agree with all of that. So let's talk about it.   Fundamentally, I don't believe that seeking a bipartisan solution on  the great issues of our time should ever be considered unserious.   President Trump, you have complained about a lack of bipartisanship-- unfairly, in our opinion. We are offering a way to implement  bipartisanship, and right now it is you, not we, who are stopping it.   I hope my Republican friends, President Trump, and the majority  leader think long and hard before dismissing our offer out of hand. I  challenge them again: Invite all of us to Blair House the first day we  get back from recess. If you think we are not serious, try us.  Democrats are ready to turn the page on healthcare. When will my  Republican friends realize it is time for them to do the same?
