 Mr. Speaker, a week after my visit to the border to meet  with agents on the ground and survey the situation with my own eyes, I  am here to report some unsurprising news. There is still a growing  crisis at our Nation's southern border.   I saw firsthand how President Biden has ceded--not in farming, but  given up--ceded control of the southern border to the cartels.   Thankfully, Texas Governor Abbott has stepped up to enforce the law,  but Federal border agents continue to lack critical federally provided  resources.   From halting construction of the wall and resisting the remain in  Mexico policy, to releasing illegals into our interior and pursuing  mass amnesty, this President and Democrats in Congress have  incentivized a long-term border surge that will forever change our  Nation.   I urge my colleagues to reverse these America-last policies, secure  the border, and uphold law and order in the face of this current  administration's refusal to do so.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Bost for yielding me the time.  I am always proud to stand on this floor and talk about the men and  women who serve our country. And it is our country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition today to H.R. 1836, the Guard and  Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021. And it kind of saddens me that I  have to rise in opposition because while this bill, well-intentioned,  is unfortunately potentially prone to unintended consequences on the  overall readiness of our Armed Forces, Active Reserve and Guard. But  first I must note that these issues could have been brought to light  earlier had this piece of legislation gone through regular order,  received proper consideration across all the normal things that we  historically have done. It received no legislative hearings, foregoing  the opportunity to receive input from key stakeholders, veteran service  organizations, new committee members on both sides of the aisle, and  even the Biden administration.   Without that engagement, we are just left with a bill that in its  current form, which would count guard and reservists Federal Active- Duty service days towards GI eligibility, including for training. And  there is a very subtle difference. In fact, it is a very exact  difference in law between Active Duty for training and Active Duty.   I spent much of my 40-year Marine Corps career in the Reserve  component. And in fact, a little known part of my bio, my first 2 years  off of Active Duty in the Marine Corps, I spent 2 years as a member of  the Rhode Island National Guard. So not only Active component, Reserve  component, but also a guardsman as well.   And my final assignment for 4\1/2\ years, I had the blessing and the  opportunity to command the Marine Corps Reserve, roughly 100,000 folks  in 183 sites across the country at a time when we are deploying them at  never-before-seen rates.   I will always stand by the unwavering service and sacrifice given by  the men and women in the Reserve component and the National Guard.                                time  1315    This bill, however, may unintentionally become an obstacle to the  recruitment and retention efforts of our Active component military. We  are in a time, and have been for over 40 years, of an all-recruited  force on all levels.    Mr. Speaker, even as Governors offer non-GI Bill  education benefits to their Guard, the parity with Active-Duty Forces  that this bill is seeking for the Guard and Reserves, again, could  impact our Active-Duty military, which we need to be ready at all  times, considering today's global threats.   Today, more than 4 years after my colleagues and I passed into law an  unprecedented GI Bill expansion to allow any veteran to use these GI  Bill benefits without restriction of time, so they are good to go for  as long as they live, I still believe there are many ways we can work  responsibly to expand these benefits.   For these reasons, I will be voting in favor of my friend and  colleague Mr. Moore's benefit expansion amendment to ensure guard and  reservists accrue GI Bill eligibility during any and all Federal  Active-Duty days that are not training days.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill and support the  Moore amendment.
