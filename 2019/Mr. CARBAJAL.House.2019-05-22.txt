 Mr. Speaker, this weekend we will be celebrating the  life and legacy of one of my exceptional constituents, Nancy K.  Johnson, who left us on January 10 of this year.   Nancy was truly a force to be reckoned with. Born in Chicago, she  later moved to Santa Maria, California, with her husband, Ned, where  they raised five children.   She was very active in the community and was a founding member of the  Santa Maria Valley League of Women Voters, a board member and counselor  at Planned Parenthood, a member of the Pismo Beach Presbyterian Church,  and a nationally recognized city and county planning commissioner.   Nancy also volunteered her time with the Santa Barbara Foundation,  Transitions-Mental Health, SBCAN, and the Women's Fund for North  County.   She had a true passion for the arts and was a longtime supporter of  PCPA community theater and the Santa Maria Symphony.   It was an honor to know and work with Nancy. Nancy will always be  remembered for her passion and work towards justice and equality for  all.                            ____________________
