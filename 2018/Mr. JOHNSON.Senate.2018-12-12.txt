 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to complete my remarks and  [[Page S7473]]  Senator Tester be recognized at the conclusion of my remarks for up to  5 minutes.    Madam President, before I begin addressing my opposition  to the CRA, I want to spend a brief moment agreeing with all of the  tributes and all of the accolades of Senator Hatch.   I wasn't able to get down here on the floor because I couldn't get  down here in time--he started a little bit early--but I watched the  entire speech from my office. It just showed the integrity, the  patriotism, and the goodwill of this good man.   Like so many of my other colleagues, I don't know another Senator who  offers more encouragement and more kind words to all of us than Senator  Hatch. Again, I wish him and Elaine well in their retirement. I wish  them the best.   God bless Senator Hatch for all of his faithful service.                           Congressional Review Act    Madam President, I rise to discuss the Congressional Review Act  challenge put forward by the senior Senators from Oregon and Montana.   The CRA has been proposed in response to guidance on a revenue  procedure recently announced by the Internal Revenue Service. As  chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I  have written to the IRS twice asking them to take the very actions this  CRA seeks to overturn.   Let me begin by reviewing some basic facts about the guidance--facts  that are irrefutable, but facts that are apparently being ignored by  those supporting this measure.   First, I want to make it clear that the guidance in question mirrors  a proposal that was crafted under the Obama administration. While that  proposal was never fully implemented, the fact that it was first  proposed by the Obama administration proves its bipartisan nature.   Essentially, the guidance makes clear that personal identifying  information of donors for certain tax-exempt organizations does not  need to be filed on a form with the IRS. However, these organizations  will still be required to keep that donor information on file. Simply  put, the guidance is merely a change in where the information is  warehoused.   In the past, it was kept on a form at the IRS, as well as in the  records of each organization. Now, it will only be kept in the records  of each organization.   It is important to note that the officials in the Obama  administration said that the reporting of such information is no longer  necessary for the efficient administration of the internal revenue  laws. I am not actually sure it ever was required.   The one change being implemented that differs from the Obama proposal  is that the IRS also included in its new guidance needed privacy  protections in response to recent government leaks and breaches. In  order to protect taxpayer privacy, under this new guidance, the donor  information in question is prohibited from being made public by the  government no matter where it is warehoused.   So let me summarize. The donor information in question is not used by  the IRS for the efficient administration of the internal revenue laws,  as was noted by the previous administration. The information is  required to be kept on file and on the books of the organization and to  be available to the IRS or law enforcement, if needed, which was also  as proposed by the previous administration. Finally, the information,  no matter where it is housed, shall not be made public by the  government.   These are clear and concise reasons for a simple change that was  made--and let me reemphasize this point--in order to protect taxpayer  privacy. Unfortunately, such protection is necessary because, when the  IRS required that donor information be reported on a form to the IRS,  there had been numerous times during which the returns of tax-exempt  organizations were inappropriately and possibly illegally disclosed,  whether through administrative sloppiness, carelessness, breaches, or  other potentially nefarious or partisan reasons.   The reason tax-exempt organizations' donors may wish to remain  anonymous is best illustrated in the 1958 Supreme Court case of the  NAACP v. Alabama. The State of Alabama was attempting to force the  disclosure of the members of the NAACP. The concern those members had  in having their names revealed should be obvious. Fortunately, the  Supreme Court decided unanimously to protect the identities of the  NAACP's members.   Today, tax-exempt organizations that span the political spectrum and  the supporters of those organizations deserve the same consideration  and protection as the NAACP had. They deserve to remain anonymous so  that they cannot be targeted by their political opponents.   A similar threat does exist today from the compelled disclosure of  donor information that is held by tax-exempt organizations, including  501(c)(4) social welfare groups. If information about donors to these  groups becomes publicly available, the information could be used in a  way that would chill future speech and association--a basic First  Amendment right.   Donor information is also susceptible to abuse by the Federal  Government itself. In one egregious example in 2010, the IRS sent 1.1  million pages of tax-exempt return information, including donor  information in some cases, to the Justice Department for potential  prosecutions relating to political speech. More recently, some States  have sought to compel the disclosure of donor information from schedule  B. The disclosure of donor information has led to the harassment of  donors in some very well-documented cases.   In a court brief that was filed in January of 2017 in Americans for  Prosperity Foundation v. Becerra, the NAACP warned against States'  compelling the disclosure of donor information:         Forcing an organization to release [organizational       membership and/or donor lists] to the State not only divulges       the First Amendment activities of individual members and       donors, but may also deter such activities in the first       place. Specifically, individuals may legitimately fear of any       number of negative consequences from disclosure, including       harassment by the public, adverse government action, and       reprisals by a union or employer.    This potential harm exists across the political spectrum regardless  of donors' ideological beliefs.   Needless to say, the Congressional Review Act challenge to the recent  IRS guidance on where to house private donor information is troubling,  and its motivation is highly suspect. For anyone who truly cares about  privacy and ensuring that the Federal Government does not use the tax  system as a political targeting machine, a vote against the  Congressional Review Act challenge is the obvious choice. I urge my  colleagues to vote no   I yield the floor.
