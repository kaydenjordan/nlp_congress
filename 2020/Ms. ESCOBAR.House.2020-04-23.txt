 Madam Speaker, I rise to support this interim package.   I have spent every day in my district speaking to constituents and  stakeholders battered by this health and economic crisis. I am grateful  to Speaker Pelosi and Democratic colleagues who fought for additional  money for small businesses, fixed problems we saw after the first round  of funding, and added money for hospitals.   I am disappointed by Republican colleagues who refused to include  local and State governments, but we will keep fighting for them and so  many others who were left out.
