 Madam Speaker, I am so proud to have played a leading role  in securing high-quality, affordable childcare for every family in  America in the Build Back Better Act.   This policy is personal for me. Growing up, I was raised by a single  mom who had to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. She got help  raising me from my grandparents. My grandmother cleaned homes, and when  daycare was too expensive, she had to take me to work with her.   Madam Speaker, no family in America, no child in America, should have  to accompany their guardian to work because childcare is too expensive,  certainly not in the richest nation in the history of the world. That  is why we are investing nearly $400 billion in childcare and early  learning programs to ensure that we solve this affordability crisis.   The childcare provisions will transform our childcare system and help  bring unemployed parents back into the workforce without them being  financially burdened.   For these reasons and so many more, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on this historic legislation.
