 Madam Speaker, on his first day in office, President  Biden issued an executive order revoking the permit for the Keystone XL  [[Page H1839]]  pipeline. Instantly, 70 people in Fallon County, Montana, were out of  their jobs.   This project would provide 12,000 American jobs and had already  created 200 jobs in Montana alone. This picture beside me was taken in  Fallon County, one of the areas the Keystone XL pipeline would have  gone through. This empty lot would have been a housing complex for  1,200 workers, who would have contributed significantly to the local  economy in Baker, Montana, a small town of 1,800 residents.   The cancellation of the pipeline deals Fallon County a loss of $7  million per year in tax revenue that would have been used to invest in  schools, roads, and other public projects. As Fallon County  Commissioner Steve Baldwin said: ``The cancellation for the XL pipeline  will further exacerbate our already weakened economy. President Biden  has an opportunity to signal that access to good-paying jobs is truly a  priority for his administration.''   So my question is: Where are the jobs?                            ____________________
