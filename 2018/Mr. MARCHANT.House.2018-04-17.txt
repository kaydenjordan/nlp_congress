 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1512) to amend title II of the Social Security Act to  provide for the reissuance of Social Security account numbers to young  children in cases where confidentiality has been compromised, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1512         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Child       Protection Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. REISSUANCE OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBERS TO                     YOUNG CHILDREN IN CASES WHERE CONFIDENTIALITY                     HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.         (a) In General.--Section 205(c)(2)(B) of the Social       Security Act (42 U.S.C. 405(c)(2)(B)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating clause (iii) as clause (iv); and        (2) by inserting after clause (ii) the following new       clause:        ``(iii) In any case in which a Social Security account       number has been issued to a child who has not attained the       age of 14 pursuant to subclause (IV) or (V) of clause (i) and       it is demonstrated by evidence, as determined by the       Commissioner of Social Security, and submitted under penalty       of perjury to the Commissioner by a parent or guardian of the       child that in the course of transmission of the social       security card to the child, the confidentiality of such       number has been compromised by reason of theft of such social       security card, the Commissioner shall issue a new Social       Security account number to such child and make note in the       records maintained with respect to such child of the       pertinent information received by the Commissioner regarding       the theft of the social security card.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1512, which is  currently under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the history of this legislation begins in my district  in Southlake, Texas. A constituent of mine called my office very  distraught that her mail had been stolen, and with it, her newborn  baby's Social Security card and number. A week later, a felon with an  extensive history of forgery, credit card abuse, and identity theft was  apprehended, and in his possession was the Social Security card of my  newborn constituent.   The child's mother, rightfully so, was very concerned that her 6- month-old child's identity had been compromised, and I requested on her  behalf that the Social Security Administration issue the child a new  Social Security card. We thought that would be an easy thing to do. The  request was denied.   My staff and my district office took it on themselves to get the law  changed and asked me would I consider introducing a bill to do that. So  today, we are here to try to protect a group of the most vulnerable of  our Social Security cardholders.   Members of this Chamber know Social Security numbers have become an  increasingly valuable target for identity theft due to their widespread  use throughout the financial sector.   Madam Speaker, children like my constituent are particularly  vulnerable to Social Security number theft because usually, before the  age of 13, they do not work, they do not drive, they do not try to get  credit cards, and they don't try to establish credit, which would  extend the time a thief can use that child's identity before the theft  is even noticed.   Current policy does little to protect children whose Social Security  cards and numbers have been stolen. I believe H.R. 1512 is the answer  to this problem. This bill requires that the Social Security  Administration issue a new Social Security number for a child age 13  and under when a child's Social Security card has been stolen and the  child's parent or guardian demonstrates to the Commissioner of the  Social Security Administration under penalty of perjury that it was  stolen while being transmitted by Social Security to the child's  address, that is, by U.S. mail.   This bill is a commonsense solution. We need to combat identity  theft. I encourage all Members to vote today to protect our  constituents, especially our most vulnerable.   I thank my fellow Texan, Lloyd Doggett, for cosponsoring the bill and  helping me introduce the bill. I urge my colleagues to join us in  supporting this bipartisan bill.   I would also like to thank, Madam Speaker, my district staff who  worked  [[Page H3376]]  on this problem so hard in the beginning and the committee staff who  helped me shepherd this through to its chairman, Mr. Johnson, of the  Social Security Subcommittee.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Plano, Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), who is the chairman of the Social  Security Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would like to say thank you to my colleagues on the committee who  have worked on this bill, and especially Congressman Doggett, who has  helped every step of the way.   H.R. 1512 is a very commonsense solution that is supported by the  Association of Mature American Citizens and the AARP.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record their letters of support.   [[Page H3377]]                                                Association of Mature                                               American Citizens,                                     Washington, DC, March 17, 2017.      Hon. Kenny Marchant,      24th District, Texas,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Lloyd Doggett,      35th District, Texas,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Marchant and Congressman Doggett: On       behalf of the 1.3 million members of AMAC, the Association of       Mature American Citizens, I am writing in strong support of       H.R. 1512, the Social Security Child Protection Act. This       important piece of legislation offers more protection for       children under 14 who have been victims of Social Security       card theft. This bill is as timely as it is simple in       protecting the identities of our nation's children.        The Social Security Child Protection Act is a real-life       solution to a real-time problem. As the Federal Trade       Commission (FTC) recently reported, identity theft rose by       50% from 2014 to 2015. As millions of identities are       compromised each year due to Social Security card theft,       children are becoming a more attractive target to identity       thieves. H.R. 1512 does more to stem Social Security card       theft by making it easier for parents to request new Social       Security numbers for their children when their Social       Security card has been stolen, in transit, from the Social       Security Administration (SSA).        Under current policy, parents of children under 14 are able       to request a new Social Security number only when they can       demonstrate harm has occurred as a direct result of Social       Security card theft. However, demonstrating a level of harm       requisite with current policy is difficult for most parents       because children do not typically participate in activities       where harm from Social Security card theft would be made       apparent (getting a driver's license, buying a home, opening       a line of credit, etc.). H.R. 1512 would make it easier for       parents to get a new Social Security number for their       children because they would only need to show their child's       Social Security card was stolen in transit from the SSA--not       that their child suffered harm.        As an organization committed to representing the interests       of mature Americans and seniors, AMAC is dedicated to       ensuring senior citizens' interests are protected. We thank       Congressman Marchant and Congressman Doggett for their       commonsense and practical solution to protect children from       identity theft. AMAC is pleased to offer our organization's       full support to the Social Security Child Protection Act.            Sincerely,                                                         Dan Weber,      President and Founder of AMAC.                                   ____                                                             AARP,                                     Washington, DC, April 11, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House of Representatives,      Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Ranking Member, House of Representatives,      Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: On behalf of AARP's 38 million       members, I am writing in support of H.R. 1512, the Social       Security Child Protection Act of 2017. The bill directs the       Social Security Administration (SSA) to issue a new Social       Security number to a child under the age of 14 if the       confidentiality of the child's previous number has been       compromised due to the theft of the documentation. AARP is       strongly committed to protecting the confidentiality of       Social Security numbers for American citizens of all ages.        An individual's Social Security number is critical       financial information and integral to everyone's personal       identity. Many parents apply for Social Security numbers for       their children soon after birth. Social Security numbers for       all family members are used for a wide variety of purposes,       including employment and taxes. For these reasons, Social       Security numbers must be afforded the highest level of       privacy protection to guard against financial fraud or       identity theft.        AARP has a long-standing public policy position to protect       the integrity of Social Security numbers that specifically       states that ``companies, government agencies, and individuals       should not be allowed to post or publicly display Social       Security numbers, print them on cards, transmit them over the       internet or by facsimile, or send them by mail without safety       measures.'' We appreciate your support to protect personal       Social Security information and make this change in the law.        We look forward to continuing to work with you to promote       the integrity of the Social Security program, and to protect       the identities of American workers and their families. If you       have any questions, please feel free to call me.            Sincerely,                                                   Joyce A. Rogers,                         Senior Vice President, Government Affairs.     Again, I encourage all Members to vote ``yes'' to make  sure that children who have their Social Security cards stolen are  protected.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
