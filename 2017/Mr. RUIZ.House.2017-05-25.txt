 Mr. Speaker, the new American Health Care Act CBO score  released yesterday reinforces that this bill is devastating to the  American people: 14 million more will be uninsured within just one  year, and 23 million more will be uninsured over a decade.   This analysis paints a dire picture. It confirms that TrumpCare will  shift the burden of costs onto our seniors, millions of hardworking  families, and patients with preexisting conditions. Those hit hardest  are exactly the people who need care the most, all while giving tax  breaks to millionaires and billionaires.   What is more, this analysis debunks the gimmicks Republican leaders  tried to sell us, saying the bill would do no harm to those with  preexisting illnesses. In fact, patients with preexisting conditions  will have less coverage, be forced to pay more, and even be priced out  of the market, just as we expected.   This is far too great a toll on the American people, and we must do  better.                            ____________________
