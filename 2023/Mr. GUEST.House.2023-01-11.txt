 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution  condemning the recent attacks on pro-life groups, facilities, and  churches.   Last summer, in a landmark decision, the United States Supreme Court  ruled in favor of my home State of Mississippi in returning decisions  on protecting life to the States.   Unfortunately, the leak of the Dobbs decision led to instances of  extremism committed against churches, pro-life institutions, and crisis  pregnancy centers.   Sadly, my home State was not spared. Mississippi has a robust network  of crisis pregnancy centers that provide care and resources to  expectant mothers.   I, and many of my Republican colleagues, have called on the Biden  administration to address these criminal acts and hold accountable  those who committed these offenses. To date, no action has been taken.   I am hopeful that this legislation will move the administration to  act, and I am grateful that the Republican majority is standing with  those impacted by last year's extremist acts.
