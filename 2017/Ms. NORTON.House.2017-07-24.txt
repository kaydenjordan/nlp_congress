 Mr. Speaker, Jim Vance, our local NBC news anchor in this  region, who died Saturday at 75, probably set a record, local or  national, as news anchor.   For 45 years, while being only himself, Vance presented the news to a  region that challenged D.C. TV news with vast changes racially and  ethnically, economically and politically. Jim Vance took the dare and  told our ever-changing story straight.  [[Page H6202]]    He made us see ourselves, from a city with too much crime to today's  D.C. with low crime and a big surplus. Only a combination of consummate  professionalism and enduring affability could have covered so much  quick-moving news without ever missing a beat.   Jim Vance brilliantly told our story throughout our first era of home  rule. These years also encapsulated Jim Vance's service and now join  his legacy with the District's own history.                            ____________________
