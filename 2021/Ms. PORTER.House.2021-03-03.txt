 Mr. Speaker, equality and justice are core values of this  country, yet for Americans with mental illness, the risk of being  killed when approached by law enforcement is 16 times higher. An  estimated one in four fatal police encounters ends the life of an  individual with mental illness.   We are not fulfilling the promise of equality and justice for  Americans with mental illnesses and disabilities. That is why I  introduced the Mental Health Justice Act, which would create  specialized mental health first responder units. If someone is  experiencing a mental health crisis, they are better served by a  trained mental health professional, not a police officer.   Mental illness is not a crime, and we have to stop treating it like  one. Getting the right help to individuals with mental illnesses  prevents them from getting tangled up in a system that isn't built to  serve their needs.   The Mental Health Justice Act makes our communities healthier and  safer, more equal, and more just.                            ____________________
