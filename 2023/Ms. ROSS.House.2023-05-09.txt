 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1715, the  Advanced Weather Model Computing Development Act.   As all Members know, the United States has witnessed an alarming rise  in severe weather events. According to NOAA, in 2020 alone, the U.S.  experienced 22 disasters in which the total damages exceeded $1  billion.   North Carolina is no stranger to extreme weather. Flooding occurs an  average of every 7.6 days in my home State. Hurricanes Matthew and  Florence in 2016 and 2018 killed 76 people and caused a combined $21.8  billion in damages.    As climate change continues to drive the growing number of severe  weather events, accurate and timely forecasts have never been more  important for protecting American lives.   This bill will enable NOAA to do just that, by fostering a  groundbreaking partnership with DOE that will tap DOE's computing  resources and expertise to improve weather modeling.   Our bipartisan legislation with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Miller)  will enhance tools available to outstanding forecasters at the National  Weather Service who dedicate their time and expertise to protecting  lives, property, aviation, commerce, agriculture, and so much more.   Madam Speaker, I also thank Ranking Member Lofgren and Chairman Lucas  for their leadership. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
