 Mr. Speaker, just over 30 years ago, I made the  decision  [[Page H9733]]  to run for the Long Beach City Council because I felt that my  councilmember really didn't listen to the constituents and to my  neighbors and myself.   This journey of public service has taken me from the Long Beach City  Hall to the California State Capitol and now to our Nation's Capitol  for the last 10 years.   When I began this journey, I did so with a commitment to listen to my  community and to use all of my abilities to help make my constituents'  lives better.   Over the years, with the help of my family, my colleagues, especially  with the help of my staff, and, yes, my constituents themselves, I hope  and believe that I have met that commitment. For this help, I will  always be grateful.   Their help has led me to be a champion for the environment, to  promote conservation of our wildlife and natural spaces, to clean up  our ports and maritime industry, to address the growing plastic  pollution and climate crisis, and to promote clean energy.   For my constituents, I have remained a dedicated advocate for human  rights, introducing the International Human Rights Defense Act,  securing the release of numerous prisoners of conscience and also  Americans who have been detained unjustly abroad, and serving as a  critical voice for the Vietnamese and Cambodian communities across our  Nation, all while working to hold corrupt and autocratic elites abroad  accountable for their actions.   My constituents have demanded a better future, and in their name, I  have championed a strong and sustainable freight infrastructure network  with the National Multimodal Freight Network Improvement Act and key  provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure act, all critical issues,  as we have seen in the wake of the supply chain crisis.   As a Jewish Member of Congress, I was proud to be a leading voice on  the passage of H. Res. 326, a reaffirmation of our commitment as a  Nation to a two-state solution and peace in the Middle East.   Throughout this journey, my constituents have remained the stars  which have guided me. I have been deeply touched by their support over  so many years, just as I am deeply honored by the trust and faith they  have placed in me time and time again to represent them.   But as I said while announcing my retirement a year ago, just as  every journey has a beginning, so does it have an end, and it is now  time to pass the baton.   During this journey, I have been blessed with having the pleasure of  raising two fine sons, who have blessed me with four grandchildren,  whom I adore. I now look forward to spending time with them and  watching them grow and flourish into wonderful people like their  parents.   It is also a chance for me and my wife, Debbie, who has been my rock  and partner throughout this journey, to even more deeply enjoy our  lives together.   However, as Robert Frost wrote, there are miles to go before I sleep.   I believe deeply in the innate goodness of our Nation and our people.  I have seen us live up to that potential so many times and, in doing  so, move our Nation and the world forward, but progress must be earned.  It remains up to each of us to continue that struggle.   While I am stepping away from the front lines of that struggle, I  will continue to be at your side, fighting for what is right, for what  is just, and for what makes us better as both a people and a Nation.   It has been a distinct honor and a true privilege to serve the people  of California's 47th District during my time in Congress.                            ____________________
