 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to speak about a pressing  local safety concern in my home county of Nelson. Wintergreen Resort is  facing major fire safety issues.   Last week, I spoke with the local fire chief, who pointed out that  having only one exit from the Wintergreen Resort creates the potential  for a major public safety crisis. In the case of an emergency, such as  a fire blocking the main exit, there would be no way to leave the  resort.   I have called the National Park Service and asked that they help me  mitigate this situation by allowing a secondary exit that will allow  people to go from the resort, through the national park, and to the  Blue Ridge Parkway in the case of a fire or emergency. This simple  step, 450 feet, would safeguard the community against a potential  disaster.   Government, when necessary, should be here to assist, not interfere.  Guidelines that don't make sense need to be changed so that common  sense prevails.                            ____________________
