 Mr. President, the Maine Dental Association was  incorporated in 1867 with 22 members. Today I wish to recognize the MDA  and its more than 700 members for 150 years of dedication to their  profession and to the people of our State.   The remarkable advancements in dentistry over the years were  accompanied by a greater understanding of the link between oral health  and overall health. As doctors who specialize in oral medicine, the  dentists of the MDA are a central part of Maine's healthcare sector.  Expanding access to healthcare, including oral healthcare, is among the  most important issues facing our society. Maine is a large, rural State  with a strong network of dental clinics supported by MDA members. In  addition, the MDA sponsors the Donated Dental Services Program that  provides free comprehensive care to our disabled, aged, and medically  compromised citizens in need.   Access to oral healthcare in Maine took a major step forward on May  20, 2017, when the University of New England College of Dental Medicine  held a commencement ceremony for its first graduating class. The MDA  has been a strong supporter of this first dental college in northern  New England since the college was founded in 2013, and many of the 62  graduates who earned doctor of dental medicine degrees performed  clinical rotations in communities throughout the State under the  guidance of MDA members. I visited the Portland UNE clinic and was  delighted to learn of the plans of many students to practice in Maine  where their services are very much needed. From preventing and treating  oral health problems to educating parents and caregivers, MDA members  also play an essential role in the health, safety, and well-being of  Maine children.   Throughout our State, members of the Maine Dental Association provide  vital healthcare with expertise, commitment, and compassion. It is a  pleasure to congratulate the MDA for 150 years of accomplishments and  contributions benefiting the people of Maine.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce two bills that will  benefit the brave women and men who volunteer at our local firehouses:  the Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Act and the Volunteer  Firefighters' Length of Service Award Program Cap Adjustment Priority  Act. I am pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague from  Maryland, Senator Cardin, in reintroducing this bipartisan legislation.   Across our nation, volunteer firefighters play a critical role in  helping to ensure the safety of our communities and the well-being of  our neighbors. The State of Maine, for example, has approximately  11,000 firefighters in more than 400 departments. Because Maine is a  largely rural state, more than 90 percent of those firefighters are  volunteers.   Without these public-spirited citizens, many communities would be  unable to provide emergency services protection at all, while others  would be forced to raise local taxes to pay salaries and benefits for  full- or part-time  [[Page S3217]]  staff. Often, communities seek to recruit and retain volunteers by  offering modest benefits. The bills we are introducing today would  support these efforts by helping to ensure that nominal benefits to  volunteers are not treated as regular employee compensation.   The Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Act would allow  communities to provide volunteer firefighters and EMS workers with up  to $600 per year of property tax reductions or other incentives,  without those benefits being subject to federal income tax and  withholding. This would ease the administrative burden that local  departments sometimes face when they reward their volunteers. We also  want to help first responders save for retirement. For years, local and  state governments have provided their volunteer firefighters and EMS  personnel with different forms of benefits, including Length of Service  Award Programs, commonly known as LOSAPs. These are pension-like  benefits for volunteer emergency responders.   Our second bill, the LOSAP Cap Act, would help communities recruit  and retain volunteer firefighters by increasing the annual cap on  contributions to their retirement accounts to $6,000, and allowing for  adjustments for inflation.   As we begin the complicated process of reforming our nation's tax  code, I believe we should take care to protect those who serve this  country with such bravery. That is why Senator Cardin and I have  introduced these bills today, and I urge my colleagues to join us in  supporting them.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Franken, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Warren, Mr. Reed, Mr. Wyden, Ms.          Baldwin, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Kaine, and Mr. Murphy):   S. 1262. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, with respect  to certain exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy; to the Committee on  the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Community Bank  Sensible Regulation Act of 2017, a bill that would allow financial  regulators to exempt community banks from unnecessary and unduly  burdensome requirements, if doing so is in the public interest. My bill  would provide this authority to the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve and would apply to financial  institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.   The aim of my legislation is to allow the financial regulators to  exempt community banks from highly complex regulations designed to  protect our financial system from systemic risks that would arise from  the failure of larger banks. All banks, large and small, should be  well-capitalized and properly regulated, but that does not mean that  our financial regulators must impose a ``one size fits all'' regulatory  regime across the board without regard to the risks posed to the  financial system by banks with fundamentally different business models  and of vastly different sizes.   Some regulations that are appropriate or essential for larger banks  may make no sense when applied to community banks. For example, current  law requires community banks to demonstrate that they are in compliance  with the Volcker Rule--which restricts proprietary trading and hedge  fund investments by banks--even though community banks rarely engage in  such trading. Even so, community banks must shoulder the burden of  complying with this complex regulation. My bill would allow the  regulators to exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule.   As the GAO has noted, smaller banks are ``disproportionately affected  by increased regulation, because they are less able to absorb  additional costs.'' These costs are significant. According to industry  representatives, the cost of complying with regulations absorbs 12  percent of total bank operating expenses, and is two-and-a-half times  greater for small banks than for large banks.   The cost of regulation puts community banks at a competitive  disadvantage vis-a-vis larger banks. Over the past two decades, the  share of the U.S. banking industry represented by community banks has  declined from 40 percent to just 18 percent. Over the same period, the  share of the market represented by the five largest banks has grown  from roughly 18 percent to 46 percent. I am concerned that unnecessary  regulation will accelerate these trends, and ironically, contribute to  the further consolidation of the banking industry into a handful of  ``too big to fail'' banks.   Community banks play an essential role in meeting the credit needs of  their customers, particularly small businesses, homeowners, and  farmers. Although community banks represent just 18 percent of total  banking assets, they are responsible for half of our nation's small  business loans. With small business formation at generational lows, it  is essential that we preserve and protect their access to credit, as  they are the major driver of job creation in our country. In addition,  community banks provide three-fourths of our nation's agricultural  loans, a line of finance that requires highly specialized knowledge of  farming and a long-term perspective suited to agricultural cycles.   Regulators should be able to tailor their regulations to take the  distinctive nature of community banks into account. My bill would allow  regulators to exempt community banks from unnecessary and burdensome  regulations where it is in the public interest to do so. I urge my  colleagues to support it.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Peters):   S. 1268. A bill to amend parts B and E of title IV of the Social  Security Act to allow States to provide foster care maintenance  payments for children with parents in a licensed residential family- based treatment facility for substance abuse and to reauthorize grants  to improve the well-being of families affected by substance abuse; to  the Committee on Finance.
