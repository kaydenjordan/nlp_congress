 Madam Speaker, though what I am about to say will surely  cause a strong case of hypertension among my Democrat colleagues and  their union allies, I won't hold back: Unions didn't build the middle  class in America. Entrepreneurs and hardworking Americans did.   Tomorrow marks the 75th anniversary of the landmark legislation that  enables States to pass right-to-work laws, and it is a cause for  celebration.   Since 1947, 27 States have decided to allow employees to choose for  themselves whether to belong to a union or not. What a smart decision  passing right-to-work laws was, Madam Speaker. They give workers the  freedom to make their own choices when it comes to paying union dues.   With rising inflation and gas prices, workers should not be forced to  hand their hard-earned paychecks over to the unions in order to keep  their jobs.   Time and again, unions prove that worker representation plays second  fiddle to a partisan political agenda that comes as no surprise to  anyone.   For example, the AFL-CIO's financial disclosure form shows that they  spent more than $37 million on political activity and lobbying while  spending just $16 million to represent workers. Workers should never be  forced to fund political causes they disagree with.   The truth is, right-to-work laws are good for unions, too. Making  union membership a choice instead of a mandatory condition of  employment improves unions by making them more responsive to worker  needs.   It is no secret that unions in mandatory dues States neglect the  needs of workers. It isn't until unions have to fight to get and keep  members that they make workers a priority. Giving workers a choice  gives workers leverage, and this can lead to more transparency and  accountability.   The truth is that right-to-work laws are good for the economy and  bolster industries. Data shows that States with right-to-work laws have  lower unemployment and higher job and wage growth than States without  such laws. Worker freedom leads to flourishing. What a concept, Madam  Speaker.   One study shows that right-to-work States attract more manufacturing  and construction jobs than States with compulsory union membership.  States which have enacted right-to-work laws in the past 22 years have  a 20.7 percent higher manufacturing share than they would have if they  did not protect worker freedom. According to the National Right to Work  Committee, factory employment rose by 150,000 in right-to-work States  in 2021 alone.    These numbers speak for themselves. Being pro-right-to-work means  being progrowth.   In the face of such overwhelming positive figures, I find it mind- boggling that Democrats want to push the radical Protecting the Right  to Organize Act, the PRO Act. The PRO Act would overturn right-to-work  laws in 27 States and force workers to line the wallets of union  bosses.   PRO Act policies will undermine worker choice, burden employers, and  harm our economy for years to come. That is why I have been working in  Congress to oppose this legislation and to hold the Biden  administration accountable when it tries to push PRO Act policies by  executive fiat.   Madam Speaker, it is time to embrace worker freedom, a quintessential  American value, and it is time to protect worker rights. I am proud to  celebrate the 75th anniversary of the right to work.   Let's make every State a right-to-work State. I guarantee the country  would be much better off.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Randy Marion, the owner of  Randy Marion Automotive Group and a true titan of entrepreneurship in  North Carolina.
