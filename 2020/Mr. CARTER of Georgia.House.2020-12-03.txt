 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor William E. ``Billie'' Clanton of Odum, Georgia, who passed away  on November 27.   Billie was raised in Wayne County and grew up picking tobacco and  harvesting turpentine on his family farm. He was born with a robust  entrepreneurial spirit which caused him to go from managing a  successful fruit stand, as well as many other businesses, all the way  to owning and operating the Chrysler Dodge dealership in 1965.   Billie went on to serve as vice president of Southeastern Chrysler  and Dodge Advertising board for 30 years. He was an avid supporter of  Wayne County and was very active in his community.   Billie was a 12-year host of the Day for Wayne, an event at his farm,  which is a great event held in support of Wayne County. It is truly  enjoyed by many every year and something I always look forward to.   Because of his prominence in his community and his life devoted to  serving others, the new Highway 169 Overpass will be dedicated in his  name.   Mr. Speaker, my deepest thoughts and prayers go out to Billie's  family, his wife, Nell; his five daughters; his 16 grandchildren; his  seven great-grandchildren, and two more on the way; his friends; and  the entire Wayne community during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on rollcall no. 230, I am not  recorded because of circumstances which caused me to miss the vote.
