 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 535, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3985) to amend the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009  to expedite the special immigrant visa process for certain Afghan  allies, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3985.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3985, the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by  Expediting SIVs Act of 2021, or the ALLIES Act, makes essential changes  to the Afghan special immigrant visa program to ensure that the lives  of those who served faithfully alongside American troops in Afghanistan  are protected.   The special immigrant visa program allows those individuals who  worked for or on behalf of the U.S. Government in Afghanistan, or for  the NATO International Security Assistance Force in support of the  American mission, to seek lawful permanent residence in the United  States.   To be eligible, applicants must establish qualifying employment in  Afghanistan for 2 years, receive approval from the Chief of Mission,  and undergo rigorous background checks and national security vetting, a  process that, on average, takes 3 years.   Our 20-year mission in Afghanistan will formally come to an end in  just a few short weeks. Each day that we continue to draw down our  military presence in Afghanistan, threats to the lives of Afghans who  supported our cause are increasing exponentially.   The Biden administration has committed to relocating certain  applicants  [[Page H3808]]  to a third country. Some who have passed the national security vetting  process will be transferred to the United States to complete visa  processing.   These evacuations, which are scheduled to begin at the end of this  month, are a critical component of our withdrawal strategy. But  evacuations alone are not enough. Congress must do our part to protect  those whose lives are at risk because of their support and service to  our Nation.   First and foremost, we must ensure that enough visas are available  for eligible applicants. H.R. 3985 increases the number of visas that  may be issued to qualifying Afghans by 8,000, which would ensure that  all qualified applicants who are currently undergoing processing can  immediately receive a visa if they are approved.   Second, we must streamline visa processing to the greatest extent  possible, without compromising national security or program integrity.   H.R. 3985 does this by reducing duplicative paperwork requirements  and modifying the requirement that applicants prove the existence of an  ongoing serious threat to their lives; to reflect the fact that Afghans  who worked in support of the U.S. mission now face an obvious threat as  a direct result of their work.   Third, the bill strengthens protections for certain groups of Afghan  nationals, including surviving spouses, and children of deceased  principal applicants, individuals employed by NATO in support of the  U.S. mission, and individuals whose work was funded by a U.S.  Government cooperative agreement or grant.   Collectively, these changes will ensure that no one whose lives are  at risk because of their support to the American mission are abandoned  or forced to wait for Congress to act to authorize more visas.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of this important bill. I thank  Representative Crow for championing the cause of our Afghan allies and  working across the aisle to build consensus and support for this  legislation. We must keep our promises to these brave men and women.  Their lives depend on it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3985, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am heartened to see Members on both sides of the aisle  speak in support of this important bill. It is vital that we pass this  legislation and it is vital that we do so quickly. As we speak, nearly  20,000 of our Afghan allies are facing increasing threats from the  Taliban and insurgent groups. The administration will begin evacuating  some individuals at the end of this month.   As Members of Congress, we must also do our part to honor the  sacrifices made by these brave men and women and pass the Allies Act.  It is much too bad that we cannot do more, but this is the least that  we can do. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
