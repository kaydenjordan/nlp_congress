 Madam President, after many weeks of uncertainty and  distress, millions of Americans can--for now--let go of the fear of  losing their homes and the roofs over their head. Last night, the Biden  administration announced a new 60-day Federal eviction moratorium. I  certainly support that decision.   I want to thank all those who insisted that we do something,  especially U.S. Congresswoman Cori Bush, of Missouri, who knows the  trauma, personally, of being without a home, having been a victim of  eviction in her life. Representative Bush camped out outside on the  Capitol steps for 5 nights. She slept on the steps of this building so  that some of the most vulnerable people in America would be able to  sleep with a roof over their heads while we were made sure the law  caught up with our intentions.   I also want to thank my fellow Democratic Senators, especially  Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren, who pushed for a fair and just  solution to avoid what would have been an entirely preventable tragedy  for families who already lost so much in this pandemic.   As many as 11 million Americans have fallen behind on their rent  during this pandemic because of job losses and other misfortunes.   Let me tell you about one of them. Patricia Vasquez. She lives in  Chicago's Little Village neighborhood. She told her story to the  Chicago Sun-Times. By the time Patricia Vasquez received an email on  July 23 telling her that she qualified for help from Chicago's  Emergency Rental Assistance Program, the gas to her apartment had  already been cut off because of an overdue $1,400 bill. She had sold  some clothes and jewelry to pay the electric bill and keep the lights  on, and she was 6 months behind in rent.   The Federal eviction moratorium will enable people like Patricia to  avoid homelessness while they wait for emergency assistance to reach  them.   Between the bipartisan CARES Act that Congress passed in December and  President Biden's American Rescue Plan, Congress has provided State and  local governments more than $46 billion in emergency rental assistance  to help families pay their landlords. Unfortunately, many States and  localities have been slower than expected in getting that money to the  people who need it. So far, only $3 billion of the $46 billion has  reached tenants and landlords.   To punish renters who have already lost so much for delays over which  they have no control and to evict them with the Delta variant tearing  the country apart would be unfair, unconscionable, and, in many cases,  deleterious to public health. It would harm our efforts to bring this  virus under control for good.   Fortunately, in recent weeks, many cities and States have made  progress in getting the help out to the people who need it. That  includes the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois.   The CDC's new eviction moratorium is only a first step. It is  imperative that all State and local governments step up their efforts  to get Federal relief to the families who need it and the landlords as  well. This pandemic has caused enough pain. Redtape can't be allowed to  deepen that pain for everyone.                                 Immigration    Madam President, I would like to address another issue that comes up  on the floor quite regularly, usually from speeches on the other side  of the aisle.   I heard one of my colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side who  is a personal friend talk about it today--and he is not the only one-- and it is, of course, the issue of immigration. I have been involved in  this issue for a long time.   I can recall when I was first elected to the Senate, I got a phone  call from Ted Kennedy. He said: I heard you are going to be on the  Senate Judiciary Committee.   I said: That is right.   He said: Can I ask you to be a member of my Immigration Subcommittee?   Well, how do you say no to Ted Kennedy, to start with? I was  fascinated by the invitation. I got involved in the immigration debate  then and over the years.   At one point, I joined three other Democratic Senators and four  Republican Senators--the so-called Gang of 8--and tried to sit down and  fix this broken immigration system. We actually wrote a bill, a good  bill. It passed here on the floor of the Senate with 68 votes.   Senator McCain was one of the contributors to it. Senator Flake of  Arizona was also one of them--Senator Graham of South Carolina, Senator  Rubio of Florida, Senator Schumer, Senator Bennet, Senator Menendez. We  put our hearts and souls into that effort and put it together and  brought it to the floor of the Senate and it was enacted into law.   Comprehensive immigration reform--I should say, it passed the Senate.  It failed to become enacted into law because the House of  Representatives, under Republican control, wouldn't bring it up for  debate, let alone a vote. That was an unfortunate missed opportunity.   It just comes down to this. We have not passed a significant  immigration bill in the United States of America in 35 years. Everyone  but everyone concedes that our immigration system is broken. There are  parts of it that are just fundamentally unfair. There are parts of it  which do not serve our Nation. There are certain things we ought to all  agree on, Democrats and Republicans. Let me give you three that I think  are the starting points.   First, we need a safe and secure border. I want to know who is coming  into America and what they are bringing. In the age of terrorism, in  the age of drugs, I want to know who is coming in and what they are  bringing. Yes, we need border security.   Secondly, we should never knowingly allow a dangerous person to come  into this country, period. If someone is here without legal protected  status and they are dangerous to us, they are gone--no ifs, ands, or  buts about it   The third point is an important one as well. We cannot allow everyone  in the world who wants to come into the United States to arrive  tomorrow. It just won't work. We have to have an orderly process, and  we ought to show some caring and humanitarian instinct in that process,  too, whether it is a refugee or asylee. These are people who  desperately need some safe place to be, and the United States has often  opened its doors since World War II to show that kind of kindness. Our  generation should do the same.   Now, there are those who come to the floor and say: Because so many  people want to come into the United States, it is a mistake for us to  give anybody legal status in this country because it is a green light.  It is an incentive for even more to show up.   That argument, I think, is not strong, and here is why. Each year,  the orderly legal process in America makes 1 million new Americans from  immigrants. It happens every year. These people are following the law,  every letter of it, to become legal permanent residents in America. So  to say we are going to cut them off and no longer allow them to become  citizens makes no sense.   Secondly, immigrants are a critical part of America. When my farmers  come to me and tell me how desperately they need farmworkers, and they  don't have enough immigrants to fill them, my natural reaction is, why  don't you go to the Americans who live near your farms? And they say:  Senator, we do. Nobody wants to do that backbreaking work of picking  fruit or vegetables and all the hard labor that goes with it. We need  immigrants to do it.   Two million people in our country pick our crops, 2.4 million. Did  you know half of them are undocumented? That is a fact. They have come  to this country and get paid to do the worst, hardest work you can  imagine.   Go to a meat processing plant or a poultry processing plant--you pick  it--anyplace in the United States and look at the workforce that comes  out of that gate at the end of the day. The majority of them--well, I  should say 40 percent across the Nation--40 percent of them are  immigrants who are working in that field; tough, dangerous, hot, hard  work. They do it because others  [[Page S5805]]  aren't lining up to do it in their place. That is part of America  today. Immigrants are a critical element.   I might add one other element which is timely. Think of all the times  we tune into the Olympics and look at the people who make us just beam  with pride, with ``USA'' written across their chest on uniforms, who  are winning these medals and competing on behalf of us, the United  States, in the Olympics.   Suni Lee of Minnesota, who is she? Well, it turns out that she is a  child of a Hmong family. The Hmongs, you remember from the Vietnam era,  were a people who were killed because they sided with the United  States, and they were caught in the crossfire of war. Many of them  settled in the United States, many in the State of Minnesota.   Here is this young woman, this daughter of refugees who is making us  so proud as she stands on the podium crying her eyes out with ``USA''  written on her uniform, proudly holding that gold medal. We cheer her  on.   Yet when it comes to the U.S. Senate, there are no cheers from some  quarters. These are immigrants. Many people look at them negatively. I  am not one of those people.   There has to be a better way. There has to be a humane way for us,  this Nation of immigrants, for us to be able to have a system that is  fair, that really is based on the three principles I mentioned: border  security, no dangerous persons, and we have got to have an orderly  process to come up with.   We are going to see in the next few days, I am sure, debate on the  budget resolution. It is going to be, in some part, a debate on  immigration policy. I am certainly ready for it. I hope my colleagues  are too. I hope that they will keep an open mind to a process of  creating a new immigration policy in America that really reflects our  values, that is fair to the people who seek to be part of our future,  and that recognizes the great heritage which the immigrants have  brought to this country. I hope those people who are on the other side  who don't feel as I do will take the time to meet some of these  immigrant people.   Meet my Dreamers. These young people who I first started championing  20 years ago have lived lives in the shadow of doubt for decades. They  were told they were undocumented; they could be deported at any moment;  and yet they soldiered on. They worked hard. They went to school. They  have done remarkable things, becoming doctors and nurses and teachers  and entrepreneurs and even members of our military. They are amazing.  They never let me down. They are just terrific young people. I think  they deserve a chance to become part of America's future.   I think they have earned it, and I think we ought to have that kind  of attitude in our minds when we talk about the role of immigrants in  the future of America.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, if you like Federal mandates, here is  one.   Senator Lankford wants a Federal mandate to require that anyone who  receives a grant from this bill has to sign up for E-Verify.   Well, what does that mean?  [[Page S5813]]    It means a school district in my home State that ended up getting a  grant under this bill for energy-efficient improvements, renewable  energy improvements at public school facilities would now be required  by the Lankford amendment, the Federal mandate, to have E-Verify to  check out the cafeteria workers in the school district. Is that what we  really want to do?   Well, how good is E-Verify? Some States have done it voluntarily.  Eight of them have done it for all or most employers. You think if you  run all these employees through the E-Verify process, how good is it?   Well, I can tell you how good it is. Do you know how many illegal  aliens you find when you go through E-Verify? One percent. One percent.   So he is creating a Federal mandate and regulations on districts that  are just trying to get energy improvements and reduce their costs and  putting in an E-Verify requirement to get those illegal aliens.   Well, it turns out that isn't the situation at all. It is a mandate  that is unnecessary. I beg my colleagues to give these school districts  and others no more redtape but less redtape.   Please oppose the Lankford amendment.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the unanimous  consent request from the Senator of Florida.   The amendment before us would change the Standing Rules of the Senate  and require additional reporting requirements regarding inflation, a  change which would substantially increase the administrative burden on  committees and staff and the process on the floor.   We already have significant tools at our disposal to evaluate  economic indicators. We have economists at the Department of Labor,  Treasury Department, Congressional Budget Office, Federal Reserve, and  other Federal offices regularly consulting with Congress on issues  about inflation and other economic indicators. This is totally  unnecessary.   For these reasons, I oppose this resolution and the request for  unanimous consent. I object.    I yield back my time.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.  [[Page S5817]]         I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, August 20 will be the end of an era in  Chicago as WLS 890 AM political reporter Bill Cameron puts his  microphone down after a 51-year career on the radio. Bill is the  ``Dean'' of Chicago political reporters, joining the city hall beat in  1970 and covering all the major stories in Chicago since that time. The  announcement of his pending retirement brought praise for Bill's  legendary career, with one colleague calling him a ``walking  encyclopedia of political knowledge.''   When asked by a fellow reporter how he had survived his first 50  years in the industry, Bill said he took inspiration in advice from  Chicago Cubs legend Ernie Banks: ``Find something you love to do and  stick with it.'' Stick with it; he certainly did. Bill earned the  admiration of his peers for his ability to elicit honest answers from  his interview subjects. Bill always finds a way to cut to the heart of  an issue and deliver insightful reports for his listeners.   Bill and I are both natives of East St. Louis, IL, though we never  met until my Senate election and his Chicago beat brought us together.  Bill's father Fred was a successful high school football coach, winning  more than 100 games for the storied East St. Louis Flyers. Instead of  following his father's footsteps into football, Bill chose broadcast  journalism, earning a bachelor's degree at Indiana University. And we  are all the better for it.   Bill started as a news writer for NBC 5 in Chicago in 1969 but left  TV for good the next year, signing on at the former WMAQ 670 AM. He was  there until the station switched to an all-sports format in 2000,  making the jump to WLS. Bill's legendary career includes two Edward R.  Murrow Awards, a Peabody Award, and countless other accolades. In  addition to his day-to-day duties covering the city hall beat for WLS,  Bill is the host of the station's weekly public affairs show,  ``Connected to Chicago.''   Bill has covered numerous mayors, Governors--and even U.S. Senators-- in his career. He has been there for election nights, policy press  conferences, breaking news, and jury verdicts. He has seen it all in  50-plus years of broadcasting. So what does he want to see now in  retirement? Bill says it is time to go see more National Parks.   Well, Bill, I hope you enjoy all the beauty that our National Parks  have to offer you in retirement. I will miss your questions at press  conferences and our lively discussions about the issues of the day on  ``Connected to Chicago.''   You certainly found something you loved and stuck with it, and you  did it with class.   Enjoy your retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2598         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
