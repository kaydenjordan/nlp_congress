 Mr. Speaker, today, I will reintroduce legislation  entitled, Save the Christians From Genocide Act. The bill declares  Christians and Yazidis in Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Iran, and Libya as  targets of genocide, and thus gives them a priority for immigrant and  refugee visas.   Importantly, this bill does not circumvent or change current vetting  processes, but rather simply ensures that these targets of genocide are  placed at the front of the line for immigration and refugee visa  processing.   The Save the Christians From Genocide Act was submitted but not  brought to the floor for a vote in the last Congress. During that time,  thousands of Christians have been killed and often turned into helpless  and hopeless refugees on the run from radical Islamic terrorism. The  Save the Christians From Genocide Act will give Middle East Christians  a safe haven.   Christians are being slaughtered. As we speak today, Christians are  being slaughtered in the Middle East. We must save them if we can.                            ____________________
