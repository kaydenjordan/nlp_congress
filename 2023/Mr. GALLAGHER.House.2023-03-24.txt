 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud Mater Dei graduate, a  proud Mater Dei Monarch, and I rise to honor a Rollinson, but probably  not the one you are thinking of.   Laurie Rollinson was my AP U.S. history teacher and imbued in me a  love of United States history, a fascination with our country's history  and values. The more I think about it and look back on it, it set me on  a path to not only further exploring those issues in college and  graduate school but to serving my country in the United States Marine  Corps and, ultimately, serving my country in the United States  Congress.                                time  1145    Among Coach Rollinson's many accolades, perhaps none is higher than  he out-kicked his coverage in terms of the woman he married, and she  had a profound impact on my life. Thank you to Laurie Rollinson, though  we are here today to recognize Coach Bruce Rollinson.   The other reason--I just want to mention the true power in the  Rollinson house because--and this is a bit of a shameful confession--I  was a nerd in high school. I spent more time studying for Mrs.  Rollinson's class than I did pursuing athletic excellence. I was not a  member of the Mater Dei football team. I went to many a game and  cheered on from afar.   In fact, I actually played flag football with the other Heisman  trophy winner that Coach Rollinson coached, Matt Leinart, in junior  high. I was so bad, I dropped every pass that Matt Leinart threw to me.  I was intimidated to play--too intimidated to play for Rollo.   Even if you weren't on the team, any student at Mater Dei was  profoundly impacted by Coach Rollinson. There was nothing better at  Mater Dei than a pep rally before a big game in which Coach Rollinson  would come out there with his raspy voice and fire up the entire  student body.   I have been to 8th & I ceremonies in the Marine Corps. I have been to  all sorts of fancy State visits. There is nothing with more energy and  more excitement than a Mater Dei pep rally where Coach Rollinson is  talking to the student body.   The thing that Coach Rollinson did was not talk about the Xs and Os  of football, that would have gone way over my head. I would have  immediately stuffed myself back into a locker if that was the topic of  conversation. He connected the playing of football to the pursuit of  excellence and what we were all there to do, which was to honor God.   Part of the Mater Dei mission--I have always felt since I started to  learn a bit more about the combination of athletic excellence, academic  excellence and leadership, I found that there are a lot of similarities  between Mater Dei's core values and the core values of the United  States Marine Corps.   We say: Honor, courage, commitment in the United States Marine Corps.  They say: Honor, glory, and love at Mater Dei. I found myself thinking  a lot about those core values.   Honor: What does it mean to pursue honor on a football field?   I would argue that there is honor in simply doing your job well,  regardless of what position you play.   As Coach Rollinson famously said: ``You create the effort, God  controls the outcome.'' There is honor in putting in the effort on the  field in order to do your absolute best. That culture of honor and  excellence permeated Mater Dei, and it was a direct result of Coach  Rollinson's leadership.   We honor God simply by doing our job well: whether you are a coach,  whether you are a player, whether you are a United States Congressman,  whether you are a President, whether you are anybody pursuing honorable  work.   In the Marine Corps we talk about this as ``ductus exemplo,'' ``lead  by example.'' Do your job well and you can inspire others.   Glory: Glory is obvious on a football field. I have colleagues who  are national champions. Coach is a four-time national champion. You  have had your share of glory on the football field. You have also  probably had your share of setbacks and heartbreak, but ultimately you  are not there to glorify yourself, you are not there to glorify even  the program, per se. It is all about glorifying God, glorifying that  pursuit of excellence, and glorifying the community that you are an  integral part of building at Mater Dei High School.   Glory on the football field translated to a sense that we are all  part of something greater than ourselves at Mater Dei. It was as  palpable as a student. That is a direct result of your leadership,  Coach Rollinson.   Finally, love: I don't want to get all, you know--we don't do a lot  of trust falls and hugging here in the House Republican Caucus. I think  the reason that football is so compelling, even more so than any of the  other sports, is this sense of sacrifice and genuine love for your  teammates, more so than any other sport. I think it is a pure team  sport. That willingness to sacrifice for your teammates is the ultimate  expression of love and leadership, I would argue.   Coach Rollinson, your ability to instill those values--those core  values of honor, glory, and love--into everything that you did in  leading the Mater Dei football team had a profound impact not only on  the lives of the players that played their hearts out for you, but on  the lives of every single student that walked through the doors of  Mater Dei High School.   I still think about it to this day. Though, I regret not being able  to call myself a former player of yours, I feel that I owe you a  significant debt of gratitude for setting that example of leadership  that I got to witness at a very early age.   We can list all your titles, we can list your wins, we can list your  national championships, we can list all the great players that you  coached, but it is impossible to quantify the impact that you have had  on tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of lives because of  what you meant to Mater Dei High School.   Thank you, Coach Rollinson, not only for everything you accomplished  on the field, but for everything that you accomplished off the field. I  stand in awe of it.   I am reminded of the quote--let me paraphrase it a little bit: Some  men have to spend their whole lives wondering if they made a  difference. You do not have to wonder about that, Coach Rollinson. You  have made a profound difference on the lives of thousands of young men  and women who attended Mater Dei High School.   Thank you for your leadership. It is an honor to be here today. You  have even inspired colleagues from other parts of the country to come  here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives to  honor your accomplishments.
