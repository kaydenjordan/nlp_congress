 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bishop Abdallah Elias  Zaidan of the Maronite Catholic faith and a valuable member of our  Lebanese American community in the United States.   Born in Ksseibe, Lebanon, Bishop Zaidan is the youngest bishop to  lead the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of Los Angeles. As a Lebanese  American myself, I am honored to have Bishop Zaidan come to Washington  to open the House floor for prayer this morning.   In 1984, Bishop Zaidan professed his perpetual vows as a member of  the Congregation of the Lebanese Maronite Missionaries and was ordained  a priest 2 years later. Since then, Bishop Zaidan committed his life to  serving others and was recognized for that service with his appointment  by Pope Francis as the third bishop of the eparchy.   I would like to commend Bishop Zaidan for his continued service in  the community and as a champion for the protection of children and a  missionary to those of all faiths. I am grateful for his work in the  Lebanese American community, and I would like to sincerely thank him  for coming this morning to bless the House in prayer.                            ____________________
