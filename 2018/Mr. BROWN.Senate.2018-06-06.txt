 Mr. President, barely a day goes by that doesn't bring  news of another consumer protection rollback and another handout to  Wall Street, day after day in this body or downtown.   This weekend, we heard that the Federal Reserve plans changes to the  Volcker rule--the rule that stops big banks from taking big risks with  Americans' money. The month before, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair,  Randal Quarles, said the Fed wants to loosen rules on foreign  megabanks. Those are the banks like Santander and Deutsche Bank. These  are banks headquartered abroad, but they abuse the public trust in this  country and have been fined in the past. The Federal Reserve Vice  Chair--who once was in the Bush administration, and prediction after  prediction missed the implosion of the economy in 2007 and 2008--wants  to loosen the rules on foreign megabanks. I don't even understand the  logic, let alone the sensibleness of it.   Today, we learned that Mick Mulvaney is continuing his systematic  dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by disbanding  the Consumer Advisory Board. It is a board of 25 advocates for American  consumers and industry experts. It is required by law to meet twice a  year, but Mulvaney now says they won't hold any meetings--not today,  not tomorrow, not next week, not next month, period--they were supposed  to meet with Mulvaney to advocate for American consumers, but they are  done with that, I guess--not ever, until Mulvaney replaces all the  members with his handpicked cronies.   Even though Federal law says: You have to meet with them--required by  law to meet twice a year--Mulvaney said: I am not meeting with them  until they quit and I get my handpicked friends of payday lenders,  friends of Wall Street, friends of big banks, friends of financial  service companies who think about politics and government and  regulation the way I think. What is right about that?    Apparently, Director Mulvaney, who, as we know, has two jobs--Office  of Budget and Management and also head of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau--and that is peculiar, putting it mildly. He has two  absolutely full-time jobs that he is supposed to do, apparently,  although he has time to chat up payday lenders at golf resorts in the  Bahamas, but he can't make time to meet with actual consumer experts,  even though it is the law to do that twice a year. He doesn't like  these consumer experts, so he is saying he is not going to do it.   The Board is supposed to advise the Director of the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau on trends that they are seeing so the  Bureau can stay ahead of scams and fraud. It is one more tool--or  should be one more tool--to try to prevent corporations from scamming  consumers before it happens.   For a change, let's stop the corruption and stop the back-scratching  and  [[Page S3266]]  stop the favors for Wall Street before they happen rather than  taxpayers bailing out these companies after they scam the public and  then the public is left penniless in far too many cases.   It is also an opportunity for the Director to hear what kinds of  consumer problems Americans are facing. Here is fundamentally the  reason why. Pope Francis, soon after he assumed the papacy, admonished  his parish priests to go out and smell like the flock. Go out and smell  like the flock. In other words, go out among people and see what  troubles them, see what their problems are, try to experience their  lives as much as a well-paid public servant can, including a Senator,  including a Congressman or Congresswoman, including a city council  person, whoever. Go out and smell like the flock. So instead of  Mulvaney going and hanging around payday lenders in Bahamas, maybe he  ought to go out and smell like the flock. Maybe he ought to follow the  words of Pope Francis and listen to the problems people have. One of  the ways of doing that is listening to these 25 advocates for American  consumers and industry experts. As I said, they are required to meet  twice a year, and if he is not listening to them--he clearly isn't  listening to people who can share some of these thoughts.   Similarly, when Lincoln was President, his staff wanted him to stay  in the White House and win the war and free the slaves and preserve the  Union, and Lincoln said: No, I have to go out and get my public opinion  baths. Well, Director Mulvaney could use some public opinion baths. He  could use some going out and smelling like the flock. Maybe he then  would understand consumers' problems. But he really doesn't seem to  want to do that.   Over and over again, he has used his position at the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau to do favors for corporate special  interests rather than look out for the people he is supposed to serve.  He canceled an investigation into the payday lending industry, which  preys on consumers and traps them in a downward spiral of debt. We know  how that happens. People don't genuinely get one payday loan. Their car  breaks down, and they borrow $400 because they can't get to work. They  will not be able to pay their rent if they can't get to work, so they  borrow the $400 because they don't have $400 in their pocket. A quarter  of Americans--more than that--don't have $400 of discretionary money in  their pockets to pay for an emergency. They go to a payday lender. They  can't pay them back right away, so they get another payday loan. They  can't pay that back, and by the end, they end up paying $1,500. They  never get out of that downward spiral. Does Director Mulvaney care?  Apparently not. He is too busy hanging out with payday lending  advocates and payday lenders themselves.   If that weren't bad enough, this week he ordered the Bureau to team  up with those same payday lenders. He joined a lawsuit to delay a rule  protecting consumers from triple-digit interest rates. Do you know why  I say triple digits? Again, that is what happens. Almost nobody gets  one payday loan. They simply can't pay it back quickly enough, so they  get a second and a third. You don't have to be very good in math. Even  Senators can understand this. If you are getting three, four, five, six  payday loans, you are into paying triple-digit interest rates. If you  borrow $300, you end up paying back $500, $600, $700.   He has gutted the Office of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  that was supposed to stop discrimination in lending. He has disbanded  the team that protected student loan borrowers. Nobody who is even as  conservative as anybody in this body might be, who is in the tank with  Wall Street as much as anybody in this body might be--there are a whole  lot of them in that category--nobody really believes that we created  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to fleece consumers and to  protect payday lenders, but that is what the new administrator seems to  want. He has hired a bunch of political cronies. We know that. He has  given them political salaries. We know that.    When he testified to the Banking Committee, sitting behind him were  very well-dressed political cronies pulling down very big salaries,  comparable to his salary and in some cases higher than Senators'  salaries. I am not complaining about that; I am just saying that these  are well-paid people who are political cronies who simply aren't  looking out for consumers. It never ends. That is just the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau.   Step back and look at what is happening in Washington, and you see  the same pattern--favors for Wall Street, favors for special interests,  no matter what it costs American workers, no matter what it costs  American families.   The White House looks like an executive retreat. It looks like a  retreat for Wall Street executives, except when it looks like a retreat  for drug company executives, except when it looks like a retreat for  big bank lobbyists, or except when it looks like a retreat for payday  lenders and Big Pharma lobbyists. That is the White House.   This place looks the same. The doors open wide around here for  lobbyists from the big drug companies, for lobbyists from Wall Street,  for lobbyists from the biggest insurance companies in the country--not  so much for public interest. You can see that in this body.   Mick Mulvaney even admitted to a room full of bankers--get this. This  is illuminating. It is illustrative. It doesn't shock me because I have  watched him, and I have watched many people who are just like him here.  Mick Mulvaney even admitted to a room full of bankers that he decided  whom he would meet with based on campaign contributions. I am not  making this up. He was a Congressman before. These are his words:         We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you're a       lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn't talk to you. If       you're a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.    Hear that again. This is Mick Mulvaney, who is now in charge of the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And consumers aren't writing big  checks to Members of Congress; it is the interest groups.   He said:         We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you're a       lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn't talk to you. If       you're a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.    Those are his words. What was particularly troubling about that was  he was telling a room full of bankers that story, and he was saying:  Come to me. Come to me. Give us money.   Not him per se because he is not running for office now, but give  Members of Congress money. Get involved. Make contributions. Come into  their offices--don't give them the money in the office. That would be  perhaps vulgar and illegal. But give these politicians money, and then  they may do things for you.   As the head of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he was basically  inviting these bankers: Give more money. Give more money. Give more  money. Imagine that. Imagine that. Talk about the White House looking  like a retreat for payday lending executives and Wall Street  executives.   Now we are seeing how devastating those priorities are for American  consumers. Think about the 3\1/2\ million victims of Wells Fargo's fake  account scandal. Think about the servicemembers who had their cars  repossessed while serving their country overseas. They come back from  combat, they come back from service overseas, and their car has been  repossessed. Why? Because the Bureau is not on the beat anymore to  protect those servicemembers from those kinds of scandals. Think about  the grandmother who ended up paying 300 percent on a $300 loan.   While Mick Mulvaney is looking out for Wall Street, who is looking  out for the servicemember? Who is looking out for the grandmother? Who  is looking out for the Wells Fargo fake account scandal victims?   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
