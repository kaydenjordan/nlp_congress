 Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of  Congressman Tom Price to be Secretary of the Department of Health and  Human Services.   I oppose the nomination because Mr. Price wants to dismantle  America's health care system--with no guarantee that Americans will  continue to receive the health care coverage they now enjoy. He is part  of the Trump ``repeal with no plan'' contingent.   In my view, any repeal of the Affordable Care Act must be coupled  with a program that has rock solid guarantees to the American public,  guarantees that Americans will not lose the health care benefits they  now have.   Further, I oppose any vote on Mr. Price's nomination until there has  been a full investigation and disclosure to the American public of his  conflicts of interest. Mr. Price has invested in companies just prior  to introducing legislation that would benefit those very companies.  Before we vote on Mr. Price, the American public needs a full  accounting whether his investments comply with Federal insider trading  laws and ethical provisions.   The President's first order of business was an attack on Americans'  health care. His Executive order gives Federal agencies broad authority  to grant waivers, exemptions, and delays of provisions in the ACA. As  Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mr. Price will be given rein  not only to grant waivers but to not enforce key ACA provisions and to  pass regulations that undercut ACA protections. For example,  undermining the individual mandate--a key target of Mr. Price's--could  lead to collapse of the individual health insurance market and drive up  premiums for everyone.   The ACA has resulted in the broadest health care coverage Americans  have ever known. Now over 91 percent of Americans have health  insurance.   In my own State of New Mexico, the number of uninsured has dropped by  over 50 percent. New Mexico is not a wealthy State. We had one of the  highest rates of uninsured in the country before the ACA--19.6 percent.  That's almost one in five people. Now, only 8.9 percent of New Mexicans  do not have insurance. This is still too high, but it is a big  improvement.   Americans strongly support ACA protections. Almost 70 percent of  Americans think insurance companies should not be able to deny  insurance because of a preexisting condition. Eighty-five percent of  Americans want their young adult children to be able to get coverage on  their insurance policies. Eighty-three percent think preventative  services should be free.   The Republicans and Mr. Price have no plan to make sure Americans do  not lose these rights and benefit.   Now, the ACA is not perfect. We all know this. It needs improvement.  It needs work. But the solution is not to throw the health care system  into chaos with no plan. The solution is to work together on a  bipartisan basis and fix the ACA's problems.   Hundreds of my constituents have called and written asking me to  protect the ACA. New Mexicans are scared--really scared--that their  health care will be taken away. People are scared their health is in  jeopardy. For some, they are scared their lives will be put at risk.  [[Page S1033]]    I am angry that the President, Mr. Price, and the Republicans have  created so much fear and worry among my constituents and around the  Nation. None of them has to worry whether their children will get the  health care they need. My constituents now do.   Kevin, from Albuquerque, now has to worry whether his 33-year-old  daughter Amber will get the health care she needs. Amber has multiple  sclerosis. That is a tough disease. I talked about Amber once before  here, and her story bears retelling.   Amber's annual medical costs are high. Her medications alone are  $60,000 a year. Her doctor visits and MRIs run into the thousands of  dollars.   But Amber now has health insurance through the open market thanks to  the ACA. And, thanks to the ACA, she is healthy. She works. She leads a  productive life.   Without the ACA, Kevin worries his daughter will be kicked off her  health insurance plan because her medical expenses are so high and that  she will not be able to get new health insurance--because of her  preexisting MS. For Amber and Kevin, the ACA's protections mean  everything.   There are literally hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans and  millions of Americans like Amber. This one ACA provision--prohibiting  discrimination based on preexisting illness--protects an estimated  861,000 New Mexicans and 134 million Americans. If we ourselves don't  have a serious illness like Amber, we have a family member or friend  who does.   Same with people who have high medical costs. These are the people  who need medical care the most. The ACA provision--prohibiting lifetime  benefit limits--protects an estimated 555,000 New Mexicans and 105  million Americans.   Why is there even any discussion about jeopardizing millions of  Americans' health care?   The ACA saves lives. It saved Mike's life. Mike and his wife, Pam,  are from Placitas, NM. Before the ACA, they didn't have insurance. They  couldn't afford it and probably couldn't get it for Pam because she had  a preexisting illness.   As soon as they could, they signed up for an insurance plan under the  ACA. Using their new preventive care services, they found out Mike had  an aggressive form of cancer. Thankfully, they caught it early. Mike  was treated at the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and is cured.   Pam says there is ``no question'' that the ACA saved her husband's  life.   Hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans and millions of Americans  benefit because the ACA requires health insurance companies to provide  free preventatives services. It is well documented that such services  prevent illness, save lives, and save money in the long run.   I am also concerned about the impact ACA repeal would have in Indian  Country. During his confirmation hearings, Congressman Price was asked  specifically about the devastating consequences Medicaid expansion  repeal would have on Indian health providers. These providers depend  heavily on this Federal funding to provide lifesaving services to our  Native communities. Any reduction in Federal funding to these  facilities would be unconscionable.   But Congressman Price has a clear record of voting to support the  elimination of the Medicaid expansion and, when asked directly, could  offer no solution for making Indian Country whole if this funding were  to be cut. Nothing in his hearing or written answers has assured me  that Congressman Price intends to protect Native communities from the  negative impact of ACA repeal.   And, finally, ACA repeal would be devastating to my State's economy.  That is what a Ph.D. economist from New Mexico State University told  the New Mexico Legislature last week. Dr. Jim Peach said ACA repeal  would be ``devastating'' to our State.   As I said, New Mexico is not a wealthy State. We have one of the  highest unemployment rates in the country, at 6.6 percent.   But the ACA has been an economic boon for us. Seven of the 10  fastest-growing job categories in New Mexico are in health care. In  fact, boosts from health care and tourism actually led to positive job  growth for the last 2 months. So health care jobs are of critical  importance in New Mexico.   But, if the ACA is repealed, it is estimated New Mexico could lose  between 19,000 and 32,000 jobs. I can tell you right now New Mexico  cannot take that kind of hit in its employment numbers.   And, the loss in spending in New Mexico would be astronomical.   ACA repeal would mean a loss of $93 million in Federal marketplace  spending in 2019 in New Mexico and $1 billion between 2019 and 2028.   It would mean a loss of $2.2 billion in Federal Medicaid funding in  2019 and almost $27 billion between 2019 and 2028.   This hit to our economy would be immediate and would be sustained.  Tax revenues would decrease. And the New Mexico legislature is  struggling mightily now how to balance the State budget.   The fact is no State budget is ready to take on the extra load if the  ACA is repealed and health care gets pushed back to the States. We will  go back to the days of no care, uncompensated care, and use of  taxpayer-subsidized ER services as a last resort.   But Mr. Price and the Republicans are not talking about any of the  damage in human or fiscal terms if the ACA is repealed.   In fact, they are already moving to undermine the Affordable Care  Act, roll back its protections, reduce assistance to families, create  chaos in the insurance markets--by executive action alone.   President Trump's Executive order directed his government not to  implement the Affordable Care Act wherever possible under existing law.  And we cannot be confident they will not bend the law in pursuit of  this Presidential decree.   I cannot support a nominee to head our health care system who is not  firmly committed to maintaining the health care coverage Americans now  have. And who will not push--and push hard--for the right of every  American to have health care.   Finally, I cannot support holding a vote on Mr. Price until all  financial conflicts of interest of his have been fully vetted and the  American public knows there has been no violation of law or ethical  responsibilities.   Mr. Price is a wealthy man, like so many of Mr. Trump's cabinet  nominees. And he has tried to increase his wealth by investing in  health-related companies. It is widely reported--in the Wall Street  Journal and elsewhere--that Mr. Price has made over $300,000 worth of  investments in health-related companies--companies that could benefit  from his legislation.   We are all familiar with the STOCK Act. It applies directly to us and  prohibits us from using inside information that we obtain through our  positions as Members of Congress for personal gain.   There are serious questions whether Mr. Price's investments ran afoul  of the STOCK Act.   I would like to refer to a February 7, 2017, column from the New York  Times discussing Mr. Price's widely reported investments. So, a first  example, in March of last year, Congressman Price announced opposition  to a Medicare measure that would limit the money doctors could make  from drugs they prescribe their patients. The proposal was meant to  reduce doctors' financial incentives to prescribe expensive drugs.   Makes sense--we don't want doctors to prescribe more costly drugs  because they would personally benefit.   But, just 1 week later, Mr. Price bought stock in six pharmaceutical  companies that would benefit if this consumer protection measure were  defeated.   And then, at the very same time, those very same companies were  lobbying Congress to block the measure. And Big Pharma succeeded.   A second example--last year, he purchased shares in Zimmer Biomet, a  company that makes hip and knee implants.   Six days later, he introduced a bill that would have directly helped  Zimmer. His legislation sought to delay a Federal regulation that would  have changed payment procedures for Zimmer. In fact, Zimmer was one of  two companies that would have been hit the hardest by the regulation.   Mr. Price has said his broker bought the Zimmer stock. But these  circumstances warrant investigation.  [[Page S1034]]  And, bottom line, Mr. Price is responsible for his investments.   A third example--last summer, Mr. Price was offered a special deal-- to purchase shares at deeply discounted price from Innate  Immunotherapeutics, an Australian drug company. He got in at 18 cents a  share--at a time the stock value was increasing rapidly, rising to more  than 90 cents a share. The value of his shares rose more than 400  percent.   At the same time, Innate Immuno needs Federal Drug Administration  approval for one of its drugs.   This deal raises questions whether Mr. Price gained from an  investment opportunity--unavailable to the public--from a company whose  profits could be influenced by his political decisions.   A Cabinet nominee should not come into office under a cloud of  conflicts. A vote on his nomination before there is full inquiry into  his investments and ethical behavior is premature.   For these reasons, I will vote no on the nomination of Mr. Price as  Secretary of Health and Human Services.   I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times column I referred to  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Feb. 7, 2017]                     Tom Price, Dr. Personal Enrichment                            (By David Leonhardt)         Each year, a publication called Medscape creates a portrait       of the medical profession. It surveys thousands of doctors       about their job satisfaction, salaries and the like and       breaks down the results by specialty, allowing for       comparisons between, say, dermatologists and oncologists.        As I read the most recent survey, I was struck by the       answers from orthopedic surgeons. They are the highest-paid       doctors, with an average salary of $443,000 in 2015--which,       coincidentally, was almost the exact cutoff for the famed top       1 percent of the income distribution.        Yet many orthopedists are not happy with their pay. Only 44       percent feel ``fairly compensated,'' a smaller share than in       almost every other specialty. A lot of orthopedists aren't       even happy being doctors. Just 49 percent say they would go       into medicine if they had to make the decision again,       compared with 64 percent of all doctors.        I know that many orthopedists have a very different view:       They take pride in helping patients and feel fortunate to       enjoy comfortable lives. But despite those doctors, it's       clear that orthopedics suffers from a professional culture       that does not live up to medicine's highest ideals. Too many       orthopedists are rich and think it's an injustice that       they're not richer.        This culture helped shape Dr. Tom Price, the orthopedic       surgeon and Georgia congressman who is Donald Trump's nominee       for secretary of health and human services.        Price had a thriving practice near Atlanta before being       elected to Congress in 2004. His estimated net worth of more       than $10 million (and possibly a lot more) makes him one of       the House's wealthier members.        Yet he hasn't been content to make money in the standard       ways. He has also pushed, and crossed, ethical boundaries.       Again and again, Price has mingled his power as a congressman       with his desire to make money.        So far, the nominee receiving the most attention is Betsy       DeVos, Trump's choice for education secretary, and she       definitely deserves scrutiny. Still, I think Democrats have       made a mistake focusing so much on her rather than on Price.       He could do more damage--and his transgressions are worse       than those that have defeated prior nominees.        Last March, Price announced his opposition to a sensible       Medicare proposal to limit the money doctors could make from       drugs they prescribe their patients. The proposal was meant       to reduce doctors' financial incentives to prescribe       expensive drugs. (And, yes, if you're bothered that your       doctor has any stake in choosing one drug over another, you       should be.)        One week after Price came out against the proposal, he       bought stocks in six pharmaceutical companies that would       benefit from its defeat, as Time magazine reported. At the       time, those same companies were lobbying Congress to block       the change. They succeeded.        It's a pattern, too. Price has put the interests of drug       companies above those of taxpayers and patients--and invested       in those drug companies on the side.        Last year, he also bought shares in Zimmer Biomet, a maker       of hip and knee implants. Six days later, according to CNN,       he introduced a bill that would that have directly helped       Zimmer.        In his defense, a spokesman for Price has said that his       broker bought the Zimmer stock and Price didn't find out       until later. That's certainly possible, but still not       acceptable. Members of Congress bear responsibility for their       personal stock transactions, period.        A third episode may be the worst. Price accepted a special       offer from an Australian drug company to buy discounted       shares, as The Wall Street Journal and Kaiser Health News       reported.        He told the Senate that the offer was open to all       investors, although fewer than 20 Americans actually received       an invitation to buy at the discounted price. The stock has       since jumped in value, and Price underreported the worth of       his investment in his nomination filings. It was a ``clerical       error,'' he says.        Even without any larger context, his actions are       disqualifying. He's repeatedly placed personal enrichment       above the credibility of Congress. The behavior is       substantially worse than giving money to an illegal immigrant       (which defeated a George W. Bush nominee) or failing to pay       nanny taxes (which scuffled a Bill Clinton nominee).        But of course there is a larger context. Price has devoted       much of his political career opposing expansion of health       insurance. His preferred replacement of Obamacare would       reduce health care benefits for sicker, poorer and older       Americans.        His views have a long history within the medical       profession. For decades, doctors used their political clout       to help block universal health insurance. They offered many       rationales, but money was the main reason. Many doctors       feared that a less laissez-faire health care system would       reduce their pay.        It's to the great credit of today's doctors that they have       moved their lobbying groups away from that position and       helped extend insurance to some 20 million people. They       understand that some principles matter more than a paycheck.        Or at least many of them do.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
