 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 741, I call up  the bill (H.R. 4) to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the  criteria for determining which States and political subdivisions are  subject to section 4 of the Act, and for other purposes, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 4.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights  Advancement Act of 2019.   H.R. 4 is comprehensive and much-needed legislation to restore the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 to its full vitality. This bill responds to  the Supreme Court's disastrous 2013 decision in Shelby County v.  Holder, which effectively gutted the act's most important enforcement  mechanism, section 5, which requires jurisdictions with a history of  racial discrimination in voting to obtain Justice Department or Federal  court approval before any changes to their voting laws can take effect.   The Court struck down the coverage formula that determined which  jurisdictions would be subject to preclearance, but it expressly said  that Congress could draft another formula based on current conditions.  That, among other things, is exactly what H.R. 4 does.   This bill is the result of an extensive process that included 18  hearings before three different House committees. This process  developed a record demonstrating that States and localities and, in  particular, those that were formerly subject to preclearance, have  engaged in various voter suppression tactics, such as imposing  burdensome proof of citizenship laws, polling place closures, purges of  voter rolls, and significant scale-backs to early voting periods.   These kinds of voting restrictions have a disproportionate and  negative impact on racial and language minority voters and deprive them  of a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.   In short, the record is clear that substantial voter suppression  exists across the country and that H.R. 4's coverage formula is  necessary to address this discrimination.   This legislation not only updates the existing formula to ensure that  it accounts for current conditions, but it is also designed so that the  formula will update itself regularly as conditions change, thereby  directly responding to the Court's concern in Shelby County.   Not surprisingly, the suspension of preclearance unleashed a deluge  of voter suppression laws across the Nation, making restoration of this  tool even more necessary.   As we consider the record and the need for H.R. 4, it is worth  remembering why Congress enacted preclearance in the first place.  Before the Voting Rights Act, we saw, essentially, a game of whack-a- mole in which States and localities could engage in voter suppression,  secure in the knowledge that any discriminatory law that was struck  down by a court could quickly be replaced by another. Preclearance  successfully put an end to this game of whack-a-mole.   I want to thank Terri Sewell for crafting this important legislation  and for her efforts over the last several years on this bill.   I also want to recognize the leadership of Marcia Fudge, chair of the  House Administration's Subcommittee on Elections, for her extraordinary  work in conducting numerous field hearings examining voting problems  around the country, as well as Constitution Subcommittee Chairman    Steve Cohen, who presided over many hearings in the Judiciary Committee  to develop the substantial record on which this legislation is based.   The Voting Rights Act represents one of the Nation's most important  civil rights victories, one achieved by those who marched, struggled,  and even died to secure the right to vote for all Americans. I urge my  colleagues to honor their sacrifices and to enable section 5 once again  to protect the rights of all Americans to vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) control the remainder of the time on the majority  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), the chief sponsor of this legislation.  [[Page H9315]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on each  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on each  side.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply comment that this is a  restoration of the previously authorized Voting Rights Act before the  Supreme Court did its dastardly deed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Richmond).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side has  left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, we have only one remaining speaker, who will  be our closing speaker, so the gentleman from Georgia may wish to close  for his side.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
