 Mr. Speaker, for eight generations, my family has lived  in the mountains of western North Carolina. Many of my family members  have served in our Armed Forces. I grew up surrounded by men of courage  and patriotism who dedicated their lives and their honor in defense of  this American Republic.   I understand, as much as one can without serving, the struggle a  veteran faces attempting to reacclimate to civilian life. It is  incumbent on the American people to work hand in hand with our veterans  and streamline their transition back into the workforce.   To that end, I urge support for H.R. 2167, the GI Bill National  Emergency Extended Deadline Act. Included in this larger piece of  legislation is a program that I am proud to advocate for.   My language in this bill authorizes a pilot program to allow States  to use grants or contracts to carry out short-term fellowship programs  for unemployed veterans. This program is not some revolutionary  concept, but what it does is build off the successes of other  pilot programs in the veteran community.    This program would authorize DOL VETS to carry out a pilot program  similar to fellowship programs created by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  Foundation to allow States to use grants or contracts to carry out a  short-term fellowship program.   After the participating States have been selected by the DOL, each  State would enter into an agreement with a nonprofit organization to  carry out the short-term fellowship program. Participants would be  provided a small stipend while they are participating in the program.   This program prioritizes veterans and opens up new and unique  pathways toward employment. This new fellowship program will build upon  the successes of other fellowship programs across the country, and I am  confident that it will empower unemployed veterans to find meaningful  work in the post-COVID economy.   The benefits of this program are numerous. It will give eligible  veterans the ability to gain on-the-job experience in a field of their  interest while earning a monthly stipend.   I will always fight for the veteran community in NC-11, and this  program is a bipartisan measure that puts veterans first.   One of the foundational attributes of Americanism is our sense of  brotherhood. Those who sacrifice for the good of this Nation are not  simply a resource to be utilized and then cast aside. These are our  heroes, and they deserve much more than what our Nation currently  provides them.   When I left my mountain home to come to Washington, I promised the  veterans in our district that I would be their weapon in Washington,  D.C. I will never abandon those who sacrificed their lives and  livelihoods in defense of our freedoms.   For too long, we have cast our veterans, these guardians of our  Republic, by the wayside and derided their sacrifice. Never forget,  America is the land of the free because of the brave. Together, we can  show these men and women who dedicated their lives to us that we will  not turn our backs on them.   Join me in supporting the new veterans fellowship program, and let's  take a firm step toward supporting our veterans. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2167, the National Emergency  Extended Deadline Act.  [[Page H2431]]                                ____________________
