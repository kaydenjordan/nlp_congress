 Mr. Speaker, it has been a year since Joe Biden took  office, and the southern border has all but collapsed.   A year has passed, and he still cannot find the elusive root cause of  his self-inflicted border crisis. Since he is clearly having some  trouble finding the cause, I will save him some time. Joe Biden is the  root cause of the border crisis.   The number of illegal crossings at the border has escalated at a  faster rate under him than at any time in recent history. Since Joe  Biden took office, nearly 2 million illegal immigrants have been  apprehended at the southern border.   But wait, there is more.   More illegal immigrants have crossed the southern border in the last  3 months than in all of fiscal year 2020. And now, we have learned that  illegals are being funneled to cities across the United States in the  dead of night.   That is right. While Americans are asleep, this administration is  trying to cover up its own failures. Some of these illegals are known  to have criminal records, yet they are being given a free pass.   Across the world, people are watching this unfold. Across the world,  people are getting the message that you can waltz into this country  illegally with no consequences. Consider the fact that people from 160  different countries are coming to the southern border. It is clear that  the message is the wrong one to be sending.   In December, a Saudi Arabian national with ties to known Yemeni  terrorists was arrested after he crossed the border wearing a fake  paramedic uniform. If he were released into the United States, the  consequences would have been disastrous.   Mr. Speaker, instead of securing the southern border and protecting  the integrity of our national security, this administration has doubled  down on its own failures. Because of this worsening crisis, every State  has now become a border State.   Border security is national security. And thanks to Joe Biden and  congressional Democrats' open border policies, America has neither.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the Democrats' China bill will weaken the  United States on the world stage. This legislation isn't about  competing with China. This bill is about appeasing China.   This is a bill without teeth, and it does too little to confront the  Chinese Communist Party while simultaneously curbing the success and  opportunities of American job creators and workers. Contrary to my  colleague's statements just now, this bill is not positive for our  workforce.   By further centralizing apprenticeship programs and giving unions  unfair advantage over small businesses, this bill closes pathways to  success for many American workers.   This legislation also fails to curb the CCP's influence at our  universities and workplaces. Where there should be action, Democrats  promote inaction. Where there should be strength, Democrats show  weakness. Where there should be security, Democrats make our country  more vulnerable. This is not the America COMPETES Act. This is the  America concedes act.
