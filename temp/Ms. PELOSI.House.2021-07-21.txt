 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  him for his extraordinary leadership as chair of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, and I thank him for bringing this important  legislation to the floor. I thank Mr. Tonko for his leadership as chair  of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, the Environment and Climate Change  Subcommittee, and I thank Mr. McKinley, the ranking member on that  subcommittee.   I respectfully disagree with the ranking member of the full  committee, and I will tell you why. I join our colleagues in support of  the PFAS Action Act to address the serious public health issue that is  a threat; PFAS chemicals, which are contaminating the water we drink,  the air we breathe, and the food we eat.   First, I salute Representative Debbie Dingell, a crusader in our  mission to protect our communities from dangerous PFAS chemicals. I  thank, again, as I said, Chairman Pallone, Chairman Tonko, and Ranking  Member McKinley.   Mr. Speaker, PFAS are referred to as ``forever chemicals''. They are  so called because they do not easily break down and even accumulate  over time. Right now, they are exposing millions of Americans to health  risks ranging from cancer to asthma, and liver disease to thyroid  dysfunction.   For babies, they can be particularly devastating with prenatal  exposure potentially leading to abnormal growth in utero, low birth  rate, and increased risk of childhood obesity and infections. Our  distinguished chairman enumerated other threats to the health and  wellbeing of the American people.   When people ask me: What are the three most important issues facing  the Congress, I always say the same thing: Our children, our children,  our children, their health, their education, the economic security of  their families, and a safe and clean environment where they can thrive  in a world of peace in which they can reach their fulfillment.   Mr. Speaker, PFAS chemicals are clearly and seriously harming to our  children's health.   A coalition of public health groups, including the American Academy  of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, National Medical  Association, and Children's Environmental Health Network, have written:  ``These ubiquitous substances pose severe health risks across the  United States and represent a growing threat to public health.''   They further state: ``PFAS are particularly dangerous . . .  widespread and likely present in the drinking water of tens of millions  of Americans.''   Further: ``Developing infants and children are particularly  vulnerable to PFAS exposure. . . .   ``Of concern, almost all fetuses and infants will have some degree of  exposure to PFAS. . . .   ``PFAS exposure before birth or in early childhood has been  associated with decreased birth weight, effects on renal function and  lipid serum levels, and immune system dysfunction.''   That statement was from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American  Public Health Association, National Medical Association, and the  Children's Environmental Health Network.   In addition to our children and young people, PFAS also poses a  serious risk to America's servicemembers. There is an epidemic of  contamination on military sites with more than 400 sites across the  United States affected.   I have had the privilege, Mr. Speaker, of hearing the concerns of  many of these families. It is not just about the servicemembers, it is  about their children who are affected.   It is unacceptable that the men and women who sacrifice to keep us  safe around the world face this danger to their health and that of  their children here at home. Yet, despite these obvious and well-known  risks, big corporations have for decades failed or refused to prevent  their spread.                                time  1245    A new study published last week shows that based on EPA data, an  estimated 30,000 industrial sites are known or suspected of using toxic  PFAS; 12 times what had been previously estimated. We cannot accept a  situation where big special interests' bottom line comes before the  public's lives.   To address this crisis, 2 years ago, Democrats crafted strong  legislation to rid our communities of PFAS. Many Democrats, and many  Members here, played a key role in crafting PFAS-related bills that  were included in the bipartisan NDAA agreement reached in the House  that year.   I thank Chairman Smith and the members of the committee.  Unfortunately, the GOP Senate then refused to support full protections  against PFAS chemicals and cut those key provisions from the NDAA; that  is, the National Defense Authorization Act.   Last year, House Democrats passed the PFAS Action Act of 2019, which  passed with strong bipartisan support, but did not become law because  Mitch McConnell senselessly refused to take it up in the Senate.   Now the Democratic House will, once again, pass the PFAS Action Act  and send it to the Senate. We are making clear that this legislation is  a priority for the American people, and we will not relent until it is  enacted.   This legislation will clean up our communities by designating the two  most-studied PFAS as a hazardous substance by the EPA and setting a  deadline for the EPA to make designation decisions about all other PFAS  chemicals.   Next, it will create new, well-funded grants and partnerships with  States to help clean up and remedy sites. It will stem the tide of  further contamination with tough new testing, reporting, and monitoring  requirements; strict limits on the introduction of new PFAS chemicals;  limits on air pollution; banning unsafe incineration; and strong  measures to hold contaminating companies accountable.   I spent the time to be so specific because this is such a threat to  the health and well-being of our children, our children, our children.  I urge a strong vote for this legislation, which honors our first  responsibility of Congress, to keep our American people safe.
