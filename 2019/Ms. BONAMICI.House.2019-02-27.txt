 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8,  the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.   This year, my State of the Union guest was Alexandria Goddard, a  young activist who helped organize Portland's March for Our Lives.   Alexandria led thousands of Oregonians in a march to demand that  Congress take action to prevent gun violence.   By passing this bill we are heeding the call of the hundreds of  thousands of students who marched for their lives.   They know--and we know--that this bill will save lives because it  requires a background check for nearly all firearm sales and transfers.   The evidence shows that Oregon and the other states that have already  passed comprehensive background checks have 35 percent fewer gun  deaths, and 47 percent fewer women shot by their intimate partners.   Congress is finally doing more than offering thoughts and prayers.   We are acting. We are acting for Parkland, for Sandy Hook, for Umpqua  Community College, and for the hundreds of thousands of victims and  survivors around the country.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 8.
