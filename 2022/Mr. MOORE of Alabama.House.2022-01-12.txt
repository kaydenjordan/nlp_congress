 Mr. Speaker, today the latest Consumer Price  Index numbers were revealed, confirming what Americans buying gas,  groceries, and other necessities already know. Over the past year, the  CPI increased an astonishing 7 percent.   That is the highest inflation rate we have seen in four decades. The  last time we saw inflation like this, the University of Georgia  football program had already begun its historic 40-plus-year  championship drought that ended this week.   This catastrophe could have been avoided, could have been headed off.  But last July, despite economists insisting it was a fantasy, the Biden  administration brushed off inflation concerns as just a transitory  inconvenience.   Of course, Biden--or at least his string-pullers--knew better, but he  did not want the daunting economic realities facing American families  to get in the way of this massive socialist tax-and-spend agenda.   You don't need an economics degree to know that trillions more in  government spending will drive up inflation. Unfortunately, that is  exactly what we are seeing.    If the Biden administration and the House Democrats get their way and  pass this harmful Build Back Better scheme with trillions more in  spending, inflation will soar like never before.   Americans are suffering. We must defeat the Democratic agenda,  restore fiscal sanity, and take meaningful steps to combat the record  inflation crushing American families and businesses.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to replace the  underlying bill with the text of my bill, H.R. 2047.   This amendment would provide additional eligibility for members of  the National Guard who are called up on Federal Active-Duty orders for  service other than for training.   As a former member of the National Guard, I know all too well the  challenges that they face. The National Guard has transitioned in  recent years from a reserve force for domestic missions to a full-time  force operating around the globe.   My amendment would remove the Presidential declaration requirement  that has restricted benefits for so many members of the National Guard  in the past. It would make it so that members of the National Guard  would receive eligibility for the time spent under any Federal Active- Duty orders that are not for training.   This would provide eligibility for Federal benefits to those who  support COVID-19 relief, respond to natural disasters, and protect our  southern border.   I agree with Chairman Levin that we must take a hard look at duty  status reform and the expansion of benefits afforded to the National  Guard and the Reserve component while operating under Federal Active- Duty orders.   My amendment would make it clear that if you are called up on Federal  orders for something other than training, you should receive  eligibility for GI Bill benefits.   However, I am concerned that the expansion proposed in his bill is a  little too broad. We should allow the DOD to complete their efforts to  better align benefits to certain duty statuses before we move forward  with such a broad expansion. I think General Bergman hit on that point  today, that we need to give them time to work through the process.   An expansion of every day in uniform could cost over $2 billion over  the next  [[Page H61]]  10 years in mandatory benefits, where my expansion is only $16 million.   We talked about inflation in the hearing today. We have seen the  highest increase in 40 years. I think we need to try to get a handle on  this kind of runaway spending. I think my approach is more surgical, if  you will. It allows the benefits to our Guard and servicemembers  without just painting a broad brush for everyone in uniform.   My amendment ensures that members of the National Guard that are  called to action receive access to educational programs, like all other  veterans, while doing so in a fiscally responsible manner.   Finally, I would like to thank Ranking Member Bost and all his staff  for their support on this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), the ranking member of the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
