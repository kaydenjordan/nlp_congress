 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  15-minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, the average American household spent an  estimated $3,500 more in expenses last year as a result of inflation-- $3,500. Now, that may not sound like much to a wealthy Democrat  politician, but for most American families, that is a lot of money. For  a lot of families, $3,500 is the difference between putting something  in savings or living paycheck to paycheck. An additional $3,500 in  expenses can mean having to forgo essential home repairs or needed car  work. It can mean putting off braces for a child or forgoing needed  medical care.   Now, the White House Chief of Staff may have the budget to regard  inflation as a high-class problem, which is how she referred to it,  described it, but for ordinary Americans, inflation is a very real  problem--a problem that is eating up their wage increases and lowering  their standard of living.   We are in the midst of an inflation crisis, a supply chain crisis,  and as if those weren't enough, a border crisis. Huge numbers of  illegal immigrants are pouring across our southern border and have been  pouring across our southern border for months, creating a security,  enforcement, and humanitarian nightmare.   So there is a lot for our country's leadership in Washington to be  focused on right now. What is the majority party doing about these  crises? Well, not much. In fact, most of the time, you can be forgiven  for thinking that neither the President nor Democrat leaders even  realize there is an inflation crisis or a supply chain crisis or a  border crisis. The President, for one, seems to be hoping that if he  ignores these crises for long enough, they will just go away.   So what are the President and congressional Democrats doing with  their time if they are not addressing our border crisis or inflation  crisis? Well, for one thing, they are attempting to double down on the  strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place. That is  right. The inflation crisis Democrats would like to ignore is actually  something they helped create by flooding the economy with excessive  government spending in their so-called American Rescue Plan last March.   For months, they have tried to double down on that bill with another  massive spending spree that would flood the economy with more  government money and undoubtedly make the inflation crisis worse.   The President has attempted to justify this massive spending  legislation by claiming that it will help inflation. Right. So the  first massive spending spree helps push us into an inflation crisis,  but a second massive spending spree will fix it? I am pretty sure that  the definition of ``insanity'' is doing the same thing over and over  again and expecting different results.   But massive inflation concerns haven't stopped Democrats. After all,  why deal with a boring inflation crisis when you could be thinking up  new ways to expand the Federal Government and new ways of taxing  Americans to pay for it? Of course, Democrats' Build Back Better plan  isn't all tax hikes. Democrats did manage to include a tax break in  their tax-and-spending proposal--a tax break for blue State  millionaires. If they succeed in passing it, I am sure wealthy Democrat  donors will be grateful.   While an inflation crisis has raged, Democrats have pushed for new  ways to spend taxpayer dollars and expand the reach of the Federal  Government into Americans' lives: a huge expansion of government's  involvement in childcare that would disadvantage the religious  providers so many Americans choose for their children; a massive  increase in the size of the IRS; a proposal to allow the IRS to examine  the details of Americans' banking transactions; energy policies that  would drive up the cost of electricity and gasoline for American  families; billions for priorities like tree equity and environmental  justice programs at well-funded colleges and universities. The list  goes on.   But it would be unfair for me to suggest that Democrats have expended  all their energy on tax-and-spending sprees. The administration has  also found time to implement provisions of Democrats' original spending  spree, the American Rescue Plan, including, apparently, until they got  caught, free government crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia.   Democrats spent a lot of time pushing election legislation that they  hope will give them an advantage come November.   On the COVID front, the administration struggled with testing, but it  has found time for vaccine and mask mandates, some of which I believe  have far exceeded the administration's authority. Fortunately, the  courts have stepped in to check some of the administration's excesses,  like the administration's attempt to impose a vaccine mandate on large  private-sector employers or the administration's decision to impose a  mask mandate for 2-year-olds--yes, for 2-year-olds.   Your Democratic government at work, ladies and gentlemen.   In November, the administration issued a mask mandate for Head Start  programs requiring all children 2 years of age and up to be masked  inside and outside--out on the playground. Now, is there scientific  evidence to support this? Not really. The World Health Organization, in  fact, recommends against masking for children aged 5 and under, but  that hasn't stopped the administration. Democrats seem determined that  nothing, including science, will pry their masks from them--or perhaps  I should say pry our children's masks from them--since Democratic  politicians have not always demonstrated the consistency of mask- wearing that they expect from our children.   Democrats wonder why Republicans think we should be careful how much  power we give the Federal Government.  [[Page S632]]  If Democrats really wanted to help American families, they would be  focusing on our inflation and supply chain crises and addressing the  security nightmare posed by our border crisis. Instead, they are busy  focusing on ways to secure their hold on power and vastly expand the  reach of the Federal Government into Americans' lives. I guess we will  have to see how that strategy works out for them.   I yield the floor.
