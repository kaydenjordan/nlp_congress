 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address the House on  National Law Enforcement Day.   I am not sure we are all aware of the demands and risks that the men  and women in uniform face every day when they go out to work. They  respond to the call always, every day, in bad weather, in disasters, at  huge risk.   They often don't know what to expect, but they respond. They respond  to domestic violence. They respond in issues of drug trafficking. They  respond when there are bullets flying, and they do it without  hesitation.  [[Page H301]]    I want to honor all of them, and their families, that go every day,  put on a uniform and protect all of us. And, in particular, I want to  say thank you to my oldest son who, as a six year old, decided he  wanted to be a police officer, and continues to serve every day  protecting his family and our community.   And I want to thank all the law enforcement officers that, every day,  get up to keep us safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman has to recognize the  irony, how, despite 2 years of claiming that he wants open rules, the  Democrat rule package talking about regular order, and here we have a  closed rule for advancing these bills.   The gentleman talks about the most closed Congress was the 115th  Congress. I will wait and see if the gentleman's side in leading  Congress' score is better than the 115th Congress was. It would be  interesting to keep that scorecard.   In the past, I have supported bills like these, especially  appropriations bills for agriculture, transportation, housing, and  urban development.   On the whole, the agriculture bill has priorities that are critical  to my district, including the farm safety net, rural broadband, food  safety, and more. However, I can't support these bills because they are  offered in bad faith. It is a charade. Let's be honest. It is simply a  charade. It is not a serious attempt to fund agriculture or any other  priorities in my district or in this country.   It is, in fact, distract and delay in order to put pressure on, to  squeeze the American people to get what you want.   It is madness, I will agree with you. It is madnes where we are going  right now because 17,000 people with criminal convictions were stopped  at the United States southern border last year.    That doesn't count the ones we didn't catch because they came in in  other ways. Yet, somehow, we want to ignore that rather than worry  about our border security. Without borders, without secure borders, we  are not a country.   The President, the administration offered a package. My colleague on  the other side of the aisle, Mr. McGovern, I want him to see this  letter. I assure you, Mr. Speaker, you have it. It talks about the  priorities of the administration.   It talks about funding, yes, for a wall or barrier for 234 miles.  Only 234 miles, not the 2,000 miles suddenly people are talking about,  which is a top 10 priority of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in  order to funnel people crossing the border to entry points.   It talks about additional immigration judges. It provides funding for  additional border patrol. It provides funding for infrastructure at the  borders--many things the other side of the aisle was talking about. So  why is it, that rather than going to the White House, closing the door,  and not coming out until you come up with an answer, there is a press  conference being held in the Rayburn Reception Room where once more we  talk about, well, we are not doing anything.   If you want to reopen the government, go to the White House, close  the door, and don't come back here until we have a deal. A deal  requires all parties. These bills will not be taken up in the Senate.  The President said he will veto them.   Negotiation, I spent 35 years in private business, and negotiation  means you never get everything you want, but you walk away where all  parties say: We could have gotten a little more. But you solve the  problem rather than put people at risk.   We are putting people at risk in this country. People won't get paid  Friday. You are right. We are also putting the American people at risk  by not securing our border. We have kicked that can down the road my  entire time I have been here, 2 years now, and long before that.   One final point: We know that Democrats previously have supported  funding for border walls, border security, and a border fence. Call it  what you want.    Mr. Speaker, so why is it now we can't simply agree  that we need to do more to secure our border along the lines of this,  including 234 miles of wall, only because the President's name is on  it?   Come on, let's solve the problem. Let's be adults here.
