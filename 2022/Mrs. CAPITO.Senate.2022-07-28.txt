 Mr. President, I feel like the Senator from West  Virginia right now.   I am very glad that we are going to be passing these two recycling  bills.   I will just briefly say I am the cosponsor of the bipartisan  Recycling and Infrastructure Accessibility Act. Sometimes the simplest  things that we can do have such great impacts, and I think that is what  we are going to see here today.   In rural America, we don't have the accessibility to recycling and  the infrastructure that we need, and that is the point of my bill. It  helps us, obviously, protect our environment, supports jobs, and it  helps our municipalities and others be able to sustain these.   This is a pilot program that would give Federal support for recycling  infrastructure projects, such as transfer stations and dropoff  facilities. That is the difficulty; you can't have one in every small  town. You need to have a spoke-and-hub sort of system, and that is what  this is looking at.   I will speed it up here. I want to thank all the different  organizations and groups that have helped: The National Water Resources  Association, the Plastics Industry Association, the American Beverage  Association, our associated staffs, and particularly the chair of the  full committee. He has been just a champion here in working on the  recycling bills. He is the main sponsor of the Recycling Composting  Accountability Act, of which I am also a cosponsor.   These will fill great and important data gaps. These are recycling  bills that were reported out by voice votes so we have unanimous  consent by our committee. I am glad that our colleagues have agreed to  pass them.                                   S. 3742    So I will move on and say, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 357, S. 3742.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Thank you.    Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from  Maryland, Mr. Cardin, for his good, hard work with Senator Cramer on  the subcommittee. Senator Cardin and I share the Chesapeake Bay. He has  got a lot more of it than I do, but we have worked on those issues for  years together, and I think that shows his dedication not just to his  State but to the environment. So I appreciate all of his efforts.   I am very pleased to rise today in strong support of the bipartisan  Water Resources Development Act of 2022. This is the bill we are  considering today. We call it WRDA. Most of us know it as WRDA.   Congress authorizes water resource projects and sets national  policies for the Civil Works Program and for the U.S. Corps of  Engineers. The work of the Corps facilitates commerce throughout the  country and internationally. Projects along our inland waterways, which  are important in my State, and in our ports enable the movement of  cargo while also bolstering our supply chain. Their support and  partnership during this process were integral for us to reach a solid  agreement.   So, Mr. Chair, I would like to thank you and your staff, and I am  going to go through our staff list really quickly: Mary Frances Repko,  John Kane, Jordan Baugh, Mayely Boyce, Tyler Hofmann-Reardon, Milo  Goodell, and Janine Barr from your staff.   So thank you all very, very much.   Today proves, again, the ability of our EPW Committee to develop  bipartisan infrastructure legislation that addresses the needs of  Senators in the communities that we represent. Our colleagues submitted  more than 800 policy and project priorities to the committee. We worked  hard to thoughtfully incorporate a majority of their requests into this  legislation, and I think that shows with the vote we got in committee.   True to the Corps' tradition, the bill moves forward projects that  benefit local communities and the entire country.   We know that natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes can  strike at any time and have devastating consequences for our  communities. The Corps' work to protect the lives and livelihoods of  millions of Americans is furthered by congressional authorization of  flood and coastal storm risk management projects.   Since 2014, Congress has enacted WRDA every 2 years, and I am  thrilled that we are here again continuing that tradition. I again want  to thank Chairman Carper for his leadership and dedication to this  critical piece of legislation, as well as--and I think I already  mentioned them, but I will mention them again because Senator Cardin  and Senator Cramer have been  [[Page S3758]]  very integral as the subcommittee chairs.   Specifically, the WRDA bill authorizes 30 projects around the  country, including projects for navigation, flood and coastal storm  risk management, and ecosystem restoration. One such project is a  coastal storm risk management project along the eastern coast of Texas.  Think of all of the hurricanes and damage that we have heard over the  years that have come in on the eastern shore at Galveston and Houston.  This will help mitigate the impacts of future hurricanes and ensure  that critical port assets can continue to serve our country's shipping  and supply chain needs as we are moving forward.   The bill also directs the Corps to expedite the completion of 24  previously authorized projects, and it authorizes 36 studies that will  develop solutions to water resources challenges that we have ahead.   While this bill is very much oriented toward advancing critical  projects and studies in our States, it also includes several policy  changes that I would like to highlight. At the beginning of this  process, I outlined areas in which I believe changes would be  beneficial. I said we needed to reduce the confusion that some  communities experience when they are dealing with the Corps and ensure  more effective delivery of our projects--and efficient delivery. So the  bill bolsters the Agency's technical assistance authorities,  specifically the Floodplain Management Services and Planning Assistance  to States Program--again, one that impacts my State greatly.   This bill authorizes the Corps to conduct outreach to ensure that our  communities are knowledgeable of the ways in which the Agency can help  them with their water resources needs. It directs the Corps to  designate staff in each district that can do this outreach.   The bill makes important improvements to the Tribal Partnership  Program and other authorities to assist Indian Tribes. It also expands  existing programs and includes new authorities to assist communities  that are economically disadvantaged, including those located in rural  areas.   It requires reporting on timelines for the environmental review  process for projects. The bill directs the GAO to conduct a study: a  review of projects that are overbudgeted and delayed--find out what is  going on--as well as a review of the Corps' mitigation practices for  projects.   The bill includes several provisions that improve flexibility with  regard to financial accounting; for example, the bill allows Federal  Agencies to provide funding to help satisfy the non-Federal sponsor's  contribution for a project or study under certain circumstances. It  authorizes, for the first time, a dedicated research and development  account for the Corps to spur innovation and provides contracting  flexibility in undertaking these activities.   The bill directs the Corps to support science, technology,  engineering, and math--STEM--education and recruit individuals for  careers at this Agency. The input of non-Federal entities is crucial to  successfully resolving water resources challenges now and in the  future.   This bill establishes a new advisory committee for non-Federal  interests to voice their opinions on how the Corps can better meet  their needs.   We preserve the integral part of the non-Federal cost share partners  in the project delivery process by avoiding mandates from Washington,  DC, and ensuring that the Corps continues to evaluate a full array of  solutions during the feasibility study phase.   In addition to my role as a ranking member, I represent the great  State of West Virginia, and I worked to address the needs of my home  State. Here are just a few highlights before I close.   This legislation advances a critical flood control project of the  city of Milton, WV. Authorized in the 1990s, this project is longtime  coming, and I am proud to have helped move it forward.   The bill also supports flood control studies for the Kanawha River  Basin and the city of Huntington. And it continues to provide  environmental infrastructure assistance to communities throughout the  State.   Finally, the bill will provide additional critical support to  riverbank stabilizations such as those on the Kanawha River.   In closing, there is a lot in this bill--I could go on and on, but I  won't--for communities across the country. It is the culmination of a  true bipartisan agreement and represents our shared goal of addressing  the Nation's water resources needs.   I am very proud of our committee. I am very proud to be here today  with you. We are active; we are cooperative; and we are fruitful. We  get things done. I like that. It is a testament to the values and goals  that Chairman Carper and I share, and it is a testament to our personal  friendship and our working relationship. Thank you for that.   Before I close, I would like to thank my staff as well for all of  their hard work and dedication to seeing that we get this across the  finish line: Adam Tomlinson, Murphie Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend,  Katherine Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, and Haden Miller.   I would also like to thank the technical assistance that we received  from the U.S. Corps of Engineers staff: Amy Klein, Dave Wethington, and  countless other technical staff.   And, then, from Senate legislative counsel, we would like to thank  Deanna Edwards.   I look forward to a rousing vote here in a few minutes.
