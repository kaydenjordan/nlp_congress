 Mr. President, I am so proud to be here today to join my  colleagues to discuss the current Supreme Court vacancy and,  specifically, the excellent choice President Trump made in selecting  Amy Coney Barrett to fill that vacancy.   I, like my colleagues and many Americans, watched the Senate  Judiciary Committee hearings on Judge Barrett's nomination last week. I  also have had a chance to meet personally with the judge myself. During  all of these occasions, I have been extremely impressed with Judge Amy  Coney Barrett.   I was especially impressed with her depth of legal knowledge, coupled  with her demeanor. She very clearly and eloquently expresses herself.  She reiterated many times in the hearing that judges don't make the  law. She was levelheaded, open-minded, and firm in all of her  responses.   Judge Barrett is a model of professional and personal success. We  have all heard that she is a mother of seven, which, in and of itself,  is quite an achievement. And, if confirmed, she will be the first  mother of school-aged children to serve on the Supreme Court.   She is absolutely dedicated to her faith and to her community, and  she is held in very high regard by the many students she has taught and  mentored over the years.   You could certainly tell from the questioning of the Judiciary  Committee members during that hearing that she has been in the arena  many times with very inquisitive people and students.   In short, Judge Barrett is a stellar nominee who will show a new  generation--our daughters and our granddaughters--that anything is  possible in America.   I plan to vote to confirm Judge Barrett, and here is why. Evaluating  nominees for high government offices is an important responsibility for  this body of Senators. That is even true when the nominee is being  considered for a lifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court. So  I consider, really, three main questions when I am considering a  Supreme Court nominee.   First and foremost, is the nominee qualified?   Second, does the nominee have a track record of independence and  fairness that befits a judge who will apply our Constitution and laws  as written, rather than make policy from the bench?   And, third, do the West Virginians whom I represent believe the  nominee is well suited to decide cases that impact their constitutional  rights?   Based on her impressive resume, Judge Barrett is clearly qualified  for the Supreme Court. The nonpartisan American Bar Association rated  her ``well qualified.'' That is the ABA's highest ranking for judicial  nominees.   Judge Barrett's judicial philosophy and record on the Seventh Circuit  are those of a mainstream jurist who considers herself bound by the  law, not free to decide cases based on her own personal opinions. She  reiterated that time and again in the Judiciary Committee.   That is so important because some of my Democratic Senate colleagues  were seeking promises from her about how she will rule on certain cases  in the future, and they sought to examine her belief on policy matters,  such as protections for those with preexisting conditions.   I, for one, strongly support--as most of us do--legal protections to  make sure that individuals with preexisting conditions can purchase and  retain health insurance. Passing laws like those are what we should be  doing here in this body, not in the Supreme Court.   After some of my colleagues were not given the hints that they were  looking for on how Judge Barrett would rule on particular cases, they  resorted to assuming that they knew what she would do. Specifically,  they tried to tie Judge Barrett to those who had mentored her in the  past and insinuated that she would judge exactly how they would judge.  Well, when that happened, she responded:         I assure you, I have my own mind. . . . Everything that       he--    Meaning Scalia--       said is not necessarily what I would agree with or what I       would do if I were Justice Barrett.    It is clear that Judge Barrett has her own mind and will seek to be a  fair and impartial judge. The role of judges is to apply our  Constitution and laws as written to the cases before them and not  implement their own policy agendas. As Judge Barrett put it in her own  words, ``Judges can't just wake up one day and say: `I have an agenda .  . . [I] am going to walk in like a royal queen and impose my will on  the world.''   Instead, she explained that it is ``never appropriate for a judge to  impose the judge's personal convictions in determining the outcome of a  case.''   She also went on to say:         A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not       policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any       policy views they might hold.    Judge Barrett's success in applying the law is reflected in the fact  that over 90 percent of the majority opinions she has written were  unanimously agreed to by her colleagues on the Seventh Circuit. No  decision she has written has ever been overturned or reversed by the  Supreme Court. This record is only possible when a judge is deciding  cases fairly and in accord with the mainstream views of colleagues  appointed by both Republican and Democratic Presidents.   West Virginians want a Supreme Court Justice with experience and  integrity who will protect the Constitution and decide cases fairly.  West Virginians want a Supreme Court Justice who will serve as a role  model for our children and our grandchildren. That is  [[Page S6351]]  why I will be proud to vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the  U.S. Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.
