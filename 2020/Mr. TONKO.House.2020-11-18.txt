 Madam Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the 50th  anniversary of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.   For 50 years, NIAAA has been the leader in generating and  disseminating fundamental information about the effects of alcohol on  our health and well-being and applying that knowledge to improve the  lives of those struggling with alcohol-related problems.   In the United States alone, nearly 15 million people have an alcohol- use disorder. An estimated 88,000 people die from alcohol-related  causes annually, and alcohol misuse has immeasurable impacts on  families and communities across our Nation.   While NIAAA has made significant achievements toward improving public  health over the past 50 years, such as illuminating the negative  effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and supporting the development of  effective behavioral therapies and medications to treat alcohol use  disorder, more work is needed.   With technological advances and an expanding knowledge base, NIAAA is  poised to advance alcohol research to the next frontier toward the goal  of helping more Americans live healthier, more productive lives.                            ____________________
