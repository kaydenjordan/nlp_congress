 Mr. Speaker, we stand today in  honor and in awe of the many accomplishments of black women in America.  Despite seemingly insurmountable odds, black women have led iconic  movements that have come to define the standard of equality and  fairness throughout our society.   Every black woman stands on the shoulders of those who have paved the  way for the continued freedom we enjoy, drawing their inspiration from  the strength of our ancestors and our peers. The accomplishments of  black women are part of a storied legacy of achievement made all the  more meaningful by the challenges that we've had to overcome. As black  women, the heavy burden of both systemic racism and sexism are not new  realities, just circumstances that we have long worked to dismantle  through civil rights movements, equal pay rallies, and organized civic  engagement.   Black women and girls possess a unique understanding of the trials  and adversities unique to our own experiences. Black women have always  made do with less than their fair share, earning only 63 cents for  every dollar a white man makes for the same work. More than 80 percent  of black mothers are the breadwinners in their households, tasked with  raising our future generations with just scarcely enough to pay for  essentials while earning a fraction of what other segments of the  population earn.  [[Page H1694]]    Black women are also sorely underrepresented in one the fastest  growing and highest paying career fields in America--engineering. Black  women make up less than 1 percent of American engineers. Science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics are fields that black women  are being excluded from through cultural exclusion, lack of role  models, and pay inequities. STEM fields offer incredible opportunities  for the African American community, and we must do more to ensure that  we encourage more women of color to pursue these opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, America needs black women to fulfill the roles as  chemists, engineers, physicists, and engineers. Black women have and  continue to engineer solutions to many of the problems we face in the  21st Century. The coming age presents unique technological challenges  that must be met with unique perspectives capable of grand problem  solving. Supporting funding for STEM after school programs, workshops,  and boot camps is an investment in the future faces of computer  science, engineering, and the continued leadership of the black woman.  Historically, when the Black woman succeeds, our nation succeeds. This  year, let us do more for black women in America so that they can  continue to do more for our country.                            ____________________
