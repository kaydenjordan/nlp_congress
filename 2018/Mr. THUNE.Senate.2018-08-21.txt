 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.    Mr. President, when it comes to deciding whether to  confirm a Supreme Court Justice, there are two important questions:  One, is this person well qualified? And, two, does this person  understand the proper role of a judge?   When it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, the answer to both questions is  yes. I don't need to tell anyone how qualified Judge Kavanaugh is. He  is a graduate of Yale Law School and a lecturer at Harvard Law School.  He has extensive legal experience in government and private practice,  and he has spent the past 12 years serving on the Court of Appeals for  the DC Circuit, sometimes referred to as the second highest court in  the land.   His opinions have been endorsed by the Supreme Court more than a  dozen times, and they are regularly cited by courts around the country.  In short, he is eminently qualified to be a Justice on the Supreme  Court.   But being qualified, while essential, is not sufficient. A Supreme  Court Justice also needs to understand the proper role of a judge, and  that role is to interpret the law, not make the law; to judge, not  legislate; to call balls and strikes, not rewrite the rules of the  game.   Judge Kavanaugh understands this. He understands that as a Supreme  Court Justice, his job will be to rule based on the facts of the case,  the law and the Constitution, and nothing else, not his personal  opinions, not his political feelings, not his beliefs about what the  law should be--just the plain text of the law and the Constitution. And  that makes Judge Kavanaugh exactly the kind of judge that all of us,  Democrats and Republicans alike, should want on the Supreme Court--the  kind of judge who, in the words of Judge Kavanaugh, will decide cases  ``without regard to policy preferences or political allegiances or  which party is on which side in a particular case.''   Of course, that is not the kind of Justice Democrats are looking for.  They don't really want an impartial Justice. They want a Justice they  can rely on to rubberstamp Democratic policies. So even before  President Trump had named a replacement for Justice Kennedy, Democrats  were already signaling their intention of rejecting anyone the  President put forward. One Democrat Senator formally announced his  opposition to the President's nominee the morning of July 9, before the  President had actually nominated anyone.   Since Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, Democrats have tried to make a  case against Judge Kavanaugh, flinging up accusations in the desperate  hope that something will stick. Needless to say, they haven't had much  luck. It is difficult to argue that a judge like Judge Kavanaugh isn't  eminently suited to serve on the Supreme Court.   Democrats are also doing their best to delay the proceedings by  making outlandish demands for documents relating to Judge Kavanaugh's  time in the White House. Apparently the up to 1 million pages that the  Judiciary Committee expects to receive from Judge Kavanaugh's time in  the executive branch and his circuit court confirmation aren't enough,  even though it could be more than the amount of material received for  the last five Supreme Court nominees combined. Let me repeat that. One  million pages that the Judiciary Committee expects to receive from  Judge Kavanaugh's time in the executive branch and his circuit court  confirmation are more than the amount of material received for the last  five Supreme Court nominees combined.   One also has to ask why Democratic leaders feel the need to see any  material for Judge Kavanaugh, given the fact that they have already  made up their minds to oppose him.   Of course, it is not about the material. We all know that. Democrats  aren't really interested in reading every email that happened to be  copied to Judge Kavanaugh. They just want to delay his nomination.   It would be nice if Democrats would abandon their partisan opposition  to Judge Kavanaugh and take a serious look at this superbly qualified  nominee. Unfortunately, I expect the political posturing to continue,  but we will continue to move forward with the confirmation process to  deliver another outstanding Justice to the Supreme Court.                               Economic Growth    Mr. President, the good economic news continues to pour in. The  economy grew at an impressive 4.1 percent in the second quarter of this  year, bringing economic growth for the year so far up over 3 percent.  Unemployment dropped to 3.9 percent in July, which is close to an 18- year low. Worker pay and benefits are increasing at the fastest pace in  a decade. Consumer confidence is at a nearly 18-year high. Disposable  income, which is income after taxes, is up 3.5 percent this year. And  small business optimism is at a record high.   In short, Republican economic policies are working, and I don't need  to tell anyone that economic growth lagged during the Obama  administration. Recovery from the recession was historically weak, and  some economists were predicting that 2 percent growth would be the new  normal.   But Republicans disagreed. We didn't think American workers should  have to resign themselves to permanently sluggish economic growth and  the diminished opportunities that come with it. We knew that American  innovators and job creators were as creative and driven as ever, but we  also knew that American businesses, large and small, were weighed down  by burdensome regulations and an outdated tax code that discouraged  growth. So over the past year and a half, the White House and  Republicans in Congress have focused on removing obstacles to economic  growth. We have reduced burdensome regulations, and in December, we  passed historic, comprehensive tax reform legislation.   Before that bill passed, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed, the  Tax Code was not helping businesses grow and create jobs. In fact, it  was doing the opposite, and that had real consequences for American  workers.   A small business owner struggling to afford the hefty annual tax bill  for her business was highly unlikely to be able to hire a new worker or  to raise wages. A larger business struggling to stay competitive in the  global marketplace while paying a substantially higher tax rate than  its foreign competitors too often had limited funds to expand or  increase investment in the United States.   So we took action to improve the playing field for American workers  by improving the playing field for businesses as well. We lowered tax  rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses,  farms, and ranches. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate  which, until January 1, was the highest corporate  [[Page S5746]]  tax rate in the developed world. We expanded business owners' ability  to recover investments they make in their businesses, which frees up  cash that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers. And  we brought the U.S. international tax system into the 21st century so  that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to  their foreign competitors.   Now we are seeing the results: stronger economic growth, as I  mentioned--4.1 percent in the second quarter of this year, giving us an  annual growth rate of over 3 percent. That is something we haven't seen  in quite a while. Low unemployment--we are seeing the lowest  unemployment numbers, literally, in the last 18 years. The number of  jobless claims is the lowest in 40 years. There are better wages and  benefits. We are seeing companies large and small across this country  increasing wages and the benefits they pay to their employees. Wages,  as I mentioned earlier, are up--the highest level increase in wages in  a decade. And, as I said earlier, disposable income is up 3.5 percent  since the first of this year. All of this has happened since tax reform  passed last year. One and a half million new jobs have been created  since the passage of tax reform, and that means more opportunities for  American workers.   I am proud of the progress we have made in getting the economy going  again, and I am going to go keep working with my colleagues, hopefully  on both sides of the aisle, to expand economic opportunities for  Americans even further.   I yield the floor.
