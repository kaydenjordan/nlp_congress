 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Michael Welsh of the University of Iowa College of Medicine.   Dr. Welsh recently won the 2022 Shaw Prize in Life Science and  Medicine for his discoveries of defects causing cystic fibrosis and his  development of medicines that reverse those defects.   Dr. Welsh has spent the past 40 years of his career researching  cystic fibrosis and looking for solutions at the University of Iowa.  The Shaw Prize is awarded to those whose discoveries in biomedical  sciences have created solutions to illness and suffering.   This is a remarkable achievement, and Dr. Welsh's research and  discoveries should be highlighted. I am excited to see where his  research takes him and those he inspires and mentors, and how the  University of Iowa will contribute to the cure of cystic fibrosis.            Recognizing Regina Catholic High School Softball Team     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of Regina Catholic High School's softball team.   Last weekend, the Regals concluded the State softball tournament  hosted in Fort Dodge and won the 2A State championship title. This  victory marks Regina Catholic High School's fourth 2A State  championship in 11 years.   Despite a difficult first inning, the Regals were able to come  together, work as a team, and finish with a 6-4 victory over Wilton  Jr.-Sr. High School.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate both teams, as both teams are in my  district. How outstanding that two of my district's teams would be in  the State championship softball tournament. They put on a spectacular  championship game, showing the talent that our district has at the  State level.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to cheering on both teams next year as  they compete for another State title.                                 Celebrations     Madam Speaker, I wish a happy birthday to Steve  Schleffer.   I wish a happy 43rd anniversary to Mary and Kirk Ferentz on August  11. Happy anniversary, Mary and Kirk.   On August 13, Kurt and Cathy Haller will celebrate their 39th wedding  anniversary. Happy anniversary, Kurt and Cathy.   I wish a happy birthday to Blake Dickerson.   And I wish a happy birthday to William Ahlquist.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Carter) for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4551, the RANSOMWARE Act. This  important legislation will help protect consumers and businesses from  ransomware and cyberattacks.   Almost every day, there are reports of foreign bad actors using  ransomware to attack companies, hospital systems, law enforcement  agencies, schools, and municipalities.   Last year, the largest meat processing company in the world, JBS,  which has a meat processing plant in my district, was hacked by a  Russian-led cybercriminal organization. These hackers threatened to  delete the company's internal files unless a ransom was paid. JBS was  forced to halt processing operations at over a dozen plants, causing  the price of meat to rise and impacting economies across the globe.   We have also seen this in our municipalities and schools in Iowa,  prompting us in the State legislature to enact legislation addressing  ransomware attacks.   This particular legislation will help avoid attacks like these by  focusing resources to better understand the threat posed by attacks  from our foreign adversaries in China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
