 Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk  about the threat posed by China.   On February 4, our Air Force shot down a Chinese spy balloon. They  did it over the coast of South Carolina. The balloon had spied upon the  United States for up to a week. One of the places that it monitored and  hovered over was my home State of Wyoming.   Now, Joe Biden did absolutely nothing until the balloon had already  crossed thousands of miles of the United States. To me, this is another  national failure from a President who already brought us surrender in  Afghanistan.   People in Montana could see the balloon from the ground. That is the  way America found out about it. It wasn't from the administration. It  wasn't from the military. It was from a reporter on the ground with a  telephoto lens. The man took a picture from his driveway.   I am not convinced that Joe Biden would have done anything if that  photographer in Montana hadn't published those pictures online.   It is hard to imagine any other President letting a spy balloon fly  over our country for nearly a week. Imagine John F. Kennedy allowing a  Soviet spy plane over the United States. To me, it is unimaginable. No  President, Republican or Democrat, would tolerate this, until Joe  Biden.   On Thursday, the Senate received a classified briefing on the spy  balloon. I am not alone when I say I was disturbed and disquieted about  what we learned. To me, Joe Biden did too little, too late, and then he  did what he always does. He bragged about it. He said he had done  everything right. To quote him, he said:         We did the right thing.    No, Joe Biden did the weak thing, as usual. He had to be shamed into  shooting down the balloon--way too late.   On Thursday, Joe Biden defended himself again. He said the balloon  was ``not a major breach''--``not a major breach.'' It reminds me when  Joe Biden signaled he would let Vladimir Putin make a minor incursion  into Ukraine. President Biden is defending the indefensible.   Just days after the balloon incident, he gave his annual State of the  Union address. We were there. There were a number of bizarre moments in  the President's speech, and one of the most bizarre to me was when he  talked about China.   He said no world leader would want to be Xi Jinping--no world leader  would want to be Xi Jinping. He actually yelled it several times.  [[Page S415]]    What was he trying to say? Does he still think that China is not a  threat?   Communist China is our No. 1 geopolitical threat. They are our rival.  They have the second largest economy in the world. They have over 2  million active military personnel. They have the largest navy in the  world, and China plans to build more than 100 new ships, 300 new  missile silos, and hundreds of nuclear missiles by the end of this  decade.   China is working day and night to get stronger. China is working to  challenge the United States as the world's superpower.   And Joe Biden seems to be doing the opposite. He is making our own  country weaker and poorer and less prepared.   China isn't the one opening the border to the whole world to come in.  China isn't the one spending themselves into bankruptcy. China isn't  the one shutting down their energy production. It is Joe Biden who is  doing those things--a President who is soft on China.   Now, he has been soft on China his entire career. When he was in the  Senate, he helped China join the World Trade Organization. He helped  China pay low tariffs under Bill Clinton. This helped China flood our  country with cheap, poorly made consumer goods.   By the time Joe Biden was Vice President, the threat from China was  obvious, but he was still soft on China.   When he was Vice President, Joe Biden said ``The growth of China is  overwhelmingly in our interest.'' That was Joe Biden as Vice President.   He should tell that to the factory workers who lost their jobs all  across America. He should tell that to the families who have buried  their children because of Chinese fentanyl.   When he was running for President, Joe Biden repeatedly downplayed  any threat from China. He said of China, in his announcement to run for  President, he said China is ``not bad, folks.''   Now, he should tell that to the 1 million Uighurs who are living as  slaves and forced to work in the west of China.   As a candidate, Joe Biden said China is ``not competition for us.''   Well, I have got news for Joe Biden. China's economy has grown 12- fold in the last 20 years. China now has more missile launchers than we  do. It is painfully obvious that China is trying to compete with us.  Joe Biden is the only one who doesn't get it.   On Friday, former Senator Max Baucus, who I served with, from  Montana, revealed that China wanted Joe Biden to be President.   Now, Senator Baucus was a Member of this body, and then he was tapped  to be President Obama's Ambassador to China. So Senator Baucus knows a  lot about China, knows a number of Chinese officials. And on Friday, he  admitted Chinese officials told him that China wanted Joe Biden to be  elected President.   Of course they did. In recent weeks, we found out that Joe Biden kept  classified information at his home and in his private office.   So where was this private office? Well, the office was at something  called the Penn Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The  university paid Joe Biden nearly $1 million to do virtually nothing.  Joe Biden says he was a professor yet never taught a single class. And  he left classified documents at the Penn Biden Center.   Now, reportedly, these documents were related to Iran and Ukraine. I  haven't seen the documents, but those are the reports.   And what is the relationship with China and this center? Well,  Chinese donors gave $61 million to the university between 2017 and  2020.   Both the House and the Senate need to investigate whether these  donations were legal, and we need to know if Chinese money is  influencing the Biden administration's policies.   On Thursday, I came to the floor and spoke about how Joe Biden's  energy policies are helping China. Later that day, we found out yet  another connection between Joe Biden's energy policies and China. We  found out that the White House and the Secretary of Energy met with an  environmental group with ties to China.   The group is, interestingly, called the Rocky Mountain Institute, and  the group was paid by the Chinese Government to study green energy.   Now Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wants their advice too.   Enough is enough. It is time to act with strength against China. The  sanctions that the administration announced are just a slap on the  wrist.   The House passed a resolution condemning China for violating our  airspace. The vote was unanimous. Every Republican voted for it and  every Democrat voted for it. Why aren't we taking it up here in the  Senate?   There is a whole host of legislation we need to pass here in the  Senate to stand up to China.   I have introduced legislation to ban administration officials from  going to work for China.   The top lawyer today--the top lawyer today in our intelligence  community used to work for China. Before that, he worked in the Obama  White House. Revolving door--Democrat administration, China, Democrat  administration.   He worked for the Obama White House. He worked for Huawei--of course,  we know Huawei is a telecommunications company controlled by the  Chinese Government. Now he is one of the top lawyers on the payroll of  Joe Biden.   There is much more that needs to be done in relation to China. China  is going to try to spy on us again. China is going to keep challenging  us. It is time for us to stand up to the challenge.   Now, what happened with this spy balloon can never be allowed to  happen again. America cannot afford Joe Biden's policies of weakness.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
