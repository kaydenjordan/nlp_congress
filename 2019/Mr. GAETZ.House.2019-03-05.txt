 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to remember my good  friend and our late colleague Representative Walter Jones.   Walter Jones was someone who deeply cared about this institution and  the constitutional principles that undergird our service. He was a  respected member of the Armed Services Committee, where he was a  passionate advocate for military families and against endless,  senseless wars that seem, too often, to have a small percentage of  Americans bear a disproportionate burden for the decisions that are  made by this body and others.   Walter was a deeply caring individual. He was an encourager. When he  saw Members on the floor, regardless of your seniority or your status  within the institution, he referred to everyone as ``chairman.'' He  thought that was a distinction that should be shared and one he used to  revere those with whom he served in this body.   He had friends on the right, on the left, and in the middle, because  Walter treated everyone with respect and was the ultimate southern  gentleman.   I will miss his friendship, his guidance, his mentorship, and this  institution and this country will miss the principle with which Walter  Jones served our great Nation.                            ____________________
