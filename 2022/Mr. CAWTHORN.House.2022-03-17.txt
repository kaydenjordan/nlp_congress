 Madam Speaker, when American projects weakness on the  international stage, everyday Americans suffer. We know this. We are  told this daily. But many everyday Americans feel that geopolitics is  far removed from their lives.   So, let's answer the question: What does it cost for America to be  weak on the world stage?   This cost is manifested at the pumps every day with 42 percent higher  prices. It is shown as food prices soar. Meat, poultry, and eggs are  all up over 10 percent.   Our weakness abroad produces hardships at home. If we lose our role  as the world reserve currency, your buying power, your savings, and  your property value could all sink to historic lows.   The preeminence of American currency has dominated the global  landscape for decades, providing stability as the international bedrock  of financial transactions and arrangements.   We are the world's reserve currency. We are the standard. But that  great financial heritage is slipping away. Our children may soon call  the world reserve currency by another name. Perhaps they will know it  as the yuan.   The geopolitical ramifications of devalued and discarded American  currency would not only signal a shift in financial confidence in the  United States; it would dissolve our standing among global superpowers.   We are witnessing the death rattle of Pax Americana, meaning the era  of American peace we have enjoyed in the world for decades.   America could lose a war with China without a single shot ever being  fired if our dollar continues to be perpetually devalued.   Permanent Washington decisionmakers, most of whom are over 30 to 50  years my senior, have clearly either not taken the time to sit and  consider the cost of or, worse, simply ignored how hyperinflation is  rotting the superiority of our Nation's currency and dragging with it  young families, blue-collar workers, and the great American middle  class.   American strength and leadership have been the driving force of peace  for the last half century. Nations unified behind the stability of the  U.S. dollar, in large part because we backed our greenbacks with gold-- substance, not fluff. We were the manufacturers of the world. The shift  from a gold standard to a fiat currency began to starve America's  financial preeminence. You cannot inflate gold, but you can print money  out of thin air. When a currency is built on nothing but paper, it  literally grows on trees. With this dramatic shift, America's leverage  on the world stage began to slip away.    There can be no globalism when America refuses to relinquish its  position as the preeminent currency. Countries also think twice before  incurring the wrath of the United States when their own financial  stability is tied to the endurance of our monetary system.   But, instead, our inflated, hollow monetary systems have given way to  fantastical foreign policy. We have surrendered our financial security  as the superpowers of the world wait eagerly in the wings. Our collapse  signals their emergence.   Saudi Arabia, which has exclusively sold its oil using U.S. dollars,  is now considering selling oil for the Chinese yuan. The Chinese  Communist Party has been posturing for years to topple the dollar with  their tender.   When the U.S. dollar falls, America will no longer remain dominant on  the world stage, and peace will end. It is already happening. Vladimir  Putin has illegally and immorally invaded Ukraine. The world is coming  unraveled as our tender's resiliency plummets.   But I am sure you are asking yourself at home: Does this have to  happen? In short, the answer is no. We can reclaim the mantle of  financial excellence we once held. We can become the leader of the  world again without having to expend the lives of young Americans.   Stooping to military interventionism is the goal of the war hawks  here in Congress who are bought and paid for by those who stand to  profit from forever wars.   If we are wise and shrewd, we can avoid ever needing to put boots on  the ground to ensure peace. We can do this by dominating the world's  economy.   To bring peace without bloodshed is actually quite simple. The key is  to immediately reduce gas prices and energy prices by drilling the hell  out of the Permian Basin and by granting every lease and incentivizing  all necessary infrastructure atop the Bakken shale.   Furthermore, we should aggressively onshore manufacturing back to  America, dominate the world market on precious minerals, and stop  shipping our jobs overseas.   A strong American economy creates a strong U.S. currency. When  America sits atop the world, peace will continue. Tyrants of the world,  like Putin and Xi Jinping, will fear us when the only way to buy and  sell energy is by using the U.S. dollar.   It is our solemn responsibility to pass a peaceful and prosperous  nation on to the next generation. We are the leaders of the world. It  is time we start acting like it.   Drill, baby, drill. America first now, and America first forever.                            ____________________
