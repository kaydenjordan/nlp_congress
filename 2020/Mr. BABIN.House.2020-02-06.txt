 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to  honor the life and legacy of Liberty County Sheriff's Deputy Richard  Whitten, who succumbed to complications of a gunshot wound.   On May 29, 2019, Deputy Whitten was off duty when he heard a ``shots  fired'' call over the dispatch. Responding without hesitation, he drove  to the scene. After a brief pursuit, Deputy Whitten was shot in the  neck by the murder suspect, paralyzing him instantly.   After visiting with him and his wife, Kami, in the hospital last  July, he told me that he would do it all over again to protect his  community and his citizens.   On February 3, 2020, Deputy Whitten suffered a complication while  undergoing physical therapy and passed away. He served with the Liberty  County Sheriff's Office for 4 years, and he will be greatly missed.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank a real hero, Deputy Richard  Whitten, for his faithful service.   Thank you.                            ____________________
