 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support this resolution to intervene  against the egregious Texas v. United States lawsuit that seeks to end  the Affordable Care Act, or, as I like to call it, the Civil Rights Act  of the 21st Century.   In a few days, we are going to be celebrating the birthday of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., who once said: ``Of all the forms of  inequality, injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and  inhumane.''   Since the ACA was enacted, significant progress has been made to  lessen the inequality in our healthcare delivery system. To dismantle  those lifesaving protections now is unfounded and unjust.   It is unjust to deny those with preexisting conditions access to  healthcare. It is unjust to cut off insurance coverage to a child with  cancer because she has reached her maximum lifetime benefits. It is  unjust to charge women more than we charge men for healthcare simply  because of their gender. It is unjust to increase the cost of seniors'  medications by reopening the gap known as the donut hole in their  Medicare prescription drug coverage.                                time  1615    It is unjust to tell young people just starting out in life that they  can no  [[Page H345]]  longer remain on their parents' insurance policies.   It is unjust to reinstitute charges for preventative healthcare,  costing more money in the long run when illnesses go undetected for too  long.   It is unjust to ask the working poor not eligible for Medicaid to  purchase private insurance at the market rate when they are struggling  to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads.   Access to quality healthcare ought not only be for those who can  afford it; it ought to be for those who need it. It is unfortunate for  us to deny healthcare to people just because they were born unhealthy.   A vote against this resolution is a vote against providing the basic  human right to fair and equitable access to quality, affordable  healthcare for all Americans.
