 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5053) to exempt juveniles from the requirements for suits by  prisoners, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5053         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Juveniles Act''.       SEC. 2. EXEMPTION OF JUVENILES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FOR                     SUITS BY PRISONERS.         Section 7 of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons       Act (42 U.S.C. 1997e) is amended--        (1) in subsection (h), by striking ``sentenced for, or       adjudicated delinquent for,'' and inserting ``or sentenced       for''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(i) Exemption of Juvenile Prisoners.--This section shall       not apply to an action pending on the date of enactment of       the Justice for Juveniles Act or filed on or after such date       if such action is--        ``(1) brought by a prisoner who has not attained 22 years       of age; or        ``(2) brought by any prisoner with respect to a prison       condition that occurred before the prisoner attained 22 years       of age.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5053, the Justice for  Juveniles Act. This bipartisan bill, which I introduced along with my  colleagues Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Reschenthaler, and Mr. Jeffries, would  eliminate the administrative exhaustion requirement for incarcerated  youth before they may file a lawsuit challenging the conditions of  their incarceration.   By passing this bill today, the House will advance a measure to  correct a manifest wrong currently present in Federal law and continue  bipartisan efforts to support incarcerated youth.   This bill recognizes the same conclusion that has been embraced by  the Supreme Court and experts for decades--that incarcerated young  people have different cognitive abilities than adults, that they are  less mature, and that they have a higher chance of being assaulted  while incarcerated.   In recent years, our Nation has finally come to the realization that  youth and adults have fundamentally different decisionmaking abilities.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly cited adolescents' lack of maturity as  a reason why they are not as culpable as adults for their actions or  able to recognize either certain consequences or dangers. Yet, in  current law, there are no allowances for these differences in cognitive  abilities when it comes to addressing deficiencies in conditions of  confinement.   Pursuing claims under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which  requires an understanding of detailed grievance procedures and  timelines, is nearly impossible for incarcerated youth, particularly  when courts have been exacting in their requirements that the  exhaustion requirements be followed, no matter how sympathetic the  situation.   Understanding the grievance process is made even more challenging by  the educational deficits faced by a substantial number of incarcerated  juveniles. According to one study, among incarcerated youth, 85 percent  are functionally illiterate, and the baseline reading levels vary from  grade 1 to grade 6. In addition, approximately 70 percent of  incarcerated juveniles have at least one learning disability. Youth  are, furthermore, less likely than adults to recognize as risks the  circumstances they face in a correctional facility.   Compounding these challenges, incarcerated youth, as a group,  experience extraordinarily high rates of mental illness. Nearly 50  percent of incarcerated 16- to 18-year-olds suffer from a mental  illness. Juveniles housed with adults are 10 times more likely to have  psychotic episodes and have a suicide rate that is 7.7 times higher  than those housed in juvenile facilities.   In recent years, the public has become more aware of the many dangers  that lurk in correctional facilities. Hurricanes have flooded  facilities; cold snaps have left prisoners freezing to death; and heat  waves have killed prisoners when they lack proper ventilation or air- conditioning.   Of course, the 2019 expose by The Philadelphia Inquirer exposed a  longstanding pattern of abuse of adolescents committed to the Glen  Mills School, which was thereafter closed.   Incarceration or detention poses a special danger to youth who often  don't have the ability to experience or recognize that they are in  immediate danger. Adolescents incarcerated with adults are also more  prone to both physical and mental abuse. Youth are 50 percent more  likely to be physically assaulted when they are housed in adult  facilities than in juvenile facilities.   Taken together, incarcerated youth are simply not able to recognize  or to effectively communicate when their prison conditions become  dangerous or unconstitutionally deficient. There remains little doubt  that the current process needs to be changed.   That is why this bill proposes a modest reform to the Prison  Litigation Reform Act. It simply exempts youth in correctional  facilities from having to comply with technical grievance procedures  before they can go to court to challenge the unconstitutional  conditions of their confinement.   While I would like to see us do much, much more, this bill is a  necessary first step, which I ask that my colleagues support today.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Mr. Armstrong for his help in moving this bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is supported by a bipartisan coalition  of groups, including, #cut50, the Campaign for Youth Justice, the  Juvenile Law Center, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association,  and R Street Institute. These organizations, as well as health and  legal experts, acknowledge that simplifying the legal process and  making it less complex is consistent with the developmental needs of  adolescents.   Therefore, H.R. 5053 was developed as a bipartisan bill to protect  young people from abuse in institutions by exempting them from the  administrative grievance requirements that stand in the way of their  getting relief from abusive practices.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1418) to restore the application of the Federal antitrust  laws to the business of health insurance to protect competition and  consumers, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1418         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Competitive Health Insurance       Reform Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. RESTORING THE APPLICATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS TO THE                     BUSINESS OF HEALTH INSURANCE.         (a) Amendment to McCarran-Ferguson Act.--Section 3 of the       Act of March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1013), commonly known as the       McCarran-Ferguson Act, is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(c)(1) Nothing contained in this Act shall modify,       impair, or supersede the operation of any of the antitrust       laws with respect to the business of health insurance       (including the business of dental insurance and limited-scope       dental benefits).        ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to making       a contract, or engaging in a combination or conspiracy--        ``(A) to collect, compile, or disseminate historical loss       data;        ``(B) to determine a loss development factor applicable to       historical loss data;        ``(C) to perform actuarial services if such contract,       combination, or conspiracy does not involve a restraint of       trade; or        ``(D) to develop or disseminate a standard insurance policy       form (including a standard addendum to an insurance policy       form and standard terminology in an insurance policy form) if       such contract, combination, or conspiracy is not to adhere to       such standard form or require adherence to such standard       form.        ``(3) For purposes of this subsection--        ``(A) the term `antitrust laws' has the meaning given it in       subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act (15       U.S.C. 12), except that such term includes section 5 of the       Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent       that such section 5 applies to unfair methods of competition;        ``(B) the term `business of health insurance (including the       business of dental insurance and limited-scope dental       benefits)' does not include--        ``(i) the business of life insurance (including annuities);       or        ``(ii) the business of property or casualty insurance,       including but not limited to--        ``(I) any insurance or benefits defined as `excepted       benefits' under paragraph (1), subparagraph (B) or (C) of       paragraph (2), or  [[Page H4572]]       paragraph (3) of section 9832(c) of the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9832(c)) whether offered separately or in       combination with insurance or benefits described in paragraph       (2)(A) of such section; and        ``(II) any other line of insurance that is classified as       property or casualty insurance under State law;        ``(C) the term `historical loss data' means information       respecting claims paid, or reserves held for claims reported,       by any person engaged in the business of insurance; and        ``(D) the term `loss development factor' means an       adjustment to be made to reserves held for losses incurred       for claims reported by any person engaged in the business of       insurance, for the purpose of bringing such reserves to an       ultimate paid basis.''.        (b) Related Provision.--For purposes of section 5 of the       Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent       such section applies to unfair methods of competition,       section 3(c) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act shall apply with       respect to the business of health insurance without regard to       whether such business is carried on for profit,       notwithstanding the definition of ``Corporation'' contained       in section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1418, the Competitive  Health Insurance Reform Act.   This commonsense legislation repeals a longstanding antitrust  exemption for the health insurance industry under the McCarran-Ferguson  Act. It does so for price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation-- the most egregious kinds of anticompetitive conduct. There is  absolutely no justification for this broad antitrust exemption for the  business of health insurance.   Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in response to a 1944  Supreme Court decision finding that the antitrust laws applied to the  business of insurance. Both insurance companies and the States  expressed concern about that decision. Insurance companies worried that  it could jeopardize certain collective practices, like joint rate- setting and the pooling of historical data, and the States were  concerned about losing their authority to regulate and tax the business  of insurance.   To address these issues, McCarran-Ferguson provides that Federal  antitrust laws apply to the business of insurance only to the extent  that it is not regulated by State law. Unfortunately, this resulted in  a broad antitrust exemption. Industry and State revenue concerns,  rather than the vital goals of protecting competition and consumers,  were the primary drivers of the act.   In passing McCarran-Ferguson, Congress initially intended to provide  only a temporary exemption and, unfortunately, gave little  consideration to competition concerns.   Not surprisingly, there is broad support for ending this safe harbor  for antitrust violations that are criminally illegal. As the Antitrust  Modernization Commission Report noted in 2007, the McCarran-Ferguson  exemption should be repealed because it has outlived any utility it may  have had and is among the most ill-conceived and egregious examples.   Furthermore, it is far from clear that the McCarran-Ferguson  antitrust exemption was ever justified in the first place. Antitrust  exemption should be exceedingly rare and should be enacted only where  there are strong policy reasons for such exemption.   Carving out an entire part of a healthcare system from the antitrust  laws should be unthinkable, particularly when healthcare costs are so  high for many families. That is why it is time to repeal the special  exemption for the insurance industry.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chairman DeFazio, for his  leadership on this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, which previously passed the House with an  overwhelming bipartisan vote of 416-7, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Healthy competition in health insurance markets is one of the most  critical elements for ensuring that Americans have access to high- quality, affordable healthcare. When insurance companies are forced to  compete, the American people win.   Unfortunately, too many families are still paying higher premiums and  out-of-pocket costs, in part, because of anticompetitive practices that  health insurance giants are allowed to engage in under existing law.   What is more, there is a statutory loophole for this conduct that  allows insurers to engage in egregious actions like price-fixing, bid- rigging, and market allocation with total impunity so long as they are  engaged in the business of insurance and it is regulated by a State.   There should be no safe harbor whatsoever for this conduct which  allows insurers to increase the cost of health insurance and impose  additional burdens on families across our Nation when they are already  struggling to make ends meet.   Health insurance companies should be subject to antitrust liability  to the extent that they collude or otherwise engage in anticompetitive  behavior. H.R. 1418 would achieve this result.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for his leadership on this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation  that is long overdue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 227) to direct the Attorney General to review, revise, and  develop law enforcement and justice protocols appropriate to address  missing and murdered Indians, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(a) Grant Authority.--Section 2101(b) of the Omnibus Crime       Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10461(b)) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(23) To develop, strengthen, and implement policies,       protocols, and training for law enforcement regarding cases       of missing or murdered Indians, as described in section 5 of       Savanna's Act.        ``(24) To compile and annually report data to the Attorney       General related to missing or murdered Indians, as described       in section 6 of Savanna's Act.''.        (b) Grants to Indian Tribal Governments.--Section 2015 of       the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34       U.S.C. 10452(a)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (9), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (10), by striking the period at the end       and inserting a semicolon; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(11) develop, strengthen, and implement policies,       protocols, and training for law enforcement regarding cases       of missing or murdered Indians, as described in section 5 of       Savanna's Act; and        ``(12) compile and annually report data to the Attorney       General related to missing or murdered Indians, as described       in section 6 of Savanna's Act.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 227, Savanna's Act, responds to the epidemic of  missing and murdered Native Americans. This crisis is appalling and  threatens millions of innocent people living both on Tribal lands and  beyond.   This bill is a bipartisan effort introduced by Alaska Senator Lisa  Murkowski and passed by the Senate by unanimous consent last March.                                time  1345    I want to especially commend the leadership of Representative Norma  Torres, who introduced the House companion in 2019 and has been a  constant champion for Savanna's Act here in the House.   The available data indicates that violence against Native Americans  is particularly high. In some Tribal communities, Native American women  experience murder rates that are more than 10 times the national  average. This is unacceptable.   Savanna's Act is named in honor of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a  member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who vanished from her apartment in  Fargo, North Dakota, while 8 months pregnant. Eight days after she  disappeared, her body was found wrapped in plastic in the Red River.   This legislation empowers Tribal governments with the resources and  information necessary to respond to cases of missing or murdered Native  Americans like Savanna and to increase the collection of data in such  cases. It also increases coordination and communication among the  Federal, State, and Tribal officials responsible for investing these  cases in a variety of ways.   This legislation provides best practices in conducting searches for  missing persons on and off Native American land; establishes standards  on the collection, reporting, and analysis of data and information on  missing persons and unidentified human remains; and will lead to the  culturally appropriate identification and handling of human remains  identified as Native Americans.   Savanna's Act provides guidance on which law enforcement agency is  responsible for inputting information into databases, guidance on  improving agency response rates and followup to cases of missing and  murdered Native Americans, and guidance on ensuring access to  culturally appropriate victim services.   Lastly and most importantly, Savanna's Act adds two new purpose areas  to two existing grant programs administered by the Justice Department,  specifically, allowing grantees to use funds to implement policies,  protocols, and training for law enforcement regarding cases of missing  or murdered Native Americans, and to compile and report data to the  Attorney General.   In short, this important legislation will help address the alarming  cases of missing and murdered Native Americans in a robust and  effective way. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Savanna's Act is an important measure to ensure the  safety of Native American women and men in communities across the  United States, for all of the reasons discussed here today.   We are so grateful to Representative Torres, Representative Newhouse,  Representative Armstrong, and Representative Haaland, for moving this  legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5546) to regulate monitoring of electronic communications  between an incarcerated person in a Bureau of Prisons facility and that  person's attorney or other legal representative, and for other  purposes.  [[Page H4577]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN AN INCARCERATED                     PERSON AND THE PERSON'S ATTORNEY.         (a) Prohibition on Monitoring.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney       General shall create a program or system, or modify any       program or system that exists on the date of enactment of       this Act, through which an incarcerated person sends or       receives an electronic communication, to exclude from       monitoring the contents of any privileged electronic       communication. In the case that the Attorney General creates       a program or system in accordance with this subsection, the       Attorney General shall, upon implementing such system,       discontinue using any program or system that exists on the       date of enactment of this Act through which an incarcerated       person sends or receives a privileged electronic       communication, except that any program or system that exists       on such date may continue to be used for any other electronic       communication.        (b) Retention of Contents.--A program or system or a       modification to a program or system under subsection (a) may       allow for retention by the Bureau of Prisons of, and access       by an incarcerated person to, the contents of electronic       communications, including the contents of privileged       electronic communications, of the person until the date on       which the person is released from prison.

(d) Accessing Retained Contents.--Contents retained under       subsection (b) may only be accessed by a person other than       the incarcerated person for whom such contents are retained       under the following circumstances:        (1) Attorney general.--The Attorney General may only access       retained contents if necessary for the purpose of creating       and maintaining the program or system, or any modification to       the program or system, through which an incarcerated person       sends or receives electronic communications. The Attorney       General may not review retained contents that are accessed       pursuant to this paragraph.        (2) Investigative and law enforcement officers.--        (A) Warrant.--        (i) In general.--Retained contents may only be accessed by       an investigative or law enforcement officer pursuant to a       warrant issued by a court pursuant to the procedures       described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.        (ii) Approval.--No application for a warrant may be made to       a court without the express approval of a United States       Attorney or an Assistant Attorney General.        (B) Privileged information.--        (i) Review.--Before retained contents may be accessed       pursuant to a warrant obtained under subparagraph (A), such       contents shall be reviewed by a United States Attorney to       ensure that privileged electronic communications are not       accessible.        (ii) Barring participation.--A United States Attorney who       reviews retained contents pursuant to clause (i) shall be       barred from--         (I) participating in a legal proceeding in which an       individual who sent or received an electronic communication       from which such contents are retained under subsection (b) is       a defendant; or        (II) sharing the retained contents with an attorney who is       participating in such a legal proceeding.         (3) Motion to suppress.--In a case in which retained       contents have been accessed in violation of this subsection,       a court may suppress evidence obtained or derived from access       to such contents upon motion of the defendant.        (e) Definitions.--In this Act--        (1) the term ``agent of an attorney or legal       representative'' means any person employed by or contracting       with an attorney or legal representative, including law       clerks, interns, investigators, paraprofessionals, and       administrative staff;        (2) the term ``contents'' has the meaning given such term       in 2510 of title 18, United States Code;        (3) the term ``electronic communication'' has the meaning       given such term in section 2510 of title 18, United States       Code, and includes the Trust Fund Limited Inmate Computer       System;        (4) the term ``monitoring'' means accessing the contents of       an electronic communication at any time after such       communication is sent;        (5) the term ``incarcerated person'' means any individual       in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons or the United States       Marshals Service who has been charged with or convicted of an       offense against the United States, including such an       individual who is imprisoned in a State institution; and        (6) the term ``privileged electronic communication''       means--        (A) any electronic communication between an incarcerated       person and a potential, current, or former attorney or legal       representative of such a person; and        (B) any electronic communication between an incarcerated       person and the agent of an attorney or legal representative       described in subparagraph (A).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5546, the Effective Assistance of Counsel in the  Digital Era Act would require the Federal Bureau of Prisons to  establish a system to exempt from monitoring any privileged electronic  communications between incarcerated individuals and their attorneys or  legal representatives.   The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides the right to  counsel to assist in the defense of those accused of criminal offenses.  In order to represent their clients in an effective manner, defense  attorneys must have the ability to communicate candidly with their  clients.   The attorney-client privilege, which keeps communications between  individuals and their attorneys confidential, exists, in part, to  foster this sort of open communication.   This privilege, of course, does not protect communications between a  client and an attorney made in furtherance of, or in order to cover up  a crime or fraud, also known as the crime-fraud exception. But to  ensure free and open communication between individuals and their  attorneys--a fundamental component of the effective assistance of  counsel guaranteed by the Constitution--other communications between  them may remain private.   It goes without saying that defendants who are not in custody are  less constrained in their ability to have candid conversations with  their attorneys than those defendants who are in custody.   Generally speaking, out-of-custody defendants can go to their  attorneys' offices, speak with them freely on the phone, or write  letters back and forth with their attorneys without fear of  interference. To an extent, in-custody defendants also have these  protections: Bureau of Prisons regulations ensure that inmates are able  to meet with their attorneys without auditory supervision, and that  they can talk on the phone and exchange letters with their attorneys  without monitoring.   But these same protections do not apply to email communications for  the nearly 150,000 individuals currently in the Bureau of Prisons'  custody, many of whom are in pretrial detention and have not been  convicted of any crime.   Since 2009, email communications have been available for Bureau of  Prisons inmates through a system known as TRULINCS. TRULINCS requires  inmates and their contacts to consent to monitoring, however, even in  the case of communications between inmates and their attorneys.   Over a decade ago, BOP clearly recognized the growing importance of  email for purposes of efficiency and speed of communication between  inmates and their outside contacts. Over time, email has rapidly grown  into a primary means of communication between inmates and their  attorneys, but without a system in place to maintain attorney-client  privilege. Without that system, the Bureau of Prisons risks severely  hindering the effective representation of inmates. It is even more  important for us to enable these confidential communications at this  point in time, given that the pandemic has severely hampered the  ability of attorneys to meet with their clients in person.   It is well past time to rectify this problem. I am pleased that H.R.  5546 would do just that, by requiring BOP to put in place a system that  will exempt  [[Page H4578]]  from monitoring any privileged electronic communications between  incarcerated individuals and their attorneys or legal representatives.   The bill also includes additional protections, including the  requirement that the contents of electronic communications be destroyed  when an inmate is released from prison, as well as authorizing the  suppression of evidence obtained or derived from access to information  in violation of provisions set forth in this bill.   This is an important bill, and one that has been needed for quite  some time. I commend our colleagues, Representatives Hakeem Jeffries  and Doug Collins, for their efforts and leadership in developing this  bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of  this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5546 is an important measure to  reinforce the attorney-client privilege, an issue that is essential to  the fair administration of our criminal justice system and one that is  even more urgent in this pandemic.   For all the reasons discussed here today, I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 982) to increase intergovernmental coordination to identify  and combat violent crime within Indian lands and of Indians.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 982         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   S. 982, the Not Invisible Act of 2019, introduced by Nevada Senator  Catherine Cortez Masto and passed by the Senate last March, addresses  the crisis of violence and sexual violence committed against American  Indian and Alaska Native men and women in two concrete ways, by  directing the appointment within the Bureau of Indian Affairs of a  coordinator of Federal efforts to combat violence against Native people  and by establishing a commission on reducing violent crime against  Indians.   I commend my colleague, Representative Debra Haaland from New Mexico,  for introducing the companion bill here in the House and for her  efforts in advancing this important legislation.   For decades, Native American and Alaska Native communities have  struggled with high rates of assault, abduction, and murder of women.  Community advocates describe the crisis as a legacy of generations of  government policies promoting forced removal, land seizures, and  violence inflicted on Native peoples.   Advocates and victims' families also complain, and rightly so, that  the investigation and monitoring of disappearances and killings of  members of their communities have gotten lost in bureaucratic gaps  generated by a system that lacks clarity on whether local or Federal  agencies should investigate. The Federal Government must do something  to address these problems.   The statistics on violence in Native American communities are  staggering. More than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native  women have experienced violence in their lifetime, including 56.1  percent who have experienced sexual violence. American Indian and  Alaska Native men also have high victimization rates, with 81.6 percent  having experienced violence in their lifetime. This problem is, in  large part, the result of decades of neglect by the Federal Government.   This crisis has particularly affected Native American women, scores  of whom have gone missing and have been found murdered. Recently, these  women's stories have begun to be told to a wider audience. But these  stories are not new, and it is long overdue that we address them.   The Not Invisible Act of 2019 is an important step for the Federal  Government in finding an adequate response to the problem of violence  against Native Americans. By making a permanent position within the  Bureau of Indian Affairs that reports directly to the Secretary of the  Interior and who will submit an annual report to Congress, we will  greatly improve the Federal response to combating violence in Native  communities.   Significantly, this bill also directs the BIA coordinator to take  into consideration the unique challenges faced by Native American  communities, both on and off Tribal lands, and to work in cooperation  with outside organizations to train Tribal law enforcement, Indian  Health Service care providers, and other Tribal community members on  identifying, responding to, and reporting on cases of missing persons,  murder, and human trafficking.   For 2 years, a joint commission on reducing violent crimes against  Indians will be tasked with preparing recommendations on concrete  actions the Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice  can take to help combat violent crimes against Native Americans and on  Native American lands. These include the development and implementation  of strategies for identifying, reporting, and responding to instances  of missing persons, murder, and human trafficking; tracking and  reporting relevant data; and increasing prosecutions in this neglected  arena. These are long-overdue critical measures.   It is well past the time to help rectify these problems, and I am  pleased that the Not Invisible Act will go a long way in that process.  Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this  bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the Not Invisible Act does precisely what  its title aims to do. It ensures that the Federal Government dedicates  proper attention and gives visibility to the crisis of violence and  sexual violence committed against American Indian and Alaska Native men  and women. Indeed, these communities have been subjected to  invisibility and neglect for far too long.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
