 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a university  in my district that has demonstrated leadership and innovation in STEM  education.   Stevens Institute of Technology, located in Hoboken, New Jersey, has  been leading the way with a rigorous technical curriculum that attracts  the attention of some of the Nation's most sought-after companies and  industries.   The university continues to develop new ways in which to augment the  success of their students, and I was pleased to hear recently about  inventive initiatives that support the success of underserved and  underrepresented students.   It is telling that the applications have increased 191 percent, and  undergraduate enrollment has seen a 41 percent growth. Moreover, the  graduation rate has impressively risen to 87 percent with Pell grant  recipients graduating at a rate of 91 percent. This is well above the  national averages, which are 59 percent and 51 percent, respectively.   There is a reason. Forbes magazine recently called Stevens ``one of  the most desirable STEM colleges in the Nation.''   Upon graduation, 96 percent of Stevens graduates either get a job in  their field, with an average starting salary of over $70,000, or enter  graduate school within 6 months.   Not only is Stevens producing students who are highly skilled and  prepared for the professional world, but Stevens is also at the  forefront of cutting-edge research in areas of national importance,  such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. In a recent  National Science Foundation competition for quantum engineering,  Stevens won two out of eight grants awarded.   There are over 40,000 Stevens alumni who are essential to the  economic progress of New Jersey and the Nation. I am proud to represent  the university that acts as a trailblazer in scientific innovation.   I would like to recognize President Farvardin for his leadership, and  I look forward to the continued success of Stevens and its students.                            ____________________
