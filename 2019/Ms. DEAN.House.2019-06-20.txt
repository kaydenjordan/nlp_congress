 Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, 49 innocent souls were gunned  down at Orlando's Pulse nightclub. In my brief moment here with you, I  lift up their first names and their lives.   Edward, Stanley, Ramon, Christopher, Eric, Peter, Luis, Amanda,  Jason, Cory, Shane, Kimberly, Eddie, Darryl, Deonka, Anthony, Jean,  Luis, Oscar, Enrique, Javier, Jerald, Luis, Tevin, Alejandro, Franky,  Martin, Mercedes, Xavier, Gilberto, Simon, Miguel, Joel, Juan, Luis,  Juan, Jonathan, Jean, Rodolfo, Brenda, Yilmary, Angel, Frank, Paul,  Leroy, Antonio, Christopher, Akyra, and Geraldo.   To Senator McConnell and the other leaders, take up legislation that  will save lives.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, public service is a high calling, and we should do  everything we can to encourage our best and our brightest, really all,  to pursue it. For me, the opportunity to serve in Congress is a  privilege and the honor of a lifetime, and I know my fellow Members  feel the same.   Unfortunately, for too many young people, public service isn't always  a realistic option. Nowhere is that surer than our broken criminal  justice system. There is no question that if we are going to fix the  problems that trouble our criminal justice system, we need prosecutors  and public defenders of the highest caliber.   Right now, students graduate law school with between $84,000 and  $122,000 in debt, while jobs in prosecutor's or defender's offices pay  just $56- to $58,000 a year. As a result, students who are eager to  contribute their talents to work for justice to defend the rights of  the vulnerable simply can't afford to. Well, we can't afford to lose  them.   The John R. Justice Act was designed to fix this problem by providing  student loan repayment of $10,000 a year for law students who make a  minimum 3-year commitment to public service. In theory, students can  earn up to $60,000 in total loan repayments, making public service a  far more realistic option.   In reality, however, Congress has failed to properly fund the  program. While the program is authorized up to $25 million a year,  actual appropriations have fallen dramatically short and now sit at  just under $2 million.   Here are the consequences: In my home State of Pennsylvania, the  Commission on Crime and Delinquency was able to fund only 38 of the 167  applicants received since 2015. That is less than 25 percent. For those  individuals who were fortunate enough to receive any funding at all,  the grant amounts totaled only $4,100.   That is better than nothing, but for most students it is not enough  to help them pay down their debt and devote themselves to public  service.   It is time to act. This amendment doubles the funds provided under  the John R. Justice Act, thereby delivering an immediate, substantial  impact. This will mean concrete help for many more students who are  eager to work on behalf of the public and build a better, smarter, more  compassionate criminal justice system.   It also sends a signal that we in Congress aren't satisfied with mere  rhetoric and that we will do what it takes to give every student a  chance to serve their communities and their country.   Mr. Chair, in closing, I am very pleased to put this forward in hopes  that we draw more talent not just in my home State but across this  country to public service in prosecutor's and public defender's offices  around the Nation.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
