 Madam Speaker, my two sisters are public school  teachers. They taught me that school breakfast and lunches are every  bit as important as a textbook or a laptop to that child's ability to  learn.   During the pandemic, Congress wisely provided 30 million kids free  meals at school, but last spring that provision expired.   Most schools had to go back to onerous paperwork and millions of kids  stopped getting free meals. I urge USDA to make it easier for States to  adopt universal school meals, including by lowering the threshold for  community eligibility.   California, Maine, and soon Colorado already made universal school  meals permanent. Three other States, including Massachusetts, have  extended universal meals through this school year.   Massachusetts is working to make the program permanent with  legislation recently introduced by State Rep. Andy Vargas and State  Senator Sal DiDomenico.   Madam Speaker, we have a sacred responsibility to keep kids fed, and  I am hopeful that one day soon we can pass a universal school meals  bill here in the United States Congress. Together, we can end hunger  now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Texas,  now the new vice chair of the Rules Committee, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, there is a lot to take in from the opening remarks the  gentleman has provided. I want to say one thing. He says that the  Republicans have a mandate. I think the message of the last two  elections was that the overwhelming number of people in this country  said no to extremism.   And mandate? Democrats picked up a seat in the Senate. The red wave  that was predicted by my Republican friends turned into a pink splash.   The reason why was because people were turned off by their extremism,  and this in spite of all kinds of gerrymandering, crazy redistricting  plans, and money like we have never seen in an election before, and we  have the narrowest of narrow margins.   So if the gentleman thinks that there is a mandate here to embrace  extremism, I beg to differ with that.   Madam Speaker, there is no denying that the situation with COVID has  improved. Cases are down, deaths are down, and most of us have returned  to the lifestyles we had before the pandemic. That is because of the  incredible steps we have taken to keep people safe: vaccines, expanded  healthcare, telework flexibilities, and other programs and initiatives  that ensure Americans can lead healthy, full lives.   The rule before us today allows for the consideration of four  measures, four reckless and regressive measures, to turn back the clock  on all that we have gone through and learned over these last 3 years,  and all under closed rules. Let me repeat that: all under closed rules.                                time  1230    H.J. Res. 7 would terminate, effective immediately, the COVID  national emergency declared in 2020 by President Trump and renewed by  President Biden in 2021.   This immediate reversal offers no off-ramps for relief programs and  benefits, threatening aid for nursing homes and hospitals, additional  support for the VA, as well as help for small businesses and more. It  would end flexibilities to ensure more food-insecure people have access  to SNAP, our Nation's first line of defense against hunger.   H.R. 382, the Pandemic is Over Act, would similarly repeal Health and  Human Services' public health emergency declarations. This would roll  back significant expansions to healthcare access and services for  millions across the country.   H.R. 139, the SHOW UP Act, would force Federal agencies to return to  prepandemic telework policies, despite the fact that the pandemic  demonstrated workers from many industries could complete their jobs  remotely.   H.R. 497, the Freedom for Health Care Workers Act, would remove COVID  vaccine requirements for Medicare and Medicaid healthcare workers.   Now, if you take a second to think about these bills, not a single  one makes things easier, safer, or more effective. They are sound  bites. That is what my Republican friends are good at, sound bites, not  legislating. They are good at making political statements but not  solving problems.   Eliminating vaccine mandates for healthcare providers will not help  healthcare providers. Instead, it increases their chances of getting  sick, increases their patients' chances of getting sick.   COVID vaccines are safe and effective. You wouldn't know that if you  listened to some of the commentary in the Rules Committee last night,  but they are. They have protected millions of healthcare workers and  their families from infections, hospitalization, and death.   Pulling the plug on the national and public health emergency  declarations will throw Federal programs in our healthcare system into  chaos. No longer will Americans be able to receive free COVID testing  and treatments. Hospitals that already struggle to stock their shelves  with proper PPE will face an even greater uphill battle.   I am not saying that these declarations should continue indefinitely.  Nobody is saying that. President Biden announced yesterday that he  plans to end the declarations on May 11. But we need time to understand  the impact that ending the declarations will have on our country.   The responsible thing to do is to provide an orderly off-ramp for  these agencies so that essential benefits aren't suddenly ripped away  from those who need them most.   Essentially, getting rid of telework for Federal agencies when it has  allowed our Nation and government to function through this historic  pandemic is nonsense. Studies have shown that telework has been largely  beneficial, resulting in increased productivity, reduced absences,  reduced turnover, and reduced office costs. If corporate America has  chosen to harness the net positive effects of teleworking, government  agencies should, too.   Madam Speaker, my Republican friends who are screaming against  teleworking provisions, I point out, for the Record, that Republicans  voted by proxy more than 14,500 times in the last Congress.   Let me repeat that. Republicans voted by proxy--that means they were  operating remotely--more than 14,500 times in the last Congress.   It was kind of comical. Last night, my friend from Texas in the Rules  Committee said that Republicans were voting by proxy because they felt  Democrats pressured them, that Democrats made them do that. Really? I  mean, I have heard a lot of crazy things in my life, but I have never  heard that used as an excuse. Give me a break.   I find it outrageous that some Members are so worried about  government workers getting their work done from home while they  themselves took advantage of proxy voting over the last 3 years. Guess  what? Proxy voting is called telework, and my friends are okay with  telework for themselves, but when it comes to Federal workers, no, they  are not okay. I guess for House Republicans, it is do as I say, not as  I do.   We had the chair of the Oversight Committee testify very passionately  against telework last night, and he voted by proxy--get this--83 times.  You can't make this stuff up.   We all know that COVID has moved into a new phase, and thanks to the  use of safe, effective vaccines and other prevention tools, we are  moving forward. We are learning to live with it, but let's not forget  that over a million of our fellow Americans have died from it.   We should not ignore the fact that COVID continues to spread and  mutate. It still poses a danger to people.   It is clear that House Republicans just want to pretend that COVID  isn't still a problem, that science doesn't exist, and that telework  doesn't have a place in the 21st century.   At the end of the day, these measures were introduced really out of  spite. Our colleagues across the aisle are looking to undo everything  we did, even if that means getting rid of important, effective measures  that help American workers, families, and patients.   In closing, Madam Speaker, none of these have gone through committee.  There were no hearings, not a single hearing.   Again, there were lots of questions raised about these bills in the  Rules Committee last night, including whether or not title 42 would be  overturned. The administration has one opinion, and the Republicans  have another opinion. I don't know what the truth is. A hearing would  have made a difference, but they couldn't even wait a couple of days to  do a hearing. They just wanted to rush this to the floor to get a press  release out.   There were not only no markups, but there were no amendments. We had  amendments submitted to the Rules Committee last night not just by  Democrats but by Republicans. They said: No. Closed. Can't even have a  debate on the floor. Can't have an up-or-down vote.  [[Page H523]]    Fifteen out of the 16 measures that this Congress has considered so  far have been totally closed. I am thinking I need to call the Office  of Attending Physician and get a neck brace because I have whiplash  trying to reconcile what my friends said they were going to do and what  they are actually doing.   I mean, the last time the Republicans controlled Congress, they  presided over the most closed Congress in the history of the United  States of America. Let me repeat that. The last time they were in  control, they presided over the most closed Congress in the history of  our country, and they are on track to try to beat their own record.   This is not what the Speaker promised. I didn't see the secret memo  that Speaker McCarthy was circulating to get votes. Maybe there was  some stuff in the secret memo that basically said that, you know, say  one thing and do another.   The bottom line is this is not what anyone was promised, and there is  absolutely no reason that we couldn't have waited a few days to do  hearings on this stuff so we could decide whether or not any of these  measures were the responsible thing to do or whether or not there were  some additions that we could have made to these measures to make them  responsible.   We all want to move on, but we want to do so responsibly. We all want  to move beyond the national emergency, but we want to make sure that  there are not unintended consequences. This is not serious legislating.  This is political posturing, and it is a lousy way to begin the new  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and a ``no'' vote on  the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   There is a lot to unpack here, but let me just tell the gentleman on  the issue of national emergencies--by the way, I will add war powers-- we did a hearing in the Rules Committee on that in the last Congress. I  did it with now-Chairman Cole. We thought that it was appropriate to do  a hearing because we wanted to avoid any unintended consequences. So,  we have done that.   It is now becoming very clear to me how this Congress is going to  operate in the Rules Committee. The gentleman just made it clear that  everything should go through regular order except what he thinks is  important. If he thinks it is important, we can come here with a closed  rule.                                time  1245    Then I am a little confused over the gentleman's pontificating on the  fact these are only one-page bills and, therefore, they shouldn't be  amended. I point out that the bill that they had the modified open rule  on was a three-page bill, but is the number of pages of the bill going  to be determinative of whether or not we have amendments or not?   The bottom line is people had some good ideas that they offered to  the  [[Page H524]]  Rules Committee last night. Not only that, but people also had a lot of  questions. If you read the President's Statement of Administration  Policy, he raises issues about title 42 that we seem to have a dispute  on, but, boy, if you did a hearing and you did a markup, you might have  been able to address those things.   I'm not saying we are moving too quickly. I am just saying we are not  moving responsibly. Once your committees are constituted, you can have  a hearing immediately. You can bring this to the floor next Monday or  Tuesday if you want; but you chose to shut the system down.   Notwithstanding all of your rhetoric, not notwithstanding all of the  pontificating on the need for more amendments to be made in order, a  more open process, a more transparent process, you are beginning this  session with closed rule after closed rule after closed rule.   Last night, the Committee on Rules reported out four more closed  rules. That is the choice you have made. We have a sense of where you  are going. The last time you were in charge, you presided over the most  closed Congress in the history of the United States Government. I  wouldn't be surprised if you beat your own record.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to ensure that none of the bills in this rule  take effect unless it is certified that they do not decrease Social  Security benefits.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, Social Security is the bedrock of our  Nation's social safety net. Since its inception, it has lifted millions  of our seniors out of poverty. Protecting the benefits it provides  should be a priority for this Congress.   As my Republican colleagues demand reckless cuts in exchange for  paying our Nation's bills, Democrats will continue taking action to  protect Social Security. This is not the first time Social Security has  been under attack by my friends on the other side of the aisle.   Don't be fooled by their phraseology that they are only interested in  ``protecting Social Security.'' We know that that is code for cutting  benefits, for raising the retirement age, for throwing people off the  benefit.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson) to discuss our proposal.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, oh my God. There are doctors who serve in Congress-- Democrats and Republicans. I hope that they will stand up and correct  the misinformation. I mean, really.   The gentleman talks about herd immunity as if somehow that was some  panacea here.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Harvard Medical  School titled, ``COVID-19 diagnosis raises risks of heart attack,  stroke.''               [From Harvard Health Publishing, Nov. 1, 2021]           COVID-19 Diagnosis Raises Risk of Heart Attack, Stroke                             (By Julie Corliss)         In one of the largest studies of its kind to date,       researchers found strong evidence that heart attack and       stroke risk rises sharply in the weeks following a COVID-19       diagnosis. The findings were published Aug. 14, 2021, in The       Lancet.        The study included every person in Sweden diagnosed with       COVID-19 from Feb. 1, 2020, to Sept. 14, 2020--a total of       nearly 87,000 people. Their median age was 48, and 57 percent       were women. Researchers compared them with more than 348,000       Swedish people of similar age and sex who did not have the       virus.        In the week after a COVID-19 diagnosis, the risk of a first       heart attack increased by three to eight times. The risk of a       first stroke caused by a blood clot multiplied by three to       six times. In the following weeks, both risks decreased       steadily but stayed elevated for at least a month.        Other bacterial and viral infections (such as influenza)       are known to temporarily boost rates of heart attacks and       strokes. But COVID-19 infections appear to be especially       risky, perhaps because they trigger an exaggerated       inflammatory response that makes blood clots more likely .     Madam Speaker, a study found that in the week after a  COVID diagnosis, the risk of a first heart attack increased by three to  eight times. The risk of a first stroke caused by a blood clot  multiplied by three to six times. In the following weeks, both risks  decreased steadily but stayed elevated for at least a month.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a USA Today piece titled,  ``Fact check: COVID-19 vaccines primarily designed to prevent serious  illness, death.''                    [From the USA TODAY, Jan. 21, 2022]    Fact Check: COVID-19 Vaccines Primarily Designed To Prevent Serious                               Illness, Death                           (By Valerie Paviionis)         As the omicron variant surges across the world and the       United States logs case numbers near and over 1 million per       day, the virus is prompting scientists to develop new       treatments and government officials to fight to curb the       spread.        While the Biden administration continues to urge Americans       to get vaccinated, a Jan. 10 Facebook post claims that Dr.       Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention, said vaccines can't prevent COVID-19       transmission. Other sites have shared the same claim, linking       Walensky's words back to an interview with CNN in August       2021.        ``Our vaccines are working exceptionally well,'' Walensky       said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer in the interview. ``They continue       to work well for delta, with regard to severe illness and       death--they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is       prevent transmission.''        Though Walensky did say these words on CNN, the original       interview was aired in early August, not recently. And while       it's true vaccines can't entirely halt transmission, experts       say they do reduce it--and reduce the chances of       hospitalization and death--as USA TODAY previously reported.        USA TODAY reached out to the original poster of the claim       for comment.        Various websites have written about the same claim,       amassing thousands of interactions on Facebook.                  vaccine effects depend on several factors         In an email, Walensky spokesperson Kathleen Conley wrote       that in August 2021--when the interview originally ran--the       delta variant was the dominant variant in the United States.        Experts at that time said it was clear the vaccines       provided protection.        ``Vaccines provide significant protection from `getting       it'--infection--and `spreading it'--transmission--even       against the delta variant,'' a professor of immunobiology and       molecular, cellular and developmental biology at Yale       University, told USA TODAY in November.        However, Conley noted data did show vaccines were ``less       effective at preventing infections and transmission with       Delta than with previous other variants.'' Omicron has proven       even more difficult to contain.        While mRNA vaccines--produced by Pfizer and Moderna--      continue to offer some level of protection against       transmission of omicron, other vaccines--such as Johnson &       Johnson, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca--offer ``almost no       defense,'' according to a Dec. 19, 2021, report by the New       York Times.        Other factors beyond variant type, vaccination type and       booster status can also influence whether or not a person       contracts COVID-19.        Dr. David Dowdy, associate professor of epidemiology at       Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it's       difficult to succinctly explain the vaccines' nuanced effects       on transmission.        A vaccine might protect you from a passing interaction with       someone at a grocery store, but it may not prevent infection       from someone you live with and share air with for several       hours a day.        ``It gets very easy to misconstrue,'' Dowdy said. ``If       someone asks, do vaccines prevent infection, and you have to       give a yes or no answer, then the answer is no, they're not a       perfect blockade. But do the vaccines offer some protection       against infection? The answer is yes.''                vaccines still protect against serious disease         While vaccinations don't offer perfect protection against       the transmission of COVID-19, experts still urge people to       get vaccinated.        According to Conley, COVID-19 vaccination remains effective       against hospitalization and death caused by the virus.       Getting a booster, she added, further decreases these risks,       and the CDC continues to recommend that Americans receive       vaccines and boosters.        Dr. Chris Beyrer, professor of public health and human       rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public       Health, said both the mRNA and J&J vaccines were never       designed to prevent infection entirely.        It's ``very hard'', he said, to prevent infection via an       injected vaccine when you're dealing with a virus that enters       the body through the nose and mouth. Instead, the vaccine       trials were designed to study reduction in serious illness,       hospitalization and death. All three vaccines were highly       effective by this measure, Beyrer said.        ``People who say, well, why would I take it if it doesn't       prevent me from getting infected?'' Beyrer said. ``You have       to remember that having a COVID-19 infection can be       everything from completely asymptomatic . . . to a head-cold-      like symptoms or full flu-like symptoms, all the way to       death. So what the vaccines are doing is really dramatically       increasing the likelihood that you will have mild infection.       And that's incredibly important.''        A CDC study released Jan. 21 showed booster shots of the       Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective at       preventing hospitalizations from the omicron variant.                         our rating: missing context         Because it can be misleading without additional       information, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that the CDC       director says vaccines can't prevent transmission of COVID-      19. While vaccines do not offer 100% protection against       COVID-19 infection, they can still partially defend against       infection. Vaccines remain effective at protecting from       COVID-19-caused serious illness, hospitalization and death.     Madam Speaker, I would highlight one of the quotes that  I guess the gentleman was referring to.   ``Though Walensky did say these words on CNN, the original interview  was aired in early August, not recently. And while it is true vaccines  cannot entirely halt transmission, experts say they do reduce it--and  reduce the chances of hospitalizations and death.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a study by the Commonwealth  [[Page H526]]  Fund titled, ``Two years of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccines Have Prevented  Millions of Hospitalizations and Deaths.''                   [The Commonwealth Fund, Dec. 13, 2022]      Two Years of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccines Have Prevented Millions of                        Hospitalizations and Deaths     (By Meagan C. Fitzpatrick, Seyed M. Moghadas, Abhishek Pandy, and                             Alison P. Galvani)         It has been two years since the first COVID-19 vaccine was       given to a patient in the United States. Since then, the U.S.       has administered more than 655 million doses--80 percent of       the population has received at least one dose--with the       cumulative effect of preventing more than 18 million       additional hospitalizations and more than 3 million       additional deaths. The swift development of the vaccine,       emergency authorization to distribute widely, and rapid       rollout have been instrumental in curbing hospitalization and       death, while mitigating socioeconomic repercussions of the       pandemic.        As more transmissible and immune-evasive variants have       emerged over the past two years, the U.S. has responded by       deploying additional doses and variant-specific boosters. The       Omicron variants caused the largest wave of infections during       the pandemic. COVID-19 monovalent vaccines available at the       time were not as efficacious against the variant as bivalent       boosters introduced later, but the wave would have been more       devastating in the absence of vaccination.        As we mark the second anniversary of the U.S. COVID-19       vaccination campaign, understanding the impact of vaccines on       reducing disease burden is needed to inform future, evidence-      based actions. We therefore used a computer model of disease       transmission to estimate hospitalizations and deaths averted       through the end of November 2022. The model incorporates the       age-stratified demographics, risk factors, and immunological       dynamics of infection and vaccination. We simulated this       model to compare the observed pandemic trajectory to a       counterfactual scenario without a vaccination program.                                   Findings         From December 2020 through November 2022, we estimate that       the COVID-19 vaccination program in the U.S. prevented more       than 18.5 million additional hospitalizations and 3.2 million       additional deaths. Without vaccination, there would have been       nearly 120 million more COVID-19 infections. The vaccination       program also saved the U.S. $1.15 trillion (Credible       Interval: $1.10 trillion-$1.19 trillion) (data not shown) in       medical costs that would otherwise have been incurred.                                  Discussion         Our findings highlight the substantial impact of the U.S.       vaccination program on reducing infections, hospitalizations,       and deaths. Curbing hospitalization rates by reducing both       COVID-19 incidence and symptom severity is particularly       important amidst the strain on the health care system caused       by unusually high levels of flu and RSV (respiratory       syncytial virus). COVID-19 vaccination has preserved hospital       resources for individuals who would otherwise have not       received timely care.        Vaccination also has prevented many millions of COVID       infections. Although the acute phase of these infections may       not have required medical attention, each infection carries a       risk of long COVID and debilitating symptoms. Many of the       prevented infections would have been reinfections, which have       higher risk of death compared to initial infections. In       addition, as our previous analysis demonstrated, vaccines       have kept children in school, highlighting the societal value       of the ongoing vaccination program.        The estimated infections, hospitalizations, and deaths       averted by vaccination are particularly striking when       compared to the actual values observed during this time       period. Since December 12, 2020, 82 million infections, 4.8       million hospitalizations, and 798,000 deaths have been       reported in the U.S. In other words, without vaccination the       U.S. would have experienced 1.5 times more infections, 3.8       times more hospitalizations, and 4.1 times more deaths. These       losses would have been accompanied by more than $1 trillion       in additional medical costs that were averted because of       fewer infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.        The impact of the vaccination program is more remarkable       given the challenges posed by the multiple variants that have       arisen. The Omicron variants have been particularly immune-      evasive and drove the largest surge in COVID-19 cases to       date. However, the vaccines provided broader and more durable       protection against severe clinical outcomes, including       hospitalization and death. The reported ``mild'' nature of       Omicron is in large part because of vaccine protection.        A limitation of our study is that we modeled only viral       dynamics within the U.S. However, vaccines developed by the       U.S. were also deployed around the world, changing the       trajectory of the pandemic on a global scale. Without them,       more variants could have emerged or there could have been       greater importation of COVID-19 cases. In this regard, our       study underestimates the true impact of COVID-19 vaccine       development on U.S. outcomes.        The unprecedented pace at which vaccines were developed and       deployed has saved many lives and allowed for safer easing of       COVID-19 restrictions and reopening of businesses, schools,       and other activities. This extraordinary achievement has been       possible only through sustained funding and effective       policymaking that ensured vaccines were available to all       Americans. Moving forward, accelerating uptake of the new       booster will be fundamental to averting future       hospitalizations and deaths.     Madam Speaker, we have lost over 1 million of our  fellow citizens to COVID, over 1 million in the United States alone;  mothers, fathers, siblings, friends, and children, as well.   But the development of safe vaccines has meant that millions more  lives have been saved. There is no question whether or not the  vaccination is effective.   Madam Speaker, I would just highlight one of the findings in The  Commonwealth Fund report.   It says, ``From December 2020 through November 2022, we estimate that  the COVID-19 vaccination program in the United States prevented more  than 18.5 million additional hospitalizations and 3.2 million  additional deaths. Without vaccination, there would have been nearly  120 million more COVID-19 infections. The vaccination program also  saved the U.S. $1.15 trillion in medical costs that would otherwise  have been incurred.''   Here we are, after having gone through what we went through, after  knowing the benefits of these vaccinations, and to hear what we are  hearing on the floor, it really is disappointing.   Madam Speaker, I would ask the doctors in this Chamber, Democrats and  Republicans, please stand up. Please correct the Record. Please tell  people that vaccinations have been a good thing and that people should  get vaccinated. They could save their lives.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I include in the Record a piece from the New York Post titled: ``GOP  unveils `Commitment to America' plan to halt Biden, inflation, and  crime.''                  [From the New York Post, Sept. 23, 2022]   GOP Unveils `Commitment to America' Plan To Halt Biden, Inflation and                                   Crime                             (By Steve Nelson)         House Republicans pledged Friday to end soaring inflation       and reduce crime by serving as a check on President Biden if       they reclaim power--calling the party's midterm election       platform a ``Commitment to America.''        House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced       the big-tent framework inside an HVAC manufacturing plant       outside Pittsburgh, Pa.        ``We want to roll [the plan] out to you, to the entire       country, to know exactly what we will do if you would trust       us and give us the ability to take a new direction for this       country,'' McCarthy said.        The kickoff featured a business-casual Q&A where dozens of       GOP legislators took turns fielding questions.        The Republicans vowed to rein in government spending to       lower the worst inflation in 41 years--with consumer prices       up 8.3 percent over 12 months as of August.        Speakers also promised to address crime, including record-      high illegal immigration, rising violent crime in cities and       fentanyl smuggling that's accelerated overdose deaths.        ``The sad part is these Democratic policies have already       taken one month of your wages. So now the struggle that you       have is you're living through 12 months with only 11 months'       pay now because inflation is so high,'' McCarthy said,       blasting Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan spending       bill.        House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy unveiled the       Republican ``Commitment to America'' agenda at DMI Companies       in Monongahela, Pennsylvania.        ``We've watched what's happened to our border--the millions       of people who are just walking across, people on the       terrorist watch list. Now we're watching it create every       community to be a border community,'' McCarthy said.        ``Fentanyl is the number one killer of Americans between       the ages of 18 and 45. The poison starts in China and comes       across our border. Do you realize it's killing 300 Americans       every day? It's like an airliner crashing each day.''        No. 3 House Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York said       the GOP would be ``making sure that we stop the trillions and       trillions of reckless government spending that we have seen       under Democrat rule.''        House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy vowed to stop       President Biden's spending policies if Republicans take the       House this fall.        ``That will immediately help lower the cost of goods as we       seek to rein in inflation,'' she said at the event.        Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) said, ``We have to have       oversight of what's happening in the administration and go       after the wasteful spending of the last administration and       return to normalcy--that $1 today means $1 tomorrow.''        Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) said Republicans would declare       fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction. ``That's what this is.       It fits the categories completely. And we're going to declare       it as that and use every resource we possibly can,'' he said.        Rep. Jim Jordan promised Republicans will nix President       Biden's plan on hiring more IRS agents over the next decade.        Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) said that unlike Democrats       under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), ``we're not       going to have this top-down leadership.''        ``Kevin McCarthy is going to rely on all of us to have       bottom-up leadership that comes from the districts,'' he       said. ``We got members here from New York all the way to the       border with Tony Gonzales. We got people that have different       approaches--all the way from David Joyce to Marjorie Taylor       Greene. But we're all united behind Kevin McCarthy.''        Republican speakers vowed various oversight efforts focused       on the Biden administration and hearings on the origins of       the COVID-19 pandemic.        House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said more hearings will       be held on border security.        House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said, ``We were       calling for hearings for over a year on the origin of COVID.       Shouldn't we know that? I mean, this is a basic question.       Millions of people across the globe died.''        Scalise said there would be many hearings on border       security too after more than 2 million people illegally       crossed the southwest border in fiscal 2022.        ``We will give [Homeland Security] Secretary [Alejandro]       Mayorkas a reserved parking spot, he will be testifying so       much about this,'' Scalise said.        Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed she will follow the       Republicans' new agenda.        Speakers did not specifically mention expected       investigations of Biden's links to his son Hunter Biden and       brother Jim Biden's multimillion-dollar influence-peddling       businesses in China, Ukraine and other countries.        Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said the Republicans decided their       first bill will seek to nullify an IRS crackdown recently       authorized by Democrats to fund an environmental and health       care spending bill. He also mentioned oversight of allegedly       biased Justice Department actions.        ``We're gonna look into this weaponization of the DOJ       against the American people . . . not to mention the border.       But specifically to the COVID issue . . . they told us so       many things that turned out not to be accurate,'' Jordan       said.        ``They told us this thing [COVID] . . . didn't come from a       lab. Sure it looks like it did,'' he added. ``But they want       us to believe, `No, no, no, it was a bat to a pangolin to Joe       Rogan.' ''        ``We are committed to doing the investigations that need to       be done,'' Jordan said.        The ``Commitment to America'' organizes various pledges       under four broad categories: the economy, safety, freedom and       accountability. The outline is an attempt to harness the       historical success of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's       1994 ``Contract with America,'' which propelled GOP gains       during President Bill Clinton's first term.     Madam Speaker, Republicans promised that as soon as  they were in the majority, they would immediately move to address  inflation. Well, we are a month into the 118th Congress with zero  action to lower costs for families.   My question is, what happened? Why have Republicans spent all of  January on messaging bills and trying to get their house in order?   I know it was a tumultuous week to try to elect a Speaker. We made  history--4 days and 15 votes. Unprecedented.   Nonetheless, what happened to focusing on issues that were first and  foremost on people's minds? Instead, we had abortion bans, and now we  are dealing with this. I think we are dealing with a bill on socialism  later today. I don't know what the heck prompted that.   In any event, I mean, really? Is that what my Republican friends  think the American people want?   Again, I am going to just say that I am urging my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the previous question so that we can have a vote on my  proposal, basically, which says that Social Security benefits must be  protected, that there is nothing in any of these bills or any bills  going forward that would in any way negatively impact Social Security.  Protecting the benefits that Social Security provides should be a  priority for this Congress.   Quite frankly, none of us are comforted by any of the words that the  Speaker has said. We don't know what is in the secret memo. I don't  know what was promised on Social Security.   When Republicans say things like they want to protect the integrity  of the program, that is code for they want to cut it. That is code for  they want to raise the retirement age. That is code for all the things  that our constituents, not just Democrats, but Independents and  Republicans, fear might be coming down the road.   They are trying to use Social Security. They are trying to hold it  hostage as part of this effort to get some sort of a deal on the debt  ceiling.  [[Page H528]]    They are basically holding this economy hostage. The good faith and  credit of the United States, they are holding it hostage, ready to just  throw it into the wind until they get these cuts in programs that help  people.   Again, before I yield back at this point and let the gentleman  continue with any speakers he has, I would say that the measures that  we are dealing with today are concerning to us because there is a right  way to wind down and a wrong way to wind down.   What we suggested last night in the Rules Committee as the right way  to do this, and you can do it quickly, is to do hearings and make sure  there are no unintended consequences, make sure there aren't vulnerable  people who could be adversely impacted by your quick change of the  rules. The majority would have none of it.   So, again, this isn't a serious effort. This is about messaging, and  it is really disappointing.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the gentleman's response, but I am not sure who he is  responding to.   The question I asked was for physicians to come down here and to make  it clear, contrary to what was said before, that these vaccines are not  dangerous, that people should get vaccinated, that it could save lives.   People are still dying of COVID, by the way, and the idea that  somehow we should be discouraging people from getting vaccinations by  scaring them doesn't make a lot of sense to me. In fact, I think it is  irresponsible.   I appreciate the gentleman's service to his patients, and I hope that  he understands now his service is to the American people and that  service includes getting out the truth and what is accurate and what is  not accurate about these vaccinations.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, our side isn't afraid to embrace change. We know that  living in the 21st century means that we can and should use technology  to improve Americans' quality of life.   We know that vaccines save lives, and we know that science is real.  We know that ending these emergencies immediately is irresponsible.   Most importantly, we know that we are here to make progress, not to  go backward, which is what the four measures this rule includes would  do.   Again, let me say none of these bills went through committee. They  could have, but none of them did.   Madam Speaker, 94 percent of the rules this Congress has dealt with  have been completely closed. That is 15 out of 16 measures with no  hearings, no amendments, no markups.   Is this what Speaker McCarthy promised you in his secret memo, that  this is the way you will conduct business?   On top of all that, we are deeply concerned that a small minority on  the other side of the aisle representing the most extreme elements of  the Republican Conference is calling the shots.   We are worried about Social Security, and we are worried about  Medicare. That is why we are asking people to vote ``no'' on the  previous question, because we want to be able to put in place  protections so that a fringe group can't mess around with Social  Security, can't take away from people what they have earned.   It is not an entitlement. It is what people have earned in this  country.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and a  strong ``no'' vote on this rule.   There is a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this. The  majority is in control and in charge. Take the time. Do the hearings.  Ask the questions. Make sure there are no unintended consequences.   This is about the health and well-being of the American people. They  deserve at least a hearing rather than a messaging bill rushed to the  floor.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
