 Mr. Speaker, for the final time, I rise to  address this Chamber, and I am leaving here with a heart full of  gratitude.   When I reflect on the path I have traveled, I still can't believe it  is real--a baby girl born in post-war Vietnam to parents facing  persecution by the Communist government. We fled our homeland by boat  and were rescued by American sailors. Our family was given refuge,  granted citizenship, and provided opportunity in the United States.   My mom and dad worked so hard to make ends meet. They struggled to  overcome barriers of language and culture, all so that I could have a  better life than they did.   My happiest childhood memories are of fishing with my father. On the  water, he told me stories of his old life in Vietnam. His new life in  America wasn't easy, but I know he felt blessed to be an American.   Those who have endured the absence of freedom and safety rarely take  their presence for granted.   As I grew up, I was encouraged and mentored by so many generous  people who expected nothing in return. I remember hoping that, one day,  I might be in a position to help people just as they helped me.   Over time, I realized that government service was a good way for me  to chisel away at the infinite debt of gratitude I owe this country. I  also discovered that it infused my professional life with a sense of  purpose.   After the 9/11 attacks, I spent a few years at the Department of  Defense, and it was a privilege to work alongside American patriots. I  admired their singular focus on the mission: keeping our country safe  from those who sought her harm. From them, I learned about courage and  commitment.   A decade later, I heard the siren song of public service once again.  I had moved to central Florida. I was the mother of two young children  and worked at jobs in the private sector I enjoyed, but I was worried  about polarization in our political system.   Although deep divisions in American politics have existed since the  dawn of our Republic, there was something in the atmosphere that felt  especially poisonous. Too many Democratic and Republican leaders failed  to treat one another with civility and decency. They were unwilling to  express policy differences without making personal attacks or using  irresponsible rhetoric.   Extreme partisanship led to legislative gridlock, and communities  across the country paid the price, including my own.   When a gunman shot 49 innocent people at the Pulse nightclub in  Orlando, it seemed like yet another preventable tragedy that might have  been avoided if common sense and political courage were on greater  display in our Nation's Capitol.   If you want to change Washington, you have to change the type of  people you are sending there, I said to myself, and I thought I could  do my part to make things just a little bit better. So, I launched a  long-shot campaign for the people's House, inspired by Teddy  Roosevelt's view that the credit belongs to the man, or the woman, in  the arena.   I was so excited when I became the first Vietnamese-American woman  ever elected to Congress, and I thought about all the people who had  lifted me up over the years. I confess I also thought about the people  who underestimated me.   I wish my dad were alive to see what his daughter had done so that he  would know his sacrifices were worth it. I vowed to work every day to  prove I was worthy of the faith my constituents had placed in me.   As my congressional career draws to a close, I am proud of my  service. I hope I earned the respect of those I represented, whether  they were Democrats, Republicans, or neither, or whether they voted for  me or would never dream of voting for me.                                time  1030    This job isn't easy, but nothing truly worth doing is. There are few  places where you can make such a difference in people's lives as you  can in the United States Congress.   Ask the veteran who finally received the benefit they earned thanks  to the congressional office who broke through the bureaucratic red  tape.   Ask the millions of Americans who got health and economic aid during  the worst of the pandemic.   Ask the billions of people who will live on a cooler, cleaner planet  because of the green investments we have made.   Ask the lion-hearted people of Ukraine who defend their land with  weapons we gave them because their fight is our fight.   And ask the police officers who risked their lives on January 6 and  who, hopefully, find comfort in the fact that there is a bipartisan  committee that seeks to honor their valor by telling the truth about  that terrible day.   I will miss this place, but, above all, I will miss the people. I  have had wonderful colleagues, some of whom have become lifelong  friends. My staff has been like a second family to me, loyal and  devoted. We have had so much fun together and achieved so much for our  constituents and our country. To honor them I will be entering their  names in the Congressional Record. Thank you, Team Murphy.   To my real family--Sean, Liem, Maya, and Kona: I love you. None of  this would have been possible or meaningful without you. You are going  to be seeing much more of me, as you requested, and as you may come to  regret.   I want to end with a word to young Americans, including young girls  who look like me. I hope you consider government service. It requires  many sacrifices, but the work is important and noble. Our Nation needs  good people with steady hands to steer the ship of state: people with  integrity; people with common sense who seek common ground; and  patriots willing to put the public interest above their personal  interests.   Representing my community and my country in Congress has been the  greatest honor of my life.   I include in the Record the names of my staffers.
