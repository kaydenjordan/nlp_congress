 Madam President, reserving the right to object, this bill  being offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is a  partisan, political stunt designed to distract the American people from  the crisis created by Donald Trump's zero tolerance policy.   Almost 3,000 children have been ripped from the arms of their parents  and traumatized by the President's cruelty. This bill would allow the  Trump administration to continue to traumatize children by forcing  them, possibly indefinitely, into so-called family detention centers.   By offering this proposal, our colleagues are calling for the  extended incarceration of children. This bill would invalidate the  Flores settlement, which has ensured the humane treatment of children  for decades. It offers no specifics on what constitutes adequate  detention conditions and no mechanism for monitoring them. The bill  says the families will be given ``suitable living accommodations'' and  ``access to drinking water and food'' and that services will be offered  that are ``necessary for the adequate care of a minor child,'' but it  does not say who determines what is suitable, whether adequate  nutrition will be offered to the children, and who will decide what is  necessary. These so-called standards are not good enough when the  welfare of children is involved.   This bill would also authorize the Border Patrol to separate families  for the most minor offenses that have nothing to do with parenting or  the safety of the children. It puts form above substance and gives DHS  no discretion about when detention is most appropriate or when  alternative means, such as ankle bracelets or other monitoring  programs, might be better.   The so-called family unit residential centers in the bill are  essentially family jails.   We have heard from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other  experts about how these children will be traumatized for life. We  should be listening to these experts and stop giving the Trump  administration a free pass to harm immigrant children.   I look at the policies of this administration and at bills like this  one, and I wonder how my colleagues are able to stomach our government  treating families in these awful ways. And we have witnessed this kind  of treatment in America over the last several weeks.   The President refers to families of children fleeing war, gang  violence, and poverty as ``infesting'' our country. I hear echoes from  the darkest parts of America's past when African-American slaves were  depicted as monkeys, Chinese laborers in the 1870s were referred to as  ``pouring forth'' from their ``Asiatic hive,'' and Japanese Americans  penned up like animals for the crime of their heritage during World War  II.   This mindset of viewing these immigrant families as subhuman does not  exist in a vacuum; it has a history and a context we cannot shy away  from. It is because of that history that I have continued to demand not  just an end to the detention of children and families but also to  demand accountability from Donald Trump's government.   Last week, the Judiciary Committee had a closed-door briefing with  officials from the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services,  and Homeland Security. We didn't get straight answers to our  questions--mainly, why is this happening in our country in the first  place? Why were these children separated from their parents? Why do we  have ICE agents taunting these already traumatized children? Why? Why?  Why?   We need and indeed we should demand to hear from these officials in  public and under oath. I urged Chairman Grassley to have a public  oversight hearing on this issue with all of the relevant agencies. The  chairman has now scheduled this long-overdue hearing for July 31 with  representatives from the Department of Homeland Security, the  Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Justice.   It is critical that we hear from the witnesses because after  separating nearly 3,000 children from their families, they are now  chaotically scrambling to comply with judicial orders to reunite these  families. The administration would not be reuniting these families  without being forced to do so by the court. They continue on their  cruel path, undermining American values, and along this path, they have  traumatized thousands of children and their families, likely forever.   This administration needs no further tools to continue these cruel  policies. To continue to enable Donald Trump to pursue his anti- immigrant agenda makes us all complicit in his cruelty and injustice.   For these reasons, I object.    I yield to the Senator from Illinois.    Yes, I am.    Yes, I am.    That is correct.    Yes.    Again, correct.    Exactly. It is a continuation of the cruelty and the  dehumanization of children.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Brown for his continued  leadership in the fight to protect our Federal workforce and for  organizing this time for us to speak on such an important issue.   Over the past year and a half, Donald Trump and his administration  have launched a concerted attack on Federal workers and the unions that  fight on their behalf. There appear to be no lengths to which Donald  Trump and the anti-union, moneyed interests who support him will not go  to attack and try to eviscerate protections for working people.   Here are some examples. In one of his first acts in office, Donald  Trump instituted an across-the-board Federal hiring freeze that  impacted the work of critical agencies such as the Veterans  Administration, the State Department, and the Department of Defense.   Then the President appointed Neil Gorsuch to join the anti-worker  majority on the Supreme Court. This decision paid off when Justice  Gorsuch provided the decisive vote intended to gut public sector unions  in Janus v. AFSCME.   As a side note, Mark Janus--the public employee who served as the  front man for the Koch brothers in the landmark Janus case--has left  his job with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services  and now works for the Koch brothers. Is that a coincidence? I think  not.   The administration has demoted or reassigned dozens of senior agency  leaders tasked with serving our veterans and protecting our  environment.   The President has left thousands of critical positions across the  government unfilled. He has presented a legislative program as well.  The President's fiscal year 2019 budget proposes to freeze Federal  workers' wages, slash their benefits, and undermine their rights in the  workplace.   In late May, as mentioned, the President issued three Executive  orders that weaken longstanding--longstanding--and hard-won rights and  protections for our Federal workers. Each of these actions is part of a  focused radical--radical--effort to shrink the Federal Government and  limit its ability to help hundreds of millions of people across our  country.   Donald Trump and the Republican Party obviously do not recognize the  service and commitment of our more than 2 million Federal workers, but  in Hawaii, and, indeed, across the Nation, we see the impact of their  hard work every single day.   In Hawaii, Federal workers provide critical healthcare for the tens  of thousands of veterans living in our State. Federal workers service  and repair our naval fleet at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Federal  workers stand watch at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Hundreds of  Federal employees across 17 agencies are even now helping our Hawaii  Island community respond to and recover from the impact of the ongoing  volcanic activity at Kilauea on the Big Island.   In my visits to the Hawaii County Emergency Operations Center in Hilo  and the Disaster Recovery Center in Keaau, and to affected communities  across Puna, I have seen the impact these workers are having firsthand.   The Federal Emergency Management Agency is coordinating the overall  response and recovery with Federal, State, and county agencies. The  U.S. Geological Survey scientific experts are monitoring seismic  activities and providing realtime updates to affected residents. The  affected residents are in the thousands. The Department of the Interior  has provided technical assistance to protect Hawaii Island's natural  and cultural resources. The Environmental Protection Agency has  deployed experts to monitor air quality and provide timely alerts to  county residents. The Department of Agriculture and the Small Business  Administration are identifying resources and  [[Page S5347]]  assisting affected farmers and small business owners. The U.S. Coast  Guard is monitoring and patrolling areas where lava is flowing into the  ocean and enforcing safe perimeters for fishing and recreational  activity.   These dedicated public servants have been working around the clock  for months to support the Puna community. These workers deserve our  respect, appreciation, and unwavering support for their service. They  certainly don't deserve the contempt and animosity that Donald Trump  and his administration have directed at them.   The collective weight of this administration's anti-worker agenda is  taking a toll on our Federal workforce, needless to say, and the  Executive orders President Trump issued in May are already making  things worse by undermining workers' rights to fair representation in  the workplace.   The President's first order directs agencies to reopen existing-- these are existing already--bargaining agreements with the intent of  rushing through one-size-fits-all replacement agreements without an  opportunity for labor to provide input. The President's second order  severely restricts the ability of unions to protect workers from  managerial retaliation, workplace discrimination, and sexual  harassment. The President's third order undermines traditional civil  service protections intended to shield public servants from political  retribution by making firing workers easier.    Collectively, these Executive orders sabotage the hard-fought gains  Federal workers have achieved through decades of organizing and  collective bargaining at agencies throughout the Federal Government.  This sabotage has a purpose: to make life so miserable for our Federal  workforce that they either quit their jobs or retire.   The long-term damage that gutting our Federal workforce would cause  to our Nation, economy, and communities is serious. That is because, as  Teddy Roosevelt recognized when he pushed for the first major civil  service reform, a quality, professional civil service is a bulwark  against corruption and cronyism.   Public servants uphold the law and promote the public interests. That  includes holding big corporations accountable when they cheat consumers  and pollute our environment.   Is this why Donald Trump and his moneyed, anti-union allies have such  a fear of and disdain for our Federal workers--because they would  rather be left unfettered by any government or regulatory oversight? Is  that what is going on? How else can we explain the President's focus  and vicious attacks on Federal employees, which ignore the work they do  to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people of our country  every single day?   These are not normal times. It is not normal for the President and  his allies to go after our Federal employees in this way. It is not  normal, and it is up to each of us to resist this administration's  coordinated attack on our Federal workforce and the institutions that  represent and protect them.   I call on all of my colleagues to join me in this fight. I just do  not understand what it is that motivates the President and his moneyed  allies to try and tear apart the very workforce in our country that  protects our health, safety, and welfare. I just don't get it.   I yield the floor.             Amendments Nos. 3553 and 3543 to Amendment No. 3399     Mr. President, the Senate has a constitutional duty equal  to the President's to provide advice and consent on all judicial  nominees, including the President's Supreme Court nominee, Brett  Kavanaugh. Our advice-and-consent role requires us to view the totality  of Judge Kavanaugh's record and experiences, including the documents  from his time in the executive branch.   Judge Kavanaugh worked as a fellow in the first Bush administration's  Office of the Solicitor General, for Ken Starr in the Office of the  Independent Counsel investigating President Clinton, and in President  George W. Bush's White House in the office of White House Counsel and  as Staff Secretary to the President.   As has been the practice for previous Supreme Court nominees, the  Judiciary Committee should ask for and receive all records related to  his work in these roles. Any document requested of the Bush library or  the National Archives should parallel similar requests made for other  Supreme Court nominees.   Take the request sent by the committee for Elena Kagan's nomination.  This is the letter requesting information for Elena Kagan. We simply  substituted Judge Kavanaugh's name where Elena Kagan's name appeared.  You probably can't see it, but the request letter is signed by then- chair of the Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy, and it was signed by  our current Attorney General, but ranking member at that time, Jeff  Sessions.   On May 18, 2010, just 8 days after her nomination to the Supreme  Court by President Obama, the Judiciary Committee sent a bipartisan  request to the Director of the Clinton Presidential Library asking for  records from her time working at the White House and records related to  her nomination to the DC Circuit. We should send a similar request for  Judge Kavanaugh, just substituting Brett Kavanaugh's name for Elena  Kagan's. However, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, our  colleague from Iowa, is refusing to work with us to request the  totality of Judge Kavanaugh's record.   I have heard the objection to the request for all the records that  rests on the volume of documents we might receive. The fact that there  could be a lot of documents relevant to Judge Kavanaugh's time in the  White House, or any relevant point in his career, is not the issue. The  President knew there were a lot of documents related to Judge  Kavanaugh. It was reported that the majority leader argued that Judge  Kavanaugh's voluminous record could hurt his confirmation, tacitly  acknowledging that the Senate would have to examine all of the  documents.   Senator McConnell understood that the record was relevant to the  Senate's advice-and-consent responsibility in reviewing this nominee's  qualifications and judicial philosophy. Even the nominee himself, Judge  Kavanaugh, thinks the same. Judge Kavanaugh often refers to how his  executive branch experience shapes his judicial philosophy.   In 2013, he wrote in a published law review article:         When people ask me which prior legal experience has been       most useful for me as a judge, I tell them I certainly draw       on all of them, the clerkships, private practice at Kirkland,       Independent Counsel's office, even college jobs on the Hill       at Ways and Means, but the five-and-a-half years in the White       House, especially the three years as Staff Secretary for       President Bush, are among the most interesting and most       instructive. . . .    In 2016, he repeated that sentiment almost word for word. Again,  quoting Judge Kavanaugh:         People sometimes ask what prior legal experience has been       most useful for me as a judge. And I say, ``I certainly draw       on all of them,'' but I also say that my five-and-a-half       years at the White House and especially my three years as       staff secretary for President George W. Bush were the most       interesting and informative for me.    Judge Kavanaugh emphasized that the most interesting and informative  experiences he had were at the White House as Staff Secretary. So, of  course, the Senate Judiciary Committee ought to be able to review all  of the records of his time in the White House.   The scope of the request that Democrats on the Judiciary Committee  are proposing is so obvious and common sense that it is hard to believe  it is a topic of debate. In normal times, there would not be any  question about what the committee is entitled to see, and no  responsible Senate would object.   But these are not normal times. In these times, we have Senators  trying to cover for an irresponsible, dangerous President, who, like in  anything else he does, wants to bulldoze his nominee's way onto the  highest Court in the land for life.   In these not-normal times, the simplest of processes--getting access  to the records of a Supreme Court nominee--has become politicalized,  and in these not-normal times, we have to wonder why the standards have  suddenly changed, and we have to ask ourselves what could possibly be  hiding in those documents.   When the President proposes a nominee to the Supreme Court, we owe it  to ourselves and to our country to thoroughly examine that nominee's  record, to diligently question them about their records and judicial  philosophy, and to make a reasoned judgment about their fitness for the  job.   The American people rely on us in the Senate, and particularly in the  Judiciary Committee, to perform our constitutional advice-and-consent  duties to the best of our abilities.   So I urge my Republican colleagues to join us in calling for the full  release of all documents related to Judge Kavanaugh's record and  experiences. This has happened in the past. It has always happened, and  it should happen again.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
