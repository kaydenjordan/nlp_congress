 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of Mr. William Adamcak, who passed away on November 23, 2017, at  98 years of age.   Mr. Adamcak was a true patriot and an American war hero, serving in  World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war. He received the  Purple Heart for his service in D-day during World War II. Even though  he and the rest of the Allied forces faced heavy Nazi resistance, Mr.  Adamcak led his men through the infamous Omaha Beach and into the  French uplands, where they dug foxholes.   Huddled in their foxholes, they faced heavy mortar attack from the  Germans. But through Mr. Adamcak's bravery, training, and leadership,  he led his men to a successful completion of their mission.   Mr. William Adamcak was a living legend and hero, and I could not be  more honored to recognize this man from the Greatest Generation on the  House floor today. He will truly be missed.                            ____________________
