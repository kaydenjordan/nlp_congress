 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise today to honor Christopher  Evans, a teacher at Basha High School in my district.   Mr. Evans was one of 52 Americans who received the James Madison  Fellowship, which is awarded to one distinguished educator from each  State. This award recognizes exceptional teachers of American history  and social studies seeking ``to strengthen their knowledge of the  origins and development of American constitutional government, and to  expose our future leaders to the knowledge of the Nation's  constitutional heritage.''   I congratulate Mr. Evans on this achievement, and I know he has a  bright future in my home State of Arizona.                            ____________________
