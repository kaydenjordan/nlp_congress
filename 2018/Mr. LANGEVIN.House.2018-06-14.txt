 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to decry last week's Supreme  Court decision in the Ohio voting case, Husted v. A. Philip Randolph  Institute.   Mr. Speaker, the ruling appears to willfully misinterpret the plain  statutory language of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. It  lays waste to congressional intent and sets a dangerous precedent of  being permissive of voter suppression across the country.   The NVRA was enacted with the express purpose of increasing voter  registration and protecting against voter purges, and it plainly  prohibits States from removing voters from rolls ``by reason of the  person's failure to vote.'' Yet this is exactly what the State of Ohio  is doing. Ohio officials are purging voters if they do not vote in  three consecutive Federal elections.   I believe every person should vote in every election, but there may  be valid reasons why they have not. We should be erring on the side of  caution.   Our democracy is built on each person having a voice. Yet the Supreme  Court has affirmed Ohio's right to silence those voices. Congress must  now act to correct this injustice and restore the rights the Court has  so carelessly cast aside.                            ____________________
