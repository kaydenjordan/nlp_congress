 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to speak  about and reflect on the wonderful life of our former First Lady  Barbara Bush.   To those who knew her, they knew the amount of love and kindness she  exemplified every single day on this Earth.   She was a caring and compassionate wife, mother, and grandmother who  displayed true devotion to her country in all phases of her life.   I had the great honor of knowing Mrs. Bush and her family. I have  many fond memories of summertime with her and President Bush that my  family and I will cherish forever.   On April 21, the day she was laid to rest in Houston, Texas, the  congregation in that church and people all around the Nation remembered  her with great fondness and admiration.   Our country is better because of Mrs. Bush. She will always be  missed, but she will never be forgotten.   I hope all of you in this Chamber will join me for a moment of  silence to remember the life and legacy of former First Lady Barbara  Bush.   May God bless the Bush family and may God bless this great Nation  that is better because of her.                            ____________________
