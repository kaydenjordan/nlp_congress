 Mr. Speaker, as revelations of Russian  interference in our democracy continue to emerge, the need for a full  and transparent investigation by an independent commission could not be  more clear. The reason is simple: We need badly to restore trust in our  government.   Though the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have begun  related inquiries, neither will have fully investigated the activities  of the Kremlin or its agents. Not a single member of the administration  has testified under oath about their contacts with Moscow. The inherent  politicization of these committees has made it nearly impossible for  any congressional body to render the nonpartisan, irrefutable answers  the American people deserve.   As a member of the House Oversight Committee, I echo Senator John  McCain's call that Congress ``no longer has the credibility to handle  this alone.'' Now is the time for an independent commission to fully  investigate the ties between the Kremlin and the White House, along  with Russia's broader interference in our democracy.                            ____________________
