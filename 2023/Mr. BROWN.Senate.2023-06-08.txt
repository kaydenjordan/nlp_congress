 Mr. President, there is no better place in the entire  United States than Ohio for the Space Command Headquarters and their  additional units. Our State is ready to lead our military into the next  frontier.   And I rise because I don't know that my colleagues think--I  understand we all care about our own States, but I don't know that they  think enough about how my State has been for decades--literally  decades--in many ways, the premier aerospace State in this country. The  Wright Brothers are from Ohio, American heroes like John Glenn, and  Neil Armstrong. The story of modern aviation was written in Ohio.   Our State continues to lead the country in aerospace innovation and  in military service. We have nearly a million veterans in Ohio, and I  would like to call out--it is not really the purpose of the speech--but  call out one veteran in particular. My mother is from Mansfield, GA; my  dad is from Mansfield, OH. And my dad went off to war, and my mother  came to Washington to help in the war effort.   My dad, when he came back from overseas, went to a soldiers' dance at  the Mayflower Hotel, and my dad met my mom at that soldiers' dance--one  from Georgia, one from Ohio.   And my daughter, who runs the YWCA in Columbus, was in town last  night, and we decided to have dinner at the Mayflower Hotel. I am sure  it looks very different. It wasn't a soldiers' dance, but it was fun to  celebrate my parents and her grandparents.   Back to the subject directly on aerospace, on Space Command, think  about the military installations we have across my State. We have  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, of course, but the Air Force Research  Lab and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center and the Space  Force's National Space Intelligence Center.   We are home to the 88th Air Base Wing of the Air Force Life Cycle  Management Center, where they support our military aircraft, engines,  munitions, electronics, and cyber weapon systems. We have the Air Force  Materiel Command that keeps Air Force weapons systems ready for war.   Wright-Patterson has been a leader in military aviation development  since the time of airplane inventors like the Wright brothers. It is  positioned to lead us into the future.   Just 150 miles away is NASA Glenn Research Center--one of only 10 in  the country--at Lewis Field in Cleveland, and a few miles west in  Sandusky, near Lake Eerie, is the NASA Armstrong Test Facility. These  are facilities researching and developing and testing innovative  technologies, taking us to the next frontier.   We have the 178th Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance  Group at the Springfield Air National Guard Base. We have our Air Guard  and Reserve bases--Toledo, Springfield, my hometown of Mansfield.   It makes sense to base our country's space military leadership near  these important assets that make Ohio the right location for both the  U.S. Space Command headquarters and additional Space Force units.   Think about the opportunity for collaboration here. Having Space  Command located alongside the Air Force Research Lab will assist in the  creation of new space technologies and capabilities. The NASIC at  Wright-Patt is already the Space Force's intelligence center.   Close proximity to NASA Glenn and Armstrong Testing Facility in  northern Ohio will allow Space Command and Space Force to benefit from  their unmatched experience and expertise in space missions. The  Armstrong Testing Facility performs specialized research and testing  that can't be done--that can't be done anywhere else in the world.   Locating Space Command and additional Space Force assets in Ohio also  means that the world's leading trade schools, research universities,  Federal laboratories in Ohio, to our east Pennsylvania, to our north  Michigan, to our west Indiana, to our south Kentucky and Tennessee, and  Illinois are nearby, ready to work together to provide a pipeline of  workers to be on the frontline of the next frontier of modern warfare.  This proximity is, pure and simple, Mr. President, unmatched.   Ohio alone has a network of world-class research universities and  community colleges--14 4-year public universities and their 24 branch  campuses, 23 2-year community and technical colleges, nearly 60 4-year  private universities.   Moving Space Command and Space Force units here would be good for the  military, good for Ohio, good for our national economy.   Ohioans know how important aerospace sector jobs are to our State.  There is a direct line that runs from GE Aviation in Cincinnati through  the base and aerospace companies in Dayton and around Columbus and up  to NASA in Cleveland, touching thousands of Ohioans, reaching every  region of our great State.   With the CHIPS Act, we are bringing 10,000 good-paying, high-tech  jobs to central Ohio making semiconductors. If you don't think this  plays a role in our national security, ask the Chinese Communist Party  if they would rather the chips for our cars, phones, missiles, planes,  and satellites be made overseas. We are finally correcting that. We  finally understood as a nation that we can't continue to outsource  manual labor. We finally understand that chips should be made here-- they were invented here and should be made here; that light bulbs  invented here should be made here; that steel, where we led the world,  is coming back and building our bridges and all that we should be  doing.   We are already the center of the country for aerospace jobs. We are  going to be a major hub for semiconductors and manufacturing. Locating  our space military leadership near the domestic hub of both  semiconductors and aerospace innovation is good for Ohio's economy, and  it makes sense for our military. The military challenges of the future  demand that our servicemembers have the most innovative, cutting-edge  technology. Ohio and the entire Midwest make that technology.   It is not a partisan issue, Mr. President. It is not ideological  either. We have always worked together to support and grow these jobs  and to invest in Ohio's military installations. This is no different.   Ohio representatives from both sides of the aisle support this  effort. This letter is led on the Senate side by me and on the House  side by Republican   David Joyce from northern Ohio. Together we call  on the President to bring new space missions to Ohio.   It is simple: Ohio stands ready to meet the space-related national  security challenges the United States faces now and in the future. It  is how you bury the term ``Rust Belt.'' We bury it with the Air Force  Research Laboratory. We bury it with the National Air and Space  Intelligence Center. We bury it with the National Space Intelligence  Center. We are burying it with NASA. We are going to bury it with U.S.  Space Command and U.S. Space Force coming to Ohio.  [[Page S2021]]                             Nomination of Molly R. Silfen
