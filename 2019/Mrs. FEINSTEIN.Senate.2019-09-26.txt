 Mr. President, today I wish to bid a fond farewell  and recognize the excellent service of my longtime foreign affairs and  defense policy adviser, Christopher Gaspar.   Over the past 6 years, Chris has brought expertise, insight, and sage  advice across a wide range of defense policy, defense appropriations,  and foreign affairs matters that have benefited me directly and,  through his service, the Nation.   I have valued Chris's counsel on contentious issues to include Iran's  nuclear program and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to address  it; the Israel-Palestinian conflict; U.S.-China relations; human rights  issues in Saudi Arabia, Burma, and Tibet; national security space  launch; deteriorating conditions in Central American countries;  oversight of the U.S. nuclear arsenal; and U.S. counterterrorism  efforts across the globe.   The people of California largely don't know his name, but have  benefited from his dedicated work on numerous National Defense  Authorization Acts and Defense Appropriations Acts. He has helped enact  numerous provisions into law for the betterment of the State, including  securing seven C-130 tankers for California to fight wildfires, making  California's the largest wildfire aerial fleet in the country. He has  worked with our counties and cities to allow underutilized National  Guard facilities to be used to combat California's homelessness crisis.  This year, he led a comprehensive effort to investigate and draft  reforms to address shameful, substandard contract military housing to  meet the needs of our servicemembers and their families a provision  that I hope will soon be enacted in this year's defense bill.   Chris has been by my side for numerous sensitive meetings with  foreign leaders, ambassadors, military commanders, corporate chiefs,  and local officials, and he has always exhibited a level of  professionalism, dedication, and empathy that I deeply admire and  appreciate.   He has also helped California constituents facing issues abroad,  served as a valued mentor to junior staff, dedicated himself to liaison  relationships with the House of Representatives on coffee meetings,  proven himself to be an integral member of my appropriations team, and  was always ready with a quip--sometimes humorous--to help lighten the  mood.   Chris is moving on to the private sector----hopefully temporarily-- and will spend some much deserved down-time with his new wife. I wish  him all the best in his future endeavors, and my staff and I will  deeply miss him.   Thank you                            ____________________
