 Mr. Speaker, our colleagues object to guaranteeing the  peoples' right to vote through the vehicle of a NASA bill of all  things. A quarter of a century ago Republicans changed Texas State law  to permit astronauts to vote absentee from space. They want to make it  easier to vote from space, and they want to make it harder to vote on  Earth.   In the last election, tens of thousands of citizens in Texas waited  in line for 6 hours to vote and an astronaut on the International Space  Station could have orbited planet Earth four times in the 6 hours that  Texas forced some of its citizens to wait in line to vote.   Across the country it is voter suppression, GOP gerrymandering of our  districts, rightwing Supreme Court packing and judicial activism to  destroy the voting rights in cases like Shelby County v. Holder and  Brnovich and deployment of the filibuster to block voting rights  legislation--the whole matrix of GOP democracy suppression today.   It is time to protect the right to vote here on Earth. If it takes a  NASA bill to do it, then I invite my GOP colleagues to boldly go where  none of them have ever gone before--to planet Earth on a mission to  defend the voting rights of the people.
