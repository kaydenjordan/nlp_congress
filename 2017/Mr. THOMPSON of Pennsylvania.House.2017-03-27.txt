 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as chairman  of the Committee on Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition to honor The  Food Trust on celebrating 25 years of helping improve food security in  Pennsylvania.   The Food Trust is a nonprofit founded in 1992 in Philadelphia that  works to develop a stable food supply in underserved communities,  educate youth and family about healthy eating, and improve the  connection between urban communities and regional farmers.   A number of Food Trust programs have become national models that have  expanded beyond Philadelphia to other regions in need of healthy food  access and nutrition education. The Food Trust provides nutrition  education for youth and adults in Philadelphia and the wider region,  serving more than 70,000 lower-income individuals.   It also increases access to nutritious food in underserved  communities by operating a network of 22 farmers markets in lower- income city neighborhoods, which accept SNAP benefits for the use of  onsite wireless card readers.   I commend The Food Trust for the fine work it does promoting food  education and to ensure that no one goes hungry in America.   Congratulations on 25 years.                            ____________________
