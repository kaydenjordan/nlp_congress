 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the class  of 2022 graduates from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the  23 exemplary graduates from the State of Michigan.   From plebes to firsties, and now second lieutenants in the U.S. Army,  the class of 2022 has come through one of the most challenging and  rewarding experiences of their lives to join ``The Long Gray Line.''  The class motto, ``For Many, Stand the Few,'' reflects the class of  2022's commitment and moral, mental, and physical strength necessary to  graduate from West Point and serve as commissioned officers in the U.S.  Army. I commend the graduates for their dedication to support and  defend the American Constitution and uphold the ethical standards of  the Army and United States of America.   I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating, from  Michigan, Kathryn LeWalk, Spencer Alexander, Cedrick Everaert, Nicholas  Listermann, Sarah Guzzo, Teddy Prichard, Matthew Rushing, Alexander  Denha, Ryan McAuliffe, Taylor Hayes Ufford, Samantha Fusik, Carter  Macias, Megan E. Hutter, Nicholas McDonald, Grace Martin, Richard  Russel III, Benjamin Pyle, Cole Chappell, Mirriam Tolston, Emily Leahy,  Samantha Chinn, Michael Byrne, and Anamika Shresth. While their service  to our Nation has just begun, I am confident these new officers will  embody the values of ``Duty, Honor, Country.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the  retirement of Mr. Matthew E. McLogan, former vice president for  university relations and secretary of the board of trustees at Grand  Valley State University in Allendale, MI.   Matt McLogan began his 35-year tenure at the university by serving as  vice president beginning in September 1987. His extensive knowledge of  government relations and leadership of GVSU's marketing and  communications units, WGVU television, and radio furthered the success  of GVSU.   Matt has been instrumental in growing GVSU from an institution of  fewer than 9,000 students to a regional force with approximately 22,000  students. He often worked behind the scenes developing and securing  opportunities for students to improve their chances of success. In  addition, he has worked relentlessly to establish a stronger west  Michigan, including securing GVSU's place on the Medical Mile in  downtown Grand Rapids and pushing key initiatives with State and  congressional lawmakers.   In 1981, he was appointed public service commissioner for the State  of Michigan, serving 6 years in this role regulating the State's  investor-owned electric, gas, telephone, and water utilities. He was  also on the faculty of the annual National Association of Regulatory  Studies Program at Michigan State University, from 1983-1987.   In 1991, Matt was appointed by the Federal judiciary of the Western  District of Michigan to the Civil Justice Advisory Committee. This  committee was charged by Congress to develop new guidelines to speed  the disposition of civil court proceedings. In 1992, he was appointed  by Governor John Engler to the Utility Consumer Participation Board,  which oversees the representation of residential customer interests  before the Public Service Commission. In 1993, he became board  chairman.   In 1993, Governor Engler appointed Mr. McLogan as a special mediator  in the Ameritech excess earnings case; the agreement stemming from the  mediation was ratified by the Public Service Commissioner and led to  the creation of a special fund to support educational distance learning  projects. In 1996, he was appointed by the Governor to a 4-year term on  the State Officers Compensation Commission, a public body that sets  salary levels for Michigan's elected State officials; he became  chairman in 1998. Mr. McLogan also serves on the Board of the West  Michigan Botanical Garden (Frederik Meijer Gardens).   Matthew E. McLogan holds a BA and MA degrees from Western Michigan  University. He is a Michigan native, born in Flint in 1948. Matt is  married to Jane L. Brierley, and both are the parents of three  children: Katherine, born 1985; Molly, born 1988; and Timothy born  1992.   It is my honor to recognize the profound impact and accomplishments  Mr. Matt McLogan has made on Grand Valley State University and within  the broader Michigan community over the last 42 years.                            ____________________
