 Mr. Speaker, inaction from this House leaves us open to  Russian cyber attacks against our democracy, and the numbers tell the  story.   Sixteen months since Russians attacked, this House stands mute.  Eleven months since all four major U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed  Putin's direct involvement, and we have done nothing.   Eight Russians and Trump advisers met to discuss illegal Russian  Government assistance to the Trump campaign, 3 hours of face-to-face  meetings between President Trump and Putin, one of those hours with  absolutely no accountability to the American people, and 98 out of 100  Senators voted in favor of new Russian sanctions 34 days ago.   And finally zero. Zero action from this House to fight back. Zero  show of bipartisanship that mirrors our Senate counterparts. Zero votes  on the House floor to send the sanctions bill to the President.   Mr. Speaker, if you allow us to vote on this bill, it will pass with  overwhelming bipartisan support. And if you do not allow us to get  Russia sanctions to the President's desk and put the pressure on him to  sign it, you and the rest of this majority in the House will carry the  weight of our failure to stand up to Russia back to your districts in  August, and no one will understand how it is that you show weakness  when it is strength that is required in the face of Russian aggression.  That is what America expects and deserves.                            ____________________
