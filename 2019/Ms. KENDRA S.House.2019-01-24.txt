 HORN of Oklahoma changed her vote from ``nay'' to  ``yea.''   So the motion to recommit was rejected.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.    HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  address the devastating impacts this shutdown is having on families  throughout Oklahoma's Fifth District.   Over the Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday weekend, I went back to my  district and visited with impacted Federal workers. The stories of the  impacts were heartbreaking.   One of the things that stuck with me was speaking with a woman named  Tammy, who reminded me that it is not just the government that is  shuttered right now, but that families' lives are also being shattered.  That is, too often, the forgotten part of this conversation. We should  never use Federal employees, contractors, or their families as pawns in  a political disagreement.   So, while we are analyzing the current negative effects of this  shutdown, we also need to look at the long-lasting effects on families,  on our communities, and on the economy.   Simply put, we will be suffering the negative consequences of this  shutdown for years to come, and the stories I have heard from Oklahoma  families are the reasons I will continue to work to reopen the  government.                            ____________________
