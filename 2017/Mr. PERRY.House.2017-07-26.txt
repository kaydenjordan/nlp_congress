 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, our Nation is $20 trillion in debt, and  there might be $100 trillion or $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.  I am not sure we really know what the answer is there. But we have got  to find a way to reduce our spending and make sure that the things we  are paying for are worthy and that we are getting something--we are  actually getting what we are paying for.   I am offering an amendment to H.R. 3219 to reduce the appropriations  to the Congressional Budget Office by 50.4 percent.   We all know and agree the Congressional Budget Office is tasked with  determining the budget and economic impacts of proposed legislation  which are critical to our everyday decisions. Oftentimes, they are  late, and, unfortunately, too often they are woefully incorrect.   I don't mean to impugn the fine people who work at the CBO, but  something is amiss. If we keep on accepting it, how are we ever going  to get our policy right?   The CBO's fiscal analysis is consistently incorrect, and, as a  result, has detrimental implications on a variety of policies.   This amendment reduces the CBO's fiscal year '18 appropriations by  50.4 percent which just happens to be the exact same percentage that  the CBO was off when it predicted the enrollment numbers for the  Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2016.   In 2010, the CBO projected that 21 million people would enroll in the  exchange plans by 2016. The actual enrollment was about 10.4 million  people. That is an error of 50.4 percent, Mr. Chairman.   Now, maybe the CBO's projections would have improved as the ACA  continued to take shape after 2010, and that seems reasonable. That is  not correct. That is wrong. It didn't improve. Four years later, the  CBO predicted that, from 2016, between 23 and 25 million people would  receive coverage through the exchanges. In 2014, the updated CBO  analysis projected that 24 million people would receive coverage  through the exchange in 2016. However, the actual 2016 enrollment in  the ACA exchanges was 10.4 million people.   So it is less than half. They always predict about twice as much, or  costs twice as much, and the numbers always seem to be half as much.  That is a big deal.   We passed the American Health Care Act in here, and I went to my  townhall, and CBO is saying: well, 23 to 24 million people are going to  lose their insurance because of the American Health Care Act.   Well, yes, if you use the CBO's numbers which based the analysis on  what they projected.   They don't even look at reality. We have got the reality right now.  The reality is 10.4 million people, not 23 and 25 million--10.4. But  that is how they view this thing, and that is what we vote on here.  That is a problem.  [[Page H6412]]    I also want to highlight the failure of the CBO to forecast the cost  of the Medicaid expansion. In 2013, the CBO projected that 34 million  people would be on Medicaid or CHIP in 2016; however, in 2016, the CBO  doubled, once again, they doubled their earlier estimates to 68 million  people.   I mean, who gets to be off by that much and still receive--it is not  like there is no accountability; there isn't any accountability, Mr.  Chairman.   As a result, in March of 2016, the CBO increased its projection of  Federal spending for Medicaid by $146 billion. These are figures that  we make decisions on around here.   Mr. Chairman, the CBO simply must be held accountable for its  consistent failure to accurately or even reasonably predict budget and  economic impacts of legislation. CBO is a critical contribution to our  discussion and decisionmaking. We simply need to be able to depend on  it as such.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire of the time remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I don't disagree with my colleagues on the  other side. I said that. We need the CBO. We created the CBO. Congress  needs to have reliable information.   The problem is, it is not reliable. It is not reliable on the  testimony that was just given against this amendment. That is the  problem.   The CBO--right now where there are 10.4 enrollees--is telling us, in  2 years, there are going to be 25 million enrollees. Meanwhile, there  are less exchanges open, and there are fewer insurers available. It is  not going up; it is going down.   The CBO, when we say that they would reflect the current time, they  absolutely don't. That is the problem. They don't even reflect reality  when reality is right in front of them. The CBO needs to wake up. Who  among us works for half the time and gets it doubly wrong and gets the  same paycheck? The CBO.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking the  chairman of the full committee for his extraordinary work and for the  chairman of the subcommittee for this auspicious opportunity.   I have been listening to the arguments recently that we have had on  the floor regarding the most recent amendments between fossil fuels and  renewables, and I am hoping to strike a sweet spot here. I am not  picking on fossil fuels, and I am going to talk about a renewable that  I think everybody has an affinity for and an agreement with.   This amendment simply increases funding for hydroelectric through the  EERE by $15 million and decreases funding to the bureaucracy. There is  no increase to the budget. This amendment just increases the  appropriation for the Office of Energy and Efficiency and Renewable  Energy because hydropower is available in every region of the country;  2,200 hydropower plants provide America's most abundant source of  clean, renewable electricity. I would say it is the first renewable. It  accounts for 67 percent of domestic renewable generation and, clearly,  7 percent of total electricity generation.   By 2025, hydropower would create almost a million and a half new,  good, high-paying jobs. It can be implemented in rivers, harbors,  coastal areas, et cetera, to capture energy from currents and tides.  Harnessing this energy will create a truly and absolutely renewable and  green source of energy without any emissions and with little fanfare to  everybody involved.   Hydro is predictable year-round power output, while other renewable  source outputs can be variable in some areas and necessitate the use of  large battery banks and alternate power sources. For instance,  sometimes when the wind doesn't blow, believe it or not, if you don't  know it, there is a gas-fired generator often associated with those  windmill farms that has to come on because base load isn't being  serviced.   Hydropower facilities are quiet, unobtrusive, while many people  report that considerable noise is generated by wind power and that land  is taken up by huge solar farms.   Hydropower is base load energy. That means it is on all the time, 24  hours a day, 365 days a year, just sitting there turning out the power  so that you can hit the light switch when you come home and not wonder:  Is the power going to be on? It backs up other intermittent sources of  energy.  [[Page H6438]]    Hydropower is safe. It harms neither fish nor man. It all faces a  comprehensive and regular regulatory approval process.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, a lot of what we hear is is that our  constituents wish that we would work together more often, and I thank  the gentlewoman for her comments and her support; and I think it is  just proof that we can work together for something that we agree on,  which is clean power, the power to just power our future, and that  comes from hydroelectricity.   I don't know why it is not as sexy as it should be. I think it is one  of the greatest marvels of technology starting back since the beginning  of time and when power was first generated, and I don't understand why  we don't rely on it more.   To that end, literally 60,000 megawatts of preliminary permits and  projects await final approval and are pending before FERC in 45 States  right now. Eighty thousand--80,000--nonpowered dams in the United  States, of which 600 have immediate hydro capability, right now could  be producing energy.    Mr. Chair, 80,000 nonpowered dams in the United States, just think  about that. And the State I hail from and I am privileged to represent  a portion of, Pennsylvania, has 678 megawatts of untapped hydropower  right now.   Mr. Chairman, I would just urge all of our colleagues to vote for  this amendment.   I, again, appreciate the chairmen of the committee and of the  subcommittee for this opportunity, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank the Appropriations  Committee for the extraordinary work they have done in a very limited  amount of time.   This amendment would prohibit the use of funds to implement or  enforce the final rule published by the former Secretary of Energy,  entitled: ``Test Procedures for Central Air Conditioners and Heat  Pumps.''   Mr. Chairman, this is simply an example of too much Washington, too  much government. I am sure it was well-intended, but I am not sure if  the good idea fairies in Washington really realized fully what they  did.                                time  0000    Certainly we want to have test standards and so on and so forth, but  the one-size-fits-all approach that comes out of Washington misses some  folks and can cause some irreparable damage to businesses all around  the country.   And all around the country there are small manufacturers that are  trying to build some air-conditioners. In particular, there is one in  the district that I represent that builds custom-made air-conditioners  and heat pumps for skyscrapers and high-rise buildings.   If I can picture the scene, the original units are put in when the  buildings are being constructed. So there are cranes available, there  are openings in the walls and in the structure, and they just move the  stuff in, and then they close it all up.   In 10, 15, 20, 30 years later when they go to replace it, well, the  walls are in, the windows are in, the people are in, the offices are  in. There is no crane available, and they have to piece this thing  together through the elevator and into the closet. So this company,  like other ones around the country, make custom-made ones, each one for  a specific application--each one.   But the Department of Energy, and this rule in particular, says that  this company must test each model that they make for these efficiency  standards--each one--an arduous test taking months, if not years, in  documentation for one application.   Again, I am sure the Department of Energy was well-intended. However,  this rule is going to put a business out. They work in the city of  York, a fine city in central Pennsylvania, right downtown where we want  manufacturing to happen, where people can walk to work. These folks are  trying. They are struggling to survive in this economy, and the only  thing that is going to put them out is this regulation, Mr. Chairman.   While well-intended, it is not going to be helpful. These folks are  trying to do the right thing, but the government is getting in the way.   Believe it or not, Consumer Reports actually recommended against  buying some of these systems under this testing rule because the  systems had higher costs and poor repair records.   Believe it or not, Mr. Chairman, the free market actually fixes most  of this stuff. Most of us want to buy more efficient things that are  cheaper, that are easier to maintain, and have a better record. This is  Consumer Reports talking. This isn't Perry's record. This is Consumer  Reports talking.   Let us not put this company out of business. Let us not put these  companies out of business. Let us be responsible. I urge passage.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we are in agreement that the regulations  have to be in place. I, too, like the yellow sticker, just like she  does; and somehow the yellow stickers are in place without this new  rule. They are there right now. You have been seeing them for years.  This is new--this is a new regulation.   I would contend that, yeah, the manufacturers have gotten on board  and they have negotiated this rule. Because what choice did they have,  right?   The Federal Government is going to regulate. They are going to do it.  You either get in the game and play ball or you know what happens to  the bat. Right? They didn't want to be in that position, so they took  the best they could.   I am telling you and it is my contention that the free market is  going to figure this out because we all want the most efficient, the  most cost-effective, and the most maintenance-effective, whether it is  an air-conditioner, whether it is a car, or whether it is an electric  toothbrush.   We don't need the Federal Government telling us to do it. By the way,  this company has applied for a waiver, years in the making. They  literally have the president of the company spending almost, he said,  85 percent of his time dealing with Federal regulation compliance.   The president of the company is the guy who wants to hire these 125  people, go make sales, and produce things. Instead, all he is doing is  dealing with the Federal Government. Somehow, someway we all got to  this point.   It feels pretty cool in the Capitol right now, right? It feels pretty  cool in the House of Representatives.   The yellow labels were there before this regulation ever happened.   Mr. Chairman, I ask and urge the Members to vote in favor of the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
