 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, later this afternoon, the Senate is  scheduled to vote on the confirmation of Mr. Thomas Farr for the  Eastern District of North Carolina. I have made my opposition to this  nominee clear on a daily basis, but allow me to remind my colleagues,  to recap, before this vote just what we are dealing with here. We are  being asked to confirm the go-to guy in North Carolina if you need a  lawyer to defend voter suppression. Some might think that is  hyperbolic, but I sincerely ask my colleagues not to go for hyperbole  but to look at the evidence.   Mr. Farr was the lead lawyer in defending North Carolina's  discriminatory congressional maps drawn by the State's Republicans,  which were struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. This  is a very conservative Supreme Court, which has been mostly  unsympathetic to arguments of disenfranchisement--as evidenced by the  Shelby County case--but in this instance, they could not help but  overturn the map for racial discrimination, despite the evidence  provided by Mr. Farr.   Mr. Farr was also the lead lawyer in defense of North Carolina's  insidious voter ID law, which the Supreme Court ruled ``targeted  African Americans with almost surgical precision''--targeted African  Americans with almost surgical precision.   North Carolina's Republicans designed the law after asking for and  receiving data sorted by race on voting practices. Mr. Farr not only  defended the law, he described the voting restrictions, which forbade  the use of government employee IDs, student IDs, and IDs used for  public assistance, as ``a minor inconvenience.''   That is only Mr. Farr's recent history involving voting suppression.  If we go back and look at the campaign of Senator Jesse Helms in 1990,  Mr. Farr represented the Helms campaign and defended it against  accusations that it sent over 120,000 postcards, almost exclusively to  Black voters, that falsely warned them they could be charged with a  crime if they tried to vote--falsely--falsely warned them. The mailers  were sent after statistics emerged that African-American registration  was outpacing White voter registration.   The sordid history of Mr. Farr's efforts to suppress voting goes back  even further. Mr. Farr was a member of Senator Jesse Helms' 1984  campaign. In that campaign, he wasn't merely a hired gun; he was a  close legal associate of Senator Helms, a man David Broder of the  Washington Post called ``the last prominent unabashed White racist  politician in this country.''   In that 1984 campaign, according to memoranda by the Voting Rights  section of the Department of Justice, Mr. Farr was involved in the so- called ``ballot security'' program run by the Helms campaign and the  North Carolina Republican Party. The so-called ballot security program  included sending postcards to minority voters in an effort to suppress  voting.   In 2006, Mr. Farr's association with these noxious voter suppression  attempts by Helms' campaign was enough to deny him confirmation to this  very seat. In the intervening years, he has not repented or even moved  on to different issues. He is still defending attempts to  disenfranchise African-American voters.   I am not from North Carolina, but if I were, I would be embarrassed  to have this man nominated and placed on the Federal bench. It takes  but an ounce of principle to say: No, I am not defending discrimination  and voter suppression. Yet, time and time and time again, not just  1984, not just 1990 but 2013 and 2015, Mr. Thomas Farr has stepped up  to the plate to represent and defend voter suppression in a court of  law, and we are being asked to reward him--reward him for these  activities--with a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge in a  district that is 27 percent African American, where he will have the  power to make decisions on voting rights and civil rights for a  generation.  [[Page S7199]]    I prevail upon the conscience of my Republican colleagues, who I know  want to be fair to this man, look at the body of evidence impartially.  There is simply a preponderance of evidence that Mr. Farr was involved,  often intimately, in decades of voter suppression in North Carolina.  The standard for this vote is not whether or how Mr. Farr should be  punished or excoriated for what he did but a much higher one: whether a  man with this history deserves to be elevated to a lifetime appointment  on the Federal bench.   Whether you are Republican or Democratic, a liberal or conservative,  that has to be--has to be--disqualifying for a seat on the Federal  bench.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter, the special  counsel investigation.   To date, the special counsel's investigation has produced no less  than 35 indictments or plea deals--35--and that does not include two  additional guilty pleas of people initially investigated by Mueller but  were handed off to other branches of the Justice Department.   Just this morning, Michael Cohen has pled guilty to lying to Congress  about projects in Russia.   It is a reminder that there has been a remarkable volume of criminal  activity uncovered by the special counsel's investigation. No one,  especially not the President, can credibly claim that the investigation  is a fishing expedition. Calling Mueller's investigation a witch hunt  is just a lie--plain and simple, a lie.   The President's actions clearly show he has a lot to hide, that he is  afraid of the truth, and doesn't want Mueller or anyone else to uncover  it, but it hasn't stopped the President from repeating these lies. In  fact, in recent days, President Trump has escalated his attack on  Special Counsel Mueller. Almost daily, the President's Twitter feed is  littered with baseless accusations about the investigation. President  Trump retweeted an image of several of his political opponents,  including Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, behind bars. Can you  believe that? The Deputy Attorney General behind bars? And this is the  man--the President--our Republican colleagues refuse to call out  against?   Just yesterday, President Trump said this about a potential pardon  for Paul Manafort, now accused of lying to prosecutors and violating  his plea agreement. He said:         I wouldn't take it off the table. . . . Why would I take it       off the table?    That is a pardon.   Let's not forget, President Trump has already fired the Attorney  General and replaced him with a lackey without Senate approval. The  nominee's only qualification seems to be that he has a history of  criticizing the special counsel.   So this idea that we don't need to pass legislation to protect the  special counsel because there is no way President Trump will interfere  with the investigation is flatout absurd.   I once again call on my friend the majority leader to schedule a vote  on the bipartisan bill to protect the special counsel. If he continues  to refuse, we will push for the bill in the yearend spending agreement.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, next Friday, appropriations expire for 7  of the 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019, and we are in good  faith negotiations with our Republican counterparts here in the  Congress to get them enacted. The good news is that because of the  bipartisan work in the Senate, approximately 75 percent of the Federal  Government is funded for 2019. The bad news is that the 7 bipartisan  appropriations bills are hanging in the balance for one reason and one  reason only--President Trump.   President Trump has said that he wants to shut down the government  unless he gets $5 billion from the American taxpayers for an  unnecessary border wall. The President hasn't even tried to get Mexico  to pay for it, as he promised in his campaign over and over and over.  He hasn't outlined a plan to deal with eminent domain concerns or even  a plan as to how it would be built. He hasn't even spent the $1.3  billion Congress allocated last year in the fiscal year 2018 budget for  border security--fences, drones, technology--which actually makes  sense. Now he is asking, having not spent that money, for more. So this  isn't actually about border security. This is the President's way of  trying to manufacture a shutdown to fire up his base.   Make no mistake. The President is the only person who holds the  ultimate responsibility for a government shutdown. He can decide if we  are going to have one or not have one. He, certainly, has the power to  shut down the government, but he has two very reasonable ways to avoid  one.   First, he could agree to sign the bipartisan DHS appropriations bill  that the Senate Democrats and Republicans have already agreed to, which  includes $1.6 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion  that President Trump still hasn't spent from last year. It is just what  we have done in previous years--funding for fencing on the border where  the experts say it makes the most sense. It would protect our border  far more effectively and far more quickly than any wall.   Leader McConnell voted for that bill. Chairman Shelby voted for it,  as did Senator Rubio. Even Senator Graham, the President's strongest  supporter and closest ally in the Senate, voted for that bill. Now, all  of a sudden, it seems that the Republicans, afraid to buck the  President even when they know he is wrong, want to renege on that  agreement to go along with the President's shutdown plan. But it  doesn't have to be that way. This bipartisan negotiated deal remains on  the table and would, certainly, receive more than 60 votes in the  Senate.   Second, if the President doesn't want to agree to that bipartisan  bill, we could avoid a shutdown by passing a continuing resolution for  the Department of Homeland Security. We think it should be for a whole  year. It would keep the government open and still provide another $1.3  billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion the President  has not yet spent. Again, this option would, certainly, receive more  than 60 votes in the Senate.   So President Trump has a simple choice of two good bipartisan  options. If he decides to support either the bipartisan DHS bill or a  continuing resolution, I am confident that both would pass by  comfortable margins. The only position that cannot garner 60 votes is  the President's position. He is adamant  [[Page S7220]]  about having a partial shutdown. He keeps repeating over and over that  he wants a shutdown. Make no mistake about it. He is the only reason  there would be a shutdown.   If President Trump wants to throw a temper tantrum and shut down some  Departments and Agencies over Christmas, that is, certainly, within his  power, but he has two more sensible options available to him. It would  be a shame if the country suffered because of a Trump temper tantrum.  It is the President's choice.   I yield the floor.
