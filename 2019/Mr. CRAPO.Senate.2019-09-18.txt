 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call attention to National POW/MIA  Recognition Day through Senate statements, such as this, each year to  try to help keep national focus on the return of American  servicemembers and help their families to know that our country stands  with them as work continues to find the answers they more than deserve.   As we observe this National POW/MIA Day on September 20, 2019, a  special tribute must be paid to the families and friends of missing  servicemembers. Too often, their quiet, ceaseless, and enormous service  to our Nation is overlooked. Many have carried on through years and  even decades of sorrow and uncertainty. Their questions must be  replaced with answers. Their loss must be softened, if possible, by  resolution.   Those working hard through challenging conditions to get needed  answers and bring all American servicemembers home also deserve  appreciation and steady encouragement. Thank you to those who work for  and assist the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and related efforts.  So far this month, the agency has reported accounting for more than 20  missing servicemembers, many of whom were lost in the attack on Pearl  Harbor and the Korean war. Piecing together the circumstances,  whereabouts and lives of those lost cannot be easy, but bringing them  home is critical to honoring their service. To help with this effort, I  have continually fought for the Bring Our Heroes Home Act that is meant  to address obstacles preventing families and caseworkers from accessing  the records needed for recovery efforts by putting one entity in charge  of prioritizing and facilitating the declassification of records  related to missing servicemembers.   Thank you to the members of the POW*MIA Awareness Rally Corp. of  Pocatello, ID, and other similar groups that hold rallies and other  events to keep a spotlight on the immense service of our Nation's  veterans and the need for an ongoing focus on bringing them all home.  Bringing all of the 82,000 Americans the Defense POW/MIA Accounting  Agency reports remain missing home will certainly not fill the losses  felt in far too many American families, but those who have served our  Nation deserve no less than to rest at home, and we cannot rest until  they do.                            ____________________
