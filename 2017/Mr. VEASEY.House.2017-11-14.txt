 Mr. Speaker, the House and Senate Armed Services  Committees have demonstrated admirable bipartisanship in completing  this year's NDAA.   This past weekend, as I celebrated Veterans Day in the Dallas/Fort  Worth area by honoring local veterans, we spoke about the importance of  taking care of our servicemembers, and I think this year's NDAA does a  good job in doing that.   I am very proud of the assistance to legal permanent residents who  serve in our Armed Forces in understanding their naturalization  options. I am also very happy about investments we made in improving  diversity, such as the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program, grants for women  and minorities in STEM, and funding for HBCUs. I think that these  investments will yield a diverse and stronger national defense  workforce for our country's future.   I am also happy that we have continued support for the tactical  aircraft that are manufactured in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, which are  very critical to our local economy and our Nation's defense.   I am very happy to have been a conferee, and I am very proud of the  hard work that the committee staff has done to help complete this vital  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this conference  report, and I want to respectfully remind my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle how critical this funding is to our national security.
