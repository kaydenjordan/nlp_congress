 Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. So-called sanctuary cities  have become a safe haven for illegal immigrants who have committed  crimes. They undermine Federal law and put the safety of law-abiding  citizens at risk.   Kate Steinle was murdered in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant  who had seven felonies and had been deported five times. Where was  Kate's sanctuary?   We are a country of laws, and we must enforce them and hold  accountable anyone who violates them.   Sarah Root was killed by an illegal immigrant, street racing drunk.  Grant Ronnebeck was murdered in cold blood by working the nightshift at  a convenience store.   Mr. Speaker, no family should ever have to go through what these  families have faced.   Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act will help protect  our communities and help protect families from these senseless and  preventable tragedies.                            ____________________
