 Mr. Speaker, Republican tax scam tax cuts really are  only going to benefit giant corporations and the wealthy few, and what  working people will ever glean from this is minimal in scope and really  is just sort of a pittance in order to allow people who have more  wealth than they can possibly even count to just get more.   This tax cut, this massive tax cut, would wipe away healthcare  coverage for millions of workers, give multinational corporations and  foreign investors a giant payday, and it paves the way for more cruel  cuts, cutting programs that will benefit Americans.   It is a moral abomination. It is wrong. It is giving more to those  who already have too much and taking from those who already are  struggling to make ends meet. But, sadly, it is just another example of  how Republicans and their billionaire buddies are in it for themselves  and not the American people.   I would like to talk about another important example, because you  have to look at what is going on in our Supreme Court together with  these tax cuts and other programs to understand how much damage  Republican leadership means to the American people.   Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard a case. It was Janus v. AFSCME.  Janus, as the case is called, is yet another attack on the right to  organize your workplace and negotiate for better wages and benefits and  safer workplaces.   Over the last several decades, big companies and their conservative  allies in Congress have attacked the right to collectively bargain.                                time  1030    The attacks on workers have led to stagnating wages for workers and  greater income inequality. This case is no different. It is being  bankrolled by the usual suspects: the Koch brothers and their  billionaire allies.   Janus will determine whether public sector unions that represent  teachers, firefighters, police officers, and nurses in States and  cities across this country can collect fees from all of the employees  in the workplaces that they represent.   This case is about whether millions of hardworking public sector  workers will have the freedom and the resources to stand together and  fight for a better future for themselves and their families. But it is  also about the corrosive power of money in politics. It is about the  millions of dollars wealthy donors spent to hold a Supreme Court seat  open for over a year; the millions more that were spent to elect  President Trump so that he could fill that seat with Neil Gorsuch; and  the millions of dollars that the Koch brothers and the Bradley  Foundation, two organizations devoted to cutting government services  for Americans and weakening unions, spent to fund the Janus case.   And today, now that the bought-and-paid-for court has heard the case  that will deliver a blow--we hope it doesn't, but likely it will--to  the public service workers and the unions that represent them, their  investment appears to be paying off.   Here is the thing: millionaires and billionaires who fund these  antiworker and antiunion attacks are petrified about the labor  movement. They are absolutely afraid of it. That is why they have been  working to attack it.   That is because the labor movement is premised on the simple idea  that, when workers come together, they can fight for their fair share  of the wealth that they helped to create and because the labor movement  is about equality and a fair economy that works for everyone, not just  a few.   That is why wealthy donors have worked to eliminate and cut union  representation; that is why they engage in union busting; that is why  they funded the Janus case; and that is why they continue to keep  kicking working people in the teeth over and over again.   This Republican tax scam is only part of the restructuring of  American democracy where we take from working Americans, give to the  wealthiest, and then try to deprive through the courts people's right  to organize collectively on their job.   But hardworking Americans are standing up, hardworking Americans are  banning together, and hardworking Americans are not going to allow a  prosperous life for themselves and their families to be taken away so  easily.   This Janus case is something that I urge everybody to look into. It  represents another attack on the American working class, but the  American  [[Page H1273]]  working people are standing up stronger than ever and will come back  stronger than ever.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, allow me to just thank the gentleman from the great  State of Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and also Congressman Pittenger, as well as  many other members of the Financial Services Committee on both sides of  the aisle. It is always a pleasure to be able to work together on  things. This is what our constituents expect, and that is what the  Credit Access and Inclusion bill actually represents.    So, Mr. Speaker, if I told you that we could help millions of people  get access to an apartment, lower the cost of a loan, lower the deposit  they may have to put down on a phone or utility deposit, and we could  do all these things without creating a new government program, we could  do it without government mandate, and we could do it with virtually no  new tax dollars, would you take that deal? Because I would. I would  say: Wow, help millions of people be able to afford services that they  need before, lower the cost of loans? Yeah, why wouldn't we do that?  Well, the truth is that we can if we vote ``yes'' on the Credit Access  and Inclusion bill.   I am proud to tell you that this particular piece of legislation,  which is bipartisan, will bring about basic fairness in the credit  scoring system. Credit is currency in our society. It unlocks credit  for access to goods and services. Hardworking Americans need to build  some economic security for themselves and their families.   There are currently about 26 million people, or 1 in 10 Americans,  who do not have a credit record; and there is another 19 million  Americans who do not have enough information to even score. Low-income  individuals and even racial and ethnic minorities are even in worse  shape. About one in four Latinos and African Americans either don't  have a credit score or don't have enough information in the file to get  a score.                                time  1545    And almost half of the residents of low-income communities do not  have a score of any background.   This bill allows credit rating agencies to use on-time rent, phone,  and utility payments when determining credit scores.   Now, you should know, Mr. Speaker, if people are late with these  lines of information, it can, and often does, show up on their credit  score now. And if people take out loan products which they pay back on  time, that helps those people's credit score now.   But what about the people who pay phone bills and utility bills, and  they pay their bills every month on time? They are not building  anything to help them get in a better credit situation. This bill  allows them to do that.   As a result, more than a third of previously unscorable Americans  will now have access to prime credit and the opportunities that come  with it when we pass this bill.   This bill isn't just about access to credit, though. It is also about  saving hardworking Americans real money, thousands of dollars, on car  loans and their mortgages.   Mr. Speaker, if you are unscorable, you can often get a loan, but the  interest rate is always higher when that happens. So, if people are  scorable and they get a credit score, they will be able to save money  for themselves and put it into their household budget.   The money that used to be going to auto lenders and mortgage brokers  is now going to go into the pockets of consumers so that they can  improve the lives of their family. That sounds like a pretty good day's  work to me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge a ``yes''  vote on the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
