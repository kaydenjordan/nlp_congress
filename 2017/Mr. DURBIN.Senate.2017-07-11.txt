 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I represented the congressional district  of Springfield, IL, for 14 years, and this is my 21st year in the  Senate. It is a big State with 102 counties. We are proud of our  diversity in our State, which runs from the great city of Chicago, to  deep, deep Southern Illinois, to a town of Cairo, IL, which is  literally south of Richmond, VA, by latitude. They grow cotton down  there in the State. So it is a very big and diverse State. I am proud  to represent it.   I have spent some time doing my best to understand the challenges  that businesses, individuals, and families face and to measure their  sentiments on issues over the years.   For the last several months, I have spent my time visiting every  corner of downstate Illinois, which is the more rural, smalltown area  of our State outside of Chicago. It is more conservative politically.  President Trump ran well in some parts of downstate Illinois. And I  have been in this area--representing it, growing up in it--to measure  what I consider to be the topic and issue of the day, and that is the  issue of healthcare in America. It is an issue which each of us takes  very seriously and personally because each of us is called on in a  variety of different ways in our lives to have healthcare for ourselves  and our family--the people we love--at critical moments.   We are now engaged in a national debate about the future of  healthcare in America. The Republicans control the House, the Senate,  and the White House, and have been from the beginning opposed to the  Affordable Care Act, which was passed under President Obama. I voted  for it. I think it was the right vote. I think it has achieved a great  many things. I hope we can build on it to make an even better  healthcare system for our Nation. It is not perfect. There are areas  that need to be changed, improved, and areas that I think need to be  strengthened over the long haul to make sure America has more fairness  when it comes to healthcare for our people.   Last week, I visited about a half dozen healthcare facilities in  Illinois. I jokingly said to my staff that I have come to know hospital  administrators in my State far better today than I ever have.   Here is what they told me. They told me the healthcare bill that  Senator McConnell has proposed in the U.S. Senate would be devastating  to the families, the patients, the employees, and the healthcare  facilities in our State. They told me that nearly $800 billion in  Medicaid cuts would cripple rural hospitals and health clinics. Not  only would this harm patients in rural communities, but 35 percent cuts  in the Medicaid Program would also cost jobs in Illinois. The Illinois  Hospital Association in my State estimates that the Republican bill,  which passed the House and now is being considered in the Senate, would  cost us 60,000 healthcare jobs.   I went to Granite City, IL, which is near the St. Louis area. I met a  young woman named Sam, who has Down syndrome and her mother Missy. They  are worried about the Republican plan to cap Medicaid spending. Sam's  health needs can't always be anticipated. There are not some that can  be capped in terms of future needs, and the amount of care can hardly  be determined in advance for this young woman who is doing her best to  lead an active and involved life facing this disability, which she  does. This is so true for so many people nationwide.   Some of my Republican colleagues in Illinois have said: We just don't  understand why Medicaid as a program has grown so much. Well, it may be  hard to understand until you look inside the program and realize what  it does. Medicaid may have started as a small idea, but it has really  grown into a major provider of healthcare in America. In my State of  Illinois, it is responsible for paying for the prenatal care, birth,  and care of mothers and their children after they have been born for  more than 50 percent of the kids.   It is an important provider of healthcare resources to our school  districts in Illinois, which count on Medicaid to help them take care  of special needs students--counselors, psychologists, transportation,  even feeding tubes for those who are severely disabled. It is a  critical program as well for the disabled community, like Sam and young  men and women who are victims of autism or Down syndrome who want to  lead a full life but need health insurance. Medicaid is their health  insurance.   One woman said to me in Champaign, IL, my 23-year-old son is  autistic. He counts on Medicaid, and, Senator, if I don't have  Medicaid, my only recourse is an institutional program that would cost  us over $300,000 a year. It is impossible for us to even consider that.   So those who would cut back on Medicaid spending in the name of  flexibility and saving money or generating enough to pay for a tax cut  for wealthy people would leave people just like those I have described  in a terrible circumstance.   I haven't described the largest cost of Medicaid. The largest cost in  Illinois and across our Nation is the Medicaid services and benefits  provided to those who are older--mothers, grandmothers in nursing  facilities and care facilities  [[Page S3909]]  who count on Medicaid along with Medicare and Social Security for the  basics in life.   I heard from Kevin. He is a worker from Urbana, IL, who is worried  that the Senate Republican bill is going to increase his out-of-pocket  expenses by thousands of dollars. He is worried because he fits into an  age category which would see premiums go up dramatically in costs under  the Republican bill. The Affordable Care Act, which we passed under  President Obama, set limits on the increases in premium costs so no  premium paid would be more than three times the cost of the lowest  premium that is paid for health insurance in our country. Well,  Republicans have changed that. In both the House and Senate, they have  raised that to five times. So it means for people, particularly between  the ages of 50 and 64, they are going to see a substantial increase in  their premiums because of that Republican provision. People are  following this closely enough to know that when premium costs go up for  many of them, it becomes impossible to buy the coverage they need.   As I returned to Washington, I once again face the reality of what  this Republican healthcare plan would mean. The nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office told us the bill would cost 22 million  Americans health insurance coverage--cutbacks in Medicaid as well as  cutbacks in private insurance. Think of that. I don't know how the  Republicans in our State can go home and explain why a million people  in Illinois are about to lose their health insurance in the name of  healthcare reform.   I can tell you the notion of repealing the Affordable Care Act may  have had some surface political appeal until you realize you might be 1  of the 1 million people in my State who ends up with no health  insurance when it is all over. It would cut Medicaid dramatically, as I  have mentioned, and then keep cutting--a 35-percent cut over the next  20 years--with devastating impacts on hospitals, clinics, and many  other facilities.   By 2020, average premiums in the individual market would increase by  76 percent under the Republican plan. Costs would skyrocket even higher  for seniors, rural communities, and those with medical needs.   What happens to people with preexisting conditions under the  Republican repeal bill? One out of three Americans has a preexisting  condition. In the old days, they couldn't buy insurance or, if they  could, couldn't afford it because they had a history of cancer in their  family, diabetes, heart disease. Well, this Republican plan would take  away the protections of the Affordable Care Act. It would allow States  to waive essential healthcare benefits, like maternity care, mental  health treatment, substance abuse treatment. People in need of these  services would be left to fend for themselves.   The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the Republican bill, and it  said: ``People who used services no longer included in the Essential  Health Benefits would experience substantial increases in out-of-pocket  spending on health care, or would choose to forgo the services.  Moreover, the ACA's ban on annual and lifetime limits . . . would no  longer apply.''   With this scathing analysis from the Congressional Budget Office,  what did the Republican leadership decide to do? Instead of addressing  these challenges straight on, they retreated. They shut themselves off  behind closed doors and tried to cut a deal within the 52 Republican  Senate Members here to pass this measure, as bad as it is. There was  not one hearing on this bill--on the Republican healthcare bill--no  markups, no amendments, and no support from medical advocates in any  part of our Nation. There was no input in the Senate from any Member  outside the Republican caucus.   They want to call this bill right away, and it is understandable. The  longer it sits out there and the longer people get to know it, the less  they support it. You know we still haven't seen the final language.  Why? Because Republicans continue to work in secret on a bill that  literally impacts one-sixth of the American people and every single  person in our country.   This measure affects everybody. Even if you get your insurance  through your employer or Medicare, this bill would make Medicare go  insolvent sooner and allow employers to, once again, impose annual or  lifetime limits on care under their health insurance plans.   Now, the latest we have heard is that the Republicans are meeting in  secret, making some changes to this bill. They may be throwing some  money at the opioid crisis facing America, but that will not make up  for kicking 15 million people off of Medicaid. The amount of money they  are talking about to deal with the opioid crisis is literally  inadequate to deal with the seriousness of that issue or to provide the  substance abuse treatment people currently receive from Medicaid who  will be cut off under the Republican plan.   Cutting Medicaid, our best tool to fight the opioid epidemic, and  offering a coupon for drug treatment is a cruel step backward. If it  ends up buying a vote on the Republican side, shame on my colleagues  for selling out so cheaply.   Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is not fooled. He called this  idea of a special opioid fund to win some votes on the Republican side  ``like spitting in the ocean.'' I called Governor Kasich this last  week. He and I came to Washington together many years ago. I have known  him, and I like him. We disagree on some political issues, but he is  very forthright and frank. He has warned us that what is going to  happen to Ohio is going to happen to the Nation, if the Republicans  have their way with their healthcare bill.   We have also heard the Republicans are considering adding provisions  that allow insurers to offer bare-bones plans. I have just heard some  more about this today, and I believe the author of this idea is the  junior Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz.   Here is what he says: If your State offers a health insurance plan  that complies with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, then  you may offer it to other consumers in the State insurance plans that  do not. He says it gives consumers choice. Well, it sure does, but look  at the choice it gives them because if he is aiming for lowering  premium costs by offering health insurance plans that are junk plans,  health insurance plans that are fake insurance, the net result is going  to be people paying a lot more in copays and deductibles and a lot less  coverage when they definitely need it.   There are a couple other things it will do. Because these younger  healthier people will buy the cheaper plans believing they are  invincible, it will end up raising the cost of premiums for those who  buy other insurance. The discrimination, in terms of premium costs,  will be dramatic, and that, in and of itself, could be damaging to  people all across the United States.   So Senator Cruz believes that offering junk insurance plans and  telling the consumers we are giving you a choice is going to answer the  needs across America. It will not. It will raise premiums on everyone  else. It will provide inadequate coverage for those who buy these  plans, and sadly many of them are going to be facing deductibles and  copays they just can't handle. That is no answer. It may be a political  answer to get his vote, but it is certainly not a credible answer.   We have had this before the Affordable Care Act, and do you remember  what it was like? People got sick and found out their insurance didn't  cover what they needed. Women who were pregnant found out their plans  didn't cover maternity or newborn care. People who were diagnosed with  a mental health condition found out their insurance covered no  treatment for mental illness. So what good is insurance if it doesn't  care for the most basic and essential needs of Americans?   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we changed it. We required that  policies provide real insurance for real families. Do you know what  happened, in addition to providing more care for people across America?  The number of bankruptcies, personal bankruptcies, have been cut in  half since the Affordable Care Act passed. Why? The No. 1 driver of  personal bankruptcy and family bankruptcy in America was medical  bills--medical bills that were beyond the payment of an ordinary  person. There are fewer of those today because of the Affordable Care  Act.   Senator Cruz's plan for selling fake insurance or junk insurance  plans that will not be there when you need them,  [[Page S3910]]  I can just tell you it means more business for the bankruptcy court. It  would banish those with preexisting conditions to the world of sky-high  premiums, all in the name of Senator Cruz's freedom of choice. Well,  freedom isn't free when it comes to relegating so many Americans to  such a precarious state when it comes to health insurance. No matter  how much the Republican Senators tinker around the edges, they are  dealing with a flawed, unfixable bill.   The American people oppose any bill that rips health insurance away  from millions of individuals and families, they oppose any bill that  causes nearly 1 million people nationwide to lose their jobs, and they  are also opposed to a Republican health insurance plan that would cost  coverage for half a million American veterans.   The American people oppose any bill that hurts those with preexisting  conditions. They oppose a bill that throws millions of people off  Medicaid and slashes billions in Federal funding to hospitals,  healthcare clinics, and schools.   The American people oppose any bill that is rejected by every major  medical and patient group. The Republican bill is opposed by the  American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association,  nurses, pediatricians, AARP, heart, diabetes, and lung associations.  How can you write a bill that draws that much opposition? They did it.  They did it behind closed doors, and they don't want you to see what  they are doing with it now.   Finally, the American people oppose any bill that takes away nearly a  trillion dollars in healthcare in order to provide hundreds of billions  of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and large  corporations. Case in point: Of the 145 pages of the Senate repeal  bill, 94 pages are devoted to slashing Medicaid and providing tax  breaks to the wealthiest Americans and pharmaceutical companies.    Last week, one conservative writer penned an article which said that  it gives conservatism a bad name when we are giving tax breaks to the  wealthiest people in order to cut and eliminate health insurance for  the poorest people in America. That is exactly what this bill does.   I am glad the Senate Republicans have delayed their vote on this  repeal, but many have not given up. In all of my townhall discussions,  the plea from Illinois people has been clear: Improve the Affordable  Care Act; don't repeal it.   So where do we go from here?   First, Republicans need to take repeal off the table. We need 3  Republicans out of the 53 to say this is the wrong way to go about it.   Second, President Trump must stop undermining the stability of the  marketplaces with his uncertainty and sabotage.   Third, we need to work together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen  our current system. We need to address the price of pharmaceutical  drugs. The current bill and law does not. That is the biggest driver,  according to Blue Cross in Illinois, of premium increases--the cost of  pharmaceutical bills. We need to build competition through a Medicare- like public option available to everyone who chooses it across the  United States.   Some Republicans, including Senator McConnell, have said that the  Republicans have to do this by themselves because the Democrats refuse  to work with them. That is simply not true. We are here. We have been  here all along, and we want to have a hearing. Bring in some experts.  Let's just have a meeting. That would be a breakthrough.   Democrats have asked the Republicans to join us. Let's sit down  together, informally, like grown-ups, and address this issue in a  responsible fashion. We are ready and willing to work on legislation to  improve the individual market for the 6 percent of the people who  purchase their insurance there. I fail to see how gutting Medicaid and  throwing 22 million Americans off of health insurance in order to  provide tax breaks for rich people does anything to help that 6  percent.   This is a critical moment when it comes to healthcare across America.  It is unfortunate that we are now considering a bill that was revealed  only 2 weeks ago, a bill that has never been subject to a hearing  before any committee, a bill that has never been amended in an open  process.   When it came to the Affordable Care Act, over 140 Republican  amendments were adopted. The Republicans haven't offered us an  opportunity to offer one amendment to their proposal--not one. It is a  take-it-or-leave-it, closed-door deal. That is not the way the Senate  was designed to work. It is not the way the American people want us to  work. They expect us to work in a constructive fashion on a bipartisan  basis to solve the problems facing our Nation. The biggest single  problem is giving peace of mind to Americans and American families  across the Nation that they have healthcare they can count on and  afford.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to recognize  WATT Global Media, a leading provider of business information and  marketing solutions for the agribusiness industry worldwide,  headquartered in Rockford, IL. More than 100 years ago, on July 6,  1917, WATT Global Media was born.   WATT Global Media's history began in 1917, when J.W. Watt and Adon  Yoder purchased ``Poultry Tribune,'' a magazine published monthly for  just 50 cents for an annual subscription. Before Watt and Yoder bought  the magazine, its circulation was about 5,000. In a few short years,  these young entrepreneurs grew the magazine's circulation by 400  percent. Under Watt's leadership, ``Poultry Tribune'' quickly became  ``America's Leading Poultry Farm Magazine'' for poultry raisers,  peaking in 1940 with a circulation of more than half a million readers.   During the mid-1920s, economic changes in the poultry industry led to  the creation of the commercial hatchery industry, which led the staff  at ``Poultry Tribune'' to create ``Hatchery Tribune.'' In 1934, Watt  added ``Turkey World'' to its growing list of publications. WATT Global  Media, originally called the Poultry Tribune Company, changed its name  in 1944 to Watt Publishing Company. In that same year, the company  acquired Better Farming Methods, ``The business magazine for leaders  who train and advise farmers.'' As the evolving poultry industry grew,  so did Watt Publishing Company.   In 1949, Leslie Watt--the second generation of family leadership--was  named president of Watt Publishing Company and expanded the company  into international markets, acquiring ``Industria Avicola,'' a Spanish  language magazine targeting the Latin American poultry industry. In  1962, ``Poultry International'' was created to cater to the poultry and  egg industries throughout Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia. In the  1980s, Leslie Watt took Watt Publishing Company to China by  establishing ``Poultry International China Edition'' and became one of  the first publishers from North America to make Chinese language  business-to-business magazines in the People's Republic of China.   In the 1990s, under James W. Watt--the third generation of family  leadership--the company expanded its portfolio to include pet food. In  1993, the Petfood Forum was created and grew into the world's largest  annual event of its kind. Overnight, Watt became the global pet food  market leader for business information--what an accomplishment.   Greg Watt--the fourth generation President and CEO--modernized the  company by taking it into the 21st century, expanding across multiple  media channels, including online and digital platforms, live events,  and magazine channels. In recognition of its global audience, the Watt  Publishing Company changed its name to WATT Global Media in 2014.  Today, WATT Global Media serves 180,000 professionals in the pet food,  poultry, pig, and animal feed industries from over 140 countries.   I will close with this: In 1907, J.W. Watt came to this country from  the Orkney Islands, just north of Scotland. He came in search of the  American Dream, and boy, did he find it. Despite WATT Global Media's  growth and many achievements, its proudest accomplishment is that it  has been family-owned for 100 years, and this family business isn't  going anywhere. I want to thank J.W. Watt, Leslie Watt, James W. Watt,  and Greg Watt--four generations from the Watts family--for their  service to Rockford, Illinois, America, and throughout the world. I  know the good people at WATT Global Media will continue its simple  guiding mission: ``to improve the health and well-being of people and  animals across the globe.''   I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating WATT Global Media  on 100 years of accomplishments, and I wish them all the best for  another century of success.                            ____________________
