 Mr. President, I rise today to commend and  celebrate Ser Familia, an organization in Atlanta focused on helping  Georgia's Latino families gain the tools and resources to solve  challenges and flourish in their communities.   Natives of Puerto Rico, Belisa and Miguel Urbina cofounded Ser  Familia in 2001. For more than 20 years, Ser Familia's vision to assist  Latino families reach their full potential and become contributing  members of their communities has changed the lives of hundreds of  families across Georgia. From teaching youth character building and  leadership skills to offering counseling services on behavioral and  mental health, Ser Familia continues to expand its positive impact on  the Latino community by developing programs that are tailored to  address the greatest needs of youth, couples, parents, and families.   As I have said before, the State of Georgia is home to a vibrant and  diverse Latino community, and I am grateful for the extraordinary  contributions of people like Belisa and Miguel Urbina who work  tirelessly every single day to guarantee that all members of the Latino  community have access to opportunities that help them thrive. I have  enjoyed working closely with Belisa and Miguel to deliver the resources  to help Ser Familia open a family resource center in Clayton County,  helping expand their comprehensive services to the community.   I join with our Latino community to commemorate the remarkable work  and contributions of Ser Familia to the Atlanta community, the State of  Georgia, and the United States. Their leadership is a reminder of the  outstanding contributions of Latino Americans who are committed to  moving Georgia and our country forward.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, it is my honor to recognize and commend  Belisa and Miguel Urbina for their service on behalf of Georgia's  Latino families and congratulate them on Ser Familia's success.                            ____________________
