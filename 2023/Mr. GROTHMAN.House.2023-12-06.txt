 Mr. Speaker, I am going to try to talk about some  issues that our press corps has not adequately covered. All of these  issues will be brought to the fore sometime in the next 3 months, and  well-informed citizens should have an opinion on them. That means that,  to a degree, the press corps has to do a good job of educating the  citizenry on these issues.   The first issue I am going to talk about one more time is  immigration. There is some time in the next 8 weeks in which an  agreement is going to have to be reached regarding the huge problems we  have on the southern border. These problems have been largely ignored  under the Biden administration, and it is time that something be done.   I want to recount right now that, in the most recent months, we are  having about 240,000 people cross the southern border. Every month, we  hit new records for that month. In October, we again exceeded where we  were 12 months ago and 24 months ago.   In addition to the fact that we have about 240,000 people crossing  the southern border, we have a situation in which about 9,000  unaccompanied minors, people under the age of 18, are coming here  without either parent.   We also have a situation where of the about 240,000 people who are  crossing the border, about 60,000 are what they call got-aways. In  other words, they have had no contact at all with the officialdom of  the United States Government. Of course, these people are particularly  dangerous because they haven't even gone through the perfunctory check  that other people go through when they show up at the southern border.   It should also be pointed out that the United States is not being  pikers at all when it comes to allowing other people into this country.  The American citizenry should know that, in the most recent year  available, over 1 million people were sworn in as new citizens to the  United States. This is the third highest on record at a time when we  are following a year that was over 900,000. We are kind of in  unprecedented territory for a 2-year period.   When I was a child in the 1960s, by comparison, about 100,000 people  a year were sworn in in the United States. We worked that way up in the  1980s to be about 200,000.   So, when we say 1 million people a year are being sworn in as  citizens of the United States, we are really changing things in this  country. As a result, nobody can say or should be able to say that we  are not doing our fair share in welcoming more people into the United  States.   It should also be pointed out that the number of people who are being  deported from this country is now a fraction of what it was a few years  ago. In fiscal year 2019, about 270,000 people were deported. In the  most recent year available, that number has fallen to 72,000.   On one level, we are multiplying the number of people coming across  the border by a factor of 10, and then once people come here and break  the law or whatever, we are now kicking out or deporting about one- quarter of the number that we were 4 years ago.   The Biden administration has not cared about this at all. However,  there are going to be multiple discussions with the Biden  administration not only with regard to appropriations bills that are  coming up but supplemental bills that are coming up.   This is the biggest crisis facing America today. We are permanently  changing the United States by allowing this many people to come across  the border.   I want to point out to the American public that John Adams said that  our Constitution was fit for a moral and religious people and totally  unfit for anybody else.   Insofar as we are allowing people in our country who do not have a  love of freedom and who want to turn their lives over to the  government, we are going to ruin our country. It will no longer be the  wonderful country that we grew up in. When we invite this many  inappropriately vetted people, that is a definite concern.   There is also a concern for the American Government. We are right now  in a position where we are borrowing 22 percent of our budget. A  significant number of people crossing the southern border are going to  have to be taken care of by the Federal Government. They won't be able  to find jobs. Not only will they not be able to find jobs, but they are  coming here without complete families. Their children are going to be  educated. President Biden promised during the 2020 election that he  would provide free healthcare to people coming here illegally. We are  doing that. That is also very expensive at a time when we don't have  money for more.   As a result, I think it is a situation that has to be cleaned up and  finished before we pass any more of what we call supplemental bills in  this Chamber.   In particular, people are asking for tens of billions of dollars in  aid to Ukraine. I think everybody would like to see them get that  money, but at a time when we are having to flood money in to take care  of people crossing the southern border, I don't think we have that  money until that problem is cleaned up.   I hope the American citizen is paying attention to this.   Again, to summarize, 10 times as many people are crossing the border  as there were 4 years ago. The number of people being kicked out,  usually for breaking the law, being deported, is about one-quarter of  what it was 4 years ago. The number of people who are being sworn in  legally--when people say, oh, we ought to let some people here--there  are over 1 million right now. We are near historical highs on that  level.  [[Page H6205]]    I hope the American press corps reports these numbers. They should  certainly be in the paper. It should certainly be in the paper when  eventually we get new information on the number of people who have come  into this country in November.   Mr. Speaker, all you have to do is look on television to see it is  getting worse and worse. That is an issue that not much attention is  being paid to.    The next thing I want to talk to the American public about is what we  call appropriations bills. Here in Congress, if things are done right,  we do not pass one budget at the end of the year. We pass 12 separate  bills as we divide the government into 12 separate agencies.   There are disagreements between the House and the Senate regarding  each one of those bills. However, one of the things that touches all of  these bills is the degree to which the Federal Government is going to  get involved with diversity regarding what we could call affirmative  action--or an obsession with judging people by their race or judging  people by their gender. This is a debate that is going to be had  between the Republican-led House and the Democratic Senate right down  the line.   We have had a situation where we have been identifying people by race  since Lyndon Johnson really kicked this into gear in 1965. At that  time, companies that had at least 50 employees and did over $100,000 of  business with regard to the Federal Government had to submit  information annually to the government.   As a practical matter, it meant that businesses were advised to pay  attention to race when they hired somebody, when they promoted  somebody, and when they let somebody go.   It also meant that the Federal Government was paying attention to  race and gender when government contracts were let, and we have a  bureaucracy that is advising American big businesses that are doing it  in-house.   Right now, President Biden's goal is to greatly increase these roles  of bureaucrats when hiring decisions are made in Federal agencies so  that when we do government contracting and government grant writing, we  are paying increasing attention to where people come from or where  their ancestors came from.   In another area, the Biden administration is currently trying to set  up a new ethnic group to get preferences or special consideration, and  that is the group called Middle Eastern and Northern African people.   It is a little bit unusual, but the American citizenry should be  aware of this. They should be aware that the government is currently in  the process of adding this group to the number of people who are going  to get preferences. Before they do that, there should be an open debate  of whether this is necessary or not.   It is kind of interesting in that I read some information on this  topic. Historically, I think the reason for this type of thing was the  feeling that people had been taken advantage of or were not given a  fair shake in the past. Right now, people who are considered Middle  Eastern and North African actually make considerably more than the  native-born American. American median household income across the board  is slightly under $100,000 a year. Middle Eastern and North Africans  are making about $115,000 a year.   Mr. Speaker, even if you buy into the idea that the American  Government should be looking at people not on the basis of who they are  today but on where their ancestors came from, we are really not in a  position where we can say that these people have been put upon or not  been treated very well.   When I go home and talk about these issues, I find that almost no  people that I know are aware that we are about to add Middle Eastern  and North Africans to the affirmative action mix, which means, of  course, the American press corps is not doing its job. It is kind of a  fundamental change in a given group if they apply for a government job,  if they apply for a government grant, or if they are getting a  government contract. If there are going to be preferences, then it is  something that should be openly discussed on editorial pages, on talk  radio, and what have you.   I think the American press corps has largely hidden this fundamental  change in the way we do things, and it is time we have an open debate  with regard to this.   It is a little bit interesting because other groups that are  supposedly subject to discrimination or supposedly are different also  do better than the average American. Right now, the wealthiest subgroup  of Americans are Indian Americans. Also very wealthy are people from  the Philippines, people from China, and people from Cuba. All of these  people, in the mythology of the left, are people who are apparently  being discriminated against, but actually, they are doing better than  the average American right now.   I wonder why we would set up a bureaucracy to keep track of what  these people are doing or making sure they somehow get preferences.   A debate is going to be had throughout putting together these  appropriations bills, and in each one of the bills, that debate will,  to a degree, focus on whether President Biden gets his new committees  or commissions in every government agency doing all that he can to  highlight differences between people and judge people by where their  ancestors came from.                                time  2015    Before I move on from this topic, I should point out that these  people self-identify. Insofar as you hear that diversity is important  to have a well-running company or a well-running government agency, in  order to buy into that, the government, in determining whether or not  you are a member of a preferred group, allows you to be a member of  that group if you are maybe only a quarter or a half of that ancestry,  which seems a little bit unusual.   You can be, for example, a quarter Mexican and have yourself  classified as a person bringing a diverse view to the world, even  though you perhaps have never set foot in Mexico and grew up in an  average American suburb and even if people didn't know that you had a  different background.   I think in a desire to cause more importance for this occupation of  these diversity bureaucrats, and in an effort to drive up the number of  people who supposedly need help from the government, we allow people to  self-identify. People who are one-half or one-quarter members of a  group get preferences of that group.   We allow the fiction to come into play that even though you have  never stepped foot in the country of your ancestors--somebody comes  here from the Philippines, and their grandchildren never step foot in  the Philippines. They know very little about the country, but for  diversity's sake, we are supposed to make sure we have a given number  of people who apparently have the Filipino-American viewpoint of the  world.   I think that is something that ought to be discussed, as well, before  we continue down this path and give the Biden administration any more  victories in these appropriations bills by hiring new bureaucrats to  enforce the new laws.   These bureaucrats, people with majors in diversity, are not all hired  by the government. They have become increasingly common in large  industry. I think they are afraid of lawsuits or whatnot, so big  businesses hire these people and decisions as to who is going to be  hired are increasingly made in big business to meet the targets that  these diversity specialists give people.   Of course, it can result, first of all, in hard feelings as people  are judged not by their skills but, to a certain extent, by their  ancestry.   I have talked before about what happens in other countries where we  have affirmative action. Hard feelings develop over time. Sometimes  they result in civil wars, as they did in Sri Lanka.   In any event, I think the efforts that the Biden administration is  making to bring in new groups and to increase the apparent number of  people who are advising our government agencies as to who to hire,  before this goes up, it ought to be subject to an open debate.   It is not being debated. I think it is not being debated because the  mainstream media has not explained to the American public the huge role  that these groups play or these occupations play in personnel  decisions, both in private businesses and in the government.   The other thing that I want to bring up is kind of a leftover from  President Biden and his last State of the Union Address.  [[Page H6206]]    President Biden has talked about his respect for members of the trans  community, and he has done what he can to highlight them in a positive  light.   I want to bring to the public's attention a book I have read, ``When  Harry Became Sally,'' in which a discussion is made as to how we should  handle people who come out as transgendered, particularly when they are  young.   I think it is of interest when our society is deciding how to deal  with these people in school, to deal with them medically, what the  compassionate thing to do is. I think one thing that is not brought up  enough when we talk about the transgender situation is that, left to  their own devices, over about 90 percent of the young people who  identify as transgender work their way out of it.   I don't think it has been adequately reported in the news media that  other countries that went through this transgender situation just like  America--I am talking about Great Britain, Sweden, Norway--have all  backed away from embracing transgenderism in young people, which can  include not just puberty blockers but things up to and including  physical surgeries, having body parts removed even while people are  minors. I think even a lot of people who have this done when they are  adults regret it.   Nevertheless, the mainstream media and our President have largely  encouraged people down this path and say they are fighting for them,  giving people, I think, still more attention.   Mr. Speaker, when you consider that over 90 percent of the people who  begin down this path break their way out of it, you would have to say  that positive attention is going to slow down the decision of so many  young people to stop going down the transgender path.   I don't think this has adequately been talked about in the media.  President Biden and his Department of Education are doing what they can  to try to force acceptance of this lifestyle on school districts. By  forcing it on people, they have to realize they are going to create a  situation in which more young people wind up doing medical things, some  of which are irrevocable, cannot be undone.   I hope that President Biden will change his mind on this. I wish he  would stop highlighting this community in a positive light because when  you do that, I believe, you are causing people who are going to change  their minds to not change their minds. One has to look at the long-term  effect these people are having, particularly when you consider that  over 90 percent of the people will not continue down that path unless  perhaps they are encouraged to do so by people like the President of  the United States.   In any event, those are three issues that I think we read about in  the paper. I think only one side of all these three issues is too often  presented, but I leave you, Mr. Speaker, with statistics on the number  of people crossing the border and whether we can continue down  this path. I also leave you with a little bit of information as to the  increasing role these race specialists play in society and a little  more information regarding the efforts by the President and his  administration to, I would argue, encourage people to go down the  transgender path.    Mr. Speaker, these are my comments for the week, things that I hope  the press corps picks up on a little bit to educate the public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
