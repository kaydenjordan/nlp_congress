 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Weatherization  Assistance Program Improvements Act, which will make critical updates  to ensure this important program can effectively serve even more  households across the country.   Since 1976, the Weatherization Assistance Program has helped more  than 7 million low-income families reduce their energy bills by making  their homes more energy efficient. The Department of Energy estimates  that these upgrades help each household save $283 in energy bills  annually. Those energy savings free up limited financial resources for  essentials, like groceries and medicine.   In addition to traditional services like attic and wall insulation,  the program also provides services that help with home health and  safety measures, such as installing smoke and carbon monoxide  detectors. Energy efficient homes also help cut down on our carbon  footprint, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate  change.   An independent study of the Weatherization Assistance Program by Oak  Ridge National Laboratory found that children in weatherized households  miss less school, improving educational outcomes. Adults miss less  work, increasing both their own incomes and their contributions to the  economy. Families also reported experiencing fewer flu and cold  symptoms and emergency room visits, decreasing costly medical expenses.   The Weatherization Assistance Program also helps boost our economy.  The program supports over 8,500 jobs for energy experts and  contractors, while increasing our national economic output by $1.2  billion.   The program is a win-win for all involved. That is why, as a member  of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have led my colleagues in  supporting strong funding for it every year. And that is why I am  introducing this bill--to ensure it continues to work for years to  come.   This bill, which is cosponsored by Senators Collins, Coons, and  Shaheen, will help expand the program to many more low-income  households that are currently unable to receive weatherization services  because their homes are not structurally sound. The bill will authorize  a Weatherization Readiness Fund, providing $65 million a year for 5  years to repair structural issues and prepare homes for weatherization  assistance, increasing the number of homes the program is able to  serve.   At the same time, it will raise the amount of funding allowed to be  spent on each home to keep up with current labor and material costs,  and it will raise the cap on the amount of funding allowed to be spent  on renewable energy upgrades in each home. These provisions are  essential updates to a program that has helped so many families over  the past few decades.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Hagerty, and Mr.          King):   S. 3771. A bill to prohibit United States persons from engaging in  transactions with foreign persons that purchase or transact in gold  from the Russian Federation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs.
