 Madam Speaker, on April 18, 2019, my Democratic colleagues  were overjoyed. The report on the investigation into Russian  interference in the 2016 Presidential election was released. It was two  volumes, volume I and volume II. Volume I was 199 pages long, volume  II, 182 pages long.   Special Counsel Mueller's report was my colleagues' dream: the  smoking gun. Now we can impeach President Donald Trump. The taxpayers  spent $2.5 million so far, but that is a victory.   The folks back home heard this, one ugly thud. There was no collusion  and no obstruction.   So why do my colleagues keep the investigation going? Why are they  threatening subpoenas, contempt of Congress?   Well, it is because Mr. Putin hacked into our elections with a wide  open door given to him by the Democratic Congressional Campaign  Committee, the DCCC.   Volume I, page 38:         On April 12, 2016, the GRU, the Russians, had gained access       to the DCCC computers using the credentials stolen from a       DCCC employee who had been successfully spear-phished the       week before.    A few lines later:         Approximately 6 days after the first hack into the DCCC       network on April 18, 2016, the GRU--again, the Russians--      gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private       network connected between the DCCC and the DNC.   [[Page H4019]]     Mr. Putin was not interfering in our elections to help Mr. Trump. The  report shows he was motivated by the fact of most of my people back  home: He wanted anybody but Mrs. Clinton.   Volume I, page 23:         Here is the main idea: Use any opportunity to criticize       Hillary and the rest--except for Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump.       We support them.    It is time for my friends on the other side of the aisle to admit  they left the barn door open, and Mr. Putin let those cows out to run  free in our elections.   It is over. Let's move on. Join us in doing the people's work. That  means issues they care about, like how about having lower unemployment?  That is historical right now for Asians, African Americans, and  Hispanic Americans. Let's give that a round of applause.   How about energy independence? Yes, our world is clear because of  American energy.   How about helping us secure our border? Address the crisis on our  border, have an immigration policy that works.   The American people want this. They are sick and tired of  investigation after investigation after investigation. It is over.  Let's move on.                            ____________________
