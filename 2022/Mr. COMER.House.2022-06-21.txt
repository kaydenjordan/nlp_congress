 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of former  State representative Wilson Stone. Wilson was a passionate public  servant who spent his career fighting for Kentucky.   Wilson served as State representative of the Kentucky General  Assembly for 12 years. During his time, he served as chairman of the  State House Agriculture Committee and pursued meaningful improvements  to Kentucky's public education system. I had the honor of serving in  the State House with Wilson Stone.   Before serving in the State legislature, Wilson was an influential  member of the Allen County Board of Education. It is a position he held  for a remarkable 24 years.   In the spare time that he did have, Wilson was a farmer. Wilson was a  true leader with a sincere drive to improve Kentucky.   On behalf of the First Congressional District, I send my sincerest  condolences to Wilson's family, friends, and neighbors. His life  touched many, and our Commonwealth is better off because of his  service.                            ____________________
