 Madam Speaker, it has been 25 days, 25 days since over  800,000 Federal employees have either been going to work without pay or  have been furloughed, all of them wondering: How am I going to pay my  rent or my mortgage? How am I going to afford the bills that I need to  pay to take care of my family?   I heard recently from Jay from the island of Maui, in my district of  Hawaii, who is a TSA employee who has been working this entire time  without pay, wondering how he is going to pay his mortgage, car, credit  card payments, and lifesaving medical care that he needs to provide for  his daughter.   Jay is not alone. Our national parks are filling with trash. Our  Coast Guard members are working without pay, being told they should  hold garage sales or start babysitting to help pay the bills while the  government is shut down.   Food stamps for tens of millions of Americans are at risk, while low- income housing subsidies aren't being renewed, impacting over 340,000  elderly and disabled veterans who depend on that rental assistance.  The safety and security of our country is at risk.    We cannot turn our backs on our brothers and sisters. These are real  people, real families, real lives, and real futures.   Senator McConnell and President Trump must pass the bipartisan  legislation we have already passed and reopen the government now.                            ____________________
