 Mr. President, it is great to be back on the floor of  the U.S. Senate. It is a heavy obligation that we have before us.   On March 17, I was contacted by the Tri-County Health Department to  notify me that on March 11 I had been in a meeting with a Coloradan who  later tested positive for COVID-19, and at the advice of the Tri-County  Health Department and the attending physician in the Capitol, I entered  self-quarantine to protect my colleagues, our community, and our  family. That time has now expired as of this morning.   I certainly regret the fact that I missed a vote that passed 90 to 8  to complete phase 2 of our help to address COVID-19. I wish I had been  here because the vote would have been 91 to 8. Throughout that time I  was in quarantine, I had an opportunity to visit with thousands and  thousands of Coloradans through telephone townhalls in every  congressional district to hear from individuals who have lost their  jobs, to hear from business owners who were terrified about what  happens next, to hear from parents who are at home with their kids who  are out of school, not knowing if they go back at all to school; how to  figure out how Zoom works, how to figure out how Skype works, how to  figure out how technology works to teach their kids at home.   Throughout this process I adopted a three-pronged approach to what we  must do as a country to get through the crisis at hand. No. 1, we have  to address the immediate health epidemic: what we are doing to, as the  experts say, ``flatten the curve'' to stop the spread; to provide the  resources, the tests, the protective equipment that we need through our  States to make sure that they can fight this invisible virus; what we  can be doing to give them the tools and the skills they need for the  heroic efforts of our frontline healthcare providers--the doctors,  nurses, clerical staff, janitors, classified workers--all of the people  who have been so heroic to provide healthcare to our people. That is  phase 1, making sure we stop this epidemic and address the needs of the  American people.   Prong 2 of this three-pronged approach is about making sure that we  provide individuals with immediate assistance: people who are terrified  about what happens to their job, how they are going to make ends meet,  what they are going to do to put food on the table, how they are going  to pay their rent, how they are going to pay their mortgage, will they  have a restaurant to go back to. That is prong 2 of this approach.   Prong 3, of course, is to get our businesses up and running again to  make sure that when this health epidemic is over--this health emergency  is over, we can make sure we have an economy that snaps back and runs  strong. We will do that because we as a country will rise together. We  will do it united. We will do it because we in this country know how to  overcome great challenges.   We are taking these measures to quarantine and self-isolate not  because we are fearful of the virus, not because we are afraid of what  will happen if we don't, but we are doing it out of love for each  other. We are doing it out of love for our neighbors, community, our  parents, our grandparents, and our children.  [[Page S2028]]    We take the guidance of health experts and public policy experts  seriously because we want to share that love with people to stop the  spread so that we can avoid the surge that can overwhelm our healthcare  systems because we know, under the best case scenarios--the best case  scenarios--we are looking at a situation that can utilize 95 percent of  every hospital bed in this country for the next year. We do this out of  love for each other and for our community and to protect one another.   In Colorado right now, we have roughly 1,000-plus confirmed COVID-19  patients. We have lost 12, perhaps more by the time I am giving this  speech today, in Colorado. These lives, those who have tested positive,  their loved ones are all in my prayers today.   The Governor of Colorado obviously is issuing the emergency  declarations. I spoke with the Governor a few minutes ago to talk about  how we can continue to provide the resources that Colorado needs. Over  2 million people across the Denver metro area are now in some kind of a  shelter-in-place order, ordered to stay at home.   Our Nation is uneasy, our future is uncertain, and the level of  anxiety that our country faces is the highest I have ever seen it, but  we don't need to have uneasiness about our future because we will rise  together; we will come together as a nation to overcome this.   We know that our future, the future of this Nation, will be  prosperous again; that our economy will be thriving again; that our  communities will be able to celebrate what we have overcome because  that is what we do in this great Nation. We rise. We rise together. We  stand together.   Coloradans have stepped up in every way possible. In a uniquely  Colorado way, you have hemp businesses that are now producing cotton  swabs for medical needs; you have whiskey distilleries that are  producing hand sanitizers for hospitals and for home healthcare; we  have protective equipment that is being donated by the Denver Broncos  and by the marijuana industry and by so many other businesses across  the State of Colorado which are stepping up in ways that make all of us  proud. They are checking on their neighbors. They are checking on their  friends. They are making sure that elderly people in their church whom  they have met are OK, making sure that we check in with our loved ones  and those around us.   We have been able to get successful tests up and running in different  places across Colorado, helping different organizations and different  healthcare facilities find new ways to process this overwhelming  burden.   As this place has passed phase 1, which gave millions of dollars to  the State of Colorado and so many States around the country, and as we  passed phase 2, which prepared additional testing and nutrition  programs and other ways to meet this challenge, we now turn to phase 3.   Phase 3 addresses all three prongs of my approach and addresses the  health emergency. It addresses assistance to individuals, and it  addresses the ability of our economy and businesses to snap back when  we address this health emergency. It needs to pass now. It should have  passed days ago.   I don't think the American people give a hoot whether this idea was a  Republican idea or a Democratic idea. I can tell you that on my tele- townhalls I did and in my conversations I have had with American people  around the State of Colorado, they haven't once said to me ``Well, we  hope the Republican-only version passes'' or ``We hope the Democratic- only version passes.'' That is not what they are saying. They are  saying ``Do your doggone job because we are scared about what happens  next.''   So pass the relief that we need to get them back on their feet, to  make sure they know they are going to be able to have food on the table  and to pay rent. I can't imagine what somebody who for 50 years built a  small business must be going through every hour we delay, wondering if  that 50-year dream is going to stand and survive.   Shame on the people around here who said ``You know what, let's have  1 more day of delay, 1 more hour of delay'' because a Republican could  get their way or a Democrat could get their way. When I was at home,  not once did I hear anybody say ``Could you stall a little bit more for  partisan purposes?''   The American people are rising above the fray. They are meeting this  challenge in the spirit that I hear in every conversation I have. They  are donating blood. They are sharing that love I talked about with  their neighbors and their communities. They are figuring out new ways  to be together even when we are supposed to stand apart. That is what  the American people are doing. And we are bickering about phase 3.   We will have phase 4 and phase 5, but do you know what we have done?  Instead of patting ourselves on the back, do you know what we have  done? We have managed to get back, I hope, to the starting line. We  didn't run through the tape. We haven't finished the job. We have made  it, I hope, to a place where we can now know we are back at the line  and we can run together to fix what will be tremendous needs and to  address the tremendous needs of this country and to answer the anxiety  every single one of our constituents has. That is what Congress should  do. That is what Congress must do. I am glad and I will be proud to  vote for this bill today because we have to get this job done, and  there is more work to do.   We have to make sure people understand that the recovery benefits  they are going to be receiving will help answer that anxiety, to  hopefully give them hope, and that the new categories of unemployment  insurance that have been created under this will also give them the  ability to know it is going to be OK, to know that the small business  loans that are being made available will help that restaurant stay in  business.   You know, I talked to Eve in Aurora, and she didn't know how she was  going to survive because, yes, she converted her whole business to  takeout, but she didn't know how successful that would be.   To Roberta in Pueblo, who had the same questions about how her  restaurant was going to survive, this small business loan will be able  to help people pay payroll, to bring those back onto payroll whom they  may have let go because they didn't know how they were going to make  ends meet, to pay them, to pay their utilities, to pay their rent, to  pay their mortgages, and to have that loan forgiven to keep this  economy in a place where it will be vibrant again because that is what  we do in this country. We don't look back; we look forward. And in  Colorado, we look up at that great Rocky Mountain horizon, and we don't  look down. We look up, and we see the next horizon, and we strive for  that optimistic next day. That is what we do in Colorado, and I know  this country does the same.   You know, I talked to a 70-year-old Coloradan in Weld County, CO,  who, on a tele-townhall--you could hear it in her voice. She didn't  know what she was supposed to do because she was older than the experts  say should be out and not following guidance, but, she said: I can't  find the disinfectants and the cleaners that I need. How do I find  that? So we were able to find her relief.   The grocery stores have stepped up, and they have provided special  hours for people. They are delivering to people like the woman I spoke  to. They are providing information to their communities. They have  clerks, they have cashiers, and they have people stocking the shelves  who are on the frontlines of this fight as well, keeping our  communities safe. So to all of them, I say thank you for the work you  are doing each and every day.   It is important to recognize in this country that we have seen great  challenges. I remember my grandmother, who passed away this past year,  talking about her experiences in the Great Depression. This country has  been through the Great Depression. We have been through the great  recession. We will make it through the great infection. That is what we  do as a country. That is who we are as a people.   The Senate will approve this bill today, and the House must approve  it without delay--no excuses; no delay; pass the doggone bill now. The  American people have expected this for a long time. It shouldn't have  taken this long. Do your job. Do our job. Get this done.   We will act out of love for our communities. We will act out of  compassion, and we will rise to the spirit that has made this country  great.  [[Page S2029]]    I have heard so many of my colleagues come together and talk about  wartime footing, or they have talked about how we have mobilized in a  way that maybe the people have never seen in their lifetimes. It has  reminded me, though, of what Thomas Paine wrote in ``The Crisis''  during our Revolution, which, actually, George Washington read to his  troops. Here is what Thomas Paine said:         I call not upon a few but upon all; not on this state or       that state, but on every state; up and help us; lay your       shoulders to the wheel; better have too much force than too       little, when so great an object is at stake.        Let it be told to the future world, that in the depth of       winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that       the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came       forth to meet and repulse it.    We were taught in Sunday school that our struggles lead to  perseverance, that perseverance leads to character, and that character  gives us hope. We will get through this, America. We will start with  this bill. We have a lot more work to do, but to my colleagues: Do our  jobs. Get it done. No excuses.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
