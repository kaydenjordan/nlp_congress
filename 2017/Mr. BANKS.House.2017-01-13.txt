 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for  granting a waiver for James Mattis continuing his distinguished service  to our Nation as our next Secretary of Defense.   We live in deeply troubling times as America's standing in the world  and our military readiness have both deteriorated significantly over  the past 8 years. Whether it is only one-third of the active Army's  brigade combat teams being ready for combat, or Marines being forced to  pull spare parts from museum aircraft to repair their F/A-18 Super  Hornet fighter jets. These are not the marks of a ready force.   This moment requires trusted leadership and someone with a genuine  understanding of what is required of our brave men and women to stand  ready when our Nation calls. There is no one better equipped to  understand the dangers that we face, how to repair our world image, and  set us on a path to rebuilding our military than President-elect  Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis. General  Mattis embodies all of the traits we should look for when selecting a  Secretary of Defense.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I look forward to  working with him to put our military back on sure footing and help  advance our Nation toward peace and stability.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the measure.
