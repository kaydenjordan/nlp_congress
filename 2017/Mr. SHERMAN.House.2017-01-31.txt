 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's outrageous ban on Muslims so  that the San Fernando Valley's own Darrius Hicks, an American citizen,  can be reunited with his wife, who is a humanitarian worker working  with Afghan war victims in Iran. She has been denied even the chance to  schedule a visa interview at our embassy in Abu Dhabi.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
