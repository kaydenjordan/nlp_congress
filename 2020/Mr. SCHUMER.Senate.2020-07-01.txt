 Madam President, this morning, I have come to the floor  with Senators Wyden and Bennet to talk about a really bold new idea to  extend enhanced unemployment assistance for as long as economic  conditions in the country warrant it. I will speak about that  legislation more in a moment, but first, two other issues.                                   S. 4049    Madam President, first, last night President Trump threatened to veto  the National Defense Authorization Act--the bill on the floor this  week--because it contains a provision to rename military bases named  after Confederate generals.   Let me make a prediction. First, that provision will not change in  this bill as it moves through the House and Senate. Second, let me  predict that President Trump will not veto a bill that contains pay  raises for our troops and crucial support for our military. This is  nothing but typical bluster from President Trump. The NDAA will pass,  and we will scrub from our military bases the names of men who fought  for the Confederacy and took up arms against our country.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, on a second matter, before I get to the main topic  of this morning, all week, Democrats have been trying to force action  on the Senate floor to make progress on crucial issues related to the  COVID-19 pandemic. As Senate Republicans continue to mindlessly delay  the next round of COVID-19 relief, we have tried day after day to jolt  the Senate into action. Last night, we made notable progress.   In the late hours of last evening, we were able to pass a monthlong  extension of the Payment Protection Program, whose loan authority  expired at midnight with over $130 billion left in the program. We had  to force our Republican colleagues to act on this very simple and  noncontroversial extension--a date change--to help small businesses  across America, particularly underserved businesses, minority-owned  businesses that had trouble accessing the PPP program in its early  days.   Throughout the day, we heard, to our surprise, that our Republican  friends might block the legislation, but when the time came, Senator  Cardin's consent request was agreed to. It certainly is something to  celebrate, but I would have hoped that our two parties could have  worked this out before last night as a small part of much broader  legislation to address the many challenges posed by COVID-19 rather  than a consent request forcing the Republicans to act.   But Senate Republicans, unfortunately, seem dead-set on delaying  almost any action on COVID-19 until after July, after they have had  time, in the words of Leader McConnell, ``to assess the conditions in  the country.'' The obstruction is deeply regrettable and impossible-- impossible--to explain.   We have other deadlines before us, not just the PPP. Today is July 1.  With the first of the month comes a new rent payment for millions of  American families who have lost their jobs through no fault of their  own. Senate Democrats, led by Ranking Member Sherrod Brown, are going  to ask the Senate to pass rental assistance and an extension on the  moratorium on evictions. Will Senate Republicans agree to our request  or leave millions of renters out in the cold?   I would say to my Republican friends, let the extension of the PPP  program be a metaphor. Democrats are going to keep pressing for Senate  action on COVID-19-related issues. Let the Republican response be quick  and generous, not stingy and halting. Senate Republicans are going to  have to respond one way or the other and either support urgent and  necessary pieces of legislation or explain to their constituents why  they are blocking them. It would be far better to pass these measures  earlier rather than later and be more generous rather than stingy   (The remarks of Mr. Schumer, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Bennet pertaining to  the introduction of S. 4143 are printed in today's Record under  ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here to urge my colleagues on the  Republican side not to object--follow last night's example and allow  this simple, humane, and good-for-our-economy amendment to go forward.   First, I want to salute Senator Durbin. There has been no voice--no  voice of any elected official whom I know who has had a stronger,  longer, and more passionate defense of the DACA kids, many of whom are  now adults.   And he has pricked the conscience of the Nation so that now the DACA  kids and their families are, really, by most Americans respected and by  many Americans just loved. I am one of those in the latter category. I  love these kids and their families.   I have watched them, on the frontlines during the coronavirus crisis  in New York, risk their lives, even though they are not allowed to be  full Americans, to help.   Now we have an opportunity here to simply say: Stop harassing them.  Let them do their jobs. Let them live their lives. Let them be with  their families here in America so they can help us in our economy  recover from COVID, as they have been doing, without looking over their  shoulder and worrying about being deported or having one of their  family members being deported every 5 minutes.   It is such an important amendment. It is so good for the country. The  idea that immigrants are bad for America, that DACA kids are bad for  America, is a regressive, nativist, and often bigoted idea that some  use for political purposes, but nothing, nothing, nothing could be  further from the truth.   So I urge my colleagues not to object to Senator Durbin's fine  amendment to help America live up to its ideals and  [[Page S4087]]  its dreams. That lady in the harbor in the city in which I live--``Give  me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses yearning to breathe  free''--that has been part of the American fabric for centuries.   This is a chance to bring us back to that fabric, that wonderful  fabric that has been so good for our country for those centuries.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object, while I know the  committee is working hard and I know the Senator from Oklahoma and the  Senator from Rhode Island are working hard together in a very good way,  I know they have been trying to work up an agreement on three  amendments to come, as well as a managers' package, but there are  certain amendments that our side feels should be debated.   In a moment I will ask the chairman to modify his request to include  reasonable numbers of amendments that we believe should have rollcall  votes. None of these are ``gotcha'' amendments. None of these are  extraneous. They are not dealing with impeachment or the records of the  President or anything like that. Every one of them is related to the  NDAA bill, and there is sincere feeling on our side that these  amendments should be debated and voted on.   This is not an attempt to block or obstruct; this is an attempt to  come together. As we know, to make this work, we need bipartisan  agreement. All of them, as I said, are related to the NDAA bill.   The modification I am asking for also includes the two Republican  amendments, one from Senator Cornyn and one from Senator Paul.   I appreciate the chairman's desire to start voting on these  amendments, but I hope he will modify his request so that several more  Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle can amend the bill as  well, and we can move forward.   So I ask this question of my friend the chairman: Will the Senator  modify his request to include the following amendments to be called up  and voted on in relation to Sanders No. 1788, in lieu of Sanders  amendment No. 1790--that is the 10 percent cut to the Pentagon; Tester  No. 1972 on Agent Orange; Shaheen No. 1729 on the PFAS study;  Gillibrand No. 1755 on transgender policy; Manchin No. 2361 on NNSA;  Menendez No. 2396 on the Bounty Act; Van Hollen-Rubio No. 1845 on the  DETER Act; and Schatz-Murkowski No. 2252 on the section 1033 program?   I ask the Senator to modify his request to add those amendments, and  then Members on our side who have serious concerns can have their  amendments considered.    Reserving the right to object, I hope we can continue  these discussions in a productive and fruitful way, but at this point I  must object.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today is July 1. For millions of  Americans, the rent is due. Utility bills don't stop, either. But too  many New York families and too many American families will be unable to  make the payments amid the pandemic that has already hurt my city and  its people.    The first of the month should not be the end of the financial line  for working families, and that is why we are here. We must continue to  put real pressure on Leader McConnell to pass the COVID 4 legislation  that would include critical rent relief to families who desperately  need the help.   Our working families--many of color and other minority groups--are in  desperate need of this basic assistance so they can continue working,  feeding their families, making ends meet. That is our push today.   Enact the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization  Act--which has a $100 billion promise to renters across the country-- and the promise is real help during the real and unprecedented crisis.   Let me give you some background. The Heroes Act would authorize $100  billion for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program led by Sherrod  Brown, the ranking member of the Banking and Housing Committee, who has  just done a great job letting people know the crisis and now acting on  it. What it does is it helps families and individuals pay their rent  and utility bills and remain in their homes during and after the COVID- 19 crisis.   The bill was already included in the House-passed and bipartisan  Heroes Act, but, unfortunately, once again--as he does with so many  other important issues--Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has  refused to bring it to the floor, so Senator Brown has come to ask the  unanimous consent.   Without basic assistance, even those renters who are currently  shielded by temporary Federal and local eviction  [[Page S4108]]  bans may still face eviction. Let me tell you, once someone is evicted  and homeless, they regress. The kids can't go to school. Healthcare  becomes even more remote. Getting to a job through public  transportation is so difficult.   This actually is a stitch in time that saves nine. If people can stay  in their homes because they can't pay the rent through no fault of  their own, they have a better chance of reestablishing their lives and  maybe even climbing up that American ladder. If they are kicked out of  their homes because they can't pay the rent, through no fault of their  own, it is very, very difficult. They are in a deep, deep hole.   We must, must do something for them. Senator Brown, with his  persistence and passion, has put together the right plan. We talk about  numbers, sure, but behind those numbers are the faces of countless New  Yorkers we see each and every day on mass transit, walking the streets,  working among us. These folks are fine, hard-working people. All they  want is a little dignity in their lives and ability to keep a roof over  their heads. They need help now more than ever.   We need action on this now, and that is the message to our friends on  the other side of the aisle.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, now on the main topic this morning, I am  proud to support Senator Wyden and Senator Bennet. As the number of  COVID-19 cases accelerates across much of the country, the economic  toll of this pandemic continues to fall hard on American families and  American workers. Over 33 million Americans--at least one-fifth of the  entire workforce--have now applied for unemployment assistance since  the pandemic began.   Democrats secured a crucial enhancement of that unemployment  assistance in the CARES Act--an extra $600 a week, which, according to  a study by Columbia University, prevented as many as 12 million  Americans from slipping into poverty. By the end of this month, those  emergency unemployment benefits will expire, but unfortunately the high  levels of unemployment will not. Without an extension of enhanced  benefits, Americans struggling without work will have their legs cut  out from under them at the worst possible time, in the middle of a  raging pandemic.   I am joining with my colleague, Ranking Member Wyden of the Senate  Finance Committee, to introduce a bill that will serve as both a short- term solution and a bold long-term strategy to keep American workers  and the American economy afloat. I thank Senator Wyden for his help and  Senator Bennet for his help. Together, we put together a very strong  piece of legislation.   Our bill, the Schumer-Wyden American Workforce Rescue Act, would do  something very simple: It would tie the extension of enhanced  unemployment benefits to economic data, not arbitrary political  deadlines. As long as unemployment remains very high--over 11 percent-- the enhanced benefits will stay in place. When unemployment goes down,  the benefits will phase out appropriately.   This automatic stabilization for unemployment benefits would be one  of the first programs of its kind, but at its core, this policy is  basic common sense. When Americans truly need the benefits, the  benefits will be there. When the economy gets better, those enhanced  benefits will be reduced. The impetus for this legislation is common  sense. We should not allow the economic security of the American people  to depend on the political whims of the legislatures--Federal or State.   When we passed the CARES Act over 2 months ago, Democrats knew the  extra $600 in weekly unemployment assistance was only a temporary salve  for struggling Americans. We had hoped the economy would be able to  bounce back and unemployment would quickly go down. Clearly, that is  not the case today.   Experts are warning us that the economic drag from this crisis will  take years, if not a full decade, to fully abate. Further action is  very much needed and very, very necessary. But for months, Republicans  have doubled and tripled down on their strategy of delaying action on  COVID-19 relief legislation. They have kept the American people  needlessly wondering if the help they rely on will remain in place much  longer.   We need to take the next step and tie unemployment benefits to  economic triggers that will ensure that so long as Americans are  hurting, a safety net will remain in place--whether it is COVID-19 or  any other economic disaster in the future that causes unemployment to  rise. That is how you give the American people the kind of peace of  mind they need that they will not needlessly fall into poverty this  year or next year or the year after.   No doubt, this is a new idea. It would be one of the first programs  of its kind. But we need to take this bold step forward to guarantee  that the Federal Government effectively serves the American people in  times of crisis.   There is a long road ahead before the U.S. economy gets back on its  feet. In many parts of the country, States are reimposing restrictions  on businesses, restaurants, and other places of employment to halt a  renewed spread of the disease. Americans will continue to wonder, when  can I get back to work?   I am proud to join my colleagues and champion this legislation to  provide unemployment benefits for as long as Americans need them-- provide unemployment benefits for as long as Americans need them.   Before I yield, I want to thank my colleague Senator Wyden for  championing this legislation as well. He has been a leading and fierce  advocate for this policy in our caucus, and I am both grateful and  proud to stand with him this morning. I also thank Senator Bennet, who  is always thoughtful and thinking on to the future--one of the first  Members to alert this Chamber and the country of the disparities in  income and wealth distribution--and has had vital input as well. We  thank him.  [[Page S4140]]    This policy is smart, it is timely, and it is forward-thinking. So it  is no surprise that my colleagues, Senator Wyden--one of the authors-- and Senator Bennet have had great input.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wyden and then  Senator Bennet be allowed to speak immediately after me for as much  time as they may consume.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.  [[Page S4142]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4143         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

As the number of  COVID-19 cases accelerates across much of the country, the economic  toll of this pandemic continues to fall hard on American families and  American workers. Over 33 million Americans--at least one-fifth of the  entire workforce--have now applied for unemployment assistance since  the pandemic began.   Democrats secured a crucial enhancement of that unemployment  assistance in the CARES Act--an extra $600 a week, which, according to  a study by Columbia University, prevented as many as 12 million  Americans from slipping into poverty. By the end of this month, those  emergency unemployment benefits will expire, but unfortunately the high  levels of unemployment will not. Without an extension of enhanced  benefits, Americans struggling without work will have their legs cut  out from under them at the worst possible time, in the middle of a  raging pandemic.   I am joining with my colleague, Ranking Member Wyden of the Senate  Finance Committee, to introduce a bill that will serve as both a short- term solution and a bold long-term strategy to keep American workers  and the American economy afloat. I thank Senator Wyden for his help and  Senator Bennet for his help. Together, we put together a very strong  piece of legislation.   Our bill, the Schumer-Wyden American Workforce Rescue Act, would do  something very simple: It would tie the extension of enhanced  unemployment benefits to economic data, not arbitrary political  deadlines. As long as unemployment remains very high--over 11 percent-- the enhanced benefits will stay in place. When unemployment goes down,  the benefits will phase out appropriately.   This automatic stabilization for unemployment benefits would be one  of the first programs of its kind, but at its core, this policy is  basic common sense. When Americans truly need the benefits, the  benefits will be there. When the economy gets better, those enhanced  benefits will be reduced. The impetus for this legislation is common  sense. We should not allow the economic security of the American people  to depend on the political whims of the legislatures--Federal or State.   When we passed the CARES Act over 2 months ago, Democrats knew the  extra $600 in weekly unemployment assistance was only a temporary salve  for struggling Americans. We had hoped the economy would be able to  bounce back and unemployment would quickly go down. Clearly, that is  not the case today.   Experts are warning us that the economic drag from this crisis will  take years, if not a full decade, to fully abate. Further action is  very much needed and very, very necessary. But for months, Republicans  have doubled and tripled down on their strategy of delaying action on  COVID-19 relief legislation. They have kept the American people  needlessly wondering if the help they rely on will remain in place much  longer.   We need to take the next step and tie unemployment benefits to  economic triggers that will ensure that so long as Americans are  hurting, a safety net will remain in place--whether it is COVID-19 or  any other economic disaster in the future that causes unemployment to  rise. That is how you give the American people the kind of peace of  mind they need that they will not needlessly fall into poverty this  year or next year or the year after.   No doubt, this is a new idea. It would be one of the first programs  of its kind. But we need to take this bold step forward to guarantee  that the Federal Government effectively serves the American people in  times of crisis.   There is a long road ahead before the U.S. economy gets back on its  feet. In many parts of the country, States are reimposing restrictions  on businesses, restaurants, and other places of employment to halt a  renewed spread of the disease. Americans will continue to wonder, when  can I get back to work?   I am proud to join my colleagues and champion this legislation to  provide unemployment benefits for as long as Americans need them-- provide unemployment benefits for as long as Americans need them.   Before I yield, I want to thank my colleague Senator Wyden for  championing this legislation as well. He has been a leading and fierce  advocate for this policy in our caucus, and I am both grateful and  proud to stand with him this morning. I also thank Senator Bennet, who  is always thoughtful and thinking on to the future--one of the first  Members to alert this Chamber and the country of the disparities in  income and wealth distribution--and has had vital input as well. We  thank him.  [[Page S4140]]    This policy is smart, it is timely, and it is forward-thinking. So it  is no surprise that my colleagues, Senator Wyden--one of the authors-- and Senator Bennet have had great input.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wyden and then  Senator Bennet be allowed to speak immediately after me for as much  time as they may consume.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.  [[Page S4142]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4143         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
