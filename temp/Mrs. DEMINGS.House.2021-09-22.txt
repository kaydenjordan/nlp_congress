 Mr. Speaker, America is a great Nation, but with all  the challenges we face--protecting our homeland, repairing our broken  infrastructure, taking care of our seniors, creating an economy that  works for working people--extremist politicians continue to find time  for their war on women.   When I was a police officer, I put away rapists, stalkers, and  domestic abusers. Now, extremist politicians in Texas and my State of  Florida are instead trying to empower those same criminals to sue  victims if they get an abortion.   Let me be clear: No Florida woman needs to justify her healthcare  decisions to anyone. It is our freedom to decide versus your attempts  to control.   When I chose to start a family, I did not ask my Senator, my  Congressman, nor my Governor for permission. Every woman has the right  and the freedom to make her choice for herself and to do so based on  her own personal, individual circumstances.   The Constitution is a stubborn thing. This week, we will preserve the  constitutional protections of the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. I ask  my colleagues to support women by voting for the Women's Health  Protection Act.                            ____________________
