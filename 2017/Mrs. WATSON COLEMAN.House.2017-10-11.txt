 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise to urge support for my bill, H.R. 2302, which  would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 259 Nassau Street in Princeton, New Jersey, as the Dr. John  F. Nash, Jr. Post Office.   As a legendary figure of Princeton University's mathematics  department, Dr. Nash was famous both for his genius and his life story.  Born in Bluefield, West Virginia, in 1928, Dr. John Nash was a child  prodigy who graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology at age  19, with both a bachelor's and a master's degree in mathematics.   Dr. Nash subsequently received his doctorate in 1950 from Princeton  University and published a groundbreaking theory of noncooperative  games later that year, which is now known as the Nash equilibrium.   His monumental work in mathematics, game theory, economics, and  evolutionary biology has influenced generations of experts in these  fields.   In addition to his academic contributions, Dr. Nash gained worldwide  acclaim from the 2001 film ``A Beautiful Mind,'' which portrayed his  vast accomplishments while living with schizophrenia and throughout his  recovery from mental illness.   In recognition of his lifelong work, Dr. Nash was awarded a Nobel  Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994, and the 2015 Abel Prize from the  Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.   Tragically, he and his wife, Alicia, were killed in an automobile  accident in 2015 on their return from receiving the award in Norway.   Finally, I want to end my remarks by congratulating Ms. Lyla Malloy,  the student in my district whose essay submission to our post office  naming competition was chosen out of 84 entries.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2302 in recognition of Dr.  Nash's important contributions to our country, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
