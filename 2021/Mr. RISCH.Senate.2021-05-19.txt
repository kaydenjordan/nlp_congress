 Mr. President, the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic have not been easy for small business owners and their  employees to overcome. Throughout the pandemic, many were forced to  temporarily close their doors. Those that reopened had to innovate  their business models to comply with local guidelines and public health  mandates. As we turn the corner on the COVID-19 pandemic, I am proud to  relaunch Support Local Gems, a statewide initiative, on May 21 to  encourage Idahoans to support local small businesses in their  communities. This month, as a senior member and former chairman of the  Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I will honor  six small businesses located throughout the State of Idaho. I am  pleased to honor Abracadabra's in Twin Falls as one of the Idaho Small  Businesses of the Month for May 2021.   The Twin Fall's Abracadabra's is a breakfast-style bistro owned by  Josh and Jonathan Swain and Nikki Bourne. The brothers have made it  their mission to bring childhood magic back to breakfast food for all  ages. The restaurant is renowned for engaging its customers through  unique specialty dishes and an outside-the-box atmosphere. Customers  rave about the creative food designs and the interactive dining  experience. Its popularity has led to the restaurant winning the Magic  Valley Readers' Choice Award for Best Breakfast in 2020.   Amid the pandemic, Abracadabra's was instrumental in providing  essential items to the local community. Last spring, many local grocery  stores experienced shortages of everyday items. The restaurant adapted  its business model to provide wholesale products like bacon, eggs,  flour, and sanitizing products in bulk to the community. Through the  use of online ordering and curbside pickup processes, customers  remained safely socially distanced while retrieving basic grocery items  that they desperately needed. Thanks to their innovative thinking, the  owners addressed the changing needs of their community while keeping  their staff safe and employed.   Congratulations to Abracadabra's in Twin Falls on being selected as  an Idaho Gem for the month of May. You serve as an example in your  community and are an outstanding example of what it means to be one of  Idaho's Local Gems.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic have not been easy for small business owners and their  employees to overcome.

I am pleased to honor Great Harvest in Idaho Falls  as one of the Idaho Small Businesses of the Month for May 2021.   The Great Harvest Bread Company in Idaho Falls is owned and operated  by Tiffani and John Van Orman. With two locations in Eastern Idaho, the  bakeries are known for their vast selection of artisan breads, sweets,  and treats. They pride themselves on using the freshest ingredients and  making their products completely from scratch.   Since its establishment over 20 years ago, the business has been  actively involved in the Idaho Falls community, donating money and  baked goods to school fundraisers, church gatherings, and local  charitable causes. While the pandemic has impacted their business, it  has not deterred their charitable efforts. During the March 2020  shutdown, Great Harvest kept all of their employees on the payroll and  increased their production. The Van Ormans donated the extra food items  to their local food pantry, YMCA, local school districts, hospitals,  and emergency responders. They also placed Generosity Tables stocked  with free baked goods outside of their bakeries and encouraged  customers to take them to people in need. Their spirit of generosity is  what defines Idaho's small businesses, and Great Harvest Bread Company  has stepped up for its community during these hard times.   Congratulations to Great Harvest in Idaho Falls on being selected as  an Idaho Gem for the month of May. You serve as an example in your  community and are an outstanding example of what it means to be one of  Idaho's Local Gems.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic have not been easy for small business owners and their  employees to overcome.

I am  pleased to honor Happy Day Corporation in Lewiston as one of the Idaho  Small Businesses of the Month for May 2021.   Happy Day is a four-generation family business founded by Bruce and  Joy Finch in 1969. After opening their first franchise restaurant in  the Lewiston area, the couple went into business with Bruce's father,  Charles, and began to expand their venture. With 10 years of business  under their belts, Bruce and Joy reorganized their budding company,  officially naming it ``Happy Day'' to commemorate Joy's delight that  their company was flourishing. Today, the business comprises 13  franchise and independent restaurants and a catering and events  division. This has enabled the company to provide jobs for more than  450 employees in the Inland Northwest.   Above all else, Happy Day is known for its commitment to service.  Each year, thousands of wildland firefighters battle wildfires  throughout the West. In an effort to keep them fed, Happy Day provides  hundreds of meals to these firefighters at their fire camps. In  addition, the company has long supported veterans. Happy Day  restaurants have served more than 100,000 meals to local veterans  through its monthly Tuesday Vets Meal initiative where veterans can eat  for free. Their enduring dedication to community service has garnered  them local and national awards, including being inducted into the Idaho  Hall of Fame in 2016. Happy Day's efforts to serve their community make  them an exceptional example of service-oriented small business  leadership.   Congratulations to Happy Day on being selected as an Idaho Gem for  the month of May. You serve as an example in your community and are an  outstanding example of what it means to be one of Idaho's Local  Gems.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic have not been easy for small business owners and their  employees to overcome.

I am  pleased to honor Mountain Madness Soap in Coeur d'Alene as one of the  Idaho Small Businesses of the Month for May 2021.   Mountain Madness Soap is a specialty handmade soap and bath products  company founded by Jennifer and Andy Morsell. The business began with  Jennifer's hobby of making organic soaps in her kitchen and giving them  as gifts to friends and family. The enthusiastic reception she received  inspired Jennifer and her husband to start their own business selling  the soaps at local farmers markets and craft fairs. The pair eventually  moved to Coeur d'Alene, where they opened their first shop. The  business quickly found success as demand soared for their locally  sourced soap and bath products. Finding themselves unable to keep pace  with demand, the business expanded into a larger facility in 2016,  enabling them to increase the size of their retail space and expand  their production and fulfillment facilities.   To overcome the challenges and retrictions of the pandemic, Mountain  Madness adapted its operations to continue serving the community  safely. Jennifer and Andy kept the store open by implementing face mask  requirements for employees, rigorous sanitation of facilities, and by  adding curbside pickup and at-home deliveries. Jennifer and Andy made  the safety of their customers and employees the top priority. They  adapted quickly to new challenges and developed ways to bring their  products to their customers. And through that quick and innovative  response, they managed to grow their business despite the hardship.  Mountain Madness continues to support its fellow Idaho small businesses  by purchasing locally sourced product materials from other small  businesses.   Congratulations to Mountain Madness Soap on being selected as an  Idaho Gem for the month of May. You serve as an example in your  community and are an outstanding example of what it means to be one of  Idaho's Local Gems.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic have not been easy for small business owners and their  employees to overcome.

I am  pleased to honor the Sandpiper in Pocatello as one of the Idaho Small  Businesses of the Month for May 2021.  [[Page S2779]]    The Pocatello Sandpiper was founded by Bob Angell in 1975 and is  currently owned by Rod Russell. With two locations in Eastern Idaho,  the restaurant is known for its cozy atmosphere and steak and seafood  offerings. It has become a staple of the local community, garnering  awards for Best Restaurant, Best Steak and Seafood, Best Fine Dining,  and Best Place To Take A Date awards in the Idaho State Journal's  Readers' Choice Awards.   Rod and his wife, Kathleen, have served as leaders in the local  community during the pandemic. The restaurant avoided layoffs, raised  wages, and provided special meals to employees and their families even  though they operated at a loss. In addition to the measures taken by  the restaurant, upon receiving their $1,200 stimulus check, the  Russells began thinking of ways to give back to their community. As the  brother of a truckdriver, Rod heard firsthand some of the challenges  facing truckers amid supply chain shortages. To show thanks to an  underappreciated group of essential workers, the Pocatello Sandpiper  partnered with Idaho State Police and other small businesses to provide  more than 600 free meals to truckdrivers in acknowledgment of their  critical work. Rod's commitment to service allowed this small business  to prioritize the needs of both its employees and the community.   Congratulations to the Sandpiper in Pocatello on being selected as an  Idaho Gem for the month of May. You serve as an example in your  community and are an outstanding example of what it means to be one of  Idaho's Local Gems.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic have not been easy for small business owners and their  employees to overcome.

I am  pleased to honor TLC for Tots as one of the Idaho Small Businesses of  the Month for May 2021.   TLC for Tots is a family-owned childcare and preschool learning  center located in Nampa, ID. In 2006, owners Dave and Elizabeth Fetzer  started the business out of their home, providing individualized  attention to each of its students. The business quickly outgrew its  original location, relocating in 2008 to a larger facility where it  remains today. The owners credit their success to their phenomenal  staff who are constantly training and reeducating themselves to provide  high-quality care. Additionally, TLC for Tots facilitates early  intervention programs and sponsors family events to ensure the  continued growth of their students.   TLC for Tots has remained committed to combating the spread of COVID- 19. At its facility, temperature checks are regularly administered,  daily cleanings are conducted throughout the facility, and staff were  required to wear masks throughout the day during the height of the  pandemic. The business provides more than a dozen jobs to the Nampa  community and has been dedicated to serving local families while  adhering to COVID-19 guidelines.   Congratulations to TLC for Tots on being selected as an Idaho Gem for  the month of May. You serve as an example in your community and are an  outstanding example of what it means to be one of Idaho's Local Gems.                            ____________________
