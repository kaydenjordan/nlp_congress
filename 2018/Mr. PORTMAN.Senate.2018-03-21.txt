 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a  colloquy on this legislation with some of my leadership colleagues who  are present: first, Senator John Thune, the chair of the Commerce  Committee, who has been very involved in this issue; Senator Richard  Blumenthal as well, who is the coauthor of the legislation and cochair  of the trafficking caucus; Senator Claire McCaskill, who is ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Investigations; and Senator Heidi  Heitkamp, one of the original cosponsors of this legislation.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my  colleagues this morning in this Chamber as we begin the process of  debating the amendments that are being offered and moving toward a  final vote on this important legislation to deal with sex trafficking  which, unbelievably, in this century and in this country is actually  increasing. All of the experts say it is increasing because of the  presence of these organizations online that are using the ruthless  efficiency of the internet to sell women and children.   It is fitting that this group is bipartisan, because this process has  been bipartisan in coming up with this legislation all along. It is  really the culmination of 2 years' worth of work--a lot of great work  and investigations being done by the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, as well as good work being done by the Commerce  Committee through regular order. We would not be on the verge of  sending this bill to the President's desk without the hard work of  every Senator who will be on the floor this morning.   I would also like to briefly recognize a sixth member of our group  who cannot be here but whose passion about this issue means that  although his presence is not here, it is felt; and that  [[Page S1850]]  is Senator John McCain. Both Senator McCain and his wife Cindy McCain  have taken on this issue of human trafficking through the McCain  Institute, and Senator McCain, through our work on the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations, also helped us with this legislation.  We wish they could be here for the final vote on this bill. I know John  McCain is watching right now and wishing he could be here with us, and  we look forward to his return to this Chamber. I thank them on behalf  of all of us for their hard work on this issue over the years.   We will hear from my colleagues today on a number of things we have  done in Congress in this process of putting together the right  legislative fix to be able to take away an immunity, unbelievably, that  some of these evil websites currently have under Federal law to be able  to sell people online. We will hear about the 18-month investigation  into online trafficking by backpage.com by the Permanent Subcommittee  on Investigations. We will hear stories about online sex trafficking  and some of the injustices experienced by some of the victims and  survivors who have come to us back home in our States and who have come  to testify bravely in the U.S. Congress.   We will hear about some of the calls from courts around the country  asking us to pass legislation to fix this problem; the prosecutors, the  U.S. attorneys, the people back home who are eager to prosecute these  cases but can't because of Federal law.   We will hear about the work of the Commerce Committee, as I said  earlier, helping us come up with a commonsense target bill through the  regular order to be sure we would have not just the best legislative  product but that we would have buy-in from Members of both sides of the  aisle.   I commend Senator John Thune for doing that. He chairs the Commerce  Committee, which held a hearing on this legislation--SESTA--last  September. It actually was reported unanimously out of committee after  making a few changes to the legislation which clarified the intent in a  positive way.   I yield to my colleague John Thune.    Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from South  Dakota, who has been at the forefront. Getting this bill through the  Commerce Committee with a unanimous vote, frankly, exceeded  expectations. Many on the outside thought this might be an opportunity  for many who are against the legislation to stop the bill but instead  we were able, through testimony, to show that this is a commonsense,  targeted approach that will make a huge difference in the lives of the  people we represent, without affecting the freedom of the  internet. That is the right balance Senator Thune helped us to get.    I see that my colleague Senator Blumenthal is here, whom I talked  about earlier. He is a coauthor of this legislation and also a former  State prosecutor who took on trafficking cases, and so he has a  professional background in prosecuting these cases and, therefore,  joined me in ensuring that this legislation allows for our State and  local prosecutors, who are going to take many of these cases, to be  able to sue these websites that are selling people online using the  current shield in Federal legislation. But after this legislation,  prosecutors will be able to successfully prosecute to stop this  criminal activity.   Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Blumenthal.    I thank my colleague for his comments and, more  importantly, for his leadership all the way through the process of  drafting the legislation.   I am now going to yield to one of my other colleagues. It looks like  Senator Heitkamp will be next to speak. She is from North Dakota, not  South Dakota, as we talked about earlier with Senator Thune, and she  has a similar passion for this issue and has been involved in this  issue for many years and is also on the committee in which we did the  PSI work we talked about earlier. I appreciate her being one of our six  original cosponsors, helping us to draft this targeted, focused  legislation that deals directly with the problem we have seen around  the country, which was discussed by Senator Blumenthal.   With that, I would like to yield to my colleague Senator Heitkamp.    I thank my colleague for the expertise and experience  she has brought to this effort. As she said, in the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations, we spent 18 months digging deep, trying  to figure out why this was happening, why we had an increase in  trafficking in this country in this century, and increasingly we were  told that this was because of the internet, moving from the street  corner to the smartphone. Trafficking survivors and victims told us  this, but so did the experts.   Senator Heitkamp jumped in, and the leadership of that subcommittee  included Senator McCaskill. She is no longer the ranking member. She  has gone on to bigger things--to be ranking member of the full  committee--but during this investigation of 18 months, she was the  ranking Democrat on our subcommittee, and I appreciate working with her  there. She is a former prosecutor. She knows how to dig deep for this  information, and she had a good staff. She also was very helpful to us  in helping to enforce the subpoenas.   I will let her tell the story, but this is really incredible. We knew  this one website, backpage.com, was engaged in this effort because we  heard about it all over the country. In my home State of Ohio, women  and girls would say they were trafficked on backpage. If I talked to a  dozen victims or survivors, 10 would say backpage. The National Center  for Missing & Exploited Children said that 75 percent were backpage.  Another group said: No, it is 80 percent.   In other words, we knew this was happening, but we couldn't get the  information because although we subpoenaed documents and subpoenaed  their testimony, they refused to show up and refused to give us  documents. We had to go through an extraordinary process. I will let  Senator McCaskill talk about it, but for the first time in 21 years,  this Senate did something that was critical to our investigation. I  want to thank her for her hard work, and I would like to yield time to  her to talk about it.    Madam President, I thank Senator McCaskill. She is  absolutely right. We are grateful to the entire Senate for jumping in  on this because we would not have gotten to the bottom of this without  our having gotten the Senate to decide for the first time in 21 years  this question: Are we going to enforce the subpoena or not? People  stepped up. As a result, through the court system and with the sanction  of criminal liability as a possibility, we were able to get these folks  to come forward and provide this information.   They never really testified. They came forward, and they claimed  their Fifth Amendment rights, but at least we were able to get 1  million pages of documents--1 million pages. Then we sifted through 1  million pages of documents to discover, lo and behold, that these  people actually knew what they were doing. In fact, they were altering  ads. They would get an ad from somebody who was selling an underaged  girl. The ad would read something like ``schoolgirl'' or  ``cheerleader'' or ``young girl.'' They would then edit that ad to take  out those words that would indicate what was going on, and they knew it  was going on. Then they would place the ad anyway. In other words, they  would make the money, make the profit, knowing that they were selling  an underaged girl online. They were also destroying the evidence that,  later, law enforcement could use in going after these people.   This is evil, and this has been happening. We have heard the stories.  We have talked about Yvonne Ambrose. We have talked about Kubiiki  Pride. We have talked about Nacole S. We have talked about some of  these mothers and their daughters who have gone through this horrific  situation. You also heard earlier about Desiree. This was the 16-year- old who was being sold on backpage, and on Christmas Eve, she was  murdered. Imagine getting that call as a parent.   We have talked before about the testimony we received in the  committee with regard to the 14-year-old girl who had gone missing.  Kubiiki Pride is her mom. Kubiiki Pride said she had been  [[Page S1855]]  missing for several weeks when someone finally told her: Why don't you  check on backpage.com. So she did. She went on backpage.com and found  her daughter, who had been missing for weeks. Imagine the mixed  emotions there--the relief of finding her daughter but her horror in  seeing the explicit sexual photographs of a 14-year-old who was being  sold for sex.   She did what you would do as a mom. She called backpage immediately  and said: I found my daughter on your website. She is 14 years old.  Thank you for taking down that ad and helping me to connect with my  daughter.   The answer from backpage.com was this: You didn't pay for the ad. We  will not take it down.   Again, talk about evil. Think of the heartbreak.   Then, later, when she was reunited with her daughter, she was one of  those brave moms and her daughter was one of those brave victims who  said: Do you know what, we are going to file a lawsuit and go public  with this and talk about our experience--the trauma that this young,  14-year-old girl had gone through in having been repeatedly raped by  older men--and we are going to hold these websites accountable.   Do you know what happened?   The court system said: I am sorry. Under a Federal law that was  passed by the Congress--a 21-year-old law--this website is not  culpable. It has a shield. It has an immunity.   That is why we are here today.   Justice cannot always be seen, but its absence is felt, and the  absence of justice is exactly what we are trying to address here today.   You have heard from my colleagues, and I appreciate all four of them  for speaking up and talking about their experiences and how we got to  this point. We may hear from a couple of other colleagues later today  who were part of helping us put together a sensible approach that  targeted this activity. Sure, we have freedom of the internet on the  one hand, but on the other hand, this is criminal activity that cannot  continue to go on here in America, in this century, at this time.   Again, as we have learned, this is where you see the increase in  trafficking. You not only hear this from the experts who give us their  data that show huge increases in trafficking reports, but you also hear  it and feel it from the victims and the survivors whom I have met with  in Cleveland, in Cincinnati, in Columbus, in Dayton, in Akron. They  have told me the same story, which is: Yes, I was sold online. It is  very efficient.   One 9-year-old girl was sold online by her father. I first met her  when she was almost 20 years old and had finally escaped from the  clutches of her own father.   Think about that--backpage's going from sporting event to sporting  event around the country and, online, one being sold many times on a  single night with the efficiency of the internet.   This is legislation that is overdue, in my view, and it is required.  The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that.  The attorneys general have told us that, and 50 of them sent us a  letter, writing to make this change. They have all said: Congress, step  forward. They have not just invited us to do it; they have welcomed us  to pass this legislation to give these families the justice they  deserve and to give our prosecutors the ability to go after them.   One thing that I hope has been made clear from the other comments we  have heard today is that one of the important parts of this legislation  is to simply allow these local prosecutors we talked about earlier to  take these cases while using the Federal standard rather than just  relying on the Department of Justice.   Having said that, sifting through those 1 million pages, our report,  with all the documents we received, you can go online to see this at  the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, PSI.   We did provide this to the Justice Department. We did provide this to  the prosecutors around the country who were interested. We did provide  it to others who are pursuing lawsuits so they have information now  that they never had before, but we also need to change the law, and  that is what we are about to do today.   You heard from my colleagues about the amendments that are likely to  be offered. There are two amendments. The first amendment is one that  is going to be called a moderating amendment, meaning that if somebody  is on their website moderating the website, cleaning up the website,  they should be given a good-faith acceptance. Let me just be clear.  This amendment is a poison pill and will make it easier for those sites  that are involved in sex trafficking to continue to do so.   Right now, under current law, there is a good-faith exception. There  is a Good Samaritan exception under current law. We actually restate  that in our legislation, to be absolutely clear, that if you are one of  the good guys--a website online--who wants to be sure your site is not  going to have these girls being sold that we talked about earlier, that  you should be protected. However, this legislation, having restated the  Good Samaritan provision, also says that if you are one of the bad  actors, you don't have that protection. The first amendment that is  going to be offered includes protections for some of the bad actors. It  purposely strips the good-faith element, and I believe it would assist  online sex traffickers rather than hold them to account.   For instance, if backpage or another website filters for illegal  content and, as a result, learns that their site is being used for  trafficking but ignores that activity, I think this amendment would say  that evidence could not be considered in a case against backpage. To  me, that is wrong, and I hope the first amendment is going to be  handled appropriately, which is to say, we don't want to weaken this  bill or have a poison pill in here.   By the way, the law enforcement community represented nationally by  their associations agrees with us, as do the victims groups, as do the  groups who are concerned about the effect of trafficking on girls,  women, and boys online. So we are together on this with all the outside  groups.   The second amendment is going to be asking for additional Department  of Justice resources specifically to combat online trafficking. I  support funding to investigate and prosecute traffickers, of course,  but we have to appropriate that funding in the proper manner. This  amendment would be subject to a budget point of order because it is not  going through the right process. The right process is the bill we are  taking up the day after tomorrow, which will be the spending bill.   In fact, there are three budget points of order that the Committee on  Budget in the U.S. Senate has found against this amendment. This  amendment is subject to points of order. Every law enforcement group in  the country opposes the amendment because as law enforcement said, it  is a poison pill that is dead on arrival if sent back to the House. We  have to defeat these amendments in order to have this legislation move  forward. I hope my colleagues will all stick with us on that as they  stuck with us through this process of getting the information, coming  up with the right legislation, being sure we have the opportunity to  take it to the floor and get it to a clean vote, get it to the  President's desk and get it signed, and starting in a couple of weeks  to be able to make a difference in the lives of the people we  represent, stopping the online trafficking that is occurring and  providing justice to those who are victims and survivors and ensuring  that, indeed, justice can be served.   One of my colleagues has joined us on the floor. Senator Nelson is  the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee that took up this  legislation and clarified some points in the legislation. By the time  he was done with it--and, by the way, he was a cosponsor of the  legislation long before that--but by the time the Commerce Committee  was done clarifying the legislation, listening to the testimony from  both sides, he received a unanimous vote in committee. That doesn't  happen very often, and I appreciate Senator Nelson being on the floor  today. More importantly, I appreciate his leadership on the issue.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent additional material be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S1856]]                                    Congressional Research Service,                                                      March 7, 2018.                                 Memorandum       To: Hon. Ann Wagner.      From: American Law Division.      Subject: Ex Post Facto Implications of the Allow States and           Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (H.R.           1865), as Passed by the House of Representatives.        This is in response to your request for an analysis of the       ex post facto implications of the Allow States and Victims to       Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (FOSTA) (H.R. 1865),       as passed by the House of Representatives in February, 2018.       You expressed particular interest in the ex post facto       implication of Section 4 as it relates to Section 230 of the       Communications Act of 1934 (Section 230) (47 U.S.C.       Sec. 230), originally enacted as part of the Communications       Decency Act of 1996.        As discussed below, the Constitution's Ex Post Facto       Clauses limit congressional and state authority to pass       legislation that applies retroactively. Because Section       230(e)(5)(B) and (C) would amend the Communications Act to       allow states to prosecute online facilitators of sex       trafficking but would not create any new federal crimes or       enhance the punishment for any existing federal crimes, the       Ex Post Facto Clause does not appear likely to bar Congress       from making these amendments. In addition, Section       230(e)(5)(A), which amends Section 230 to allow civil causes       of action under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1595 for 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1591       violations, does not appear to violate the Ex Post Facto, Due       Process, and Takings Clauses.                                  discussion         Among other things, Section 230 of the Communications Act       protects online providers of internet services from being       treated as publishers of information provided by other       entities. Section 230 states: ``No provider or user of an       interactive computer service shall be treated as the       publisher or speaker of any information provided by another       information content provider.'' Section 230 does not bar       criminal prosecutions under federal law.        Courts have found Section 230 to prevent states from       enforcing state laws intended to reduce sexual abuse of       minors. For example, in 2012, a court found Section 230 to       bar state prosecution of an online classified advertising       service pursuant to a state law that criminalized advertising       commercial sexual abuse of a minor. Other courts have       construed Section 230 to immunize online classified       advertising services from civil liability.        Among other things, FOSTA is intended to clarify that       Section 230 of the Communications Act does not protect       providers and users of interactive computer services from       federal and state criminal and civil laws relating to sexual       exploitation of children or sex trafficking. The relevant       substantive provisions FOSTA include:         Section 3 (proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2421A), which would       proscribe ``promotion or facilitation of prostitution and       reckless disregard of sex trafficking,'' authorize       restitution, and provide a civil cause of action for the       victims of such an offense;        Section 4, which would amend Section 230, to ``ensur[e]       [the] ability to enforce federal and state criminal and civil       law relating to sex trafficking'';        Section 5, which would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1591, which       proscribes certain aspects of commercial sex trafficking of       children or by force, fraud, or coercion, by defining the       term ``participation in a venture'';        Section 6, which would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1595, which       establishes a cause of action for damages and attorneys' fees       to benefit victims of violations of 18 U.S.C. ch. 77 (18       U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1581-1597) (relating to peonage, slavery,       and trafficking in persons, including commercial sex       trafficking), to allow state attorneys general to bring civil       actions on behalf of victims of commercial sex trafficking.        Section 7, which would establish a savings clause relating       to pending federal and state criminal and civil litigation.         Section 4 of FOSTA addresses the scope of Section 230's       grants of civil and criminal immunity. It reads:         (a) In General.--Section 230(e) of the Communications Act       of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(e)) is amended by adding at the end       the following:        ``(5) No effect on sex trafficking law.--Nothing in this       section (other than subsection (c)(2)(A)) shall be construed       to impair or limit--        ``(A) any claim in a civil action brought under section       1595 of title 18, United States Code, if the conduct       underlying the claim constitutes a violation of section 1591       of that title;        ``(B) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under       State law if the conduct underlying the charge would       constitute a violation of section 1591 of title 18, United       States Code; or        ``(C) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under       State law if the conduct underlying the charge would       constitute a violation of section 2421A of title 18, United       States Code, and promotion or facilitation of prostitution is       illegal in the jurisdiction where the defendant's promotion       or facilitation of prostitution was targeted.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,       and the amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply       regardless of whether the conduct alleged occurred, or is       alleged to have occurred, before, on, or after such date of       enactment.        Section 4(b) clarifies that the Section 4(a) amendments       apply retroactively, which raises the possibility of ex post       facto issues. With respect to Congress, the Constitution       provides that ``No . . . ex post facto Law shall be passed,''       and, with respect to the states, the Constitution provides       that ``No State shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law       . . .''      Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(B) and (C)        Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(B) and (C) concern state       criminal prosecutions. Section 4 of FOSTA would amend       existing federal law to remove impediments to criminal       prosecution under state law as described in proposed Section       230(e)(5)(B) and (C). Strictly speaking, it would neither       create new federal crimes nor enhance the punishment for       existing federal crimes. Thus, on its face, it would not       appear to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause that binds       Congress. Because Section 4 does not contemplate state       enactment of retroactive legislation, it would not appear       likely to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause that applies to       states. It is possible, however, that an argument could be       made that allowing prosecution for parallel state offenses       effectively enhances punishments for 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1591 and       proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2421A violations retroactively.        The Supreme Court has considered two ex post facto cases       that involved removing impediments to state prosecution and       punishment--Stogner v. California and Dobbert v. Florida. In       Stogner, the Supreme Court found a California statute that       attempted to revive expired statutes of limitations to       violate the Ex Post Clause. The Court stated:         The second category [of Calder v. Bull's inventory of       statutes that violate ex post facto]--including any law that       aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when       committed--describes California's statute as long as those       words are understood as Justice Chase understood them--i.e.,       as referring to a statute that inflicts punishments, where       the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment. After       (but not before) the original statute of limitations had       expired, a party such as Stogner was not liable to any       punishment. California's new statute therefore aggravated       Stogner's alleged crime, or made it greater than it was,       when committed, in the sense that, and to the extent that,       it inflicted punishment for past criminal conduct that       (when the new law was enacted) did not trigger such       liability.         In Dobbert v. Florida, the Court considered a Florida       statute that sought to revive the death penalty. Dobbert had       committed murder, then a capital offense, several months       before the Court decided Furman v. Georgia, which invalidated       Georgia's, and by implication Florida's, procedures for       determining death sentences. After reinstating the death       penalty with constitutionally valid procedures, Florida       prosecuted Dobbert, and sentenced him to death. The Court       found no ex post facto violation. ``The new statute simply       altered the methods employed in determining whether the death       penalty was to be imposed; there was no change in the quantum       of punishment to the crime.'' The Court explained further:         Petitioner's second ex post facto claim is based on the       contention that at the time he murdered his children there       was no death penalty in effect in Florida. This is so, he       contends, because, the earlier statute enacted by the       legislature was, after the time he acted, found by the       Supreme Court of Florida to be invalid under our decision in       Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). Therefore, argues       petitioner, there was no valid death penalty in effect in       Florida as of the date of his actions. But this sophistic       argument mocks the substance of the Ex Post Facto Clause.       Whether or not the old statute would, in the future,       withstand constitutional attack, it clearly indicated       Florida's view of the severity of murder and of the degree of       punishment which the legislature wished to impose upon       murderers. The statute was intended to provide maximum       deterrence, and its existence on the statute books provided       fair warning as to the degree of culpability which the State       ascribed to the act of murder . . . Here the existence of the       statute served as an operative fact to warn the petitioner of       the penalty which Florida would seek to impose on him if he       were convicted of first-degree murder. This was sufficient       compliance with the ex post facto provision of the United       States Constitution.         Because Section 230(e)(5)(B) revives the prospect of state       prosecution for conduct outlawed by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1591, it       seems analogous to Dobbert and critically distinct from       Stogner. In Stogner, the defendant could not be prosecuted       until the impediment was removed. Under proposed Section       230(e)(5)(B), defendants could be prosecuted before the       impediment's removal if 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1591 proscribed the       underlying conduct. In Dobbert and under proposed Section       230(e)(5)(B), the defendant knew beforehand that government       authorities considered the underlying conduct criminal and       warranting punishment under the law.        Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(C) is different because dual       state and federal prosecutions would only occur after       proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2421A's enactment and, consequently,       any conduct subject to revived state prosecution would not       have been a federal crime when the conduct occurred.        However, Section 230(e)(5)(C) would create no new federal       crime or enhance punishment  [[Page S1857]]       for any pre-existing federal crime and only impacts state       law. We have been unable to locate any case that indicates       that the Ex Post Facto Clause limits Congress's legislative       authority in such a situation.      Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(A)        Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(A) concerns civil causes of       action. Section 230(e)(5)(A) would remove Section 230 bars to       causes of action under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1595 and predicated on       18 U.S.C. Sec. 1591 (relating to commercial sex trafficking)       violations. Ex Post Facto Clauses ordinarily do not apply to       statutes providing retroactive civil remedies. The Supreme       Court has stated: ``Because [the Court will] ordinarily defer       to the legislature's stated intent, only the clearest proof       will suffice to override legislative intent and transform       what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal       penalty.'' Section 1595 appears to be remedial in contrast to       the criminal provisions in the same chapter of Title 18 of       the United States Code, including Section 1591.        Retroactive civil remedial statutes raise Due Process       Clause and, occasionally, Takings Clause concerns. The Court       has not presumed retroactivity in civil cases unless such       legislative intent is clearly indicated. When legislation is       explicitly retroactive, the Court's due process analysis       generally is more forgiving than its ex post facto analysis.       The Court has stated: ``Provided that the retroactive       application of a statute is supported by a legitimate       legislative purpose furthered by rational means, judgments       about the wisdom of such legislation remain within the       exclusive province of the legislative and executive       branches.'' Section 230(e)(5)(A) appears to have a legitimate       legislative purpose--to make facilitators of commercial sex       trafficking compensate its victims and, having a narrowly       drawn cause of action, its means appear rational.        In rare cases, retroactively imposing liability on private       parties raises Takings Clause claims. The Court in a 5-4,       plurality decision, Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, found it       unconstitutional to require coal companies to cover health       care expenses of retired miners whom they had employed before       exiting the coal industry. Four members of the Court found       the legislation violated the Takings Clause because it       ``imposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of       parties that could not have anticipated the liability, and       the extent of that liability is substantially       disproportionate to the parties' experience.'' Justice Thomas       concurred, but wrote separately to suggest revisiting whether       to apply the Ex Post Facto Clauses in civil cases. Justice       Kennedy concurred in the judgment, but maintained that a Due       Process standard provided a more appropriate analysis. The       four dissenters agreed that the Due Process Clause should       control and that, accordingly, the legislation was       constitutional. It is not clear, however, that Section       230(e)(5)(A) would impose retroactively the kind of massive,       unanticipated civil liability at issue in Eastern       Enterprises.     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this is in relation to an amendment that  has been offered by my colleague Mr. Wyden. It has to do with funding  for the Department of Justice dealing with trafficking. I appreciate  the intent behind it, but I will tell you, as one of the letters from  the law enforcement community, who are opposing this amendment, said,  this is a poison pill. This will derail this in the House of  Representatives.   We have law enforcement from the Fraternal Order of Police, the  National District Attorneys Association, and from all of the national  groups opposing this amendment because they believe it is so important  to pass the underlying legislation and to do it now to provide the  justice that the victims of human trafficking deserve.    Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to join us  in supporting this legislation. Most of you are cosponsors already. It  strikes the right balance. It helps to allow victims to get the justice  they deserve and, lastly, to hold these websites accountable through  prosecution, while at the same time protecting the free and open  internet.   I would like to yield my remaining time to my coauthor and colleague  Senator Blumenthal.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
