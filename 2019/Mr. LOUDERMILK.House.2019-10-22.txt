 Madam Speaker, I am in my fifth year in this esteemed  body, but I have never in my 5 years been subjected to being alienated  from one of the most important duties that people in this House are  given the responsibility for.   There is no issue greater than impeachment, other than just declaring  war. But, yet, I have been alienated from the process.   Now, when Speaker Pelosi decided that she was going to start somewhat  of an inquiry, I was told, being on the Financial Services Committee, I  will be one of the committees involved in it.   But then, apparently, the rules changed, and we shifted it to two  other committees. And those committees, when they were having their  hearings in front of the American people, apparently, that didn't go to  their pleasing because the testimonies didn't meet their narrative, so  they moved it into a secret area.   Since then, I have been trying to get ahold of the transcripts of the  hearings that I have been alienated from.   I actually got one today. After a week of looking for Volker's  testimony and asking for others, I finally got one today of Ambassador  Taylor, from The Washington Post. It appears that we are leaking what  we want to leak.                            ____________________
