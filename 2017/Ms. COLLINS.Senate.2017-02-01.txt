 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor to announce a very  difficult decision that I have made; that is, to vote against the  confirmation of Betsy DeVos to be our Nation's next Secretary of  Education. This is not a decision that I have made lightly. I have a  great deal of respect for Mrs. DeVos. I believe she is a good person. I  know she cares deeply about the children of this Nation. But for the  reasons that I will explain, I simply cannot support her confirmation.   Later today, the Senate will vote on a motion to proceed to the DeVos  nomination. I will vote to proceed to the nomination because I believe  that Presidents are entitled to considerable deference for the  selection of Cabinet members, regardless of which political party is in  power, and that each and every Senator should have the right to cast  his or her vote on nominees for the Cabinet. That is why, during  President Obama's administration, I voted for procedural motions,  including cloture, to allow the President's nominees for Secretary of  Defense and for Secretary of Labor to receive up-or-down votes by the  full Senate, even though I ultimately voted against those two nominees  on the Senate floor. At the time, I stated that it is appropriate for  every Senator to have an opportunity to vote for or against an  individual Cabinet member, and I still believe that is the right  approach.   Let me again make clear what I said at the beginning of my remarks,  which explains why this has been a decision that I have not made  lightly. I know that Mrs. DeVos cares deeply about children. I  recognize that she has devoted much time and resources to try to  improve the education of at-risk children in cities whose public  schools have failed them. I commend her for those efforts.   I wrote to Mrs. DeVos, seeking her assurances in writing that she  would not support any Federal legislation mandating that States adopt  vouchers nor would she condition Federal funding on the presence of  voucher programs in States. She has provided that commitment, and I ask  unanimous consent that the exchange of correspondence with Mrs. DeVos  be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.   Nevertheless, like all of us, Mrs. DeVos is the product of her  experience. She appears to view education through the lens of her  experience in promoting alternatives to public education in Detroit and  other cities where she has, no doubt, done valuable work. Her  concentration on charter schools and vouchers, however, raises the  question about whether she fully appreciates that the Secretary of  Education's primary focus must be on helping States and communities,  parents, teachers, school board members, and administrators strengthen  our public schools.   While it is unrealistic and unfair to expect a nominee to know the  details  [[Page S550]]  of all the programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of  Education, I am troubled and surprised by Mrs. DeVos's apparent lack of  familiarity with the landmark 1975 law, the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act--known as the IDEA--that guarantees a free  and appropriate education to children with special needs.   The mission of the Department of Education is broad, but supporting  public education is at its core. I am concerned that Mrs. DeVos's lack  of experience with public schools will make it difficult for her to  fully understand, identify, and assist with those challenges,  particularly for our rural schools in States like Maine.   In keeping with my past practice, I will vote today to proceed to  debate on Mrs. DeVos's nomination. But I will not, I cannot, vote to  confirm her as our Nation's next Secretary of Education.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.      Mrs. Betsy DeVos,      Education Secretary-Designate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mrs. DeVos: I am writing to follow up on the questions       posed to you in your confirmation hearing regarding your       position on school vouchers should you be confirmed as       Secretary of Education. I have concerns about the impact of       such a voucher program, especially on rural school districts       with limited budgets and numbers of students.        The needs of public schools in Maine are very different       from those in large urban areas, where some schools have       failed our children. The majority of Maine's schools and       school districts are small and rural, and the constraints on       resources and the realities of distance greatly influence the       policies and practices for delivering high-quality education       in those settings. The concern I hear in Maine from teachers,       administrators, and parents is that school vouchers will       divert scarce resources from public schools.        During my time as a U.S. Senator, I have visited more than       200 schools in Maine. At each visit, I have seen repeatedly       the skilled and dedicated teachers, administrators, and staff       working closely with parents to deliver the best possible       education for their students. Likewise, I have spoken with       students who are vibrant members of their communities and       excited about learning. Our public schools have a tremendous       impact on students and communities, and the U.S. Department       of Education is an important partner in fulfilling the       promise of high-quality public education for all students.        Please respond in writing to the following question: Would       you oppose a federal mandate that would require states to       adopt private school vouchers? I ask that you respond prior       to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions       Committee mark-up on January 31.            Sincerely,                                                  Susan M. Collins,      United States Senator.                                   ____                                                   January 25, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for the opportunity to       answer your question about my position on federal education       mandates regarding private school vouchers.        As a strong proponent of local control, I believe the       decision of whether to provide vouchers, scholarships, or       other public support for students who choose to attend a       nonpublic school should not be mandated by the federal       government. Rather, this is a state and school district       matter.        The Every Student Succeeds Act made great strides in       returning control over education decisions to states and       local communities, and I applaud your efforts in passing that       important law. Decisions about whether to provide parental       choice will vary from state to state and district to       district, reflecting local needs.        As I stated during my confirmation hearing before the U.S.       Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on       January 17, while I am a strong supporter of school choice, I       am also respectful of state and local decisions on this       issue. Therefore, if confirmed, I will not impose a school       choice program on any state or school district.        Senator Collins, I look forward to working with you to       support Maine's teachers, schools and districts as they work       to provide a high quality education to every student.            Sincerely,                                                       Betsy DeVos.     Madam President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Special  Committee on Aging, having adopted rules governing its procedures for  the 115th Congress, have a copy of their rules printed in the Record,  pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the  Senate.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING                       Committee Rules 115th Congress                          Jurisdiction and Authority         A.1. There is established a Special Committee on Aging       (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``special       committee'') which shall consist of nineteen Members. The       Members and chairman of the special committee shall be       appointed in the same manner and at the same time as the       Members and chairman of a standing committee of the Senate.       After the date on which the majority and minority Members of       the special committee are initially appointed on or affect       the effective date of title I of the Committee System       Reorganization Amendments of 1977, each time a vacancy occurs       in the Membership of the special committee, the number of       Members of the special committee shall be reduced by one       until the number of Members of the special committee consists       of nine Senators.        2. For the purposes of paragraph I of rule XXV; paragraphs       1, 7(a)(1)-(2), 9, and 10(a) of rule XXVI; and paragraphs       1(a)-(d), and 2(a) and (d) of rule XXVII of the Standing       Rules of the Senate; and the purposes of section 202(I) and       (j) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the       special committee shall be treated as a standing committee of       the Senate.        B.1. It shall be the duty of the special committee to       conduct a continuing study of any and all matters pertaining       to problems and opportunities of older people, including, but       not limited to, problems and opportunities of maintaining       health, of assuring adequate income, of finding employment,       of engaging in productive and rewarding activity, of securing       proper housing, and when necessary, of obtaining care or       assistance. No proposed legislation shall be referred to such       committee, and such committee shall not have power to report       by bill, or otherwise have legislative jurisdiction.        2. The special committee shall, from time to time (but not       less than once year), report to the Senate the results of the       study conducted pursuant to paragraph (1), together with such       recommendation as it considers appropriate.        C.1. For the purposes of this section, the special       committee is authorized, in its discretion, (A) to make       investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, (B)       to make expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate,       (C) to employ personnel, (D) to hold hearings, (E) to sit and       act at any time or place during the sessions, recesses, and       adjourned periods of the Senate, (F) to require, by subpoena       or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production       of correspondence books, papers, and documents, (G) to take       depositions and other testimony, (H) to procure the serve of       individual consultants or organizations thereof (as       authorized by section 202(I) of the Legislative       Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended) and (I) with the       prior consent of the Government department or agency       concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration, to       use on a reimbursable basis the services of personnel of any       such department or agency.        2. The chairman of the special committee or any Member       thereof may administer oaths to witnesses.        3. Subpoenas authorized by the special committee may be       issued over the signature of the chairman, or any Member of       the special committee designated by the chairman, and may be       served by any person designated by the chairman or the Member       signing the subpoena.        D. All records and papers of the temporary Special       Committee on Aging established by Senate Resolution 33,       Eighty-seventh Congress, are transferred to the special       committee.

(b) Shortened Notice. A meeting may be called on not less       than 24 hours notice if the Chairman, with the concurrence of       the Ranking Minority Member, determines that there is good       cause to begin the meeting on shortened notice. An agenda       will be furnished prior to such a meeting.        3. Presiding Officer. The Chairman shall preside when       present.

The Committee shall make public announcement of       the date, place and subject matter of any hearing at least       one week before its commencement. A hearing may be called on       not less than 24 hours notice if the Chairman, with the       concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, determines that       there is good cause to begin the hearing on shortened notice.        2. Presiding Officer. The Chairman shall preside over the       conduct of a hearing when present, or, whether present or       not, may delegate authority to preside to any Member of the       Committee.        3.

A witness shall be       allowed no more than five minutes to orally summarize his or       her prepared statement. Officials of the federal government       shall file 40 copies of such statement with the clerk of the       Committee 48 hours in advance of their appearance, unless the       Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member determine there is       good cause for noncompliance.        6.

A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be       present during his testimony at any public or closed hearing       or depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of       his or her rights, provided, however, that in the case of any       witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or       of a corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that       representation by counsel from the government, corporation,       or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the       witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the       government, corporation, or association.        7. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic       record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in       closed sessions and public hearings.

Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a       time limit set by the committee clerk, a witness may request       changes in testimony to correct errors of transcription,       grammatical errors, and obvious  [[Page S577]]       errors of fact. The Chairman or a staff officer designated by       him shall rule on such request.        8. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence       presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public       hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have       been public reports, tends to impugn his or her character or       adversely affect his or her reputation may:        (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the       evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing       record; and        (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the       Committee to testify in his or her own behalf.        9.

Such request must be made before the completion of       the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to call the       minority witnesses, no later than three days before the       hearing.        10. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the       Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness,       his or her counsel, or any spectator conducts him or herself       in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or       interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing       the Chairman or presiding Member of the Committee present       during such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of       the Senate, his representative or any law enforcement       official to eject said person from the hearing room.        III. Closed Sessions and Confidential Materials        1. Procedure. All meetings and hearings shall be open to       the public unless closed. To close a meeting or hearing or       portion thereof, a motion shall be made and seconded to go       into closed discussion of whether the meeting or hearing will       concern Committee investigations or matters enumerated in       Senate Rule XXVI(5)(b).

Witness Request. Any witness called for a hearing may       submit a written or an electronic request to the Chairman no       later than twenty-four hours in advance for his or her       examination to be in closed or open session. The Chairman       shall inform the Committee of any such request.        3. Confidential Matter.
