 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Equality  Act. This landmark legislation will bring our Nation closer to the  promise of its founding and will change the lives of generations of  LGBTQ Americans for the better. This should be one of the easiest and  most-affirming votes we ever take. Equality is, after all, a self- evident truth. It is part of the bedrock of this Nation.   Throughout our history, the march toward full equality has brought  more Americans of diverse backgrounds into the heart and soul of this  country. Today's vote is another important milestone along that path.   Americans in 29 States can be denied housing, education, credit, or  other services, simply because of who they are. That this can happen in  our country in 2021 is a grave injustice that  [[Page H652]]  must be corrected with this vote. And by passing this bill, we can also  send an unequivocal message to every LGBTQ American and their families:  ``You matter. You have dignity. Your country sees you and has your  back.''   Growing up in New Hampshire, I never thought I could live as my  authentic self. Thankfully, I have a loving family and a welcoming  community who embraced me as a young person, and I am fortunate to live  in a State that has already added sexual orientation and gender  identity to its civil rights statutes.   But too many other LGBTQ Americans live in fear of sharing their  truth, and millions live in fear that the law won't protect them from  discrimination when they need it.   Look, we are not asking for anything any other American doesn't  already enjoy. We just want to be treated the same. We just want  politicians in Washington to catch up with the times and the  Constitution. No one deserves to be treated as a second-class citizen  in this country just for being themselves.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass the Equality Act. Let's achieve full equality  under the law, and let's pass this bill with a strong, affirming vote  today.
