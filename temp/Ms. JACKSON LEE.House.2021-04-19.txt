 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 490, ``DHS  MORALE Act,'' which expands the duties of the Chief Human Capital  Officer to address morale throughout the Department of Homeland  Security.   The bill provides for:   1. leader development and employee engagement,   2. maintaining a catalogue of available employee development  opportunities, and   3. issuing a DHS-wide employee engagement action plan.   The bill directs DHS to establish an employee engagement steering  committee and authorizes it to establish an annual employee award  program.   DHS is also required to report to the congressional homeland security  committees the impacts of the lapse in appropriations between December  22, 2018 and January 25, 2019 on (1) DHS human resources operations;  (2) DHS's ability to meet hiring benchmarks; and (3) retention,  attrition, and morale of DHS personnel.   As a senior member of this committee I have long been troubled by the  low morale, employee retention and job opportunities within the entire  agency and what impact these issues have had on homeland security.   Over my service on this committee, from its inception, I have learned  a great deal about the capacity and strength of the men and women who  work at the Department of Homeland Security.   I hold them in the highest regard for their dedication and service to  our country.   This nation depends on the men and women of the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) to protect citizens from those who wish to do  them harm.   DHS is charged with protecting the nation from terrorism threats.   The agency also assists local, state, and federal law enforcement to  prepare to meet those threats which are significantly different than  what was seen on September 11, 2001.   Because of the dedication of DHS professionals, we are better  prepared to face these challenges as one nation united against a common  foe.   The Department of Homeland Security was not created to protect the  nation from desperate people escaping violence and poverty, seeking  asylum in our country or the ravages of a virus attacking and killing  over half a million Americans.   It was created to prevent attacks against our nation such as the one  carried out by foreign terrorists who used commercial planes as  missiles to destroy the World Trade Center Towers, and a section of the  west side of the Pentagon, and would have killed more if not for the  heroic acts of the passengers on Flight 93 to stop the attackers from  reaching their ultimate destination right here at our nation's Capitol.   On January 6, 2021, our nation was once again threatened, but it was  from an enemy found on our own shores led by the former President of  the United States to attack the Capitol building during the  constitutionally mandated Joint Meeting of Congress to count the  ballots cast by presidential electors and announce the results and the  winner to the nation and the world.   Today, our nation faces multiple crisis at the same time that are  challenging our way of life, values, and resolve; challenges the  American people are, and will be, prepared to face and overcome.   As Americans we are best when we are true to the values we hold dear,  beginning with fidelity to the Constitution and the laws of the United  States.   The Department of Homeland Security has had low employee morale and  low employee engagement since it began operations in 2003 and this must  change.   In 2019, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report  on DHS employee morale.   This report addressed:   1. drivers of employee engagement at DHS and   2. the extent that DHS has initiatives to improve employee engagement  and ensures effective engagement action planning.   GAO analyzed employee trends within DHS, reviewed component employee  engagement action plans and met with officials from DHS and component  human capital offices as well as unions and employee groups.   I was at the Capitol on September 11, 2001, and I will never forget  the Members who were there with me as we sang God Bless America on the  steps of the Capitol.   In the days and weeks following the attacks, we were uncertain what  threat might come and how many lives might be lost as we worked to put  resources in place to deal with an enemy that might be among us.   Over the past nineteen years we have learned a great deal about  homeland security, but we must learn more about making sure that agency  professionals have what they need to excel.   We will be better prepared to face these challenges as one nation,  united against a common foe, when morale issues within DHS have been  effectively addressed.   I urge all members to join me in voting for H.R. 490, DHS MORALE Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 473, the  ``Trusted Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2021,'' which  directs the Government Accountability Office to review Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) trusted traveler programs, and DHS to extend  the enrollment period where an individual's participation in a trusted  traveler program was revoked in error.   The Trusted Traveler consists of several programs that include:  Global Entry, TSA Pre, SENTRI, NEXUS, and FAST.   The Trusted Traveler Programs are risk-based programs to facilitate  the entry of pre-approved travelers.   All applicants are vetted to ensure that they meet the qualifications  for the program to which they are applying.   Receiving a ``Best Match'' or program recommendation based on  eligibility or travel habits does not guarantee acceptance into any  Trusted Traveler program.   We will be better prepared to face these challenges as one nation  united against a common foe, when morale issues within DHS have been  effectively addressed.   I urge all members to join me in voting for H.R. 473 the ``Trusted  Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2021.''    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 367, the  ``Homeland Security Acquisition Professional Career Program Act,''  which establishes in the Department of Homeland Security an acquisition  professional career program to develop a cadre of acquisition  professionals.   Acquisition professionals work in one of six career fields, each of  which plays a vital role in Department Acquisition.   The six Acquisition career fields include:   1. Contract Specialist,   2. Program Manager,   3. Logistician,   4. Systems Engineer,   5. Industrial Engineer/Cost Estimator, and   6. IT Acquisition Specialist.   Homeland Security Acquisition Professional Career Program  participants are appointed to rotational assignments within department  components to gain experience in a wide variety of work environments.   The program is three years, and upon successful completion  participants are placed into a permanent full-time position at the GS- 12 grade.   Job applications to the Department of Homeland Security go through  multiple levels of review.   Human Resources Specialists screen applications to determine whether  basic eligibility requirements are met for the position and rate  applications according to the additional qualifications listed in the  job announcement.   If the application rates among the best qualified, it will be  forwarded to the hiring manager who will make the final selection.   Selection procedures are subject to Federal Civil Service laws, which  ensures that all applicants receive fair and equal treatment in the  hiring process.   Acquisition Professionals are responsible for nearly $20 billion in  annual purchases for the Department of Homeland Security.   The Management Directorate shall administer this essential program,  including carrying out recruitment efforts and providing specialized  acquisition training.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for passage of H.R. 367.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 408, the  ``Department of Homeland Security Mentor-Protege Program Act of 2021,''  which provides statutory authority for the mentor-protege program of  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under which a mentor firm  enters into an agreement with a protege firm to assist the latter to  compete for prime contracts and subcontracts of DHS.   The Mentor-Protege program is designed to motivate and encourage  large business prime contractor firms to provide mutually beneficial  developmental assistance to small business, veteran-owned small  business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small  business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business  concerns.   The participating Mentor-Protege Companies, program is also designed  to:   1. Improve the performance of contracts and subcontracts.   2. Foster the establishment of long-term business relationships  between large prime contractors and small business subcontractors.   3. Strengthen subcontracting opportunities and accomplishments  through three incentives.                        Eligibility for Participation    All firms must be in good standing in the federal marketplace.   The program excludes firms that are on the Federal List of Debarred  or Suspended Contractors.   A Mentor Firm is open to any large business firm that demonstrates  the commitment and capability to assist in the development of small  business proteges.  [[Page H1904]]    A Protege Firm can partner with all small businesses that meet the  definition of small business concern at FAR 19.001, based on their  primary NAICS code, are eligible to be protege firms.   This includes small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small  disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.   Benefits for Mentors to participate in this program include for  acquisitions that require for a subcontracting plan, mentors are  eligible to receive credit in the source selection/evaluation criteria  process for mentor-protege participation.   Additionally, a post-award incentive for subcontracting plan credit  is available by recognizing costs incurred by a mentor firm in  providing assistance to a protege firm and using this credit for  purposes of determining whether the mentor firm attains a  subcontracting plan participation goal applicable to the mentor firm  under a Homeland Security contract.   The program benefits the Protege by allowing them to receive  technical, managerial, financial, or any other mutually agreed upon  benefit from mentors including work that flows from a government or  commercial contract through subcontracting or teaming arrangements. The  assistance could result in significant small business development.   The benefits to the Department of Homeland Security is the  opportunity to move from the traditional large business prime  contractor/small business subcontractor model to a mentor-protege  relationship model based on mutual agreement, trust, and meaningful  business development.   Additionally, mentor-protege arrangements may provide the Department  of Homeland Security with greater assurance that a protege  subcontractor will be able to perform under a contract than a similarly  situated non-protege subcontractor.   Further, protege firms gain opportunities to seek and perform  government and commercial contracts through the guidance and support of  mentor firms that may not have been available to them without the  mentor-protege program.   This type of program is working in the Department of Defense with  great success. It is time to formalize the work of the mentor-protege  program with DHS.   I ask that my colleagues join me in voting for H.R. 408.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R 1491,  the ``Fair Debt Collection for Servicemembers Act,'' which addresses  abusive debt collection practices affecting members of the military by  amending the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCP A) by adding  servicemember-specific provisions to Section 805 (covering prohibited  communications in connection with debt collection) and 808 (defining  unfair practices that constitute a violation of the Act).   H.R. 1491 specifically prohibits debt collectors from making threats  of rank reduction, revocation of security clearance or prosecution  under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   Further, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to  report the impact of this act on military readiness and national  security, including the extent covered members with security clearances  would be impacted by uncollected debt.   While all Americans are covered by laws barring debt collectors from  overly aggressive or deceptive tactics, military members and their  families face particular financial challenges requiring extra  protections: in service to their country, they relocate frequently,  deploy overseas and are a prime target for scammers.   Military members are also more vulnerable to debt collectors in some  instances, and debt collectors have taken advantage of this  vulnerability by targeting members of the Armed Services through  calling their superior officers, threatening reduction in rank and even  courts-martial.   This past year has seen a rise in aggressive debt collections due to  the impact of COVID-19, according to the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau (``CFPB'').   According to the CFPB, in the past year credit and consumer reporting  complaints accounted for more than 58 percent of complaints received by  the CFPB, followed by debt collection (15 percent), credit card (7  percent), checking or savings (6 percent), and mortgage complaints (5  percent).   Nearly 40 percent of complaints filed by servicemembers with the CFPB  concern debt collection--as compared to only 26 percent by non- servicemembers.   This pandemic has been among the most disruptive long-term events we  will see in our lifetimes, and it is not surprising that the shockwaves  it sent across the planet were felt deeply in the consumer financial  marketplace.   Our servicemen and servicewomen make extraordinary sacrifices on our  behalf, and they should not be forced to confront aggressive and  manipulative debt collectors who capitalize on the strains required of  them in the course of their duties.   It is critical for the United States Congress to stand with the women  and men who have served our country and remove the unethical methods  debt collectors use to prey upon our servicemembers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  1491, and address these abusive debt collection practices; the patriots  serving our country deserve no less.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1565,  the ``Senior Security Act,'' which will help stop financial predators  from scamming seniors out of their savings by creating a federal Senior  Investor Taskforce within the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  to strengthen protections and safeguards for senior investors.   This legislation will establish the Senior Investor Taskforce at the  SEC, which will be charged with identifying problems senior investors  encounter, including financial exploitation and cognitive decline, as  well as identifying regulatory changes that could help senior  investors.   The established Senior Investor Taskforce will be required to:   Identify challenges that senior investors encounter, including  problems associated with financial exploitation and cognitive decline;   Identify areas in which senior investors would benefit from changes  at the Commission or the rules of self-regulatory organizations;   Coordinate, as appropriate, with other offices within the Commission  and other taskforces that may be established within the Commission,  self-regulatory organizations, and the Elder Justice Coordinating  Council;   Consult, as appropriate, with state securities and law enforcement  authorities, state insurance regulators, and other federal agencies;  and   Submit a biennial report to Congress.   Every day, and far too often, vulnerable seniors in Texas and across  the country fall victim to financial scammers.   Seniors have worked their entire lives with the promise of a safe and  secure retirement, but unfortunately criminals are taking advantage of  uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and working overtime to target  them.   No senior should ever have to worry that picking up the phone could  mean being scammed out of thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, for  too many members of our communities, that is exactly what is happening.   Retirement accounts are not the only damage these scams target--they  damage the independence and trust of a vulnerable community.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen instances of fraud rise in  unprecedented numbers, as scammers attempt to take advantage of senior  citizens and deprive them of their hard-earned savings.   Bad actors preying on older Americans is, unfortunately, nothing new,  but in the midst of a global pandemic impacting Americans' lives and  livelihoods, cracking down on those scams must be a priority.   One such scam was thwarted by Houston police and the Harris County  District Attorney, who made an arrest in February in an international  cyber-scam that bilked unsuspecting, mostly elderly victims out of more  than $1 million.   According to a report from the Senate Special Committee on Aging  released last Congress, older Americans lose approximately $3 billion  each year to financial scams and abuse.   Although 1 in 20 seniors in the U.S. is a target of fraud schemes,  the National Adult Protective Services Association has found that only  1 in 44 seniors report-that they are victims of a fraud scheme.   Fraudulent IRS impersonation and tech support calls are among the  common and costly scams, and according to the Treasury Inspector  General for Tax Administration, more than 2.5 million Americans have  been targeted by scammers impersonating IRS officials.   Since 2013, more than 15,800 taxpayers have lost at least $80 million  from this type of scam alone.   Furthermore, Microsoft estimates that more than 3 million Americans  are victims of technical support scams, where scammers pretend to be  with a reputable tech company and persuade seniors to provide personal  and bank information.   Although we do know a few statistics, the lack of good, recent data  on senior financial exploitation is a problem that H.R. 1565 would  significantly aid in resolving.   For this reason, I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R.  1565, the Fraud and Scam Reduction Act, which is critical to protecting  seniors' hard-earned savings and stopping fraudulent schemes before it  is too late.
