 Mr. Speaker, I have spoken with New Mexicans all  across my district. I have  [[Page H1279]]  talked to mayors, local officials, Tribal leaders. I have asked them  the same question: What do you need?   What they have all said, Republicans and Democrats alike, is that  they need this rescue plan. Our small businesses are ready to put this  lifeline to use. Our frontline workers, families, and farmers are  ready. New Mexico is ready to start climbing out of this crisis.   Americans have told us what they need. We have listened, and now we  are delivering.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to the  passionate voices born of grief that we heard from today, to join my  heart with their hearts.   Gun violence robs our communities and our families of innocent lives,  innocent worshippers, innocent shoppers mowed down just because they  are Latinos.   I rise for the children in too many schools who have lost their  classmates, for the families who mourn their young, for the students  who organized and petitioned us to act against gun violence with  sensible laws. I am glad we passed the gun safety legislation to stem  the epidemic of gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, New Mexico has the fourth-highest gun death rate in the  country. Today, we took a commonsense, critical step to keep our New  Mexican, our American, children, families, and communities safe, to  drive us toward a more equitable, thriving future for all.
