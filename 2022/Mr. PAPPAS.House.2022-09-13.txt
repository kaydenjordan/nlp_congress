 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member  Bost for getting these bills to the floor, including this important  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan legislation,  H.R. 8260, the Faster Payments to Veterans' Survivors Act. It is a  bipartisan bill that ensures that VA quickly identifies, locates, and  pays surviving family members the life insurance benefits they are  owed.   VA's insurance service already has some tools in place to identify,  locate, and pay hard-to-find beneficiaries, but more can be done to  prevent these survivors from needlessly waiting during what is likely a  difficult time, both emotionally and financially.   My bipartisan bill, the Faster Payments to Veterans' Survivors Act,  will make much needed reforms to allow VA to better identify and locate  surviving family members of recently deceased veterans.   By making these reforms, we will make sure they receive the payments  and benefits they were owed in a timely manner.   According to the VA, the Department owed more than $155 million to  15,000 individuals at the end of September 2020.   For a widow or widower who is struggling to make ends meet, a life  insurance payment of $10,000 makes a world of difference.   Alfred, a constituent of mine in Rochester, New Hampshire, and a  Korean war veteran, shared how much this bill will mean to his family.  His father-in-law, a veteran of World War II, passed away last year.  Alfred's spouse waited for months to receive the survivors benefits  owed to her by VA. He contacted our office for help remedying the  issue. We were able to help them, but no family should have to jump  through hoops for months following the loss of a loved one.    This bill directs the Department to improve and better publicize an  online tool that families of veterans can use to search for past due  benefits. It expands access to internal and external data sources that  will help VA track down veterans' survivors. It makes sure the  Department is adequately staffed to perform these searches.   The bill also shortens the unnecessarily long timeframe in which VA  is authorized to designate and pay alternate beneficiaries and ensures  that procedures for paying alternate beneficiaries are consistent  across several different life insurance programs. All of these steps  will lead to faster payments to veterans' survivors.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina for  co-leading this bipartisan bill. I appreciate the strong bipartisan  support from my colleagues and from veterans service organizations,  including the VFW, American Legion, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America, Vietnam Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of  America, Modern  [[Page H7772]]  Military Association of America, and Paralyzed Veterans of America.   Once enacted, the Faster Payments to Veterans' Survivors Act will  have a real and positive impact on the financial well-being of  thousands of veterans' families.   Our veterans serve our country and sacrifice so much, and their  family members contribute and sacrifice right alongside them. It is of  utmost importance that we honor those commitments and support their  family members.   The bill passed the Veterans' Affairs Committee unanimously in July,  and I urge the full House to support its passage today.                                time  1630
