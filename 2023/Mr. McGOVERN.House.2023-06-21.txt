 Mr. Speaker, Republicans have said time and time again  that they don't want to hurt pregnant mothers and young children, but  they did just that with the FY 2024 agriculture spending bill that they  advanced out of the House Appropriations Committee last week.   The Republican bill slashes WIC funding by $185 million from the  current funding level and guts WIC's extra fruit and vegetable benefits  for 5 million pregnant and postpartum moms and young children.   It is the first time ever that WIC has been intentionally  underfunded. At a time when many families are still dealing with  pandemic-caused inflation, these cuts are especially cruel. I am  appalled that Republicans' idea of fiscal responsibility is taking  healthy food away from pregnant moms and kids under 5. Seriously?   Mr. Speaker, let's not forget that Republicans also tried to cut  Meals on Wheels and WIC in their original debt ceiling bill, and they  have a bill to kick moms with young children and seniors off of SNAP.   Taking food away from the most vulnerable is completely heartless. It  is shameful, and we are going to fight these cuts.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans are in charge of the House of  Representatives. They control the schedule here. They control when  bills get brought up for debate. They make the Calendar. We could be  debating a bipartisan bill that actually helps get more people on to  healthcare or lowers prescription drug costs and makes coverage more  affordable, but instead Republicans are bringing to the floor a bill to  chip away at the Affordable Care Act. They are siding with billionaire  corporations and insurance companies and actually spending money to  kick people off of healthcare.   We could be debating bipartisan legislation that makes it easier for  regular middle-class Americans to buy a home, but instead, Republicans  are bringing to the floor a bill that literally increases mortgage fees  charged to middle-income borrowers.   Time and time again, this majority brings to the floor bills that  benefit billionaire corporations, insurance companies, the rich and  powerful, Big Oil, Big Pharma, all at the expense of everyday people  back home who send us here to fight for them.                                time  1230    We could be debating bipartisan legislation that actually addresses  our broken immigration system. Instead, Republicans are bringing to the  floor a nonbinding resolution that condemns a nonexistent problem so  they can go after immigrants once again.   We had a Member in the Rules Committee last night yelling and  screaming and ranting and raving about all he thinks is wrong with our  immigration system and the border. It was actually kind of scary.   Listen, I get being passionate about this problem. I am not here to  argue that our immigration system doesn't need to be fixed. We all know  that it could use a comprehensive overhaul, but we don't need to be  screaming at each other about this nonbinding press release of a bill  that does literally nothing to help deal with our border. My God.   Republicans want to talk about immigration, so let's talk about  immigration.   Let's talk about how the Republican solution to the border is  building a stupid wall that even they know won't work.   Let's talk about fentanyl. Let's talk about how most of it is  trafficked through legal ports of entry in the United States by U.S.  citizens, by the way, and let's talk about how President Joe Biden  seizes more fentanyl at the border than Donald Trump did. That is just  a fact.   Yet, we had a Member last night have a complete meltdown over this  issue. Would Republicans rather the Biden administration not seize  fentanyl? I don't get it. Make it make sense.   Let's talk about how, since the end of title 42 on May 11, unlawful  entries along the southern border have plummeted. As of June 6, Customs  and Border Protection had an average of 3,700  [[Page H3005]]  encounters between points of entry or unscheduled encounters per day, a  decrease of over 70 percent.   Republicans don't want to talk about any of that. Instead, they are  going to try to get people all worked up by scapegoating vulnerable  migrants who are fleeing awful circumstances in search of safety.   I can't believe I have to say this, but migrants are not political  pawns. They come to our country seeking a better life, often fleeing  violence and oppression. They are human beings and deserve to be  treated with dignity and respect. Yet, Republican Governors have  treated migrants like they are garbage, busing them across the country  like luggage, with no advance notice or coordination, dumping them  outside after they call the press to show up and make a scene. I find  it disgusting. I find it racist. I find it disrespectful to all that  this country stands for.   This nonbinding press release that they are bringing to the floor  isn't a serious attempt to solve a problem. They are dropping migrants  off in New York City and then attacking New York City for trying to  come up with solutions to the problem. This is absurd.   Then, Republicans claim gyms can't be used to house migrants because  they want to ``protect students.'' Give me a break. Migrants have never  been housed in a facility with kids. That is just a fact. In the Rules  Committee last night, we asked the person who was bringing the bill  before the committee to give us examples. She couldn't.   If we want to talk about protecting students, let us talk about  protecting students. A thousand kids have died from gun violence this  year. Where will the next school shooting be? Parents are terrified  their kid will be next. Teachers are terrified that their class will be  next. Students are terrified they will be next. Republicans are here  regulating gyms instead of guns. What the hell is wrong with these  people?   This majority is obsessed with demonizing, demeaning, and targeting  people who are coming to the United States in desperate search of a  better life. Stop appealing to the worst instincts in people. Stop  peddling hate. Stop fueling racism.   Here is a contrast I want people to know about. President Biden and  the Democrats are working to expand the middle class, to build a strong  economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Democrats are lowering  costs for working families, helping cut inflation by more than half  since last summer.   Democrats have taken on Big Pharma to reduce prescription drug costs,  and Democrats continue to fight special interests to lower healthcare  costs while making childcare and housing more affordable for working  families.   Democrats are investing in America and have created more than 13  million jobs since President Biden took office. Democrats are bringing  supply chains back home, fixing our roads and bridges, and delivering  clean water and high-speed internet to more communities.   Democrats are making our communities safer. We are committed to  building on the gun safety legislation we passed last year by  strengthening background checks and keeping dangerous weapons of war  off our streets to protect America's kids.   Democrats know that we don't have to choose between an immigration  system that reflects our interests and our values, and we don't  demonize and attack people who want to come to this country in search  of a better life.   You are seeing on the floor today exactly what Republicans have to  offer: nothing, not a thing, no plans, no ideas. They are just  interested in helping the rich and powerful and using immigrants as  political pawns to drive a wedge between people. It is a rotten,  shameful thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and  the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues on the Republican side to  get serious about bringing legislation to the floor that will actually  make a difference, that will actually help fix some of the challenges  that we face in this country. This is a joke.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentleman's tirade just now, but the bottom line is  that nothing in this bill that his party is championing as somehow this  important piece of legislation does anything to provide any assistance  to any of these communities. Not one penny goes to offset any of the  costs that might be incurred--nothing, not a thing.   I just don't get it. People come onto this floor and speak in sound  bites and do press releases and then bring legislation to the floor  that is nonbinding, that means nothing, that does nothing. This is  ridiculous.   We need to fix our immigration system. We tried to do that when we  were in charge. We had challenges in the Senate trying to overcome the  filibuster, but we were trying to fix the system. That is a contrast to  what we are doing here now, which is a nonbinding resolution.   By the way, a nonbinding resolution, to anybody who is watching,  means it is just somebody's opinion. It doesn't do anything--no money,  no assistance, no help to anybody. It is just like: ``I want to tell  you what my opinion is.'' Big deal.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question,  and if we do, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to provide  for consideration of a resolution which states that it is the House's  duty to protect and preserve Social Security and Medicare for future  generations and reject any cuts to these essential programs.   We know, because we have heard from my friends, that they have their  eyes on these programs. We need to get people on record to make sure  that they will not vote for any cuts.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Sorensen) to discuss that proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record a Washington Post article titled: ``House GOP eyes Social  Security, Medicare amid spending battle.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is simple. To lower the national deficit, House  Republicans plan to try to cut Social Security and Medicare. This  includes potentially ``raising the Social Security retirement age to  70, targeting younger Americans who have yet to obtain Federal  benefits.''   We have a number of Members on the Republican side who talk about  privatization all the time. That is their favorite word when it comes  to Social Security and Medicare. We want to make sure the American  people understand who is on their side and who is trying to undercut  things that are very meaningful to them.   Mr. Speaker, I also point out that my Republican colleagues have been  in disarray since they took the majority, and they have failed to pass  meaningful legislation into law on behalf of the American people. As I  said, they control this Chamber, the schedule, the committees, and what  they bring to the floor.                                time  1245    At this point in the 117th Congress, that is the previous Congress,  Democrats had passed 17 bills into law. At this point in the 116th  Congress, under divided government, we passed 21 bills into law.   You want to know how much this majority has passed into law?   Six.   They are failing the American people. They are incapable of bringing  legislation to the floor that can garner bipartisan support that has  any chance in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  comparison of the number of bills passed into law by May 31, which  demonstrates how utterly unproductive this Congress has been.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I spoke about the unproductiveness of my Republican  friends and how they are squandering all opportunities to help the  American people since they have been in control but let me just talk to  you about some of the stuff that we did when we were in charge of this  place.   Let me remind people that because of the Affordable Care Act, which I  think almost everybody over there voted ``no'' on, 40 million Americans  have health coverage under the ACA. Women have access to preventive  health services like breast and cervical cancer screening at no cost to  them. Prescription drugs are more affordable for older adults.   Americans with disabilities are protected from discrimination on the  basis of medical history or preexisting conditions. Lifetime caps on  essential health benefits are gone. They are gone.   Since 2010 when the bill became law, Republicans have been obsessed  with tearing it apart. Under Republican majorities, we have voted  nearly 70 times to repeal and undermine the law. Nearly 70 times  Republicans have tried to dismantle a law that provides healthcare  coverage to 20 million people and covers preventive health services.   Today, Republicans are continuing this effort to undermine the ACA.  It is maddening where their priorities are. It is maddening. Here is  the deal. They know that they can't just repeal it outright because  everybody doesn't want them to do that. What they are doing is they are  going after it bit by bit by bit, trying to chip away at the edges and  trying to kill it through a thousand cuts so that maybe people won't  notice, that people won't notice when essential benefits are no longer  guaranteed.   Healthcare ought to be a right in this country, and we ought to be  building on the ACA, not tearing it apart, not tearing it down, not  trying to make it more difficult for people to get the essential  services they need, not to try to give people plans that don't provide  the coverage for whatever may occur to them and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to understand--again, the good  news here is that all the bills they are bringing to the floor today  have no chance in hell of going anywhere in the Senate because they are  just over the top and extreme.   Make no mistake about what is happening here. They have a target on  healthcare. They have a target on Social Security. They have a target  on Medicare. Rather than trying to fix our immigration laws, what are  they doing?   They are trying to tear this country apart. They are trying to  demonize immigrants. They have no solutions, just a nonbinding  resolution that does nothing. It basically addresses a fake problem  that was totally ginned up by FOX News. That is where their priorities  are. Certainly, we can spend our time doing more productive things.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind the gentleman that fentanyl is  coming across the southern border because U.S. citizens are bringing it  [[Page H3009]]  across through ports of entry. Don't trust me on this. You can look to  the conservative think tank CATO that will reinforce what I just said.   By the way, this bill that you are bringing here does nothing to  solve the problem. It is a waste of time. There are no more resources;  nothing to combat it. It is just a press release. What a joke that we  are here debating something like this when we could be debating  something that might make a real difference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say, what I am a little surprised about today  is that nobody has raised the deficit or the debt because the  Republicans were obsessed with that when they basically threatened to  ruin this economy by not allowing us to move forward to increase the  debt ceiling.   We had to have all these cuts from programs that help poor people.  Throwing people off of programs like SNAP, the food benefit, that is  what they did. I now understand why we are not talking about the  deficit or debt today because of the bills that they are bringing to  the floor.   One of the bills that we are talking about right now, the CHOICE  Arrangement Act, cuts more than $348 million. That is what the CBO  says.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the CBO  score.    Mr. Speaker, that is just the beginning. House  Republicans spent half a billion dollars on their H.R. 1 bill that  would gut environmental protections and take tax credits away from  people who want to upgrade their homes. Half a billion dollars was  added to the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, $6 billion was added to the deficit on their deeply  flawed H.R. 2, a bill attacking immigrants and essentially ending  asylum as we know it.   Get this, $114 billion--billion with a b--was added through their  H.R. 23 to protect the wealthy from paying their fair share of taxes.  That was their very first bill on the House floor in this Congress,  their top priority adding $114 billion to the deficit.   Over $505 million was added through the Republicans' bill last week  to enhance access to firearm stabilizing braces.   Republicans are on a spending spree, all on the backs of real  people--not the rich, not billionaire corporations, not by reallocating  funding from the bloated Pentagon budget. Maybe some of you saw the  ``60 Minutes'' piece a few weeks ago about the cost overruns, where  former Pentagon officials said that they are spending hundreds of  thousands of dollars on a switch that costs a couple hundred dollars.   We can't find a penny, yet they want to increase the Pentagon budget  with no questions asked.                                time  1300    They can't touch any of the tax cuts for any of the billionaires or  multimillionaires of big corporations. We can't do that, and we all  know why. Google where they all spend their money on political  campaigns. However, they spend all this money, and they want to balance  the budget on the backs of regular, everyday people, and, in  particular, the most vulnerable in our country.   Last night everybody was complaining about the CBO score--the CBO  score. I guess I understand why my colleagues across the aisle would  not want to support the hardworking, nonpartisan people at CBO. Maybe  it is because they keep giving them bad news. Maybe it is because they  keep saying to my friends that they are spending and spending and  spending and it is adding enormously to our deficit and our debt.   Mr. Speaker, I raise this issue because my Republican friends like to  come to the floor and talk about the deficit. Today they are not. I  think it is because we had this conversation in the Rules Committee  last night. I want people to know that they are driving up the deficit  and the debt, and then when they want to talk about fiscal  responsibility, where do they go?   They go to the middle class, and they go to the people who are poor.  That is where their priorities are. So there is a big difference here.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has no other speakers, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am surprised my friend has no further speakers. I  thought because these bills were so important and unbelievably  essential that there would be lots of speakers on the other side.   Mr. Speaker, we all know how valuable our time is here. We only have  13 scheduled legislative weeks until the end of the year--13 weeks that  could be used to improve the lives of everyday Americans.   So how have Republicans in the House decided to use this week?   Are we working to make our communities safer or our educational  system better?   No. We are not. Republicans would rather demonize immigrants and  peddle hate than regulate guns or invest in schools.   They are in control. They can bring what they want to the floor.  Don't take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Look at what they are bringing  to the floor.   Are we here to help regular Americans purchase their first home?   No. We are voting on a bill today that will make it easier for those  well-off to get even further ahead while making it more difficult on  middle-class home buyers.   Mr. Speaker, you can't make this stuff up, but that is what this bill  does.   Are we passing legislation that will continue to expand people's  access to affordable healthcare?   No. Republicans want to chip away at popular policy that provides  quality coverage to millions.   There are very real issues that regular people in this country face  every day, and I wish House Republicans could wise up and address them.   This is such a colossal waste of time. One of the bills is  nonbinding, but the other bills aren't going anywhere. This is a waste  of time. Rather than working across the aisle trying to find common  ground, they continue to bring these messaging bills. These are bills  that demonize immigrants and that continue to chip away at the  Affordable Care Act. These are bills that continue to screw people in  the middle class, and they continue to bring these bills to the floor.   I don't know who their base is, but apparently it is popular amongst  their base.   This is not about legislating. It is not about making law, and it is  not about improving the lives of anybody in this country.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ``no'' vote on the underlying  legislation and a ``no'' vote on this rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, Republicans care more about personal  vendettas and sucking up to Trump than about doing what is right for  the country.   Adam Schiff has been an incredible Member of Congress. He exposed  Trump's lies and corruption, impeached him, and got a bipartisan  conviction vote in the Senate. He has passed real and consequential  laws that solve real problems and help real people.   What has the sponsor of this censure done? What is Congresswoman  Luna's record? I want her constituents to know in her congressional  career, five of the six legislative items she has ever introduced are  about Adam Schiff. Doesn't she have anything better to do--like, I  don't know, help her district?   This is what is known as lunacy, and it is all about deflection,  retaliation, and distraction from Trump's 37 felony charges.   The people who came up with the big lie want to censure Adam Schiff  for telling the obvious truth, all so they can defend a three-time  loser ex-President who has been indicted more times than he has been  elected.   What an embarrassing day for this institution. What an insult to the  American people. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I stand proudly with  Congressman Schiff.
