 Madam Speaker, this past December, our past President  finalized a rule requiring States to fund Planned Parenthood through  title X funding.   Today I rise as a cosponsor of and in support of this joint  resolution, H.J. Res. 43, which repeals this Obama rule and allows  States like mine, Kansas, to choose how to best allocate title X funds.  The Obama rule is yet another example of government overreach that  tries to force my State to fund Planned Parenthood.   Redirecting Federal funds away from abortion providers does not  reduce funds for other title X programs. Instead, this will allow even  more funding available for county health departments and other public  health clinics for family planning, sexually transmitted disease  testing, and lifestyle choices education.   While Planned Parenthood remains a political organization that spent  tens of thousands of dollars in the last election to oppose pro-life  candidates, let me stop and salute the nurses and social workers back  home at the Barton County Health Department where I worked for years,  and salute my fellow doctors, Dr. Perry Smith and Dr. Bill King, and  everyone's favorite nurse practitioner, Sheila Hein, who dedicated  themselves to helping women.
