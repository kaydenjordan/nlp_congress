 Madam Speaker, I rise today on Thursday, November 18, in  honor of National Rural Health Day. My home State of Mississippi is  leading the way in rural healthcare innovation, which is important  because 54 percent of our State's population lives in rural areas.  Thanks to a strong network of hospitals served by dedicated healthcare  providers, as well as a world-class telehealth system anchored by the  University of Mississippi Medical Center, patients in Mississippi can  receive the care they need in their communities.   I am proud of the partnership between two universities in my district  to improve health outcomes in rural communities across our State. The  University of Mississippi Medical Center, our State's only academic  medical center, and Mississippi State University, with its land grant  mission and extension expertise, are partnering on critical healthcare  and public health challenges and are working together to meet the  healthcare needs of their fellow Mississippians.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for Mississippi's role in advancing  rural healthcare and the selfless service of our healthcare providers.                            ____________________
