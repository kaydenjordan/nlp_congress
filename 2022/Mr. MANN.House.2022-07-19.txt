 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a win for American  farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers.   Fertilizer prices have been skyrocketing for over a year now, with  the cost of urea ammonium nitrate, in particular, rising to record  highs. Since March, I have been urging the U.S. International Trade  Commission to suspend duties on UAN imports from Trinidad and Tobago,  and this week, they did just that.   On July 18, the U.S. International Trade Commission rejected imposing  final duties on urea ammonium nitrate, UAN, in its determination that  antidumping activity surrounding UAN fertilizers in Trinidad and Tobago  did not harm the U.S. fertilizer industry. With this determination, the  ITC has finally responded to my three letters dating back to March, the  legislation I introduced in that same month, and my testimony before  them in June, all urging reconsideration of the initial duties.   I am proud to lead the charge on this effort. I will continue to  monitor the situation, and I look forward to seeing the immediate  removal of duties on UAN imports from Trinidad and Tobago, which is the  most immediate opportunity for a near-term, partial remedy to the high  cost of fertilizer facing U.S. farmers.                            ____________________
