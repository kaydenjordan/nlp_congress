 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 26.   We didn't hop in a time machine back to the 1970s. It is 2023, and we  all know what this is about. It is not about the protection of newborn  children. It is about control. It is about Republicans' continued  desire to control  [[Page H186]]  women, take away their freedoms, limit their bodily autonomy, plunge  poor women deeper into poverty, and further marginalize those already  not seen.   It is about intimidating, silencing, and criminalizing doctors. It is  about the nationwide abortion ban that Republicans have been itching to  enact since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, bans that the American  people have said loudly and clearly that they do not want.    We cannot continue to let the extreme Republican Party attack and  erode the rights of women across this country. We have a responsibility  to put an end to politicians inserting themselves into the doctors'  offices and uteruses of women across this country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure.
