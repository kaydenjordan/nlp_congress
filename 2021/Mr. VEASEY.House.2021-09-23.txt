 Mr. Speaker, I bet every single person on this floor  today--every single person--knows someone who has had an abortion or  exercised their constitutional right to reproductive healthcare.   But that lawful right is under attack in the State of Texas because  Republicans in my home State have passed what is probably the most  dangerous and draconian law that we have seen since Roe v. Wade.   It literally creates a vigilante bounty system that allows a private  citizen to sue anyone who knowingly aids or abets a procedure.   In a State like Texas, where people are always professing about  freedoms and different things like that, it is amazing to see  conservative politicians wage this war against women's rights and  against women's healthcare.   I think it is deplorable. This law is dangerous, and it is un-Texan.   Who it is really going to hurt is, disproportionately, low-income  women, who are going to find it harder to be able to leave the State to  seek these services.   The doctor who wrote the op-ed who said that he performed an  abortion, I think that that doctor is a hero, and we ought to applaud  him on this House floor today. That is why I am going to vote for the  Women's Health Protection Act.                            ____________________
