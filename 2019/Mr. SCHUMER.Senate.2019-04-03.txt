 Mr. President, this is a very sad day for the Senate. At  a time when Leader McConnell brags about confirming more judges than  anyone has done in a very long time, he feels the need to invoke the  terribly destructive and disproportionate procedure of the nuclear  option in order to fast-track even more of President Trump's  ultraconservative nominees to the Federal bench.   Before I discuss that in greater detail, I want to note for the  record that Democrats were prepared to confirm the nomination of Mr.  Kessler by unanimous consent, so the cloture vote we had was  unnecessary.   If you have been listening to Senators debate this issue in recent  days, you have heard a lot of claims and  [[Page S2217]]  counterclaims about cloture votes, about rates of confirmation for  circuit and district courts in different Congresses, about judicial  vacancies and other arcane things that may not sound very illuminating.  So I want to start by making clear what this debate is really all  about. I want to issue a warning about what is at stake in this fight.  Underneath all of the statistics, what Leader McConnell, President  Trump, and Republicans in the Senate are trying to do is use the courts  to adopt the far-right agenda that Republicans know they cannot enact  through the legislative process.   Why can't they? Because it is an agenda the American people reject,  an agenda set by the far right, which Republicans in the Senate follow.   Senator McConnell and Republicans in Washington understand that they  will never persuade enough Americans to support backward goals like  ending women's reproductive freedom, taking away healthcare, rolling  back civil rights, making it more difficult to vote, or abolishing  safeguards for clean air and clean water.   Instead, they decided there was another route to achieving their  policy goals, one that requires neither public support nor legislation:  the courts. So Republicans, pressured by the hard right and by wealthy,  special interest donors, launched a sustained effort to pack the courts  with very conservative judges, preferably young ones, who would sit on  the bench for decades. These prospective judges were identified as  early as law school, having signaled their hard-right leanings through  their writings or membership in conservative groups like the Federalist  Society.   Nominees like these started to appear during the George W. Bush  administration. Take Miguel Estrada, a Bush nominee with no judicial  experience, who held membership in the Federalist Society but had no  writings and claimed he had never even thought about Roe v. Wade.   Or take William Pryor, another Bush nominee, who called Roe ``the  worst abomination in the history of constitutional law'' and who argued  that States should have the right to criminalize homosexuality.   Or take Charles Pickering, who advocated a reduced sentence for a man  convicted of burning a cross in the front yard of an interracial  couple.   Before the Republicans launched their campaign to remake the courts,  neither party would have dared put forward such radical nominees.   Starting with his campaign and into his Presidency, President Donald  Trump has been captive--totally captive--to the conservative campaign  to take over the courts. Before he was a Presidential candidate, Mr.  Trump had been a Democrat and a person with no fixed judicial  philosophy, so conservatives didn't trust him. He and his advisers came  up with a solution: Ask the Federalist Society to produce a list of  far-right Supreme Court nominees, and then have candidate Trump pledge  to only nominate people on that list. And not just the Supreme Court-- the Federalist Society is and continues to be a huge influence on  nominees to the circuit courts.   No other Presidential candidate had so willingly and openly  outsourced judicial nominations this way, but it mollified the hard  right, and the President has dutifully nominated people from the list  to the Supreme Court. He has made similarly ideological choices for the  circuit and district courts.   This is an alarming strategy because, over the last 2 years,  President Trump has nominated and Senate Republicans have advanced the  most unqualified and radical nominees in modern times.   Consider the nomination of Ryan Bounds, who misled the Oregon  Senators' bipartisan judicial selection committee about his  controversial writings in the past, writings in which he dismissed  efforts to increase diversity as mere ``race-think,'' criticized  Stanford University's suggested punishment for students who defaced an  LGBT pride statue, criticized a student group for protesting against a  hotel company that had fired workers trying to unionize, and  disregarded the value of university disciplinary actions against  students accused of sexual violence. Five of the seven members of  Oregon's in-State screening committee, including the committee's chair,  said they would not have recommended Bounds had they known of his  college writings when they first interviewed him. Fortunately, it  became clear that a few Republicans would not support Mr. Bounds on the  floor, and the nomination was withdrawn.   Consider the nomination of Thomas Farr, who has an extensive record  defending discriminatory voting laws and racial gerrymandering in North  Carolina. He is also credibly alleged to have played a role in the  voter suppression efforts of the Jesse Helms campaign, including  sending over 100,000 postcards to heavily African-American precincts  that ``falsely told voters they could be found ineligible to vote based  on several conditions involving place and length of residence.''  Amazingly, after something as despicable as that, President Trump and  Leader McConnell pushed hard for his nomination, but it could not  withstand scrutiny by the Senate and was ultimately withdrawn due to  the united Democratic opposition and a few conscientious Republican  Senators.   I would note that in the cases of both Mr. Farr and Mr. Bounds, the  Republican concerns emerged only at the end of postcloture debate time,  which Republicans now propose to limit. Had we had only 2 hours,  horrible nominees--way beyond the bounds of normal nomination and  discourse, even from conservatives--like Farr, like Bounds would be  sitting on the courts today.   I agree with what my colleague Senator Klobuchar has said:         Two hours for a lifetime appointment . . . is unacceptable.    She said:         Two hours for a lifetime appointment, with huge influence       on people's lives, is unacceptable. It's ridiculous. It's a       mockery of how this institution should work.    It is not just the courts. There are many examples in the executive  branch as well. Ann Marie Buerkle, nominated to chair the CPSC--just  today the Post reported that this nominee blocked action at the  Commission to recall hundreds of thousands of potentially defective  baby strollers, even in the face of reports that they caused  ``potentially life-threatening injuries.'' She even kept Democratic  Commissioners in the dark about the investigation.   Of course, there is Chad Readler, who led the charge to end  preexisting condition protections. President Trump and Senate  Republicans, the self-declared ``party of healthcare,'' rewarded him by  overwhelmingly confirming him to a lifetime position as a circuit court  judge. Despite Mr. Readler's conspicuous role in trying to curtail  Americans' healthcare, no Republicans were willing to stand up to  President Trump and vote against his confirmation.   At this point, people listening to these proceedings might be asking  themselves: What happened when a Democratic President occupied the  White House?   The answer is that Republicans, led by Senator McConnell, remained  undeterred. In such times, they chose to employ the extraordinary  tactic of denying confirmation to a Democratic President's nominees in  order to hold vacancies open until a Republican could regain the  Presidency. It was an audacious and insidious gambit, a way to nullify  a Democratic President's power to fill judicial vacancies.   We saw this tactic during the Clinton administration, when  Republicans on the Judiciary Committee killed a number of President  Clinton's quite moderate judicial nominees, even without the basic  courtesy of a hearing.   We saw it again during the Obama administration, when Republicans  used the filibuster and other forms of delay to more than double the  number of circuit and district court vacancies. During Obama's last 2  years in office, the Republican Senate confirmed fewer circuit court  nominees than any Congress in 70 years.   Then, in March of 2016, Senator McConnell and Senate Republicans took  this maneuver to a new Machiavellian low. They refused to even consider  President Obama's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States,  Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, one of the most respected jurists in the  Nation, a man known not only for his judicial excellence and perfect  judicial temperament but his moderation. In fact, Senator Orrin Hatch,  a conservative's conservative and the former chairman of Judiciary  Committee, had previously endorsed Judge Garland for the Supreme Court.  [[Page S2218]]    But the merits didn't concern Senator McConnell. His cynical strategy  required Republicans to block the Garland nomination for almost a year  until after President Obama's second term ended, and that is exactly  what they did. It was widely condemned as a naked power grab that  nullified the President's constitutional authority. It was a terrible,  deeply lamentable moment for our democracy and our Constitution. Yet,  as the New York Times reported, Senator McConnell said it was one of  his ``proudest achievements.''   After President Trump took office, Republicans sensed an opportunity  to grease the conveyer belt even more. Senator McConnell ordered the  Judiciary Committee chairman to do away with the longstanding practice  that Senators be consulted about district court nominees in their home  States. The blue-slip tradition ensured that judicial nominees  reflected the ideology and values of the State to which they were  nominated. It provided some healthy counterbalance against nominees who  were outside the mainstream from either party or were lacking in proper  qualifications. Thanks to Senate Republicans, led by Senator McConnell,  that protection is now history.   So when Republicans complain about Democratic handling of nominees,  there is no other word for it but hypocrisy. You don't have to take my  word for it. According to the Congressional Research Service, more  circuit judges have been confirmed in the first 2 years of the Trump  administration than in the first 2 years of any Presidency since at  least the Truman administration.   The majority leader himself has celebrated the pace of confirmations.  He bragged about it to the Heritage Foundation. He said this to them a  few months ago:         We confirmed every circuit judge. We've now done 29 circuit       judges. That is a record for this quick in any administration       in history.    Those are Leader McConnell's words, not mine.   Now we have to change the rules, even though you have confirmed more  circuit court judges than anyone in history. That is a shame. That is a  disgrace. That is not the Senate we want. For Leader McConnell to brag  about confirming more judges than ever before and then to complain  about Democratic obstruction and say that the process is broken so you  have to change the rules is the height of hypocrisy.   Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans also complain about the pace  of confirmation for President Trump's executive branch and independent  Agency choices. They conveniently omit Republicans' sorry record of  obstruction of nominees to Democratic seats at important agencies like  the NLRB, the FDIC, and the SEC, which have suffered as Republicans  caused dedicated public servants like former NLRB Chair Mark Pearce to  languish for months or even years.   It is actually a little surprising that Leader McConnell and his  Republican colleagues would draw attention to the subject of executive  nominees now, given the appalling history of incompetence, corruption,  and venality among President Trump's so-called ``best people,'' not to  mention the fact that there are hundreds of vacancies the President  can't even be bothered to fill.   Staffing the government is serious business and so is the system of  justice assigned to the courts by our Constitution. They both deserve  better than the Senate Republicans' cynical, partisan efforts to turn  the Senate into a conveyer belt for ideological conservatives.   The notion that President Trump's judicial nominees have been treated  unfairly is simply false. There is no truth to it, as all of these  statistics that I have talked about have shown. What Republicans really  want to see is the elimination of yet another norm of the Senate so  they can automate and expedite the nomination process without a modicum  of debate. They are all for ``consent'' with no ``advice.'' With all  undue haste, they want to pack the courts with partisan warriors, not  impartial jurists. It is outrageous.   Democrats have a different view of who should sit on the Federal  bench. We have a different view of the role of this Chamber. Our  judicial system works best when we hold nominees to three simple  standards: excellence, moderation, and diversity. These are not  ideological litmus tests. They are the pillars of a healthy system of  justice. They are the benchmarks by which we can rest assured that the  men and women who are appointed to the Federal bench will respect the  rule of law and execute their duties impartially.   It cuts both ways. When Republicans are prepared to act in good faith  and advance nominees of high caliber, we are ready to give them the  consideration they deserve. For generations, the Senate has done the  work of the American people through consensus, through compromise, and  through cooperation. It has been a place where seemingly impossible  disagreements have found sensible solutions. Indeed, the legacy of the  Senate is the story of debate--ample debate--followed by compromise. It  is in large part thanks to the rules that govern how this Chamber  works. It is crucial that those rules not be twisted or abused for  partisan advantage.   The majority, by taking yet another step to erode that legacy, risks  turning this body into a colosseum of zero-sum infighting--a place  where the brute power of the majority rules, with little or no regard  for the concerns of the minority party, and where longstanding rules  have little or no meaning.   I am so sorry my Republican colleagues have gone along with Senator  McConnell's debasement of the Senate. To do this for such blatantly  political ends is simply unworthy of this institution.   I yield the floor.
