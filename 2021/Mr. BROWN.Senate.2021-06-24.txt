 Object.    Object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career  and service of a proud Ohioan, Dan Sewell, who will retire at the end  of June, bringing an end to his 44-year career in journalism.   Dan spent 39 of those years with the Associated Press, serving  Americans, both by bringing them the news and by telling their  stories--in Buffalo, Miami, San Juan, Atlanta, and Chicago, where he  has worked as a writer, editor, assistant bureau chief, and most  recently in our home State, in Cincinnati, OH.   A native of Middletown, OH, Dan graduated from Edgewood High School.  He got his start in journalism as a student journalist at Ohio  University's student newspaper, The Post. That is where Dan and I first  met, when he interviewed me as the youngest member of the Ohio State  Legislature.   Journalists like Dan play a vital role in our democracy--they ask  tough questions, they challenge special interests and uncover  corruption, and they connect Americans with their communities and with  the world. Whether it was the Grenada Invasion in 1983, Hurricane  Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, or the mass shooting in  Dayton's Oregon District in 2019, Dan has done vital work on the  frontlines, covering stories that matter to people.   Not only has he made a difference through his writing, Dan also  teaches as a part-time instructor of journalism at Miami University in  Oxford, OH, helping mentor the next generation of journalists.   Dan is a devoted husband to Vickii, father of five, and grandfather  of nine, and plans to spend time with them during retirement. And he  will have more time to partake in his favorite hobby--attending  Cincinnati Reds' games.   On behalf of grateful readers in Ohio and around the country, I thank  Dan Sewell for nearly four decades of service in journalism, doing work  that is important to the fabric of our communities and our country.

This is our only tool to support workers who lose their jobs because  of countries like China that cheat the rules. And in one week, it goes  away. This is an economic problem and a China problem.   All of us, of both parties, recognize the threat that countries like  China pose to our economy. It's why just two weeks ago, we came  together and passed the Endless Frontiers Act on a broad, bipartisan  basis: To secure and expand our domestic supply chains, to support R&D  to ensure the next generation of manufacturing is developed in America  and made in America, and to finally--finally--ensure that Americans'  tax dollars are used to buy American products that support American  jobs.   This should not be controversial.   We are working to undo decades of bad trade policy with China, and  decades of neglect for our domestic supply chains. That's going to take  years. We know corporations won't stop outsourcing jobs on July 1st. We  know China isn't going to stop cheating and undermining American  industries on July 1st. And we know our manufacturers will still have  to compete against governments that prop up their competitors on July  1st.   We owe it to workers, who we know are going to have their lives  upended through no fault of their own to unfair trade, to do everything  we can to ease the transition. Today, I'm not asking for a complete  renewal of the program. I'm not even asking for an extra year of the  program.   I, on behalf of my Democratic colleagues and American workers, asked  for unanimous consent from this body for a straight 3-month extension  of TAA, so that we can keep having the conversations about how best to  structure the program going forward. It appears that my friends on the  other side would prefer a 1-month extension. I would like more, but in  the spirit of compromise--this beats the alternative--letting TAA  expire and leaving workers in the lurch.   And while that dialogue continues, workers get the help they need.   We know workers are losing jobs to China all over the country. Sadly,  that happens every week, every day.   By extending this program, service workers and people whose jobs get  shipped overseas to countries without trade agreements will get help.   Training funds, will continue being provided, at a time when we need  to train people for the new jobs that we want industry to create. We  all want the US economy to be more resilient in the face of economic  shocks. We all want to see fewer communities devastated by unfair  trade. We all want American workers' hard work to pay off TAA is part  of that.   We came together to extend it in 2011. We came together to extend it  in 2015. We must do the same today.   If you love this country you fight for the people who make it work.  That's what we do with Trade Adjustment Assistance.
