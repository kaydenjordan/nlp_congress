 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Indiana for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we consider a rule for two bills that do not  address the most pressing issues in our country. Over the last 2 weeks  in New Mexico, I spent my time in my beautiful, large district in  classrooms, meeting with healthcare providers, learning from Tribal  leaders, and talking to students and their parents.   They shared their worries about poor access to healthcare, about  affordable housing, their worries about whether we were going to target  Social Security and Medicare in this House.  [[Page H1776]]    They talked to me about the epidemic of gun violence. Let's talk  about that epidemic. There have been at least 145 mass shootings so far  this year. More kids die from gun violence than from any other cause.  Americans want Congress to pass meaningful gun safety laws so our kids  can be safe and cared for in our schools.   What are we getting out of the Education and the Workforce Committee?   We are getting book banning and now sports banning. You know what?  Books and sports don't kill kids, guns do.   I have behind me here just some of the names of the many children who  have died in their classrooms and in their schools.   Parents are scared. Students are terrified of being killed at school,  a place where they should be safe and ready to learn. Kids should be  able to go to a 16th birthday party and come home again.   But the bills this rule makes in order won't fix the scourge of gun  violence in this country. While kids are dying from gun violence, the  answer from the House Republican majority is to bully trans girls with  H.R. 734 and undermine D.C.'s local laws. That is not okay.   Today, I stand in strong solidarity with some of the most vulnerable  students in our schools, trans girls. Trans kids deserve to be  understood. They deserve to be loved. They deserve an opportunity to  play on a team and make friends.   Today, the Republican majority has brought up yet another bill that  is meant to divide us and to get people angry and upset over things  that are not key to whether they can have what they want their kids to  accomplish in school.   H.R. 5, which the Republican majority passed in March, was about  banning books. H.R. 734, which we are debating this week, is about  bullying kids.   The problem is this: When you bully these kids it can lead to their  death. I am worried that this bill will lead to rising suicide rates  among the most vulnerable kids in our schools.   Studies have proven that when we welcome trans kids with compassion  and kindness they are less likely to attempt suicide.   Studies have shown that the problem isn't whether a kid is trans or  not, it is are they accepted? At a time when trans kids face alarming  rates of behavioral and mental health issues and 53 percent of trans  kids have considered suicide, my colleagues have chosen to use fear to  score political points.   Mr. Speaker, 1 in 25 American kindergartners won't live to adulthood.  Imagine that. Imagine going into a kindergarten class, like I did  several times in my district, looking out at that class and thinking,  which one of those precious children will not make it to adulthood?   That is the issue we should be addressing, both gun violence and  addressing behavioral and mental health, and providing the resources  that they need.   You know what? The rate of children not making it is twice as much  for Hispanics and over three times as much for Black students.   Do we go after that in this bill?   No, we don't.   Sports and books are what H.R. 734 goes after, not guns and violence.   There is already a mechanism in place to address the fairness in  playing sports that has been raised on the other side of the aisle.  There is already a way of addressing those distinctions in playing  sports. The NCAA and Olympics put these in place decades ago.   The Olympics already has a manual for what you should do, and it was  done in 2003.   Here in the United States we already have something done by the NCAA.  The NCAA adopted a student athlete participation policy that will cover  the concerns that some people may have.    Women in sports, I will tell you--they say they are doing this for  women.   Guess what? Women in sports who compete, they don't want this bill.  They understand it is not about sports but about making people angry.   We have the statements of women's rights and gender justice  organizations in support of full and equal access to participation in  athletics for transgender people, and it is signed by numerous women's  sports organizations. One after another they have lined up to say, no,  this bill is bad for women in sports.   You know what? I want to make sure here in Congress that we lead with  compassion. We are all human. We all have within our families, within  our communities, people who are lesbian, who are gay, who are trans,  who are many, many different aspects of who they are, who they actually  are and authentically are.   Why are you willing to sacrifice those beautiful kids of ours? Why? I  just don't understand it.   You know what? Trans kids deserve to live.   The rule also makes in order H.J. Res. 42, which disapproves of the  District of Columbia's Comprehensive Police and Justice Reform  Amendment Act. The D.C. Council, elected by D.C. residents, passed this  bill through democratic process.   D.C., just like those in Kentucky and other local jurisdictions--it  is the local jurisdictions which should have the right to enact laws  through their democratic process without congressional interference.   We should not be having congressional interference into local  matters, like protecting our citizens and like having a police force  that is responsible to those citizens.                                time  1245    Just because Congress can intervene in D.C. affairs, doesn't mean  that it should.   The D.C. reform bill includes many of the reforms that both  Republican and Democratic States and localities have passed, things  like banning choke holds, things like using body cameras. That is  available in red districts, in red States, in red cities, and in blue  cities. In New Mexico we have those things.   So let's stop interfering in D.C.'s affairs. Let's put forward  legislation in contrast that addresses the needs of all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would not protect kids. We must  remember that this legislation could require female student athletes to  be subjected to invasive genital examinations or forced to disclose  their menstruation data.    What parent would want their child to go through that?   This is a grotesque violation of privacy and the complete opposite of  protecting our children.   If Republicans really want to protect our girls, they should focus on  real issues. The sexual abuse of female athletes and students goes  unreported too often. The U.S. Center for SafeSport found that 93  percent of athletes experienced sexual harassment or unwanted contact  and they were too afraid to report it. We must address the real issues  that our children face.   With regards to the D.C. bill, Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, all opposition to this bill is not radical. Indeed, the  Republican Governor of Utah also opposed a similar bill, and in his  veto message he talked about the fact that even though he might not  understand what it means to be trans, even though he doesn't understand  the science which might be conflicting, he said: I choose to err on the  side of kindness and compassion.   He wanted to make sure that the children live, the few children in  his State who play sports, the few trans children in his State who play  sports, he said: Why are we heaping so much hatred on those children?   I want them to live.   The reason why that concern is so profound is because of the fact  that transgender kids have an extremely high risk of suicidal behavior.  In 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for kids ages  10-14 and 20-34. Nearly one in five trans kids attempted suicide that  year. I want our trans kids to live.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Rules.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, we can actually point to two  accomplishments that we did on this House floor when Democrats were in  charge. The Democratic leadership in Congress helped us lead to pass  the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. It was bipartisan, but we had  very few Republicans. That would have provided the kind of resources we  need in our schools to help our children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Sorensen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Vermont (Ms. Balint).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question,  which I hope we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to provide  for consideration of a resolution that affirms the House's unwavering  commitment to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare and  states that it is the position of the House to reject any cuts to the  program.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield  1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Hoyle).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas, Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee.    Mr. Speaker, I close with some powerful words  from a Republican, a Republican Governor who vetoed a similar bill in  his State.   He said, ``I must admit I am not an expert on transgenderism. I  struggle to understand so much of it, and the science is conflicting.  But when in doubt, I always try to err on the side of kindness, mercy,  and compassion.''   ``Here are the numbers that have most impacted my decision: 75,000,  4, 1, 86, and 56--75,000 high school kids participating in high school  sports in Utah; four transgender kids playing high school sports in  Utah; one transgender student playing girls' sports; 86 percent of  trans youth reporting suicidality; 56 percent of trans youth having  attempted suicide.   ``Four kids, and only one of them playing girls' sports. That is what  all of this is about. Four kids who aren't dominating or winning  trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find  some friends and feel like they are part of something. Four kids trying  to get through each day. Rarely has so much fear and anger been  directed at so few. I don't understand what they are going through or  why they feel the way they do, but I want them to live.''   I want our transgender children to live. I want them to have the  ability to do what they need to do in school, which is to learn, to  play, to compete, to learn about what it is like to be on a team.   I want them to live, which is why I oppose this rule, and I am asking  all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Please err on the side  of compassion, kindness. Let them live.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
