 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to serve on the Judiciary  Committee in the House and be the chairman of the Constitution, Civil  Rights and Civil Liberties Subcommittee.   I want to report to the American people that we passed out H.R. 1  that helps clean up corruption in our government, makes our government  more transparent, makes voting easier and open to more people, and does  other improvements the American people want.   We also passed out H.R. 8, the first gun reform bill in over 20 years  that says you have to have background checks on all sales.   This week, we will be marking up the Violence Against Women Act.  Hopefully, we will have bipartisan support for that.   We will also have a hearing on renewing the Voting Rights Act that  never should have been discarded by the Supreme Court. We will be  having hearings to get the Voting Rights Act back on the law books in  the United States.   And our subcommittee had a hearing last week on the President's  powers on emergency actions. We have bipartisan agreement that we need  to reform that bill and will work together in a bipartisan fashion.                            ____________________
