 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7164) to add Ireland to the E-3 nonimmigrant visa program,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7164         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. E-3 VISAS FOR IRISH NATIONALS.         (a) In General.--Section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)) is amended by inserting ``or, on a basis       of reciprocity as determined by the Secretary of State, a       national of Ireland,'' after ``Australia''.        (b) Employer Requirements.--Section 212 of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182) is amended--        (1) by redesignating the second subsection (t) (as added by       section 1(b)(2)(B) of Public Law 108-449 (118 Stat. 3470)) as       subsection (u); and        (2) by adding at the end of subsection (t)(1) (as added by       section 402(b)(2) of Public Law 108-77 (117 Stat. 941)) the       following:        ``(E) In the case of an attestation filed with respect to a       national of Ireland described in section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii),       the employer is, and will remain during the period of       authorized employment of such Irish national, a participant       in good standing in the E-Verify program described in section       403(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant       Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note).''.        (c) Application Allocation.--Paragraph (11) of section       214(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1184(g)(11)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(11)(A) The Secretary of State may approve initial       applications submitted for aliens described in section       101(a)(15)(E)(iii) only as follows:        ``(i) For applicants who are nationals of the Commonwealth       of Australia, not more than 10,500 for a fiscal year.        ``(ii) For applicants who are nationals of Ireland, not       more than a number equal to the difference between 10,500 and       the number of applications approved in the prior fiscal year       for aliens who are nationals of the Commonwealth of       Australia.        ``(B) The approval of an application described under       subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be deemed for numerical control       purposes to have occurred on September 30 of the prior fiscal       year.        ``(C) The numerical limitation under subparagraph (A) shall       only apply to principal aliens and not to the spouses or       children of such aliens.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 7164, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7164, a bill to add  Ireland to the E-3 nonimmigrant program. The bill was introduced by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the former chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, and is a simple bill that recognizes the  unique friendship and working relationship between the United States  and Ireland.   H.R. 7164 allows nationals of Ireland to be eligible to apply for  unused E-3 nonimmigrant visas, subject to Ireland providing reciprocal  access to U.S. nationals.   Holders of E-3 temporary work visas must be working in a specialty  occupation while in the United States. A specialty occupation is one  that is defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act as requiring:  One, ``theoretical and practical application of a body of highly  specialized knowledge;'' and, two, ``the attainment of a bachelor's or  higher degree in the specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a  minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.''   The E-3 applicant must have a job offer from an employer in the U.S.,  and that employer must get foreign labor certification from the U.S.  Department of Labor prior to filing a petition with U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services.   H.R. 7164 also requires that employers using Irish E-3 visa holders  in their workforce are and will remain participants in good standing in  the E-Verify program. This means that such employers must use E-Verify  to ensure that those they employ are eligible to work in the United  States.  [[Page H9677]]    E-3 nonimmigrant visas are currently only available to nationals of  Australia and are capped at 10,500 per year. Australian nationals have  not ever used all of the 10,500 authorized visas in a given year, nor  have they come close to doing so. In fact, the highest number used was  during fiscal year 2017 when 5,657 were issued.   H.R. 7164 provides that nationals of Ireland can utilize those visas  not used by Australians in a given year. For operational purposes, the  visa can be issued the following year but will be counted against the  previous year's cap. The bill does not increase the number of visas  authorized, and allows Australia, for whose nationals the program was  originally created, to have first access to the numbers.   H.R. 7164 is a simple bill that reflects the continued friendship  between Ireland and the United States. I thank the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) for his work and his leadership on this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I recognize and thank the gentleman, Mr.  Neal, for his leadership, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Sensenbrenner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I just want to also thank all the folks who were  previously mentioned by my colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler).   This is, I think, a very good bill. It is great to see something  bipartisan around here get passed; and as we are wrapping up this year  and this Congress, it is good to see this good legislation being  passed. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
