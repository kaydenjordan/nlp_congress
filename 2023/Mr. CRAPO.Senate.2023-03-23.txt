 Mr. President, I congratulate the Idaho  Environmental Coalition that currently manages cleanup operations at  the Idaho National Laboratory, INL, Site and Department of Energy, DOE,  Office of Nuclear Energy contractor Battelle Energy Alliance for  completing the transfer of all spent nuclear fuel from wet to dry  storage more than 9 months ahead of the 1995 Idaho Settlement Agreement  milestone. This is the culmination of more than two decades of work by  DOE and many partners and contractors. It further reinforces DOE's  commitment to meeting its agreements with the State and following  through on its promises to the citizens of Idaho.   Importantly, the completion of the wet-to-dry project ahead of  schedule means risks are reduced, security is improved, and the  environment is better protected earlier, rather than later. Dry spent  nuclear fuel storage is considered safer than wet storage, as it  reduces proliferation concerns and potential risk to area natural  resources. Dry storage of spent nuclear fuel also better prepares it  for transport to long-term storage when a permanent repository becomes  available.   DOE has now met more than 90 percent of the Idaho Settlement  Agreement milestones and more than 97 percent of all regulatory  milestones with the State of Idaho. The completion of the wet-to-dry  project frees up cleanup resources to further advance the next stages  of the nuclear fuels mission. Thank you to all those involved in this  momentous achievement, especially the exceptional and highly skilled  employees involved in this project, for advancing and accelerating the  cleanup at the INL and protecting Idaho's citizens.                            ____________________
