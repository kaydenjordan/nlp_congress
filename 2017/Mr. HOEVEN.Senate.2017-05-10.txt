 Mr. President, I have a request for the Indians Affairs  Committee to meet today at 2:30 p.m.   First, we have a markup in the Indian Affairs Committee. The two  bills we are marking up are Democrat-sponsored bills. The first one is  Senator Tester's bill, from the State of Montana, which would provide  support for Native languages. I guess the summary is that it would  support the education of Indian children. I believe it relates to  Native languages in that educational capacity. So that is one of the  bills, Senator Tester's bill.   The other bill we are marking up is Senator Tim Kaine's bill, also a  Democrat-sponsored bill. The short narrative I have is this: To extend  Federal recognition to the Chickahominy Indian Tribe, the Chicahominy  Indian Tribe-Eastern Division, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the  Rappahonnock Tribe, the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Indian  Tribe.   The reason that is significant, that is something that both Senator  Kaine and Senator Warner--both Senators from Virginia--have been  working on for some time. The reason it is timely is that they have  Pocahontas's birthday celebration coming up, which I think is going to  be a large celebration in the Commonwealth of Virginia. They were  hoping to have these Tribes recognized before this birthday celebration  for Pocahontas. It is a timely issue.   Obviously, we can't advance the bill to the Senate floor unless we  mark it up. At the request of those two Democratic Senators from the  Commonwealth of Virginia, we are scheduled to mark up those bills and  get them to the floor and try to do it in a timely way because of the  celebration they are trying to get prepared for. Everybody knows the  story of Pocahontas and why that would be a big celebration and  certainly a big deal in the Commonwealth of Virginia.   Again, as we debate this on the Senate floor, I think Senator Daines  made some strong points, and I would certainly appeal to our colleagues  across the aisle to consider what I just described as far as those  markups.   In addition to those markups, we also have a hearing on several  bills. The first one is a McCain bill, and it is to amend the PROTECT  Act to make Indian Tribes eligible for AMBER Alert grants.   Everybody knows what the AMBER Alert Program is and how important  that program is to protect our young people when they get abducted. The  reason Senator McCain, from Arizona, is bringing this bill forward is  because there was an abduction in Arizona, and the AMBER Alert went out  late. I  [[Page S2865]]  think the AMBER Alert went out a day late.   Senator McCain has this PROTECT Act so we can make sure the AMBER  Alert is working in Indian Country, and you certainly can understand  how important it is that we do that. We have to have a hearing on the  bill again so we can advance the bill to the Senate floor for  consideration.   The final bill that we would have a hearing on in committee, if we  are allowed to meet, is a Murkowski bill, Senator Murkowski from  Alaska. It would provide the conveyance of certain property in this  State.   You have to realize that the witnesses--and I think certainly the  good Senator from Hawaii will appreciate this--had to come here from  Alaska, which is quite a lengthy trip. When the Senator travels back  home to Hawaii, that is a long trip. It is certainly a beautiful place  but a long trip to get there. Of course, it is not inexpensive to  travel from Alaska to Washington, DC.   Those witnesses will be out their costs to come here if we are not  able to have the hearing, and we would have to reschedule it. That  certainly creates a cost burden for them, which is certainly unfair and  not what they would want to have had happen on the part of their  government.   I am putting that in human terms. Again, we are talking about two  Democratic bills, and we are talking about two Republican bills. We are  talking about constituents who have traveled a long way to come here to  have the hearing and the markup.   Again, these are issues we should be able to work on in a bipartisan  way. I would certainly ask for that consideration. At this point, I ask  for unanimous consent that our committee be allowed to meet.
