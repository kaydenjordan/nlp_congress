 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to highlight the rising  severity of illegal marijuana grows on Federal lands.   In 2016, the DEA Cannabis Eradication Program found a 60 percent  increase in the amount of assets seized from marijuana raids compared  to just the previous year.   The same year, the Forest Service eradicated nearly $1.5 million  worth of marijuana plants from over 240 sites on National Forest System  in the Pacific area alone.   Local sheriffs from my district have expressed to me their great  concern for public safety, environmental destruction, a lot of time  which farmers end up getting blamed for for water quality and the  chemicals and stuff that get left behind, not the farmers' fault, but  indeed these illegal grows, and even human trafficking gets caught up  in all this.   What is currently being done to address the amount of marijuana grows  on our public lands? Not nearly enough. People feel endangered by going  out into their public lands, whether it is adjacent private property  owners or what have you.   Timber harvest needs to be done, forest thinning needs to be done,  taking care of the environmental needs for our wildlife, all that, and  it can't happen due to these illegal grows and the danger they bring.  They should be able to enjoy them, and we should be able to stop this  illegal practice. We need many more assets poured into our Western  forest lands to eradicate this illegal grow.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am very pleased to speak on  this bill here tonight. I am so proud of the effort to work in a  bipartisan nature with my colleague and friend, the ranking member,  Mrs. Torres, as well as all the members of the committee. We have had  such overwhelming support to move this bill along.   Mr. Speaker, indeed, this is a culmination of a lot of strong,  bipartisan effort here in the committee as well as the community  itself, which sought consensus during the several years that I have  been involved with this legislation and now as chairman of the  Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs. We have  seen the local consensus that has been built with the local government,  the Tribe, and my colleagues on the committee.   With the inclusion of language referencing the local agreement, the  bill is supported by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians; the County  of Santa Barbara; and the region's representative, my colleague,  Representative Salud Carbajal, and was reported out of the House  Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent on September 17, 2017.   Located in Santa Barbara County for thousands of years, as was  pointed out by my colleagues, the recorded history of the Chumash  reaches back to the earliest arrival of Europeans in California, when  Spanish explorer Cabrillo recorded his encounters with the Chumash in  1542. They had a long and unbroken connection to the Camp 4 parcel,  which is located very close to their current reservation.   In the early 1800s, the Chumash became wards of the Spanish mission  in Santa Ynez, which included Camp 4, and later, the Mexican Governor  granted lands to Chumash members, which also included Camp 4. The  commission created by the Mission Relief Act of 1891 recognized that  the Tribe continued to reside in the Santa Ynez and Camp 4 area, though  only 99 acres were ultimately taken into trust for the Chumash at the  time, which is a fairly common problem for many Tribes.   With the various things that have happened to them, such as  derecognition and decertification over the years, tribes end up on very  small, narrow parcels of land that make it very difficult for them to  grow and prosper. So today, partly because of that, the Chumash face a  significant housing crisis, as was pointed out, and fewer than 17  percent of their members and descendants are able to reside on  [[Page H9445]]  the Tribe's existing reservation, which consists largely of hillsides,  wetlands, and streambeds unsuitable for housing.   To address the housing shortage, the Chumash used their own resources  to purchase the Camp 4 parcel, with the intent of constructing homes  for their members. They applied to take Camp 4 into trust  administratively, and after conducting a thorough public process, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a decision in December of 2014.    The Department of the Interior then completed the fee- to-trust process in January of 2017. Indeed, this is ongoing.   On October 31, the county ratified an agreement with the Chumash,  ensuring that any impacts of Camp 4 housing on local infrastructure and  other resources would be addressed, and the Department of the Interior  approved this agreement on the same day.   In order to enable the Chumash to address their housing crisis and  ensure any impacts to local governments are addressed, H.R. 1491 takes  the following actions:   It affirms and ratifies the action of the Department of the Interior  to take the Camp 4 parcel into trust on January 19, 2017.   It codifies references to the Chumash-county agreement ratified by  Santa Barbara County on October 31, 2017, addressing impacts to local  infrastructure and services.   By request of the Chumash, it prohibits the operation of gaming  facilities on the Camp 4 parcel.   It protects and respects rights-of-way also held by local  stakeholders.   Mr. Speaker, this bill represents, again, the culmination of years of  effort on the part of the Chumash, the county, the committee, and  Congress to ensure that the concerns of all stakeholders were addressed  fairly through a local process and reaching a consensus with the Tribe  and the county that we sought from the beginning. Indeed, as chairman  of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs, I  believe this agreement is the outcome of good faith negotiations by all  parties and should be considered a model for maintaining positive  working relationships between tribal and local governments.   I urge all Members to support this bipartisan, noncontroversial  measure.
