 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise this afternoon in  celebration of the 100th birthday of a member of my district. Josephine  Bizzarro, a resident of the High Desert, turns 100. She is preceded in  death by her husband, Mr. Domenick Bizzarro. They are both members of  the Greatest Generation.   The Nazis held Domenick Bizzarro as a prisoner of war in Germany,  during World War II where he earned a Bronze Star and three Purple  Hearts.   His wife, Josephine, was the consummate military spouse whose  unwavering commitment to her husband is what saw him through those dark  days in World War II.   Mr. Speaker, everyone that knows her celebrates her life as the  epitome of what a life well lived should be, and Heather and I join  them in wishing Josephine Bizzarro a very happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
