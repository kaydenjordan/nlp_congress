 HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman  and ranking member, and Representatives Jeffries and Burchett, for  bringing this important legislation forward. I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 5065, the Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly  Incarcerated Act.    Incarceration rates in the U.S. are disturbingly high, and my home  State of Oklahoma has the highest rates of any in our country.  According to a study done by the Prison Policy Initiative, more than 1  in 100 Oklahoma adults were in jail at any given time in 2018. The  numbers are even more disturbing for African Americans in Oklahoma,  with nearly 4 in 100 incarcerated in 2010.   High incarceration rates have both economic and human costs. They are  [[Page H37]]  costly to taxpayers and crippling to communities, which lose so many  individuals to incarceration.   While Congress has spent time focusing on how people end up in  prison, we have not committed enough time focusing on how to prevent  formerly incarcerated individuals from returning.   While Oklahoma and other States have also made positive steps in  criminal justice reform to reduce the unnecessarily harsh prison  sentences, releasing individuals is only one step in decreasing  incarceration rates.   According to the Justice Center's National Reentry Resource Center,  employment after an individual is released from prison is the single  most important predictor of recidivism. Sadly, 75 percent of  incarcerated individuals are still unemployed after a year of being  released from prison, causing them too often to resort to criminal  activity, leading back to prison.   H.R. 5065 addresses the critical issue of employment and helps break  this devastating cycle by creating a program where SCORE association  volunteer business counselors can mentor formerly incarcerated  individuals.   The counselors provide formerly incarcerated individuals with  entrepreneurial development training and workshops to help them utilize  their skills and gain new experience to go into workplaces or run  businesses of their own.                                time  1515    Helping individuals find a job and career opportunities after leaving  prison is a critical step in addressing our Nation's high incarceration  rate and ensuring those who have gone to prison don't return.   I am proud to cosponsor this legislation and encourage my colleagues  to vote for H.R. 5065.
