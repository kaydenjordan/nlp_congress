 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 887 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this amendment ensures that we don't  implement a carbon tax, and I am joined on it by Senator Lankford and  Senator Cramer.   Simply put, a carbon tax is a national energy tax, and it is a  regressive tax. Raising the cost of energy through a tax or fee hits  hard-working families the most, making it more expensive to heat their  homes, drive to work, and put food on the table.   In addition to keeping the lights on, every sector of our economy  depends on access to affordable and reliable supplies of energy. A  carbon tax increases the cost on our manufacturers, exporting American  jobs abroad to other countries with fewer environmental regulations,  meaning global emissions would actually increase. Instead of pushing  new taxes, we must, instead, focus on innovation and making emerging  technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage, or CCUS,  commercially viable.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment.    Mr. President, stand up for working families and vote  yes.   I ask for the yeas and nays.                          Vote on Amendment No. 887
