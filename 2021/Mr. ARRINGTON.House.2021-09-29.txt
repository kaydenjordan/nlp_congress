 Madam Speaker, it is not our duty to raise the debt  limit; it is our duty to not spend so recklessly and so egregiously and  irresponsibly that we bankrupt this country, and we rob our children of  their freedoms and the opportunities that we have all been blessed with  as Americans. That is our duty.   I won't give Republicans a pass on this, Madam Speaker. This place is  broken. We play by a different set of rules--if we are honest--than the  American people. The pay-fors just for the infrastructure bill are  total jokes. It is a gimmick. It is Enron accounting scams. People in  our country who operate that way would be thrown in prison. So we are  all accountable.   But I have never seen this kind of spending spree to accelerate the  curse that we are putting on the heads of our children. James Madison  said: `` . . . a public debt is a public curse, and in a Republican  Government a greater curse than any other.''   Trillions of dollars have been spent. We were promised bipartisanship  and restoration of unity in this place. We are jamming more bipartisan  spending bills starting with COVID, which was a bailout of union  pensions and which was a bailout of blue States and Democrat-run  cities. Very little went to COVID. That is deception.   We are accelerating what Admiral Mullin said was the greatest threat  to the United States. He said that the greatest threat to our national  security was our national debt. So we promised the cradle-to-grave  cash, entitlements, and more handouts without any regard to  responsibility and without any requirement for work, and we are going  to bankrupt the next generation. We are going to steal from them what  we have enjoyed.   This is not a profile in courage.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reconsider all of this  spending that is bankrupting the country, and I urge them to vote  ``no'' on the reconciliation bill.
