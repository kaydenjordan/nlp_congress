 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia  for yielding, and I thank Mr. Knight and Mr. Mitchell for their  leadership on this. I also want to thank Ranking Member Elijah Cummings  for all that he has done to try to get the answers about executive  branch background checks.   For over 6 months, various Oversight and Government Reform Committee  members have been working to get basic answers from the White House  about its process for granting security clearances. In a February 2017  hearing, my colleague, Congresswoman Plaskett, asked the Director of  the National Background Investigations Bureau if any senior  administration officials with access to sensitive material were under  criminal investigation. Chairman Chaffetz specifically asked the Office  of Personnel Management to get back to Representative Plaskett about  her request. Unfortunately, neither OPM nor NBIB have answered these  basic questions. That is why I am pleased that the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee unanimously adopted my amendment during  consideration of H.R. 3210 last week.   My amendment is very simple. It requires the NBIB to report to  Congress on the process for conducting and adjudicating security  clearances at the White House.   This bill is a necessary first step for Congress to conduct the  oversight necessary to ensure that all personnel in the U.S.  Government, regardless of administration, regardless of office,  regardless of the President who happens to be in office at the time,  will be thoroughly vetted and will not pose a threat to our national  security.   I encourage all Members to support this bipartisan bill.
