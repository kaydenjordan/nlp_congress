 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize  American Farm Company of Hospers, IA, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   Founded by 29-year-old Rachel Granstra in 2021, American Farm Company  is a clothing line specially designed to represent farmers, ranchers,  farm wives, and farm families. As part of a multigenerational farm  family, Rachel takes pride in her agricultural roots and strives to use  her direct-to-consumer online apparel business to promote farming and  agriculture in a way that reaches the next generation. American Farm  Company first grew out of a blog that Rachel started in 2018 called  ``Little House on the Feedlot.'' She would share recipes and anecdotes  about her life on a family farm as she and her husband Brennan raise  cattle and grow corn and soybeans. After developing a large following,  Rachel began to sell original farmer-themed t-shirt designs. Her  business soon took off as many people sought out her creative and  authentic designs.   In 2021, Rachel rebranded her business as American Farm Company and  expanded into a large warehouse in Hospers. American Farm Company sells  a variety of products such as crewneck sweaters, t-shirts, headwear,  backpacks, and flags. She even sells a flagship light beer in  collaboration with West O'Beer in Milford, which she brands as  ``Farmer's Water.'' Rachel now employs 20 women who help her fulfill  orders for her growing online retail business. Rachel is proud to use  her business to advocate for the American farming industry, and she  recently launched a new product, the Co-Op Box, which directly connects  consumers with high-quality products from small American farms.   The American Farm Company's commitment to providing quality apparel  products in Hospers, IA, is clear. I want to congratulate Rachel  Granstra and the entire team at American Farm Company for their  continued dedication to our ag communities. I look forward to seeing  their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit.

Another one of Blue-9 Pet Products' best-selling products is the  Balance Harness, which is an adjustable harness that is flexible for  dogs that ease their use for both canines and their owners.

This week it is my privilege to recognize  Delzell Brothers of Wapello, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Founded in 1931 by Lawrence ``Tut'' Delzell, Delzell Brothers is a  family-owned car dealership and auto service-repair shop in operation  for more than 90 years, spanning four generations. Tut ran the business  until 1965 when his sons Craig and Phil took over the family business.  In 1970, Craig went on to establish Delzell Motor in Burlington, while  his brother Phil continued to run Delzell Brothers. By the 1980s,  Phil's sons Kent and Kirk took over the operations, with Kent serving  as president and Kirk as vice president. On Christmas Eve 2004, the  Morning Sun location was destroyed by a fire, forcing the company to  use a rental house to continue operating. Through resiliency and hard  work, the family was able to move the shop into a new building in 2005.  The business now employs the fourth generation of the Delzell family,  with Jessica Stickling and Joe Delzell working at the dealership.  Delzell Brothers is a licensed dealer for Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and  Ram vehicles, and they offer both new and used cars. Delzell Brothers  sell parts and operate a car service center for customers from the  broader Southeastern Iowa region.   Delzell Brothers prides itself on its commitment to Iowa's farm  economy, which has been integral to its success as a car dealership in  a rural community. By focusing on developing personal relationships and  maintaining a laid-back environment with customers, Delzell Brothers  has been able to establish its success in Wapello and employ more than  20 Iowans. In 2009, the local Morning Sun newspaper recognized Kirk  Delzell as the Citizen of the Year. The Delzell Brothers team is active  in the Louisa County community, a proud supporter of local Little  League teams, and a sponsor for the Morning Sun Fourth of July  celebration. Delzell Brothers is also a member of the National  Automobile Dealers Association and the Iowa Automobile Dealers  Association.   Delzell Brothers' commitment to providing customers with quality cars  and auto repair services in Wapello is clear. I want to congratulate  the Delzell family and the entire team at Delzell Brothers for their  continued dedication to the community. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Hands On Excavating of Radcliffe, IA, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   Hands On Excavating was founded by brothers Brett, Brian, and Jacob  Handsaker in 2010. Farming is in the blood of the Handsaker family. The  brothers are fourth-generation Iowa farmers who grew up on their family  farm. Following Jacob and Brian's graduation from Iowa State  University, they saw a need for agriculture excavation services and  tile repair with their brother Brett. Family friend Bob Lepper advised  the brothers on the excavating business, and shortly after, Hands On  Excavating was born.   Over the past 13 years, Hands On Excavating has evolved to include  other services to help farmers. They have worked with local farms to  improve their drainage systems to ensure that Iowa's farmland remains  the best in the United States. They have expanded their efforts to  include conservation work by helping to build bioreactors to help  filter nitrates out of waterways using natural methods.   The Handsaker brothers are also actively involved in the Radcliffe  community and have been recognized for their contributions to the Iowa  agricultural industry. Jacob is a member of the Radcliffe Fire  Department as a volunteer and is involved with the EMS and serves as an  EMT. Jacob was recognized by the Iowa State University College of  Agriculture and Life Sciences as the 2020 Emerging Iowa Leader. The  award was presented by Senior Associate Dean Joe Colletti at center  court of an Iowa State Cyclone women's basketball game. In 2022, Hands  On Excavating was awarded the Leader in Conservation Award by Iowa  Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. Recently, Jacob was featured in  Drainage Contractor magazine's GroundBreakers class of 2023.   Hands On Excavating's commitment to providing quality excavation and  demolition services in Radcliffe is clear. I want to congratulate the  Handsaker family and the entire team at Hands On Excavating for their  continued dedication to the Radcliffe community. I look forward to  seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize PIVO  Brewery and Blepta Studios of Calmar, IA, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   PIVO Brewery and Blepta Studios was founded by husband and wife Craig  and Sara Neuzil in 2017. The couple grew up as childhood friends near  Spillville and married following their graduation from Iowa State  University. Craig's first career was in the U.S. Air Force as a  communications officer, which allowed them to live across the United  States and Europe. During his time serving our country, he began  brewing beer at home as a hobby. With Sara being interested in art,  they began outlining a business plan that would create an incredible  community space that combines a brewery and an art studio. Following  Craig's retirement after 21 years in the Air Force, they turned their  hobbies into a small business in northeastern Iowa.   To honor Craig's family heritage, they chose the Czech word for beer,  ``pivo,'' as the name of the brewery. The logo of the brewery is a star  in a pentagon, which represents Craig's time in the Armed Services.  PIVO Brewery and Blepta Studios currently operate in a building that  has used repurposed items from the community in the design and  decoration of the space. Over the past 6 years, the brewery has made  over 70 beverages that circulate in their taproom, with the beers and  ciders sharing the namesakes of Iowa towns. They also offer  nonalcoholic drinks, wine, and a dining menu for customers.   The other side of their business is Blepta Studios. Sara, also having  Czech roots, used the name ``blepta,'' which is slang for  ``chatterbox,'' a fond nickname bestowed on her by her grandmother.  Blepta Studios has hand-crafted paint-pour jewelry, decorative eggs,  ceramics, and pottery for sale while  [[Page S3893]]  also offering art classes and private group classes. PIVO Brewery and  Blepta Studios also host events in their wedding reception hall and  event center.   The Neuzils are also actively involved in the Calmar community and  have been recognized for their contributions to the craft brewery  industry. In October 2022, PIVO Brewery was one of the hosts of the  Iowa Brewery Series ``5k Beer Run.'' The race started and ended in the  brewery's taproom, and portions of the race's proceeds went to local  nonprofits. Their beer has also been recognized by the Great American  Beer Festival. In 2020, their Decorah Nordic Gruit won a gold medal in  the historic beer category, and their Old Balltown Bulleit Bourbon  Barrel Aged Salted Carmel Dark Chocolate Milk Stout earned silver in  the chocolate beer category. In 2019, after 2 years of being open, they  took home the gold medal for the chocolate beer category with their Old  Balltown Dark Chocolate Milk Stout at the 2019 Great American Beer  Festival. Additionally, they were awarded the Excellence in Concrete  Award by the Iowa Ready Mixed Concrete Association and the Iowa Chapter  of the American Concrete Institute for their building's design.   PIVO Brewery and Blepta Studios' commitment to providing quality  beers, ciders, and arts in Calmar is clear. I want to congratulate the  Neuzil family and the entire team at PIVO Brewery and Blepta Studios  for their continued dedication to the Calmar community. I look forward  to seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
