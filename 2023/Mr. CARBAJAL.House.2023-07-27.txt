 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce, yet again, the  radical rightwing war on women, which is attacking fundamental rights  and putting our military readiness at risk.   Before I came to Congress, I served our Nation in the United States  Marine Corps. As a marine, I am appalled to see that for the first time  in over 150 years marines are without a Senate-confirmed leader because  of this misguided war on reproductive freedom, one of more than 200  confirmations being held up in the United States Senate.   I thoroughly condemn using these promotions as hostages and every  single Member of Congress who is choosing to put their radical agenda  over our national security, the same agenda that warped this year's  NDAA with countless culture war amendments.   Our servicemembers give their lives to protect our country. We owe it  to them to protect their basic rights to privacy and healthcare.   For the sake of our servicemembers and for women across America, I  urge my colleagues to drop reckless precedent-setting blockade.                            ____________________
