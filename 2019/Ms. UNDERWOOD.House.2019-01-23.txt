 Mr. Speaker, this week, we will vote for the tenth  time to end the shutdown. I sincerely hope that this is the last time.   For the people in the 14th Congressional District of Illinois, the  effects of this shutdown are real and they are painful.   This weekend, I visited a family shelter for survivors of domestic  violence that does incredible work serving my community. This shelter  would like to expand to serve more people, but funding uncertainty  around reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act makes that  impossible for them. Domestic violence survivors are a casualty of this  senseless shutdown.   This weekend, I met an entrepreneur who is working to open a pet care  company with her husband. He even left his job so they could realize  their dream. They are currently waiting on a Small Business  Administration loan they need to open their business. It is sitting on  a furloughed worker's desk. Entrepreneurs are a casualty of this  shutdown.   This week, I met with air traffic controllers in my district, people  who keep passengers and freight moving safely through the skies. They  are working 6 days a week and about to miss a second paycheck. They  told me they look after their colleagues by asking: How long do you  have left?   How long do they have left before they miss a mortgage payment, a  healthcare bill, or max out their credit cards?   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope the Senate will take up one of these  bills and reopen the government.                            ____________________
