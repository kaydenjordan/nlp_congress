 Mr. Speaker, I want to draw attention to provisions of  this bill which attack bedrock environmental laws and recklessly  promote logging over clean water, recreation, and wildlife.   In a district like mine, where the holdings of the U.S. Forest  Service are extensive, this bill is a critical part of helping to  protect our economy, our way of life, and the way we enjoy our public  lands.   Title 8 of the bill includes blatant attempts that undermine the  Endangered Species Act, NEPA, and the roadless area conservation rule.  This bill allows for congressional exemptions--basically, an earmark-- to prevent environmental reviews and public comment periods that  actually prevent communities from having a say over what happens quite  literally in their backyard. I think that we need to make sure that we  involve our local communities. This bill empowers Washington,  [[Page H3997]]  D.C., decisionmakers by taking that control away from our communities.   It weakens the Endangered Species Act by eliminating scientific  expert opinion about whether projects would harm endangered species and  their critical habitats, and it prioritizes logging over recreation,  even going so far as shifting incentives to emphasize logging over  environmental restoration in other areas that support the outdoor  recreation economy, one of the biggest sources of jobs in my district  and in my State.   Before the ink is even dry on the omnibus, this farm bill threatens  to renege on the bipartisan wildfire budget deal with more proposals  that weaken protections and mitigation on our public lands.   In my State, the 6,000-acre congressional exemption or earmark would  have a detrimental impact, but it would have an even worse impact on  the much smaller Eastern and Midwestern forests, where 6,000 acres  would vastly exceed the annual sustainable maximum harvest.   When the Forest Service needs to do a 6,000-acre project, it already  can. It needs to take input from the public nearby in our neighborhoods  and in our communities about how they would be affected. Of course, it  should consider how water, soil, and wildlife habitat can be protected.   For years, congressional debate over forest management has been  framed by the need to address hazardous fuels for wildfires. This bill  takes a step away from that and makes it clear that reform efforts  weren't actually about wildfire; they are about efforts to give away  our public lands to timber and other industries and silence the voice  of residents.   Congress should stop trying to legislate logging projects and take  control. Washington should allow our communities to have a say. The  Forest Service has many tools today that include local input. All  Americans deserve is a say in how our public lands are managed.  Endangered species should certainly not be sacrificed just so more of  our forests can be logged.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from over 120  conservation groups opposed to these harmful forestry provisions in  H.R. 2, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                                                      May 11, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters we urge you to strongly oppose the extreme and       divisively partisan federal forest provisions in the Forestry       Title of the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2),       also known as ``the House Farm Bill.''        The legislation is replete with provisions that undermine       bedrock environmental laws, including the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act       (ESA), and Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule).       This bill consistently prioritizes the logging industry over       all other forest stakeholders. It would cause irreparable       harm to our federal forests, the millions of Americans who       depend on them for clean drinking water, subsistence,       recreation, and economic benefit, and the wildlife that call       them home.        The federal forest provisions in the House Farm Bill also       run contrary to the wildfire funding agreement reached only       weeks ago in the Fiscal Year 2018 Omnibus. A deal was only       reached after significant environmental concessions to pro-      logging hardliners, even though a comprehensive wildfire       funding solution had solid bi-partisan support in both       chambers going into the omnibus negotiation.        Ignoring that compromise, H.R. 2 would allow logging,       grazing, and many other activities on up to 6,000-acres--      almost 10 square miles for each single project--without any       NEPA review or disclosure of potential harms. The numerous       new exemptions are double the size of the legislated NEPA       exclusion just passed in the omnibus deal and they also       eliminate the requirement, preserved in the omnibus       agreement, to consider cumulative effects and ``extraordinary       circumstances'' such as wilderness areas and endangered       species.        This partisan bill also goes further than the omnibus deal       on the ESA, allowing federal land management agencies to       ``self-consult'' on whether their actions would harm       threatened and endangered species even though such self-      consultation has already been declared unlawful by the       courts. Additionally, it attacks the landmark Roadless Rule,       makes resource management and forest stewardship dependent on       logging revenue, creating a perverse incentive, and       jeopardizes fire-vulnerable communities by deprioritizing       hazardous fuels reduction efforts in the Wildland Urban       Interface.        The harmful federal forest proposals in this legislation       solve no problem; they only add controversy to the House Farm       Bill and weaken its chances of becoming law.        For all of these reasons we strongly urge you to OPPOSE the       federal forest provisions in the House Farm Bill and any       amendments that further undermine environmental safeguards on       our federal forests.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the senior gentleman from Colorado  for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to discuss a couple of the terrible conservation  and environmental bills that affect the district I represent, our  State, and our country.   As the gentleman from Oregon mentioned, the elimination of the  Conservation Stewardship Program, a program that has been successful to  help preserve over 70 million acres, is, frankly, inexcusable. The  Conservation Stewardship Program supports farmers, ranchers, and owners  of forests who want to pursue high-level conservation stewardship  activities. It is important to protect our watershed that our towns and  communities rely on, to keep our air clean, to sequester carbon, to  maintain diverse habitats for wildlife, and, yes, to keep our farms  productive and sustainable in the long term.   Working lands conservation programs are so popular that the Natural  Resources Conservation Service wound up having to have a waiting list.  It had to turn away almost three-quarters of the qualified applicants.  Under the proposal today it would have to turn away 100 percent of  applicants.   Now, they claim that they are consolidating some programs into the  Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, but, frankly, those  programs are very different. Whereas, the Conservation Stewardship  Program helps farmers and ranchers implement advanced conservation and  stewardship systems to help preserve and protect the resources on their  lands.   EQIP is more of an introduction or on-ramp to working lands  conservation. It is on a one-time basis to help a specific conservation  practice. It is not a program that designed, nor does it provide,  assistance for long-term sustainability.   That is why the Conservation Stewardship Program is so important for  our forest health. Switching gears to our national forests, it seems  that some Members of this body are still seeking to erode protections  for our national forests.   One example in this bill, the Tongass National Forest, in Alaska,  which is one of the crown jewels of our National Forest System, faces a  huge threat with two amendments. One of those amendments in the bill,  which was already ruled in order last night without any debate, would  exempt all of the Federal forests in Alaska--more Federal forests than  any State in the country--to one of the most important conservation  safeguards: the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule.   The second amendment would overturn the Tongass forest plan, which  protects roadless areas and other ecologically important lands from  unsustainable logging, and charts a transition away from taxpayer  subsidized, industrial scale, old-growth logging, to better and new  forms of sustainable economic development.   Our country's old-growth forests are, frankly, a National treasure.  Clear-cutting ancient forests not only compromises our public lands;  but it devastates and fragments habitat for wildlife, it introduces  invasive species that compete with native species; and, yes, it  pollutes the drinking water supplies for as many as 60 million people.   The Roadless Rule is very important because it provides a balanced  protection between our old-growth forests and public roads, and  hydropower projects. Its application in Alaska has a very positive  impact on community access and economic development, and we need to  maintain the rule.   As representatives and stewards of our forests, under the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, it is absolutely critical to protect our  public lands. From the Clean Water Act to NEPA, which this bill would  devastate for projects that are 6,000 acres or less, to the Endangered  Species Act, which has had so many great successes, we need to protect  the tools we have to secure a safe environment and a diverse habitat  for our wildlife.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Colorado, and others,  for speaking out on the important environmental provisions in this  bill.
