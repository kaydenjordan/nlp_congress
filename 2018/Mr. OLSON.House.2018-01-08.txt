 Mr. Speaker, sometimes life matters by the inch. Last  month, for the Manvel Mavericks, their dream came down to 12 inches--1  foot. That is how close they came to winning every football game they  played in 2017, including the Texas 5-A Division 1 State Championship.   Was Manvel disappointed when they lost?   Heck yes.   Did we shed some tears?   Heck yes.   Are we more proud than ever of our guys?   Hell yes.   That pride comes from how they played, win or lose. An example of our  pride is next to me. That is our team listening to our senior  quarterback, Kason Martin's final words as a member of the Mavericks.  Kason's words rang true then, and they ring true for all eternity.   He said: I'm forever Manvel. I don't care what the scoreboard says.  We are the champions. Hoka Hey.                            ____________________
