 Madam President, I begin this morning by remembering  two heroes and the events that claimed their lives 20 years ago today,  right here in the Capitol.   On July 24, 1998, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut and  Detective John Gibson made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of  American democracy. By doing their duty, these heroes helped cut short  an act of brutal violence that could have claimed many more lives. That  same week, Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson lay in honor in the  Capitol Rotunda, and an entire Nation paid its respects.   I imagine 20 years have not made this senseless violence any easier  to bear for the families these men left behind or for their brothers  and sisters in the Capitol Police. Yet, as we remember their bravery, a  triumphant example endures of selfless service and fearless heroism--of  two men who embodied the values that keep this building and our Nation  standing safe and sound.   Today, we honor Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut. We renew our  condolences to their families. We recognize the depth of our gratitude  for them and for everyone who puts on the uniform and steps into harm's  way every single day.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on an entirely different matter,  yesterday, the Senate began considering our next set of appropriations  measures for fiscal year 2019.   Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy have led an exemplary  bipartisan process through subcommittee and full committee work.  Yesterday, that same bipartisan spirit was here on the floor when we  were able to proceed to these measures by consent. Let's keep up that  productive and cooperative spirit so we can achieve the goal we all  share--completing a regular appropriations process and avoiding another  omnibus.   The measures before us encompass agriculture, interior and the  environment, transportation and housing, and financial services and  general government. They would deliver real resources to help American  communities face real challenges--challenges like clearing the backlog  of infrastructure needs that are holding back rural America and  challenges like fighting the opioid epidemic that threatens families  and communities.   Among the many, many things this legislation would accomplish, it  meets these two challenges head on. It delivers nearly one-half billion  dollars in loans and grant funding for rural broadband. It supplies  $400 million to accelerate the delivery of water and waste  infrastructure projects across rural America. It would also deliver  more assistance to all of the areas of our country that are living  under the long shadow of the opioid crisis--tens of millions to help  the FDA crack down on the spread of illicit drugs and to improve care  in rural communities through distance learning and telemedicine.   These are just a few of the important provisions in these bills. I  look forward to considering them this week. I hope we will have a  robust amendment process, and then, with bipartisan cooperation, we can  take these next steps together.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a final matter, yesterday, the  White House hosted a ``Made in America'' showcase, featuring products  that were manufactured in each State, including from Stoneware & Co.,  in my home State, which makes the famous Louisville stoneware kitchen  and dining sets.  [[Page S5228]]    Well, talking about reviving American manufacturing is nothing new in  this town. In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Obama  insisted that ``our first priority is making America a magnet for new  jobs and manufacturing.''   Every few years, it seemed our Democratic friends over in the House  would hold yet another press conference to talk about getting  manufacturing moving. So rhetoric was not in short supply during the  Obama era. What was harder to come by were actual results. On President  Obama's watch, on net, our country lost more than 300,000 manufacturing  jobs.   Year after year, Democratic policies led to insufficient, sluggish,  and uneven economic growth that left much of the country behind. Eight  years of this so-called recovery couldn't even get us back to the same  number of manufacturing jobs that we had when President Obama first  took his oath of office.   There are a number of reasons why. Yet here is one thing we heard  loud and clear from U.S. manufacturers: High taxes, heavy regulations,  and other Democratic policies put the wind squarely in their faces.  Back in 2013, more than 75 percent of U.S. manufacturers said a hostile  climate due to taxes and regulations was a major business obstacle.   What about the present? What about now?   This united Republican government has put an end to one burdensome  regulation after another. We cut through the redtape that held back  small businesses, local lenders, and manufacturers. We overhauled the  Tax Code, leaving families with more to spend and invest and leaving  job creators with more flexibility to compete and win.   What were the results?   Less than 2 years into the new administration, an all-time high of  95.1 percent of U.S. manufacturers have a positive outlook. Now fewer  than one in five says a hostile business climate due to things like  taxes and regulations is a top obstacle, and more than two-thirds are  planning to hire this year. These aren't just numbers; this is real  life.   At Jamison Door in Hagerstown, MD, tax reform made possible a 400- percent increase in plant size.   In my home State of Kentucky, it is estimated that more than 1,000  construction jobs will be needed to help build a new aluminum rolling  mill for Braidy Industries. Over the next 7 years, tax reform is  expected to save the company--listen to this--$150 million, which will  help to support this investment and the 600 permanent new jobs the  company estimates it will create in the Commonwealth.   So let's sum it up. Republican policies have helped generate the very  outcomes Democrats claim they wanted. American manufacturing is  thriving on our watch, but now Democrats aren't cheering. In fact, they  have tried to block most of the policies that have helped this happen.   They voted against tax reform--every Democrat in the House and the  Senate. They have protested regulatory reform every step of the way.  They want to go right back to their old ways--repeal the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, raise taxes, and pile on more crushing regulations.   We are not going to let that happen because we agree that  manufacturing growth is vital for American prosperity, and unlike our  friends across the aisle, we have the ideas and the policies to help  make that goal into reality.                            ____________________
