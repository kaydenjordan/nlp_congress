 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of the second fiscal year  2018 continuing resolution this year, which will fund the Federal  Government through December 22 of this year.   This bill is a necessary measure to continue vital government  programs and services. It also prevents uncertainty and harm in a  shutdown.   This year, the committee worked at a historic pace to produce and  then pass all 12 bills to fund the government. Chairman Frelinghuysen  should be recognized for this feat of leadership. It is important that  we eventually send these bills to the President's desk.   As chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I want  to highlight that the funding provided in our bill supports continued  leadership by the U.S. and advances our national security and economic  interests. This funding is critical to addressing the many challenges  that we face around the world.   Mr. Speaker, while CRs are never our preferred course of action, the  bill before us today will give us more time to complete our work with  the Senate and put together a final bill that will support the American  people. Our current continuing resolution expires tomorrow, so we must  act today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the CR.
