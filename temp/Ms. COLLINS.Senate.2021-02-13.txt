 Mr. President, the hallmark of our American democracy is  the peaceful transfer of power after the voters choose their leaders.  In America, we accept election results even if our candidate does not  prevail. If a candidate believes that there is fraud, the courts can  hear and decide those issues. Otherwise, the authority to govern is  vested in the duly elected officials.   On January 6, this Congress gathered in the Capitol to count the  votes of the electoral college, pursuant to the process set forth in  the 12th Amendment to the Constitution. At the same time, a mob stormed  the Capitol, determined to stop Congress from carrying out our  constitutional duty.   That attack was not a spontaneous outbreak of violence. Rather, it  was the culmination of a steady stream of provocations by President  Trump that were aimed at overturning the results of the Presidential  election.   The President's unprecedented efforts to discredit the election  results did not begin on January 6. Rather, he planted the seeds of  doubt many weeks before votes were cast on November 3. He repeatedly  told his supporters that only a rigged election could cause him to  lose.   Thus began President Trump's crusade to undermine public confidence  in the Presidential election unless he won.   Early in the morning of November 4, as the ballots continued to be  counted, President Trump claimed victory and asserted that Democrats  were trying to steal the election.   On November 8, the day after several media outlets had declared Joe  Biden the apparent winner based on State-by-State results, President  Trump tweeted:         This was a stolen election.    With that, his postelection campaign to change the outcome began.   Over the ensuing days and months, the President distorted the results  of the election, continuing to claim that he had won, while court after  court threw out his lawsuits and States continued to certify their  results. President Trump's falsehoods convinced a large number of  Americans that he had won and that they were being cheated.   The President also embarked on an incredible effort to pressure State  election officials to change the results in their States. The most  egregious example occurred on January 2. In an extraordinary phone  call, President Trump could be heard alternating between lobbying,  cajoling, intimidating, and threatening the election officials in  Georgia. ``I just want to find 11,708 votes,'' he stated, seeking the  exact number of votes needed to change the outcome in that State.  Despite the President's pleas and threats, the Georgia officials  refused to yield to the Presidential pressure, as did State officials  in other States.   In December, President Trump's postelection campaign became focused  on January 6, the day that Congress was scheduled to count the  electoral college votes. Although this counting is a ceremonial and  administrative act, it is nevertheless the constitutionally mandated  final step in the electoral college and the electoral process, and it  must occur before a new President can be inaugurated.   On December 19, President Trump tweeted to his supporters:         Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!    In response, some of his campaign supporters changed the date for  protest rallies they originally had scheduled to occur after the  inauguration to happen instead on January 6.   Having failed to persuade the courts and State election officials,  President Trump next began to pressure Vice President Pence to use his  role under the 12th Amendment to overturn the election. The President  met with Vice President Pence on January 5 and then increased the  pressure by tweeting hours later:         If [the Vice President] comes through for us, we will win       the Presidency.    That is what his tweet said.   Vice President Pence, however, refused to yield. He issued a public  letter on January 6 making clear that his oath to support and defend  the Constitution would prevent him from unilaterally deciding which  electoral vote should be counted and which should not.   During his speech at the Ellipse on January 6, President Trump kept  up that drumbeat of pressure on Vice President Pence. In front of a  large, agitated crowd, he urged the Vice President to ``stand up for  the good of our Constitution.'' ``I hope Mike has the courage to do  what he has to do,'' President Trump concluded. Rather than  facilitating the peaceful transfer of power, President Trump was  telling Vice President Pence to ignore the Constitution and to refuse  to count the certified votes. He was also further agitating the crowd,  directing them to march to the Capitol.   In this situation, context was everything. Tossing a lit match into a  pile of dry leaves is very different from tossing it into a pool of  water. And on January 6, the atmosphere among the crowd outside the  White House was highly combustible, largely the result of an ill wind  blowing from Washington for the past 2 months.   President Trump had stoked discontent with a steady barrage of false  claims that the election had been stolen from him. The allegedly  responsible officials were denigrated, scorned, and ridiculed by the  President, with the predictable result that his supporters viewed any  official they perceived to be an obstacle to President Trump's  reelection as an enemy of their cause. That set the stage for the  storming of the Capitol for the first time in more than 200 years.   Nearly 30 minutes after the Capitol first came under attack, Members  of Congress, law enforcement, and everyone else here in the Capitol  waited in vein for the President to unequivocally condemn the violence  and tell his misguided supporters to leave the Capitol. Rather than  demand an end to the violence, President Trump expressed his  frustration once again that the Vice President had not stopped the vote  certification as he had urged   Shortly after the Vice President was whisked away from this very  Chamber to avoid the menacing mob chanting ``Hang Mike Pence,''  President Trump tweeted:         Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have       been done.    Instead of preventing a dangerous situation, President Trump created  one.   Rather than defend the constitutional transfer of power, he incited  an insurrection with the purpose of preventing that transfer of power  from occurring.   Whether by design or by virtue of a reckless disregard for the  consequences of his action, President Trump, subordinating the  interests of the country to his own selfish interest, bears significant  responsibility for the invasion of the Capitol.   This impeachment trial is not about any single word uttered by  President Trump on January 6, 2021; it is instead about President  Trump's failure to obey the oath he swore on January 20, 2017. His  actions to interfere with the peaceful transition of power, the  hallmark of our Constitution and our American democracy, were an abuse  of power and constitute grounds for conviction.   Two arguments have been made against conviction that deserve comment.  The first is that this was a snap impeachment, that the House failed to  hold hearings, conduct an investigation, and to interview witnesses,  and that is true. Without a doubt, the House should have been more  thorough. It should have compiled a more complete record. Nevertheless,  the record is clear that the President, President Trump, abused his  power, violated his oath to uphold the Constitution, and tried almost  every  [[Page S739]]  means in his power to prevent the peaceful transfer of authority to the  newly elected President.   Second is the contention that the First Amendment protects the  President's right to make any sort of outrageous and false claims, no  matter the consequences.   (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)   But the First Amendment was not designed and must never be construed  by any court to bar the impeachment and conviction of an official who  violates his oath of office by summoning and inciting a mob to threaten  other officials in the discharge of their constitutional obligations.   My vote in this trial stems from my own oath and duty to defend the  Constitution of the United States. The abuse of power and betrayal of  his oath by President Trump meet the constitutional standard of high  crimes and misdemeanors, and for those reasons, I voted to convict  Donald J. Trump.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
