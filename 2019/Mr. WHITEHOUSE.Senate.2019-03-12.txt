 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as  in morning business for probably about 15 minutes, and should Senator  Van Hollen from Maryland--who is scheduled to arrive--arrive, that I be  able to engage in colloquy with him.    Madam President, there is now no doubt that climate  change is happening, that it is caused by human activity, and that we  must act now to avoid the worse of it.   As science guy, Bill Nye, has said: ``Climate change is happening,  it's our fault, and we've got to get to work on this.''   For too long we have seen the fossil fuel industry and its army of  front groups use manufactured doubt, phony doubt, as their weapon of  choice to obstruct any solution. Well, science studies things, and it  even studies doubt. A scientific study published by Nature has found  that the evidence of human-caused climate change occurring has now  achieved what scientists call the five sigma level of certainty.   What does that mean? This scientific standard means there is 99.9999  percent confidence that Earth is warming due to human activity. Put  another way, there is a 1 in 3.5 million chance that human-caused  warming is not occurring.   To compare, you have a 1 in 15,000 chance that you will be struck by  lightning in your life. You have a 1 in 100,000 chance of being born a  conjoined twin, and you have a 1 in 3.5 million chance the fossil fuel  industry's phony doubt about climate change is true.   Yet, just one Republican has signed on to Senator Carper's resolution  stating the basics--that climate change is real and caused by human  activity, and Congress should take action now to address it.   In an editorial last week--this one here--even the middle-of-the-road  USA Today said climate change is ``a true crisis facing the United  States and the world,'' that ``fossil fuel polluters keep using the  atmosphere as a free waste dump,'' and, finally, that ``[t]he public is  growing impatient.''   Well, last week, here on the Senate floor, we actually had something  resembling a climate debate break out. It was a little weird. As a  debate, it coughed and banged and sputtered, and we didn't really  engage. Many of our Republican colleagues had a very hard time  mentioning the actual phrase ``climate change.'' They found it  impossible to talk at all about the costs of climate change--the  floods, the fires, the rising seas, the worst yet to come. No one could  mention the 1.5 degree centigrade limit that we need to meet.   They mostly wanted to have fun bashing an imaginary Koch brothers- invented version of the Green New Deal. However, some did say that they  accepted the science. In particular, I was happy to see the chairman of  the Environment and Public Works Committee clearly accept that climate  change is real, that it is caused by humans, and that we have a  responsibility to do something about it.   I appreciate that he pointed to the bipartisan work he and I have  done on carbon capture and removal. I enjoyed working with him on that  legislation, and I hope we can get its successor bill passed too. We  just had a very good bipartisan committee hearing on it, but put those  two bills together, and you are still nowhere near the scale of action  that science demands.   Our scientists report that we must aim for net zero carbon emissions  by the middle of this century to avoid the worst consequences of  climate change. Carbon capture will be a part of that, but there is  zero chance it alone will be sufficient, and any plan that falls short  of that mark amounts to its own diluted brand of climate denial.  Bashing the Green New Deal doesn't solve the problem.   This is a good moment for me to interrupt my remarks because I see  the majority leader on the floor. If I may, I will yield to him to  close out the Senate and then have myself and Senator Van Hollen  recognized at the conclusion of the majority leader's comments.    Madam President, when we yielded to accommodate the  majority leader, I was talking about the episode on the Senate floor  with the Republican Senators coming to bash the Green New Deal. I  wanted to go on to say that the USA Today editorial--the one saying  climate change is ``a true crisis facing the United States and the  world''--also said this about the Green New Deal critics:         Republicans in the White House and Congress are having a       grand old time mocking the Green New Deal. . . . But the       critics owe this and future generations more than scorn; they       have an obligation to put better ideas and solutions on the       table.    So far we have not seen much from my Republican colleagues by way of  better or, indeed, any solutions.   Madam President, I would like to take a moment to express my  gratitude and appreciation to Senators Murkowski and Manchin for the  joint piece that they wrote in the ``Washington Post'' recently.   I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record at  the conclusion of my remarks.   So we get that my colleagues don't like the Green New Deal.   Let's consider other proposals. We have lots of them on the  Democratic side. We have had cap and trade. We have had ``keep it in  the ground.'' We have had Green New Deals. We have had revenue-neutral  carbon fee proposals.   Senator Van Hollen, of Maryland, is here to discuss his ideas. We are  ready here.   Republicans said last week they wanted innovation to address climate  change--great, me too. But you can't count on the innovation fairy to  fly down and wave innovation fairy dust on the problem and make it go  away. One of the reasons that Senator Barrasso's and my bipartisan  carbon capture bill was necessary is because there was not enough  innovation. There was not enough innovation because, quoting the USA  Today article, ``fossil-fuel polluters keep using the atmosphere as a  free waste dump.''   It is really hard to spur innovation when there is no revenue in the  business model. So our bill put revenue in the business model. We did  it in the form of tax credits.   But the big driver for developing innovation and for developing  innovative, new technologies would be a price on carbon, just like  Senator Schatz and I have in our American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act--a  revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon fee. This bill passes all the  major Republican tests. It is a market solution that fixes a market  failure. It does not grow government or regulation, and it does not put  American industry at a disadvantage against foreign competitors. It  will drive innovation: Put a $50 per ton price on carbon emissions, and  every polluter paying the price has an incentive to spend up to $49 per  ton on solutions. That is how you get innovation.   This carbon pricing idea has support from a swath of senior  Republican officials, including seven Chairs of the Council of Economic  Advisers, six current and former Members of Congress, four EPA  Administrators, three Secretaries of State or Treasury, two Chairs of  the Federal Reserve, and one Congressional Budget Office Director--all  Republicans. Some of these Republicans were members of a group of  prominent economists, including 27 Nobel Prize winners, who recently  published this statement in the Wall Street Journal editorial page  supporting just the kind of carbon fee model that is the basis of  Senator Schatz's and my legislation. Since then, over 3,500 U.S.  economists have signed this statement, and that is because it is pretty  obvious how you have to solve this problem, once you want to.   Former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis has been very active in this  area. He said of our carbon fee proposal: ``Democrats . . . have  offered Republicans an olive limb, not just an olive branch.''   We are trying to reach out. We are trying to get to yes, and that  olive branch will remain extended as long as it takes.   If you think all of our bills are no good, come up with something  better, for Pete's sake. Give it a try. I am ready to work with  Republicans on passing a carbon fee or other climate change  legislation. I think I have proved that by working in a bipartisan  fashion. But when Republicans will not propose anything and will not  agree to anything--even an olive limb offered to them--then, that is a  pretty strong sign that there is something more going on than  objections to a Green New Deal. If you don't like the Green New Deal,  tell us what you do like. Go the carbon fee route. Go ``leave it in the  ground''--whatever. But please, let's get together and solve this  problem.   As USA Today said, ``the American people are getting impatient.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, March 8, 2019]    Lisa Murkowski and Joe Manchin: It's Time To Act on Climate Change--                               Responsibly                    (By Lisa Murkowski and Joe Manchin)         Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, represents Alaska in the U.S.       Senate, Joe Manchin, A Democrat, represents West Virginia in       the U.S. Senate.        The two of us have more in common than might meet the eye.       We come from different parties, but we are both avid       outdoorsmen and represent states that take great pride in the       resources we provide to the nation and to friends and allies       around the world. Alaska and West Virginia know that resource       development and environmental stewardship must move in       tandem, which is why we are committed to putting forward       bipartisan solutions to help address climate change.        There is no question that climate change is real or that       human activities are driving much of it. We are seeing the       impacts in our home states. Scientists tell us that the       Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world.       Rising temperatures and diminishing sea ice on Alaska's       shores are affecting our fisheries and forcing some remote       communities to seek partial or total relocation. In summer       2016, West Virginia experienced unprecedented flooding that       killed 23 residents and inflicted tremendous damage across       the state.        Congress is in the middle of a debate about the appropriate       way to tackle climate change. This is often portrayed as an       issue with just two sides--those who support drastic,       unattainable measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and       those who want to do nothing. We believe the time for       sensationalism is over. And we are seeking ideas that will       bring people together, rather than drive them apart.        On the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we       are working together to find pragmatic policies that can draw       strong and enduring support. In our hearings this year, we       have heard from a range of experts who are helping us to       gather facts that shape these efforts.        Just this week, we held a hearing focused on climate change       and the electricity sector. We heard that utilities are       pursuing cleaner energy technologies and integrating them       into their networks. These changes to the generation mix       reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 28 percent between 2005       and 2017 and lowered costs to consumers.        Yet, our witnesses also agreed that to effectively mitigate       the impacts of climate change, we must do more to pursue low-       and zero-carbon technologies that will continue to lower       emissions.        The United States leads the world in research and       development. Our national labs and universities are working       toward the next scientific breakthrough, and private       investors are pursuing the next game-changing technology. The       United States is at the forefront of clean-energy efforts,       including energy storage, advanced nuclear energy, and carbon       capture, utilization and sequestration. We are committed to       adopting reasonable policies that maintain that edge, build       on and accelerate current efforts, and ensure a robust       innovation ecosystem.        The impact of developing these new technologies will be       felt by Americans from all walks of life, including residents       of rural communities and other areas served by older       technologies. Transitioning these communities to more       efficient forms of energy will provide them with cleaner       energy that is also more stable and has lower costs, which       will bring about additional benefits.        American ingenuity has solved many of the great challenges       of our time and is key to addressing climate change. If the       United States is going to lead by example, we must continue       to lead the world in the development of new and improved       technologies. On the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,       we agree it is time to act. And that is why we will work to       find responsible solutions worthy of West Virginians,       Alaskans and all Americans.     Madam President, I am now honored to yield the floor  to my distinguished colleague from Maryland who has been working on  this issue in the House before he came to the Senate and has become a  real leader in our Senate caucus, Senator Van Hollen.    If I may, Madam President, I would like to remark on  the figure that Senator Van Hollen used of the recent measurement in  our atmosphere of a carbon dioxide concentration of 411 parts per  million. Standing on its own, that may not seem particularly  significant, so let's put that into context.   NASA, which Senator Van Hollen mentioned and which has important  facilities in Maryland, has been measuring this for a long time.   By the way, I think NASA's scientists have demonstrated they know  what they are talking about. They have rovers driving around on Mars  right now, so they know what they are talking about.   The scientists have gone back and determined what the carbon dioxide  levels were on Earth over a period of 400,000 years. If you look back,  there is a graph that NASA has that shows the carbon dioxide levels  ramping up and down, up and down, over 400,000 years. For that entire  time, the levels have stayed between 180 parts per million and 300  parts per million. That was the range within which the entire human  species experienced our development--180 parts per million at the low  and 300 parts per million at the high. At 411, we are now out of that  range by almost the entire range. We are not out by a little; we are  out of that range by a lot.   Also, 400,000 years is a very long time. If you look at how long  humankind has been farming--kind of the basic, organized activity of  our species--the common view is that we really started farming about  12,000 years ago. Some people push that number further, more towards  20,000 years. We invented the wheel a little over 5,000 years ago in  Mesopotamia. If you think about the first people who put seeds in the  ground and planted farms, you only go back 12,000 to 20,000 years. If  you think about the first people who rolled a wagon or a chariot on a  wheel, you only go back about 5,000 years. This record goes back  400,000 years. They know it because you can go into ancient ice, and  you can find bubbles of air from tens and hundreds of thousands of  years ago, and you can test them. I have been to the freezer at Ohio  State University, which is where they keep the cores they have drilled  out of glaciers, and I have seen how they go back and do these micro  measurements that let you know what the carbon dioxide levels were. So  we are not off by a little, folks; we are off by a lot.   When you consider the known scientific effect of carbon dioxide  concentrations, we have known what it has done. This has been a  greenhouse gas since Abraham Lincoln rode around in his top hat. This  is not scientific news; we know this stuff.   When you consider that we are that far out of the range that has made  human life and development comfortable on this planet throughout the  entire duration of our species--that we are out of that range for the  first time in 400,000 years and are out of that range by an amount that  is practically equal to the entire range itself--if that is not a  signal for us to wake up and pay attention, I don't know what is. The  fact that the fossil fuel industry can drown out that signal with its  political signal in this body is astounding.    Arsenic, too, is a naturally occurring substance, but  you don't want too much of it.    I thank Senator Van Hollen for joining me in this  colloquy and for speaking today on the floor.   I see the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee here.   I yield the floor.
