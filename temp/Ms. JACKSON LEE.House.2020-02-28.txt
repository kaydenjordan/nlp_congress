 Madam Speaker, I am not here to target people of  color. I am here to save lives.   I support this legislation because it closes an effective tax  loophole for e-cigarettes and taxes them just accordingly as tobacco.   It prohibits the manufacture of flavored tobacco and, more  importantly, actually prohibits companies from marketing or promoting  e-cigarettes to youth under the age of 21. That is an important  element.   It makes sure that the grants that are gotten from those dollars are  utilized for outreach and education, for evidence-based smoking- cessation programs. It awards grants to make tobacco-cessation  therapies and counseling available to community health centers.   We have to save lives. People of color die disproportionately through  tobacco products, including these flavored cigarettes.   The NAACP says flavored cigarettes, e-cigarettes, have driven the  youth epidemic and more than half of youth smokers. Organizations like  the National Black Nurses Association, African American Tobacco Control  Leadership Council, Black Women's Health Imperative, and National  Hispanic Medical Association all support this.   Madam Speaker, I am here to save lives. That is why I am supporting  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2339, the ``Protecting  American Lungs and Reversing Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.''   I support this important lifesaving and life-extending legislation  because it:   1. Closes a tax loophole for e-cigarettes by establishing tax parity  with current tobacco taxes, which is a highly effective way to reduce  youth smoking.   2. Prohibits the manufacture and sale of all flavored tobacco  products, including menthol cigarettes, within one year, and removes  all flavored e-cigarettes from the market within 30 days.   3. Prohibits companies from marketing or promoting e-cigarettes to  youth under age 21.   4. Directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prohibit non- face-to-face (online) sales of most tobacco products, including e- cigarettes, thereby blocking a key path for high schoolers to obtain  tobacco products, many of which are sold online with limited or no age  verification requirements.   5. Provides FDA with the authority to collect user fees from all  classes of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, and increases the  annual user fees collected for tobacco products by $100 million.   6. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to issue an annual report to  Congress on the domestic sales, advertising, and promotional activities  of cigarette, cigar, smokeless tobacco, and e-cigarette manufacturers.   7. Invests in grants for outreach and education for evidence-based  smoking cessation programs for individuals in medically underserved  communities, including racial and ethnic minorities.   8. Awards grants to make tobacco cessation therapies and counseling  available at Community Health Centers.   This critical legislation provides a comprehensive approach to  address the youth tobacco epidemic, which has surged in recent years  with the introduction of such new tobacco products as e-cigarettes.   I support H.R. 2339 because it will help prevent the loss of an  entirely new generation to a lifetime of nicotine addiction.   Madam Speaker, one of the most effective ways to reduce youth use of  a tobacco product is to increase taxes on that product.   This legislation closes the tax loophole for e-cigarettes by  establishing tax parity with current tobacco taxes--significantly  increasing the cost of e-cigarettes.   Currently, there is no federal excise tax on the nicotine contained  in e-cigarettes, which could result, for example, in up to a 75 percent  increase in the cost of some brands of e-cigarettes.   As the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids points out, ``The Surgeon  General has called raising prices on cigarettes `one of the most  effective tobacco control interventions.'   The tobacco industry has targeted kids through social media  advertisements, glossy marketing campaigns, and other kid-friendly  platforms.   Banning the marketing and promotion of e-cigarettes to young people  will have a salutary effect because about 95 percent of adult smokers  start before age 21 and young people who do not begin smoking by their  early 20s are unlikely to ever start.   The legislation also includes numerous other provisions to address  the youth tobacco epidemic, including prohibiting the manufacturer and  sale of all flavored tobacco products, prohibiting companies from  marketing or promoting e-cigarettes to youth under age 21, and  directing the FDA to prohibit non-face-to-face (online) sales of most  tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.   Madam Speaker, it is gratifying to know that this legislation is  supported by nearly 100 groups, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free  Kids, American Lung Association, American Heart Association, American  Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Academy of Pediatrics,  African American Tobacco  [[Page H1270]]   Control Leadership Council, Black Women's Health Imperative, National  Black Nurses Association, National Hispanic Medical Association,  Catholic Health Association of the United States, American Public  Health Association, National Education Association, Parents Against  Vaping e-cigarettes (PAVe), First Focus, Children's Defense Fund, and  American College of Physicians.   In support this legislation, the NAACP, the nation's oldest civil  rights organization, has stated that: ``Flavored e-cigarettes have  driven the youth epidemic, and more than half of youth smokers-- including seven out of ten African American youth smokers--smoke  menthol cigarettes, so it's time to take these products off the market  once and for all.''   Madam Speaker, over the last few years, the use of e-cigarettes has  skyrocketed among American middle school and high school students.   More than 5.3 million middle school and high school students used e- cigarettes in 2019, an alarming increase of more than 3 million in two  years.   The recent dramatic rise in the number of middle and high school  students using e-cigarettes has reversed the progress that had been  made in previous years in the use of tobacco by kids and teenagers.   The U.S. Surgeon General has labeled the skyrocketing growth in youth  use of e-cigarettes an ``epidemic.''   The Surgeon General has also concluded that youth use of nicotine in  any form, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe, causes addiction, and can  harm brain development, which impacts attention, memory, and learning.   The Surgeon General also found that using nicotine in adolescence  increases the risk of future addiction to other drugs.   E-cigarettes have very high levels of nicotine, placing young people  at significant risk for developing nicotine addiction.   Studies have shown that one brand of e-cigarette cartridge can  contain as much nicotine as a full pack of traditional cigarettes.   In 2009, Congress enacted a federal law prohibiting the manufacture  and sale of traditional cigarettes that had flavors (other than the  flavors of menthol or tobacco), since the tobacco industry had begun  targeting young people by offering flavored cigarettes, including candy  and fruit flavors.   However, that 2009 flavor prohibition has not applied to tobacco  products other than traditional cigarettes.   Now, the legislation being considered this week would broaden that  2009 prohibition--blocking the manufacture and sale of all flavored  tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes.   In recent years, tobacco companies have significantly stepped up the  introduction and marketing of flavored tobacco products, especially e- cigarettes, with more than 15,000 flavors now available on the market.   The widespread availability and appeal of kid-friendly flavors has  significantly contributed to the rapid rise in e-cigarette use by young  people--with the tobacco industry targeting and addicting kids with  enticing flavors such as gummy bear and cotton candy.   Flavors mask the harsh taste of tobacco and make it easier for kids  to start to use a tobacco product and to become addicted.   More than 9 out 10 young persons using e-cigarettes use flavored the  e-cigarettes, with 7 out of 10 current youth e-cigarette users saying  they used them ``because they come in flavors I like.''   The bill's prohibition on menthol cigarettes will also help protect  kids.   More than half of youth smokers--and seven in ten African American  youth smokers--smoke menthol cigarettes.   A 2013 FDA analysis concluded that menthol cigarettes soothe the  harshness of tobacco, increase youth initiation, increase nicotine  addiction, and make it harder for smokers to quit.   Madam Speaker, the National Medical Association, the voice of  America's African American physicians, supports this legislation,  stating:         As the collective voice of African American physicians, we       know that banning menthol cigarettes will save lives in our       community. Smoking-related illnesses are the number one cause       of death in the African American community and approximately       45,000 African Americans die each year from smoking-related       diseases. Further, more than 85 percent of African American       smokers use menthols cigarettes. . . . For years, the tobacco       industry has aggressively promoted menthol cigarettes and       other flavored tobacco products in African American       communities. Taking action to ban menthol cigarettes is long       overdue and the NMA requests that Congress move swiftly to       take up this bill and save lives.    Madam Speaker, I do not agree with opponents of the legislation who  assert that because 85% of African American smokers use menthol  products, that it would disproportionally harm communities of color.   H.R. 2339 is not intended to disproportionately impact people and  communities of color; instead it treats all tobacco products the same  by prohibiting flavoring in all tobacco products.   Further, the legislation prohibits the sale, but not the possession,  of the banned products and expressly prohibits law enforcement from  using abusive practices, such as stop and frisk, to enforce the ban.   In 2009, President Obama signed into law the Family Smoking  Prevention and Tobacco Control Act which prohibited all flavored  cigarettes, other than menthol, after the tobacco industry used these  products to target kids.   H.R. 2339 merely extends the same enforcement authorities enacted  under the Tobacco Control Act to prohibit all flavored tobacco products  and ensure that the tobacco industry is no longer manufacturing or  importing any flavored products.   Finally, instead of imposing criminal penalties, should the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration find a manufacturer or retailer in violation of  the law, the FDA most commonly utilizes warning letters, no-tobacco  sale orders, and civil monetary penalties.   Thus, it is simply untrue that H.R. 2339 increases criminal penalties  or ``criminalizes tobacco.''   Before concluding, it is noteworthy that H.R. 2339 makes critical  investments to medically underserved communities to enhance smoking  cessation, particularly among racial and ethnic minority populations.   In order to ensure there are necessary resources for current smokers  to quit and transition off flavored tobacco products, the bill provides  significant resources to Community Health Centers to provide for the  availability of counseling and tobacco cessation therapies, as well as  other grant programs to enhance the availability of smoking cessation,  in particular for menthol products, in medically underserved  communities.   In sum, H.R. 2339 will help ensure the tobacco industry can no longer  target minority communities to the detriment of public health.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.
