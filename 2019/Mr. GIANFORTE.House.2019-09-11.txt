 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the nearly  3,000 people who were killed on this day in 2001. At dawn, September  11, 2001, was a morning like every other, that is until everything  changed. Terrorists, who were intent on destroying our country and our  way of life attacked.   But through this tragedy we saw our country unite. We saw unmatched  courage and bravery from our first responders, servicemembers, and  everyday citizens. Now, 18 years later, we find ourselves with a new  generation that did not experience the horrors of that day. They only  know a post-9/11 world. That makes it all the more important that we  teach them what happened that day, honor the victims, and discuss the  impact those terrorist attacks have had on our world.   But today, we remember. Today, we pray. Today, we honor Americans of  every background who, in the aftermath of that fateful day, united  under our flag, bound together by a sense of unflappable courage, duty,  and patriotism.                            ____________________
