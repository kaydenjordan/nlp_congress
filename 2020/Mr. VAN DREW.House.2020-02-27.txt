 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize William Ardis on  his achievement of the rank of Eagle Scout. William is with Troop 4 in  Millville in South Jersey.   Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of  America. It is a prestigious honor bestowed upon only the most worthy  and most qualified individuals. Only 4 percent of all Boys Scouts ever  achieve this prestigious recognition. Eagle Scouts are much more likely  to dedicate their lives to service, becoming future leaders in the  military, in business, and in politics.   My office was proud to be at William's ceremony to celebrate this  achievement earlier this week. I could not be prouder of William's  accomplishments, and I look forward to big and bold things from him in  the future.   As Americans we all look for heroes. We look to celebrities--God help  us; we look to Washington--equally God help us--but I want to say: God  bless you and your family, William.                            ____________________
