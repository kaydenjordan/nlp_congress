 Madam Speaker, it is disappointing to see  Republicans in the Senate ready to make a deal that will do nothing  except slide us down the slippery slope toward gun registration and  confiscation.   The gun deal being contemplated in the Senate will do nothing to stop  criminals intent on doing harm. This is just another surrender by  uniparty RINOs. This will do nothing to satisfy the radical left that  wants, again, registration and confiscation.   Why not do something that would truly reduce violent crime in blue  cities where there are hundreds of shootings every weekend? Why not  support our police, prosecute criminals, end no-cash bail, harden our  schools, and do something that will actually make a difference in  reducing the deaths by violent crime in this country?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
