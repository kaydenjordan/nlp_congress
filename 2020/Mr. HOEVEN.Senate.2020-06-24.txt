 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor an influential and  beloved North Dakotan, Sister Thomas Welder.   I know the Presiding Officer knew her very well and just a little bit  ago spoke about her here on the Senate floor, and that is so  appropriate. She was such a wonderful person, and we both are so very  fortunate to have known her and to have had time with her, to have  learned much from her. She is truly somebody who I think epitomizes the  term ``servant leader.''   Sister Thomas Welder was somebody who for me was a friend and a  mentor in so many different ways, it is hard to recount, and also for  my wife Mikey. Sister Thomas Welder dedicated her life to the  University of Mary and the students, and my wife Mikey is on the board  of trustees at the University of Mary, so Mikey and Sister Thomas  worked together for many, many years and share an unbelievable bond as  well. I am not even sure how long Mikey and I have known Sister Thomas;  it has been many years. We have seen her in so many different  capacities and so many different ways, but without fail, she was an  inspiration--an inspiration for both of us and frankly an inspiration  for anybody who ever met her. She truly was one of the most  exceptional, amazing, wonderful people I have ever met. She was  certainly a person of incredible faith, and she lived her faith, and  she provided that to others, certainly in her words but in her deeds  and in her spirituality, in the way that she handled herself, in her  spirit and compassion, and it affected everyone she met. Everyone she  met felt that radiant glow and reflected it back because it was so  powerful within her.   She was a member of the Benedict Sisters of Annunciation Monastery  and faithfully lived the monastic life for 59 years.   From 1978 to 2009, she served as the president of the University of  Mary and was, as I say, beloved by students and faculty. Under her  leadership, the university did amazing things.   I think for a time the Presiding Officer worked there at the  University of Mary during her tenure as president of the school. She  grew the enrollment--I think tripled the enrollment.   She was a gifted leader, an inspiring leader. She led by example. I  think one of the most amazing things about her--a story you hear about  over and over again; people marvel about it. When she originally came  back after her schooling at the University of Mary, she taught music,  but she eventually became president of the university. Even after she  was president of the university and Monsignor Shea became president of  the university, she stayed and continued to work with the university  and the students.   One of the amazing stories that people would talk about and marvel at  is how she would go on campus and she would meet all the students. So  she got to know them all, thousands of students. She knew all the  faculty and administrators and that kind of thing because they were  there all the time. But  [[Page S3195]]  she would get to know all the students, and without fail, she would  remember those students' names. She went around the campus, and it  wasn't just ``Hi, how are you?'' She knew the students. She knew their  names. She knew who they were. People would marvel not only that she  was able to do that, but she never seemed to forget a name. You have to  remember, there are thousands of students, and they are there for a  while, and they move on and more come in.   It is one thing to know the faculty and administrators and those  kinds of things and people who are there year in and year out, but  think about the flow of students coming through, and to know them and  know them by name--I think it is not only a testament to her but a  testament to the University of Mary, where they really make those young  people feel special and feel that they are an individual who is  somebody, who has worth. They are not just another student at the  school; they are somebody special. She made them feel special because  she knew them, she took time to talk to them. She always had time to  talk to them. She had a lot of important things to do, but she always  took time to talk to them and make them feel appreciated.   When we think about sending our son or our daughter off to school,  that is certainly something we would want, is when they go to that  school, there is somebody there who says: You are an individual. You  are unique. You are special. You are not just a number, but you are  here, and I appreciate you, and I am here for you.   That is what she did for those students--not just when she was  president but even after she retired as president. That is what she did  because that is who she was.   That is just one story, but that is part of her special gift--her  special gift--and she gave it to everybody. She gave it to everybody.  She gave that gift of her time, attention, compassion, and spirituality  to everyone. I don't know that I ever saw her in any setting where that  wasn't exactly what she was doing. That is why I say she did epitomize  that concept of servant leadership.   As Governor, I was privileged and honored to award Sister Thomas the  Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. That is our highest recognition  in North Dakota. That is the highest award we give. As part of it, we  then hang the individual's portrait in our State capitol, and along  with the portrait, there is also kind of a bio that is right there so  that people going to the North Dakota State Capitol can see the people  from across our State who are inspirational leaders. The pictures are a  montage, so that you put up things in their life.   In the case for Sister Thomas, she went to the University of Mary  there, and they can see and get a visual sense of what the person  looked like, the important things they did, and then we have a bio that  goes with it.   I am going to reference just a couple of the lines we have in the bio  we put in there:         Sister Thomas is recognized as a woman who lives, serves,       and leads by example. Her personal achievements, character,       and leadership have been an inspiration to countless       individuals, students, entrepreneurs, and business and state       leaders. Envisioning the University of Mary as the Nation's       premier institution for the preparation of servant leaders,       Sister Thomas promotes competence, communication, commitment       to values, and service to community. Her strong belief in the       ability of an individual to go into leadership through       service is an example for North Dakota and the nation.    There is a lot more, but those were some of the things we put in  there to try to capture who she was, what she did, and what a  difference she made in the lives of so many.   As I say, I don't know that I ever met anyone who didn't immediately  like her, but it was more than that. I mean, there are a lot of people  who are likeable, affable, and amiable. She was all of that. She was  very, very likeable. She had a great smile, good wit, and good humor.  She was a really good speaker. She was always very prepared, always had  a good message, and was well-spoken, but she had a great smile and a  ready laugh, and she immediately made people feel comfortable. You  could see how she would lean in and gaze in on them and just start to  say: Tell me about you. Give me some of what you are, A little bit of  what is your spirit, what moves you, what makes you. What are you  interested in? What do you like? How are you feeling?   She just did it naturally.   I just, again, can't think of anybody who ever met her and didn't  come away saying: You know, I like her, but she is special. She made me  feel good. She made me feel good. She seemed interested in me. She is  genuine. She cares. She made an impact on me.   They remember her, and it was positive, and it was strong.   Mikey and I extend our deepest condolences to her loved ones, and  when I say her family, she had a huge family because everybody she met  was basically her family, all those kids and all those students. We  want to express our sincere appreciation for her lifetime of service  and her commitment to her community and her commitment to God. Sister  Thomas was patient, Sister Thomas was wonderful, Sister Thomas was  beloved, and Sister Thomas will be missed very, very much. God bless  her   With that, I yield the floor.
