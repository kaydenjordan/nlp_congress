 Madam Speaker, my father fled Nazi Germany for America  because he saw what happened when a despot became untethered. He fled  because he believed in democracy, the rule of law, and the right to  vote. Before he died, he asked to be buried in a simple pine box with  an American flag to symbolize his love of this country.   Today, we are called upon to do our duty out of love of country. The  President stands accused. We must judge him as we judge any of our  fellow citizens: on the facts and on the law.   The facts show that the President's North Star is Russia, not the  Constitution.   There is no question that President Trump delayed military aid to  Ukraine, our ally, as they were under attack by Russia, our adversary.   There is no question the President withheld a meeting with President  Zelensky at the White House, giving Russia the upper hand in peace  negotiations with Ukraine.   There is no question that President Trump promoted the Russian hoax  that Ukraine attacked our election in 2016, a canard that has been  proven to be a lie, a Russian lie.   The only question is his motive. The fact is, his conduct and crimes  are reprehensible and unquestionably impeachable.   When I vote today, my father's legacy is deep, very deep, within me.  My father loved America, and I love America. That is why I will vote to  impeach the President of the United States.
