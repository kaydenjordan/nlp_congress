 Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a foreign  policy disaster that will be a stain on the conscience of our Nation  for many years to come. The situation in Syria is costing lives as we  speak.   Until recently, our strategy to defeat ISIS by, through, and with our  allies was working. Our small military presence in Syria was a  sustainable force that denied ISIS the ability to plan and launch  attacks from Syria or resurge back into Iraq.   The President's impulsive decision to leave Syria without any  deliberation has ignited a conflict in one of the most volatile regions  on Earth. This administration has managed to turn our Middle East  policy on its head in a week's time.   Turkey is slaughtering the Kurdish forces that have fought and died  on our behalf in the fight against ISIS. In our place, Syria and Russia  have quickly filled the void of American leadership.   We have betrayed our allies. This is not a foreign policy that  displays America's core values. It is a shameful choice that will cause  irreparable damage to American interests and alliances around the  world.   I believe this joint resolution is what we need in this moment to  combat this President's worst instincts. The joint resolution will  rebuke the White House and attempt to rebalance the situation in Syria.  I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support it.
