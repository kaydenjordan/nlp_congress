 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to share the story of Shalynne  Vilela, the loving daughter of Amy and David Vilela.   At just 22 years old, Shalynne was a smart, ambitious, and dedicated  young woman who loved her family. She was working hard to become a  registered nurse.   In 2015, Shalynne was admitted to the ER with symptoms of deep vein  thrombosis, a highly treatable condition, if treated in time.   Upon arrival to the ER, Shalynne told the hospital staff that she did  not have insurance, and she was advised to leave the hospital without  being given proper care.   Three weeks later, Shalynne died of a pulmonary embolism caused by a  blood clot that originated in her leg.   It is unacceptable that, in one of the richest and most powerful  countries in the world, a tragedy like this can still occur. Everyone  in the United States of America should have access to quality and  affordable health insurance. Access to healthcare is a basic human  right, and no one should ever be denied medical care because of their  inability to pay.   This is why, Mr. Speaker, I have recently pledged my support to the  Medicare for All Act, which provides universal coverage to all those  living in the United States of America.   My deepest condolences go out to the Vilela family. And, Shalynne,  this one is for you.                            ____________________
