 Madam Speaker, I have been to every nook and cranny of  the region I represent. I have never spoken to anyone anywhere who  thought elected officials should be able to use their public office for  personal profit.   I have never spoken to anyone anywhere who believes that elected  officials should be able to interfere in independent investigations or  to punish whistleblowers.   I have never spoken to anyone anywhere in my district who thinks we  should allow foreign countries to interfere in our elections.   Addressing these issues is what the Protecting Our Democracy Act is  all about.   Importantly, this bill includes the Honest Ads Act, a bill that I led  to increase accountability for online political ads. There are  disclaimer requirements for print, broadcast, and radio ads, and our  bipartisan bill would set those same requirements for online ads so  that the American people can know who is paying for the ads they are  seeing online and so we can keep foreign money out.   We know that foreign adversaries have attacked our elections in the  past, and we have to stop it. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this  legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to pass this bill today.                            ____________________
