 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, on July 20, 1969, people  across the country and around the world watched in eager anticipation  as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon.   This historic event ended the space race and brought American  innovation, determination, and leadership to the forefront of the  global stage.   This was American exceptionalism at its best. My brother, sister, and  I never missed an Apollo liftoff. We all became very familiar with that  countdown:         Ten, 9, 8--ignition sequence--6, 5--fire the retro-      rockets--3, 2, 1. Liftoff. We have liftoff. The rocket has       cleared the tower.    We watched in amazement as we sat in front of that little RCA black- and-white TV. It was like the whole room was shaking. We would sit and  watch the TV set until we saw the rocket finally leave all the way out  of sight.   Apollo 11 was a 36-story-high rocket. It started its 8-day, 953,000- mile journey to the Moon and back.   We all had toy rockets back in the day, and we would repeat that  liftoff sequence over and over. My brother and I would climb our garage  and launch our toy rockets.   In Cub Scouts, we built rockets. In Boy Scouts, we built rockets. In  our high school physics classes, we built rockets. We had contests to  see who could fly their rockets the highest and the farthest.   I have no idea how many young boys and girls were inspired to go into  science because of the joy of watching rockets being launched to the  Moon.   That Apollo jargon took over our daily lives. Our teachers would say  things like, ``Lunch is T minus 30 minutes.'' Or at the end of a tough  test, they would say, ``Mission accomplished.''   As we celebrate this historic event, I think back to all the times I  took my children to the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas, which  displays one of the Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo 11 mission.  This world-class museum and science center, number one of its kind,  showcases American innovation in space and aeronautics and provides  interactive opportunities to engage with historic events such as the  Moon landing.   In fact, they currently have a traveling exhibit called ``Apollo  Redux,'' which allows visitors to sit in an actual mission control  console from the Johnson Space Center where the Apollo missions were  coordinated.   It amazes me to think of all the advancements that have been made  possible as a result of these Apollo missions. Aerospace and  manufacturing revolutions have dramatically changed the way we build  and fly airplanes. Research conducted by NASA has helped us to better  understand our solar system, as well as our universe.   In fact, Astronaut Nick Hague of Hoxie, Kansas, in my district, is  currently conducting research on the International Space Station.   We are proud of Nick, who will keep doing a great job for America.   As a member of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I  am proud to join my colleagues here today in honoring the 50th  anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing and its legacy that we continue to  build upon today.                            ____________________
