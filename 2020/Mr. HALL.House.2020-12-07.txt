 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw the Chamber's attention  to critical needs for Georgia's Fifth Congressional District.   I know it has been a familiar trope to suggest that this week is  going to be the new infrastructure week. The administration has  announced several different infrastructure weeks, in fact. But it is  not just a talking point in my district. In my district, there are  several projects that require the attention of this Chamber.   They include the Clayton commuter rail, Campbellton Road BRT and rail  extension, Bankhead rail to Indian Creek extension, and Clifton  Corridor transportation plan.   Tackling these projects accomplishes many ends. It is an economic  revitalization project, as it connects vital American companies like  Microsoft to greater Atlanta. It is an environmental imperative, as  getting folks out of cars and onto mass transit decreases  CO2 levels. It is a jobs imperative, as it creates many  well-paying jobs. It is a racial justice imperative, as these projects  will service communities historically neglected.                            ____________________
