 Madam President, I want to start by commending my  colleague from South Carolina. He just spoke about his police  modernization efforts over the years and of his passionate commitment  to this issue, which comes from his heart.   I hope that the other side is hearing that because I think there is  an opportunity now to come together, particularly in light of the  speech the other night by the President, to say, let's do two things.  One, let's help these communities to be able to be safer and help the  people who live there, but, also, let's increase the amount of respect  and gratitude for our police officers. Those two are not inconsistent.  In fact, they are complementary. That is why I appreciate the work that  he has done and will do.                                   Ukraine    Madam President, tonight, in Ukraine, the bombs are already raining  down on the cities of Kharkiv, of Kyiv, and other towns and cities  throughout Ukraine. Indiscriminate bombings--artillery, missiles--are  killing innocent civilians. Already, thousands of civilians have been  killed.   This was a totally unwarranted, unjustified, atrocious invasion of a  free country, of an independent sovereign country. Here on the floor of  the Senate we have an opportunity to do something about it, which is to  act on legislation called the supplemental appropriations bill, which  provides more funding and help for two things: one, the military  response.   We need to do everything we can--we need to flood the zone--to help  the Ukrainians be able to defend themselves. They want more help, and  they need more help, and I think the American taxpayer, from what we  have already done, should be proud of that, but we need to do more and  do it quickly. We can't wait for the redtape and the bureaucracy to  finish up before we send small arms, before we send more Stingers to be  able to shoot down airplanes, or more Javelins to stop these tanks that  are coming into Kyiv. You saw that long column.   We should do more. We should provide more funding for the kind of  airplanes that we don't have but that other countries do that they  might be willing to provide, we are told, if we provide compensation to  them--MiG fighters that they can use--because airpower is so important.   We should provide more in terms of the drones that countries like  Turkey can provide, and we can help finance, to be able to give them  the ability to do things like stop that murderous column that is on its  way to kill civilians in Kyiv tonight.   So my hope is that, on both sides of the aisle, we put aside whatever  differences we have and focus on this immediately. The funding is  needed to be able to ensure that we have a sustained effort here-- because this is not going to be a matter of hours or days; it is going  to be a matter of weeks and months--and we need to do everything we can  do to help the freedom-loving people of Ukraine defend their liberty,  their freedom, their independence, their sovereignty.                                  H.R. 3076    Madam President, today, on the floor of the Senate, we are also  talking  [[Page S985]]  about Postal Service reform. This is about saving the post office. It  is in big trouble.   In my view, if we don't put some reforms in place in the post office  and do it quickly, we are going to have a situation where, in the next  few years, the post office will become insolvent. What will we do then?  A huge taxpayer bailout.   We have an alternative, which is to put in place reforms now, both  through congressional action--passing a law that I will talk about in a  second--but also through internal reforms at the post office itself.  With the current Postmaster General committed to those reforms, I am  confident that those can move as well. The combination of those two  things means saving the post office, and it is really important.   Think of the veterans you represent, if you are a Member here in the  Senate, who get their medication prescriptions from the mail. I am sure  you have heard from them, because I have. They don't like it when their  drugs are a day late, much less 2 or 3 days late or a week late,  because of the post office's not being able to perform.   How about the people who get their Social Security checks in the  mail? I have heard from them, too, and I am sure the Presiding Officer  has. They want a strong post office. They know that that universal  service obligation--meaning the post office--goes to every mailbox. It  is critical to them and their ability to get those lifesaving Social  Security checks.   What about the voters who vote absentee? In Ohio, we have no-fault  absentee. It works very well. It is a system that is fair, and it is a  system that is secure, but it is a system that relies on the post  office's doing its job--right?--to be sure those ballots are delivered  properly both to the voter but also back to the boards of elections.   So the post office is critical. Again, no one else is going to pick  up this function. That last mile is not going to be done by somebody  else. The post office is absolutely critical to save because it is  absolutely critical to the American people.    So what does our legislation do? Basically, it just does a few  things.   First, it eliminates a burdensome prefunding requirement for retiree  health benefits that the post office has to make that nobody else does.   Congress mandated this back in 2006. I am not quite sure why. They  mandated it for all current employees regardless of age. This has  crippled the post office financially. No other Federal Agency or  Department does that, by the way. The Federal Government does not  require the prefunding of retiree health benefits nor does the private  sector, frankly. In the private sector, it is basically Medicare. So we  take away that onerous burden, which, again, is crippling the post  office financially.   Second, we require the post office retirees who are retiring and who  have been paying into Medicare their entire careers to actually enroll  in Medicare Part B and Part D.   These are the hospital visits or prescription drugs. That saves the  post office money, but it also saves the taxpayer a bunch of money  because, right now, those employees--about 25 percent of them, of the  postal employees--do not go into Medicare; they stay in the Federal  Employees Health Benefits Program, soon to be the Postal Health Benefit  Plan, which is a more generous plan that will still be there to back it  up. But these employees going into Medicare will help to save the post  office.   Third, we require the Postal Service to maintain its current standard  of 6-day delivery.   Now, this is very important because a lot of Members in this caucus,  on my side--the Republicans--feel very strongly about this, but so do  Members of the Democratic side, particularly if they represent rural  areas. The 6-day delivery, as I said, is so important for things like  the Social Security checks, the rent checks, paying your utility bills,  ensuring that you have the ability to get your prescriptions through  the mail. So that is in this legislation--but also doing it through an  integrated delivery network of mail and packages. Think about first- class mail and other mail and packages. To have those in this  integrated service is far more efficient for the post office,  obviously. That is what they are doing now. So this legislation simply  says the status quo should continue there. Otherwise, it would be  terribly inefficient for us to have a separate system for packages and  a separate system for mail.   The combination of all of these things, by the way, means that the  Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation will save  the taxpayer $1.5 billion. So it doesn't cost anything--this is not an  appropriation--but over 10 years, it does save $1.5 billion.   In response to legitimate concerns that I have heard from the  shipping and the banking communities, let me also note what this bill  does not do.   No. 1, it does not appropriate any new funds to the U.S. Postal  Service--period.   No. 2, it does not change the accounting or costing structure for  packages and letters. So it does not disadvantage private sector  carriers. That is very important.   No. 3, it does not allow the Postal Service to enter into new  commercial services like postal banking--period.   Those are important things that have sometimes been misrepresented as  I have heard people talking about this legislation.   Finally and very importantly, despite the claims of some of the  opponents of this legislation, this bill does not impact the solvency  of the Medicare Part A trust fund--period. For the people who keep  saying that, you are wrong, and you know it because the CBO has now  made that very clear. I have made it clear on the floor, and so have  others. If that is the reason you are not supportive of this  legislation, you ought to look twice at it because it does not affect  the solvency.   This bill also, as we have found out from the CBO, does not impact or  increase the Part B or the Part D premiums. Again, some people have  said that. It is just not true. We know this because one of my  colleagues asked the CBO these questions in a letter. Some of us were  already saying this because, as an example, with regard to Part A,  people have been paying in their whole lives, but they are also already  eligible for Part A. So they are not going to add to Part A.   This colleague of mine wanted to be sure and get the answer from the  CBO. So he asked the CBO this question:         What is the effect of the legislation on the Medicare       Hospital Insurance Trust Fund?    Here was the answer from the CBO:         Most people aged 65 or older are entitled to benefits under       Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) if they have worked and       paid Medicare taxes for an adequate number of quarters;       nearly all Medicare-eligible USPS--    That is the Postal Service--       annuitants are already covered. Because entitlement to Part A       is related primarily to a person's age and employment       history, CBO estimates that the legislation's Medicare       requirements would not increase the number of people       receiving benefits under Part A; therefore, the agency       estimates that H.R. 3076 would not result in additional       spending from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.    No impact.   My colleague also asked the CBO:         So what is the effect upon Medicare premiums in Part B and       Part D?    The trust funds there, as you know, are funded by people paying  premiums. But the question is, Are the premiums going to go up in Part  B and Part D? The question really is, What is the effect on everybody?   Here is CBO's reply:         Our preliminary analysis suggests that the legislation is       unlikely to have an effect.        CBO does not expect that Part D (Drug Coverage) premiums       would change under H.R. 3076. Monthly premiums from Part B       are set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to       finance one-quarter of the expected annual monthly Part B       spending for all enrollees age 65 or over, rounded to the       nearest multiple of 10 cents. To cause a change under H.R.       3076, the group of new enrollees would need to be large       enough and their healthcare costs would need to be       sufficiently different from the current averages to affect       [the] average. CBO projects that under current law, Part B       enrollment will increase from 64 million people in 2025--the       year that 3076 would begin requiring certain UPS annuitants       to enroll in Part B--to 73 million [people by] 2031. CBO       estimates that under the legislation enrollment in Part B       would increase by between 13,000 and 40,000 people over that       period of time, or less than 0.1 percent of the program's       total enrollment. It is unlikely that an increase of that       magnitude would affect the monthly Part B premiums.   [[Page S986]]     In other words, what they are saying is it won't affect the premiums  because it is a drop in the bucket. We are talking about 60 or 70  million people, and we are talking about 13,000 to 40,000 people coming  into Part B and Part D. By the way, again, these people paid their HI  taxes all throughout their careers.   CBO then continued, relative to part D--this is the drug benefit:         H.R. 3076 would require PSHB--    That is the Postal Health Benefit Plan--       to deliver prescription drug benefits using an Employer Group       Waiver Plan under Medicare Part D. Part D premiums are based       on the national average monthly bid amount, as calculated by       the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services using       information from applicable plan bids. Because Employer Group       Waiver Plans are excluded from that calculation, CBO       estimates that the legislation's requirements would not       affect Part D premiums.    So let me, again, put it clearly. The bill does not impact the  solvency of the hospital trust fund--the Part A trust fund--which is  the trust fund we all talk about here--period. And the bill does not  increase Medicare Part B and Part D premiums.   By the way, because of this and because this saves the post office,  this legislation passed the House with strong bipartisan support. Just  a couple of weeks ago, it passed by a vote of 342 to 92. Not much gets  passed in the House with those kinds of big bipartisan numbers these  days, but saving the post office is pretty popular, particularly when  it is done the way this is done.   This was worked out between Members on both sides of the aisle and  between both sides of the Capitol. We did it carefully. We did it in a  way that, yes, will save the post office, along with the other reforms  internally we talked about, but in a way that is actually a money-saver  for the taxpayer.   It is also pretty popular with constituents. It is popular with  postal workers because they want to have a post office that continues  to survive. It is supported by the Citizens Against Government Waste,  which wrote a letter acknowledging the importance of this bill for  ensuring the solvency of the post office.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                Council for Citizens                                        Against Government Waste,                                                   February 7, 2022.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: You will soon be voting on H.R. 3076,       the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021. On behalf of the more       than one million members and supporters of the Council for       Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to       support this legislation.        The United States Postal Service (USPS) has been the       subject of a significant amount of justifiable criticism for       many years. The agency has been on the Government       Accountability Office's High-Risk List since 2009 due to its       unsustainable business model and financial condition. There       have been 15 consecutive years of net losses since 2007,       totaling $91.2 billion.        H.R. 3076 does not address all of the agency's problems,       including closing excess facilities, high labor costs, and       greater work sharing. But Section 202 of the bill codifies an       integrated delivery network of packages and mail together six       days a week. This provision is supported by the USPS, the       Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), mailers, shippers, and       pro-taxpayer organizations. Requiring the USPS to create       separate delivery systems for packages and mail would       increase costs, slow down delivery, and raise prices for       customers.        According to the PRC, separate networks would cost more       than $15 billion annually for a new fleet of vehicles and       tens of thousands of new employees. That would make it highly       unlikely that the USPS would ever be profitable, and very       likely that taxpayers would be paying for a significant       bailout, along with a large annual subsidy.        H.R. 3076 also prevents the USPS from getting into       financial services and other non-postal commercial       businesses. There is ample evidence that such activities are       doomed to fail. In the fall of 2021, USPS began providing       Visa cards of up to $500 to customers who used business       checks for the transactions. They sold six cards between       September 13, 2021 and January 12, 2022, bringing in $37.50       in fees, which is equal to the pay for about two hours of       work for one USPS clerk. As the USPS said in 2014 in response       to the suggestion by the USPS inspector general that the       agency should provide financial services, its ``core function       is delivery, not banking.''        The bill also increases financial transparency and       strengthens inspector general oversight.        While H.R. 3076 does not solve all the issues currently       facing the USPS, the legislation sets the agency on the path       to a more sustainable future. For these reasons, I urge you       to support H.R. 3076. Any votes related to H.R. 3076 may be       among those considered for CCAGW's 2022 Congressional       Ratings.            Sincerely,                                                        Tom Schatz,                                                         President.     So I encourage my colleagues to join us in support of  this legislation. Let's put the Postal Service in a position to  succeed, and let's provide those essential services to the small  businesses, veterans, the elderly, rural constituents, who rely on it  so much--the prescription drugs we talked about, the Social Security  checks, the rent checks, the utility checks, and the ballots.   I appreciate working with my colleague Senator Gary Peters on this,  over time, to try to find a consensus, to try to find a way forward  that was bipartisan, bicameral, where we could actually do something  after years and years of talking about what bad shape the post office  is in financially, to do something to right the ship, to ensure it will  be there for the future.   Let's pass this bill, and let's do ensure that the post office is  healthy for all the folks we represent going forward.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
