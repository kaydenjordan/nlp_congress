 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the  dedicated staff work of Major Jonathan Grabill, who served as a  military fellow, and Drew Nickels, who served as a foreign policy  fellow, in the office of the Second District.   Major Grabill has had a distinguished career in the Army for more  than 16 years. He provided key insight in developing the National  Defense Authorization Act. He has been deployed to Germany, Iraq, and  Kuwait. His background has been vital to reverse the decline of  readiness in our military.   A leader on foreign policy issues, Mr. Nickels has worked tirelessly  to develop legislation for the Foreign Affairs Committee. He previously  served as intelligence briefer for two Secretaries of Energy. Before  that, he was an intelligence analyst with the Foreign Nuclear Programs  Division at DOE.   Mr. Speaker, their service will always be appreciated, with  congratulations for being members of the Wilson team.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of Diane Wells; her husband, Joey; and  children Eli, Maya, and Emma.                            ____________________
