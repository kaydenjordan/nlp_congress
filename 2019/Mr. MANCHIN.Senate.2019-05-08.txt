 Madam President, I rise today to call for immediate  action on the American Miners Act. We have an obligation to the miners  across America who have served our Nation by providing us with energy  through our greatest advancements. They deserve to know that their  pensions, which they rightfully worked for, will be funded fully, and  they deserve to have accessible healthcare, which was guaranteed to  them as well.   As the Senate fails to act, we continue to put our retired miners'  healthcare and pension benefits in jeopardy yet again. I have been  working with everyone from every angle in order to prevent our miners  from losing their healthcare and benefits. But, once again, they are  facing a deadline that puts their whole livelihood at risk.   This has been a long fight, and it is far from over. Everyone who has  joined me in this journey understands that fighting for working people  is what we were sent here to do. These retired miners are walking the  halls and fighting for what is rightfully theirs. I am doing this for  them. I promised them that this body will not abandon them, and I  refuse to let them down.   To give you some background, the 1974 pension plan will be insolvent  by 2022 if we do not act. We needed to act a year ago or so, and we  haven't done it. It is a shame. Miners who receive their healthcare  through companies that went bankrupt in 2018 are at risk of losing  coverage in the coming months if we fail to act soon.   How did we get here? Unlike many other public and private pension  plans, in 1974, the miners' pension plan was well managed and 94  percent funded prior to the crash of 2008. However, the financial  crisis hit at a time when this plan had its highest payment  obligations. If the plan becomes insolvent, these beneficiaries will  face benefit cuts, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will  assume billions of dollars in liabilities.   To address these issues, the American Miners Act would shore up the  1974 pension plan, which is headed for insolvency due to coal company  bankruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis. It would ensure that the  miners who are at risk due to 2018 coal company bankruptcies will not  lose their healthcare and extend the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund  tax at $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and 55 cents per ton of  surface-mined coal for 10 years.   West Virginia has more retired union coal miners than any other  State. More than 27,000 retirees live in West Virginia alone.   I am going to read a letter to give you perspective on what we are  dealing with. Richard from Morgantown, WV, said:         I am writing this letter with respect and concern to       preserve our pension. My name is Richard. I live in       Morgantown, West Virginia. My career as an underground coal       miner lasted 35 years. I am soon to be 68 years old. Working       underground all those years, the physical labor tends to take       a toll on a person's body. I receive a monthly pension of       $1,466 a month from the UMWA Pension Fund. This monthly       pension is used to pay utility bills, purchase groceries, and       everyday necessities. I am also helping to support my five       year old grandson and his mother, who doesn't earn enough for       them to live on their own. You see, my daughter became       addicted to prescription opioids after having serious medical       problems. She has been clean for five years and is trying to       rebuild her life, but we are supporting her and her son. My       pension is a major source of income for my family and it       would be devastating if I were to lose any of it. I can't       imagine how we would survive. Our county and surrounding       counties are heavily dependent on the coal miners' pension.       Should we lose our pension, the economy in this area would       plummet. I am also writing as a voice for those who are       unable to write to you. I am asking your committee to       carefully consider the bill to preserve our pensions.    I have another one from Gary from Southern West Virginia who wrote:         I have worked in the [United Mine Workers] since 1973 at       Cannelton Coal. I worked about 13\1/2\ years, then had a lay-      off in the early 80's, had to find work in another field, and       got a job driving a school bus for 25 years. I'm retired now,       but I still sub-drive for the county, was in [a] . . . bus       driver association, and also drive a bus for Ace Adventure       Resort. I am 74 now and still very active in the work force.       I thank God for my health. I am still married to a wonderful       woman, had 4 kids, 3 of them have passed away, one from       cancer, one [from] allergy, my daughter died from a drug       overdose. I am still paying on my daughter's funeral       expenses. This retirement check that I get every month is a       big help getting this bill paid, also had to pay on one of my       son's funeral expenses. Since 2011 it has been very hard       trying to keep your head above water. I only get $261 a month       but I am so thankful for what I get. It really helps out a       lot. Please find a way so we can keep our retirement check.       We will keep on praying for all you guys who are fighting for       us.   [[Page S2731]]     I just want to finish by saying that these are people who have gone  to work every day. They didn't take the money home because they were  letting that go into their retirement pension, and they thought that  was being taken care of and managed properly. It wasn't their fault.  They have already paid, and now because of bankruptcies and financial  collapses, they can't get the money. It is wrong. It is not who we are  as a country.   Through the bankruptcy laws that we have in America today, you can be  in line if you are a financial institution--somebody that basically is  in line before the person we are basically here to serve. The miners  who get these pensions average $460 a month. That is the average  pension they receive. That is not much. Most of these are widows, too,  because the husbands have passed away.   So I am asking--this has been a bipartisan bill. I appreciate all of  my colleagues on the Republican side, all of my Democratic colleagues,  and everybody for working and really trying to take care of the people  whom we made a promise to. This was a pension that was guaranteed by  Harry S. Truman with John L. Lewis at the time. It is in stone. It is  there for us, and it is basically one we cannot walk away from.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.
