 Mr. Speaker, today the House is asserting its  constitutional responsibility by cutting off U.S. involvement with the  Saudi-led coalition in the devastating conflict in Yemen. I thank  Representative Khanna for leading on this issue.   This brutal war has caused mass starvation and cut off humanitarian  aid from reaching those most in need. The number of casualties has  exceeded half a million men, women, and children. We don't know if this  legislation will reach the President's desk or whether he will sign it,  but with reporting that Saudi coalition members have transferred U.S.  weapons to terrorist groups in Yemen, and the Trump administration  choosing to ignore a deadline last week to report on whether Saudi  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the death of  journalist Khashoggi, we must keep up the pressure to end U.S.  involvement in hostilities in Yemen.   At the end of the day, U.S. participation in this war is illegal,  having never been authorized by Congress.                                time  1015    When the United States became involved with the Saudi-led war, this  action was not covered by the Authorization for Use of Military Force  issued by Congress in the wake of 9/11. The Houthis, against whom the  Saudi coalition is engaged, are not affiliated with al-Qaida. But  because of the 60-word 2001 AUMF, three Presidents have warped that  limited authorization into enabling a global-spanning war, broad enough  to cover airstrikes in the Khyber Pass and to boots on the ground in  Niger. This AUMF contains no time limits, no geographic constraints,  and no need for congressional consent or oversight.   In the last 17 years, the 2001 AUMF has been cited as statutory  authority for unclassified military actions in more than 18 countries,  and Congress has been left in the dark about many of these operations.  Our men and women in uniform have deployed time and again, shouldering  a heavy burden while at the same time the public is becoming more  removed from the conflicts in which we are engaged.   Today, less than 20 percent of the Members of the 116th Congress were  present when this vote was taken in 2001. But after more than a decade  of putting more and more war-making power in the hands of the President  and greater burden on the shoulders of our troops, Congress must take a  [[Page H1529]]  stand. We cannot continue to be sidelined from the decisions critical  to our national security.   The Constitution is clear. Congress, not the President, has the power  to declare war. The President can respond to an imminent threat to the  homeland or to U.S. personnel abroad, or if we are attacked, but this  is the only situation in which he may dispense with congressional  approval, because as current law dictates, once the President initiates  hostilities against a new enemy, Congress, not the President, dictates  whether hostilities can continue.   It would be wrong for Congress to allow any President solely on his  or her own authority and aside from an imminent, clear threat to  sustain our involvement in any conflict, especially one so fraught as  the conflict in Yemen. The United States cannot enter any conflict in  the Middle East, East Asia, or Africa with no clear strategy, no clear  objectives, and no authorization from Congress.   The American people need answers, and our troops and their families  deserve a public debate over the sacrifices we ask them to make. I  understand that for many Members, after close to two decades of war in  Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of debating, let alone authorizing, new  military action is not going to be popular, even if warranted. But we  were not elected to pass the buck or abdicate our constitutional  responsibility. We must debate these issues.   Mr. Speaker, as a combat veteran and a Member of Congress, I know it  is one of our most important and solemn responsibilities to decide when  and how we send Americans into harm's way. We cannot shirk that  responsibility because of its gravity. We must embrace the tough  decisions our role requires us to carry out.   I hope today is the beginning of our long-overdue debate over the  AUMF and the true costs of war on our country and the men and women who  fight and die serving it.                            ____________________
