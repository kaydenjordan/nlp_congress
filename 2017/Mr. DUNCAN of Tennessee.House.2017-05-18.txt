 Mr. Speaker, President Eisenhower's most  famous speech was his farewell address in which he criticized the  military industrial complex.   However, 7 years earlier, in April of 1953, he gave a speech,  entitled, ``The Chance for Peace,'' with these words: ``Every gun that  is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the  final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who  are cold and are not clothed. . . .''   ``The cost of one modern heavy bomber,'' Eisenhower added, ``is this:  a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power  plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. . . . We pay for a  single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a  single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000  people. . . .''   Eisenhower concluded: ``This is not a way of life at all, in any true  sense . . . it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.''   President Eisenhower loved the military, but he hated war. He would  never have gone along with a 16-year war in a place like Afghanistan,  especially since it is one mainly done for personal glory for generals  and more money for defense contractors.                            ____________________
