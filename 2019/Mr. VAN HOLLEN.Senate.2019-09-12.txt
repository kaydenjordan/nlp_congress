 Mr. President, I start by thanking my friend and  colleague the Senator from Illinois, Ms. Duckworth, for her service to  our country many years ago in the military, for her serving in Iraq,  and now for her serving our country in a different capacity; that of  standing up in the U.S. Senate to defend the Constitution and to defend  this institution against what is clearly an unconstitutional power grab  by the President of the United States.   When I took my oath of office--when we took our oaths of office--we  all swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.  Back in March of this year, 59 Senators kept that promise when we stood  together, on a bipartisan basis, to say no to a gross abuse of  Executive power--to an unconstitutional power grab--when we said: No,  Mr. President, you may not ignore the will of the Congress. You may not  ignore the appropriations that were passed by both Houses of Congress  and signed by you. You may not ignore them and rob critical military  projects across the country to fund an unnecessary wall.   Now, we can all debate--we have debated many times--the merits of  this wall, but there really should be no debate about the fact that the  way the President has gone about it undermines the Constitution and  undermines the powers given in that Constitution to the Senate and to  the House. We made that statement on a bipartisan basis back in March-- 59 Senators.   Mr. President, don't go robbing military construction accounts and  defense accounts to finance the wall.   Yet here we are, 6 months later, and the President is attempting to  do exactly that. He is diverting important investments in our military  in places across Maryland and around the country.   As has been pointed out, the President said repeatedly that Mexico  was going to pay for this wall. Instead, taxpayers are having to pay  for this wall, and service men and women and the families of service  men and women are bearing the brunt of the President's latest raid.   I see the majority leader is on the floor. Just yesterday, the  majority leader said he was going to fight the President's effort to  take money away from a middle school in Kentucky to build the wall.   I have a question for the majority leader and all of my colleagues  who want to fight to protect the projects in their States. Are they  willing to stand up for projects in every State that hurt military  families?   Here is what the Air Force wrote about a Maryland project. It is one  that is not very far away from here--at Andrews Air Force Base. It is  an air force base that, I dare say, every Member of this Senate has had  the occasion and honor to visit from time to time. I have in my hand  the budget request from the Air Force for a project at Andrews to help  the service men and women who work there.   Their article reads:         Not providing this facility forces members to use more       expensive, less convenient and potentially lower quality off-      base programs. These off-base child development centers       typically cost $9,400 more than on-base, creating a severe       financial strain on military personnel.    That is what the Air Force writes--an additional $9,400 a year for  military men and women who we know are not getting big paychecks.   That is not all the Air Force wrote. It went on to write in its  justification for this investment: ``Quality of life will be severely  degraded, resulting in impacts to retention and readiness because  Airmen and their families will not have a safe and nurturing  environment for childcare.''   That is from the U.S. Air Force.   I invite all of our colleagues to visit that base and look at the  current conditions there because here are the current conditions at the  current childcare center that the Air Force is seeking to remedy with  this investment.   Again, this is a quote right from the Air Force:         The existing facility has suffered from sewage backups, a       leaking roof, HVAC failures, along with mold and pest       management issues. Work orders continue to pile up . . .       making it more difficult to ensure accreditation each year.       The bathrooms are constantly flooding, and drainage issues in       the kitchen result in monthly backups.    That is from the Air Force. Those are the conditions our men and  women at Andrews are currently facing in the childcare center. That is  why the Air Force asked for this money that the President is now trying  to take away.   It turns out that when you do the math and when you look at the cost,  the money being taken away from this childcare center that would  address these awful conditions that exist would build about a half a  mile of a wall--a wall that is unnecessary. Yet, even if you believe we  need to build this long wall, you should agree that we should not be  robbing moneys out of the accounts that help the families of our  service men and women.   That was one of the projects in Maryland the President raided. He  also raided two others, including one to address traffic congestion at  Fort Meade, which is the home to many facilities, including, of course,  the National Security Agency. In all, $66 million was robbed from  service men and women in the State of Maryland.   That was just Maryland. We have heard about other States. We have  also heard about cuts around the world--cuts from a program that was  originally known as the European Reassurance Initiative--funds that we  were investing, along with our allies, to deter Russian aggression in  places like Ukraine. We called it the European Reassurance Initiative.  I don't know what is reassuring now about robbing those accounts. That  will have a direct negative impact on our national security and the  readiness of the U.S. forces and those of our allies.   We are going to have a lot of opportunities in the coming weeks to  address this issue. I hope we will address it on a bipartisan basis. I  hope we will address it as U.S. Senators who recognize that the  President's actions here are a direct assault on article I--that they  are a direct assault on the spending powers given to Congress under  article I.   We have our differences. We had a markup in the Appropriations  Committee today. Members had a chance to  [[Page S5467]]  offer their amendments. Some were accepted. Some were rejected. It was  the democratic process at work, and that is the same democratic process  we used to put these investments for our military families in place in  the first place.   The Senate acted. The House acted. In fact, the President signed the  bill, and now he comes back to grab that money through this  unconstitutional power grab.   I will end with this, because I think all of us recognize the danger  and the precedent that will be set here. We may agree or disagree with  the President's decision to build a wall, but beware--beware,  everybody--of a future President--a Republican or Democratic President  or of some other party--using the same mechanism to undermine the  Constitution and to undermine article I.   Let's unite as U.S. Senators to stop that from happening.   I yield the floor.
