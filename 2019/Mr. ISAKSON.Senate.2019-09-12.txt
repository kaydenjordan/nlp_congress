 Mr. President, today, I am proud to recognize  in the Record an organization that has meant so much to so many  worldwide.   In June, the YMCA celebrated a major anniversary. Since its creation  175 years ago, the YMCA is now located in 119 countries and serves 58  million individuals, including my own family In Alpharetta, GA; the  local YMCA is named for my father: the ``Ed Isakson/Alpharetta Family  YMCA.''   Now, the YMCA is celebrating 75 years of an important civic  engagement program called Youth Assembly. Youth Assembly is a high  school mock State legislative program, which I participated in as a  student myself, serving as a press delegate in 1962.   At Youth Assembly, students discuss current issues confronting their  State with other high school students from across the State, along with  educators, State administrators, and other elected officials. In  Georgia, this program brings together a diverse group of students who  come from very different parts of our State. Students choose from a  range of areas relevant to the legislative process, including  executive, judicial, legislative, lobbyist, and media roles. This  program is competition-based, and those delegates who excel in each of  the programs are recognized during the closing session.   In Atlanta, the program is held annually at the State capitol, where  volunteers from State departments act as resources for the students  while they debate the issues. These volunteers, along with State YMCA  staff, help guide students through mock committee meetings and  procedures. Students debate and vote on the bills that their fellow  delegates have written and presented. Bills that pass in committee are  then taken to the floor of the house or senate for full debate and  vote. Participants also engage in campaigns and elections for officers  who will serve during the following year.   Bringing these students together helps them learn not only the  legislative process but also more about people from different  backgrounds and from parts of their own State who may not be as  familiar to their upbringing.   For our democracy to survive, it requires citizen participation.  Anything we can do to help students--and all citizens--to better  understand government and recognize the importance of playing a role m  its operation is important. If everyone were more involved day-to-day,  we might see fewer disagreements, but we would certainly have a better  understanding of how our country operate, and how opinions can differ  without being disagreeable.   Becoming involved in government helps us all, and I commend the YMCA  on the 75th anniversary of this meaningful program for our  youth.                            ____________________
