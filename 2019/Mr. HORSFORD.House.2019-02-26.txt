 Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of Nevada's Fourth  Congressional District, a district that is home to over 50,000 square  miles of geographically diverse land, including several national  monuments and parks, I am proud to voice my support for the Natural  Resources Management Act.   As we have heard, this bill permanently reauthorizes the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, an integral conservation program that has  provided the State of Nevada with $40 million for investment in local  parks and another $60 million to benefit our public lands.   Moreover, this bill expands access to outdoor recreation  opportunities for communities across America. Outdoor recreation is a  vital aspect of Nevada's economy. In 2017, it supported nearly 90,000  jobs, contributed $4 billion in wages, and spurred $12 billion of  consumer spending in our State.   I am proud to vote for this bill to expand outdoor recreation  opportunities, particularly for our underserved communities, many of  whom depend on Federal funding to develop parks and recreation.   As the 116th Congress continues, I look forward to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to develop  conservation programs that work for all of America.
