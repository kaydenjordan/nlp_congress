 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I agree with  the Senator from Connecticut that we should pass the proposal. In fact,  I have offered a proposal to fund the Iron Dome with $1 billion that  should be paid for, though. We are facing a $30 trillion debt. We  borrow $2 million a minute. Inflation is rising. They are wanting to  pile more debt upon our country. So, if we are going to help our ally  Israel, I think we need to be strong to do it, we need to be not piling  on debt without consequences, and this should be paid for.   There is a very easy pay-for that I have proposed. There is $6  billion left in a reconstruction fund for the Afghan national  government. Well, the Afghan  [[Page S6960]]  national government no longer exists. In the haste to leave, the Biden  administration has let the Taliban overrun the country.   So I asked the other day, in committee, of Secretary Blinken: This $6  billion, are you planning on giving it to the Taliban?   And he said: Well, it depends on whether they fulfill their  commitments.   To me, that sounds like a pretty big ``if,'' but if the Biden  administration says that they fulfill their commitment and  expectations, the understanding is the Biden administration is going to  give $6 billion to the Taliban.   So, not only do they let them take $80 billion of equipment, not only  did we leave in complete disarray, Democrats now want to say: Oh, we  have got to keep this money because we have to give it to the Taliban.   That is obscene.   We should immediately rescind all of that money. If you want to give  money to Afghanistan, let's vote on it again. But you gave the money to  the previous government, and now you want to give the money to the  Taliban, which has overrun the country. It is a disgrace. The Taliban  shouldn't get a penny. And we should pay for things, even for things  that we are trying to give to allies.   So I have a proposal before the desk. My proposal says to fully fund  the $1 billion for the Iron Dome project. Fully fund it. We have  already given billions for it. We are willing to give $1 billion more,  but we are going to pay for it by not giving money to the Taliban. So  it is a pretty easy sort of list. We asked every Senator on the  Republican side if they objected to this, and not one Republican  objected to this. So the reason the Iron Dome is being held up is  because the Democrats are objecting to its being paid for.   I am here today to support the Iron Dome. I am giving a proposal that  would give them their $1 billion right now. It could happen today. All  I ask is that it be paid for with money that has already been  appropriated and that is, in all likelihood, going to be given to the  Taliban if we don't take it away now. I think it is a very reasonable  proposal.   I am disappointed that the Democrats are objecting to Iron Dome  today. It is a disappointment that they are against paying for it with  a fund that is already out there, and that they so much love the idea  of giving the money to the Taliban that they are going to insist on  blocking Iron Dome funding because they are insistent on ``No, no, we  can't get rid of the $6 billion because, if the Taliban behaves, we are  going to give it to them.''   Look, I don't care if the Taliban behaves. I wouldn't give them a  penny. There are other ways of trying to have a diplomatic relationship  other than giving money to people. People think that somehow, if the  Taliban behaves, we have got to give them money? I think that is a  crazy notion.   So, without question, I will object.   I ask the Senator to modify his request so that, instead of his  proposal and as in legislative session, the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; further, that  the only amendment in order be my substitute amendment, which is at the  desk. I further ask that there be 2 hours of debate, equally divided  between the two leaders, and that upon the use or yielding back of that  time, the Paul substitute amendment at the desk be considered and  agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time,  and that the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I am  disappointed that the Democrats will again today block the Iron Dome  funding as paid for. I think it is important that we do support our  allies. I am in support of the Iron Dome funding, but I think, at the  very least, it should be paid for. We have offered them various  permutations of this--either the entire $6 billion from the Afghan  reconstruction fund or $1 billion. We have offered them other  alternatives to look at other funding in government that already exists  to see if we could pay for this.   So the real reluctance is on the Democrats' part to pay for aid, and  the thing is that we can't just blindly keep giving money away without  repercussions. We are $30 trillion in debt.   So I am disappointed today that the Democrats will block the Iron  Dome funding as paid for, and I do object to the underlying  proposition.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as we speak,  the Taliban is regaining control, has control over most of Afghanistan,  is brutalizing women, kicking women out of school. Women will no longer  be participating in the government.   It is really just unconscionable that Democrats insist that money be  there to give to the Taliban.   Any person who believes and truly believes that the Taliban is a  menace to women's rights and to women in a civilized world should join  me in saying: We should make sure that no money ever goes to the  Taliban.   When Secretary Blinken was asked about this, he said that if there is  cooperation and if they meet expectations, the $6 billion--and some say  up to $10 billion--available for the previous government will be given  to the Taliban, who violently overthrew this government.   We are asking something very simple. We could fund Iron Dome today.  Make sure that everybody who listens to this understands. This is being  blocked by Democrats who don't want to pay for it.   We have a proposal that would have proposed $1 billion today for Iron  Dome, but it would have been paid for by taking money out of an account  that has been allocated and that Secretary Blinken has indicated he  will give to the Taliban if they behave.   So I think it is a real problem, and it is a problem of this body  that the cavalier nature of just letting our country pile on $30  trillion of debt. You ask how we got here. We got here $1 billion at a  time.   So rarely do we have an episode or a time where we can object. You  know, I would object to a trillion if it were on the floor. I would  object to $50 billion on the floor.   But the billion dollars ought to be paid for. And there are so many  pay-fors. But this is why government grows by leaps and bounds and  becomes more and more wasteful over time.   So I do object.    Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching a milestone in  our country, and it is not a good one. We are rapidly approaching $30  trillion in debt. We are accumulating debt like we never have at any  time in our history. We are actually accumulating debt at the rate of  over $2 million per minute.   Now, some say deficits don't matter. Some on the left say they have  this new monetary theory: We can just print it all up. You can all have  free stuff. There will be manna from Heaven. And nothing could go  wrong; we are just going to give you money. If not $1,400 checks a  month or a year, why don't we give you monthly checks?   That is part of the new plans. The new plans of the $3\1/2\ trillion  that we are facing down at this point--that will all be borrowed--is to  give people free money; to give people free this, free that. But I  think people are smarter than that. I think people know that,  ultimately, you don't get anything in life without hard work; you don't  get anything in life, really, for free.   Isn't there some kind of ramification to so much borrowed money? When  someone comes to you and says or they call you on the phone and they  say ``Here is a thousand dollars; all you have got to do is sign up for  this,'' most people immediately recoil and they say ``Well, that might  be a scam. Somebody is going to be ripping me off to say that.''   Well, that is sort of the bait-and-switch of the politics we face  now. People are saying: We are going to give you free college, free  cars, free cell phones, free this, free that. Everything in life will  be free. You won't have to work anymore.   The problem is, there are ramifications. Money doesn't grow on trees.  Money has got to come from somewhere. So either we borrow it and we  become more indebted to foreign countries, we tax people for it, or  ultimately the way we fix a lot of our deficit problems is we simply  print the money.   So when the Federal Reserve prints the money, as we increase the  money supply, the money that we have becomes worth less and less; it  loses its purchasing power. This is the insidious tax of inflation.   The interesting thing about it is that inflation is a regressive tax.  It doesn't affect everyone the same. In fact, the tax of inflation  actually affects the working class, the people of lower incomes, and  those on fixed incomes and pensions, retirees--it affects them much  worse because they don't have the ability for their income to go up.   So, right now, we are facing 5 percent inflation because of the  massive borrowing that, really, both parties instituted in the last  year. They decided that the result to the pandemic would be to close  everything down, destroy the economy, and then give everyone free  money. And, to a large extent, both parties actually did this last  year.   Now, this year, the decision has been made by Republicans to say:  Whoo, this is so much. We have got to stop. We have got to get people  back to work and let the economy recover.  [[Page S6976]]    So it has primarily been Democrats this year, but both parties have a  certain responsibility to this--at least some members of both parties.  But, as the inflation occurs and as this effect is being transmitted to  the economy, you find that those who suffer are those who cannot raise  their incomes, those who have fixed incomes or low incomes.   One of the things you see here is that, if we have 5-percent  inflation, what does that mean?   You say: Well, I don't know. It means I lose my purchasing power by 5  percent next year.   But what if it happens year in and year out for a decade, and you  have lost 50 percent of your purchasing power?   It means, to make up for that, you really have to have a 50-percent  increase in your wages.   So will wages keep up with inflation?   The dirty little secret is that, in some ways, wages will rise, but  maybe they rise an equivalent amount or a little bit less, and you say  a decade later: I am not any better off.   And there become people mired and more dependent on government as  government gets larger and larger. They think they are getting free  stuff, but it is not really free. The allure of something for nothing-- this is the allure of socialism. This is a false allure. It is the idea  that you are going to be able to get something and you are not going to  have to pay for it.   So we have accumulated $30 trillion in debt. Interest payments have  been fairly low over the past decade or so. Interest payments are at  about, you know, 1, 2, 2.5 percent, but now interest rates are rising.  Even at the low interest rates, our interest rate that we pay each year  has grown to about $300 billion a year.   So, with $300 billion a year, people say: Well, there is a debt  ceiling. If the debt ceiling doesn't come up, we will default, and Wall  Street will become hysterical, and there will be a collapse of the  stock market.   Well, there doesn't need to be. Nobody is really for spreading  discalm or spreading, you know, chaos among the marketplace. We all  want the marketplace to be calm.   How could we calm the marketplace?   Well, what we would say to the marketplace is, we will pay our bills  and we are not going to default on our currency. And the way you can  pay for your bills is to pay for them with income. We bring in $3.8  trillion a year in tax revenue. The interest payment is $300 billion.  It is less than we bring in in 1 month. So the annual payment on  interest is less than what we bring in in tax revenue in 1 month.   Why can't we pay the interest? Why would we ever not pay the interest  on our debt? Why?   Because we are overdrawn and because all the rest of the spending is  crowded out by the interest.   We have got plenty of money to pay for the interest. We just don't  have enough left to pay for the cocaine studies with Japanese quail.  That is, you know, about a million bucks.   You say: Oh, it is only a million bucks.   Well, they studied Japanese quail to see whether or not Japanese  quail on cocaine are more sexually promiscuous.   How did we get to a $30 trillion debt?   Because there are studies like that littered throughout the budget.  In fact, the group that does these studies, the National Science  Foundation, we just increased their budget by two-thirds. It was mostly  the Democrats, but, once again, many of the Big Government Republicans  voted for this too. So we have exploded the National Science  Foundation.   Now, was there any warning that the National Science Foundation was  one of the most wasteful parts of our government?   Well, yes, since 1972.   There was a Senator at the time named William Proxmire. He was a  conservative, or a maverick, Democrat from the Midwest, and he started  an award. He called it the Golden Fleece Award. The first award he gave  was for a study from the National Science Foundation. It was over a  study that was $50,000. That was when $50,000 was a lot of money. And  the study was to see what makes people happy.   Really?   People were aghast that we were spending $50,000 on it. He  complained, and he gave them a booby prize and a Golden Fleece Award.   And, lo and behold, we are still doing it. The same organization,  last year, did a million-and-a-half-dollar study that if you take a  selfie of yourself while smiling and then look at the selfie later on,  does it make you happy? That cost a million-and-a-half bucks.   Why do people like each other? Why do people fall in love?   These aren't studies for taxpayer dollars. But these are small ticket  items. They say: Oh, you could never balance the budget on that.   Well, what about the $70 million spent on a hotel in Kabul, and the  contractor ran off with the money, and it was never built?   What about a $48 million gas station--no; strike that--natural gas  gas station in a remote area of Afghanistan?   Well, very few, if anybody, in the United States has a car that runs  on natural gas.   Why was the U.S. Government building a natural gas gas station in  Afghanistan?   Because we have gone ``woke'' on the green climate. We are for the  green climate. We have got to combat climate change and reduce the  carbon footprint of Afghanistan.   Really?   I thought the military was supposed to kill the enemy and defend the  country, but we are reducing the carbon footprint in Afghanistan.   Somebody put this up--I think it was Rod Dreher--the other day. It  was a little video clip. It was tragic, but somewhat hilarious in its  tragicness.   He said: This is when we lost the Afghan war.   It had a picture of a urinal. I think it was by Marcel Duchamp, some  Dadaist artist back in, like, 1917, and I guess he thought it would be  really hilarious to put a male urinal in a museum and call it art. I  don't know if it was really art or if it was a joke, but the thing is  they were having these Afghan men and women in robes and veils and  everything studying Dadaist art--a male urinal--and asking them what  they thought of this. You could see a couple of women just sort of  shaking their heads with utter incomprehension.   When we are spending money sending Ph.D.s over to Afghanistan to  teach Dadaist art--that a male urinal is somehow art--I think that is  why some of them think that we are actually the culture that is in  decay, not theirs.   But the thing is we are spending money right and left. The right  spends it on military adventures, and the left spends it on welfare,  and the compromise that always happens around here is that right comes  together with left, and they all agree: Well, you know, we might as  well just spend it on both.   So everything goes up. The military budget went up. We already spend  more than all of the countries. More than 10 countries combined is our  military budget--$750-some-odd billion. Republicans and Democrats just  raised it $25 billion more.   In the midst of ending a war, where is the peace dividend? What  happened?   We ended a war. I thought we would have a little more money left  over.   So, today, I tried to take $6 billion that is supposed to go to the  Afghan Reconstruction Fund, to the old Afghan Government. There is no  Afghan Government. They have been overrun by the Taliban.   I would love for Americans who are watching this to call me today, at  my office, and tell me why the Taliban should get money.   I asked that we take that money away, put it back in the Treasury,  and spend some of it on the Iron Dome for Israel, and it was objected  to by the Democrats because, by golly, they will spend money, but they  don't want to offset it with any spending cuts.   Well, really?   We should have zero dollars being sent to any government in  Afghanistan.   I asked Secretary Blinken about this, and his response was: Well, I  can't guarantee it, and if they--you know, if they are meeting  expectations and they are acting and behaving properly, they might get  this money.   Really?   I don't see a scenario or a world in which U.S. taxpayer dollars  would be going to the Taliban. It makes utterly no sense at all.  [[Page S6977]]    But we have spending that is literally out of control. The only time  I have ever heard a Democrat--most of the time, they are honest in that  they don't care about the debt. But the only time I have ever heard  them say anything about it is when they say: Well, you know, it happens  because you cut taxes.   Well, you know, it is verifiably false. You can go back to the Reagan  tax cuts, when the rates went from 70 to 50, and then from 50 to 28.   Do you know what happened?   The government got more revenue because, when you tax people less,  when you let them keep more of their own money, guess what. Their  incentives to produce go up, and the economy grows by leaps and bounds.  So when Reagan cut taxes dramatically, the economy responded and grew  tremendously.   When we cut taxes in 2017, it was the same thing. It was the same  thing: Revenue didn't go down. Revenue went up.   So how did the deficit get worse? Why did the deficit get worse? Was  it because we cut taxes in 2017?   No. It was because we piled on the money. We just were spending money  like there was no tomorrow.   So, before we got to the extraordinary times we have now, where  everything is about COVID and we are just going to spend money like  there is no tomorrow, we were borrowing $1 trillion a year. The main  segments of government--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, food  stamps, other welfare, and military--probably comprise three-fourths or  more of government.   If you look at that on an annual basis, before you get to the  extraordinary binge over the last 2 years, we were already $1 trillion  short every year--$1 trillion short. So, last year, we added a couple  trillion more, and our deficit for the year--for 1 year--was $3  trillion. We have never, ever borrowed that much.   There are going to be ramifications. You are already seeing some of  the ramifications. You are seeing the prices in the grocery store go  up; you are seeing the prices at the pump go up; you are seeing  sometimes wages go up. But you are also seeing prices rising faster  than wages, which often happens in an inflationary cycle.   Some people have trouble comprehending these numbers.   What is a billion? What is a trillion?   Reagan had an analogy he did. He said: If you want to know how big  ``a billion'' is, take thousand-dollar bills and put them in your hand,  and when you have them about 4-inches high, you have got $1 million.  But if you want to know how much or how tall a stack of $1,000 would be  if you had $1 trillion, it would be 60 miles high--over 60 miles high.   That is what kind of money we are talking about. That was to get to a  trillion.   So we have $1 trillion of institutional debt that is added every  year, but now we are talking about a time when they are talking about  adding, in one bill, $3.5 trillion. The bill that they have before us  has $1 billion in spending for every page. Every page of the bill has  an extra billion dollars in spending. It is extraordinary. We have  never, ever seen anything like this.    What happens when a country destroys its currency?   We have examples in history. In Germany, in 1923, the money was  starting to lose its value in about September. A loaf of bread might  have cost 100 mark when, before, it cost 1 mark. Two weeks later, it  was 1,000 marks, but then 2 weeks later, it was 10,000 marks, and then  it was a million, and then it was several million. This happened in a  2-month period of time.   People say: Oh, when it comes, when the currency unravels, it will be  gradual.   In Germany, it happened in a 2-month period.   In Venezuela, the currency is completely worthless. It is the same in  Germany. It is almost better to burn your currency for fuel or warmth  than it is to spend it. This is what happens when you have runaway  spending and out-of-control deficits. Venezuela is one of the richest  countries in South America. They have more oil underground than Saudi  Arabia, but, frankly, socialism doesn't work. Socialism is this borrow  and spend. It has this alarming tendency to want to offer everybody  everything and say it is going to be free. Many of these things  backfire.   For the last year, we have been saying: Oh, gosh. We feel sorry for  workers, so we are going to pay them while they are unemployed.   But guess what. If you pay them more than the market wage, more of  them will choose unemployment, and more of them will choose  unemployment, and more of them will stay unemployed for a longer period  of time. We found this out in the 2008 recession.   During the 2008 recession, we extended unemployment. It is normally  26 weeks, paid for by a tax, and it largely works within the confines  of a State-run program. We extended it to 99 weeks--almost 2 years.   But do you know what the studies found?   This is part of the syndrome we have around here. It is sort of the  ``big heart, small brain'' syndrome. I think many of these people want  to help people; they just don't understand that what they are doing is  actually hurting the same people they are trying to help.   So if you extend unemployment to 99 weeks, and then, all of a sudden,  the guy, at 99 weeks--or woman--says, ``I need to get a job,'' and they  go to the employer and say, ``I have been out of work for 99 weeks, and  I have been on unemployment,'' and the other person who is applying for  the job says, ``Well, I have been out of work for 10 weeks, and I am  looking for a job,'' who do you think the employer hires?   Every time, it is the person out of work for 10 weeks.   As for the person who hasn't worked for 99 weeks, they are like:  There might be something wrong here. We might have gotten to the point  where we have lost the work ethic.   So what have you done to the people who you try to help?   You have actually kept them out of the workplace so long that they  become unemployable.   After they become unemployable, what do they become?   They become the permanently unemployable, the nonworking part.   Do you wonder who this is?   Sixty-two percent of the country is in the workforce, and 38 percent  is not. These are people who are permanently out of the workforce.  These aren't people who can't work. These are just people who, for one  reason or another, are no longer in the workforce.   Now, some of them really can't work, and we have sympathy for that,  but many of them are people who just stayed out of work too long or  took the wrong incentives or became addicted to drugs or alcohol  because they weren't working.   So there are things we can do in our country, but if we are not  careful, it is going to slip away from us. I don't want our country to  be Venezuela, and I don't want our country to destroy its currency, but  what we are offering is a more difficult sell because the other side is  going to give you free college and free daycare and free cars and free  cell phones.   What we are offering is opportunity. What we are offering is the  freedom to try to strive. We are offering equality before the law, not  equality of outcome after you have done your work, after you have tried  to participate--equality before the law.   One of the interesting things that I think isn't often grasped by  people is that if you want equal outcomes, if you want everybody to be  the same and you want to equalize everybody, you actually have to treat  them unequally.   In our country, it took a while, but we have gotten to the point  where people truly believe in the concept of equality before the law.  But if you also want to believe in equal outcomes at the end, realize  you can't believe in both. They are mutually exclusive. You cannot  believe in equality before the law if you want equal outcomes.   If you want this so-called equity at the end, you want everybody to  be equal at the end, you have to treat them unequally because some  people are either born with more talent, born with more money, born  with more sense, luckier, work harder--there are a lot of reasons.   If you put 100 people in a room and you give them all 5 bucks, within  an hour, somebody will have more. Somebody had some cigarettes.  Somebody really wanted to smoke, and they have a dollar. The money  spreads around the room. They have done these experiments. Money  doesn't stay in one  [[Page S6978]]  place, but it is by and large, in a free society, based on work. But  once the government becomes in charge of things, it becomes less of a  meritocracy and becomes more of a society based on who you know.   There are rich people--don't get me wrong. When you look at  socialism, there are rich people: Maduro, Chavez, Castro--incredibly  rich people. They own their own islands. They have billions of dollars.  Their relatives are all rich.   So instead of a society mostly based on merit--we talk about the  greatness of America. One of the most important things about capitalism  and freedom and what happened in America is, for the first time, it  wasn't based on who you were; it wasn't based on royal lineage. For the  most part, Europe was, you know, longtime landowners and royalty, and a  very small percentage of the public did very well.   In fact, before 1820, before the Industrial Revolution, virtually  everybody in the world--96, 98 percent of the world lived in extreme  poverty. A bare subsistence level. Barely enough to eat. There was no  obesity because there was barely enough food. You just scraped by. That  was 98 percent of the world.   Fast-forward to today, after we have adopted what Adam Smith talked  about as far as trade, division of labor, and capitalism, do you know  what we have now? When you look at poverty--less than $2 a day in the  world--it is less than 10 percent of the world. You won't find this on  television. There is not going to be any good news on television or in  the newspaper. The poorest people in our country actually are  equivalent to the middle class in most countries. We are a huge  success, but we are a country misguided and led astray by media that  aren't honest.   For example, if you watched CNN, you would think that nobody is  getting vaccinated, and it is a complete disaster, and, whoa, we are  stuck in this rut because no one is vaccinated. It is completely  untrue. Over 90 percent of people over 65, who are the most vulnerable,  are vaccinated. Now, sure, there are a lot of younger people who aren't  vaccinated, and there are some older people, but 90 percent is a pretty  good success. Over age 50, it is like 75, 80 percent of people. People  are informed. They know this is a disease that can affect any age but  affects primarily the older ages.   For example, the one truth you won't be told is that an 85-year-old  has a 10,000 times greater chance of dying than a 10-year-old. Now, you  think we should treat them the same? If you were their doctor, do you  think a 10-year-old should get the same healthcare and the same  prescriptions for what they need to do as an 85-year-old? That makes no  sense at all.   I see 10-year-olds and I see 5-year-olds out on the Mall--my wife and  I were walking down to the Lincoln Memorial the other day, and I saw 5- year-olds in groups, led by teachers, wearing masks outside. There is  no science to that.   We have Dr. Fauci spreading mistruths across the country, saying we  have to forcibly vaccinate the kids? There is no science behind any of  that. In fact, England is rejecting what we are doing. In England,  because of the age skew, because of what they are seeing--that the  people most at risk are of an older age--they are actually saying:  Instead of forcibly vaccinating children, why don't we try to make the  vaccine doses available for the elderly? Why don't we target our care  to those who are at highest risk?   We have a problem in our country. We have people who have so  politicized science that there are people struggling and dying every  day because they have never heard about monoclonal antibodies. We have  people dying every day because the government, at the behest of Dr.  Fauci and a few other people, has said: You can't get monoclonal  antibodies if you are in the hospital.   I talk to people every day who really have not yet heard of  monoclonal antibodies, who get COVID again after being fully vaccinated  or sometimes not being vaccinated and are not getting the treatment  because Dr. Fauci says: If you are in the hospital, you don't get it.    So we have medicine that is coming from on high, from a central  authority like the politburo, and doctors are afraid to prescribe. This  has never happened in our country before. Doctors were able to make  their own decisions based on their own experience, based on studies,  based on real-life examples, but using their own discretion. Now  doctors are afraid to prescribe monoclonal antibodies, and many of them  are disallowed from prescribing it to an inpatient.   Realize the ridiculous nature of that. You are in the emergency room.  You are sick, and you are coughing. You might be dying from COVID. You  get to the emergency room. You don't know what to say. You can barely  talk. Your spouse has to be able to tell the doctor ``Please stop'' in  an emergency room. Give them the monoclonal antibodies before they are  admitted because once they are admitted, we won't treat them. It is the  same way with symptoms. You have to have symptoms within the first 10  days. If you don't have symptoms--if you are on day 11, you won't get  monoclonal antibodies. It is completely arbitrary, it is capricious,  and it has to do with government-mandated guidelines.   Let's take some of the other truths or mistruths that are out there.   I have said over and over again that cloth masks don't work because  they don't. Peer-reviewed studies have shown time and time again that  cloth masks don't work. But when Dr. Fauci tells you that all masks  work, when he comes in all draped with three masks on himself with  little insignias, clever insignias of different sports teams, he is  actually spreading a mistruth that causes lives to be lost.   Why? Let's say you have a 75-year-old woman and she gets COVID, and  her husband is taking care of her. Do you think the advice to go into  the room to feed her, bathe her, help her get in and out of her clothes  while she is sick, while wearing a cloth mask is a good idea or a bad  idea? It is malpractice. Yet, for some reason, the leftwing media has  lauded this man as the second coming, and what he is telling you is  absolutely verifiably dangerous to your health.   The only mask that really works of any real value is the N95 mask.  The surgical masks have some value but not very much. Most of the air  is going around the mask. They just aren't of value. But you have to  submit. The man is telling you to do it; you got to do what you got to  do. But the thing is, when you tell people something is safe, they tend  to react to that and have behavior, and in their behavior, they are in  favor of something that may well actually be risky behavior for them.   The vaccinations--because we ignore natural immunity, we directed the  vaccine to the wrong people and still are. For example, because of Dr.  Fauci's lead--India is accepting his lead as well, and India does not  have enough vaccine. They have a billion people. They can't vaccinate  enough people fast enough. So if you have a billion people and you have  200 million doses of vaccine, who do you think you should give it to?  Should you give it to the 10-year-old the same as the 85-year-old? No.  That is ridiculous. But what about two 65-year-olds and one of them has  had COVID and one of them hasn't?   The studies are plentiful. The studies are throughout that say that  if you have already had it, you have natural immunity to COVID, as good  or better than the vaccine.   Do you think it makes good public health policy to say that everybody  who is 65 should get it instead of saying: Have you had it? Why don't  we check you for antibodies if you think you have had it? Maybe you  should wait until we have vaccinated every 65-year-old who doesn't have  immunity.   These are real things. These are real discussions. But if you have  these, unless it is on the Senate floor--actually, that is not even  true. You can say this on the Senate floor, and YouTube will take it  down. I have had it happen. I have given speeches on the floor that  YouTube takes down.   So this is a world in which people need to realize and get back to  the ideas of classical liberalism where we debated things. Classical  liberalism was about skepticism; it was about you having your opinion  and me having my opinion. But the difference between the elitist or the  collectivist point of view and the individual right point of view is, I  believe you have every right to your opinion.   But if you are a collectivist and you believe that, from the very top  down, all medical decisions come from Dr. Fauci, and if he doesn't want  you to  [[Page S6979]]  fly, you don't get to fly--see, it is different from individual liberty  because I think if you have a differing opinion, you are welcome to  your opinion.   If an airline has a policy I don't like, maybe I choose not to fly,  but the idea that we are going to restrict everyone's behavior based on  what they decide to do--what is next? People eat too many  cheeseburgers. We are not going to give them a heart stent because we  think they haven't behaved and haven't listened to the doctors on what  they should be eating?   There is no end to this. But in the end, if we are not careful, we  are going to spend this country into oblivion. COVID is a big cause of  the extra spending we have now, but I can tell you, there are  ramifications that are coming quick. They are coming in the form of  higher prices. But there is no reason in the world for us to default.  We have plenty of money. We should simply pay for the interest based on  what comes in every month.   With that, I would like to reserve my time and turn it over.    Sure.    I guess ``surprised'' is not the word I would choose; I  would say disappointed.   You know, the tea party movement--we had 100,000 people on the Mall  out there. People were concerned about the debt. They were concerned  about constitutional government.   I remember you and I meeting for the first time and talking about how  we needed to reverse some of these terrible precedents that had allowed  government to grow large and that the courts need to reform government,  as well as government be reformed from its elected officials.   But, yes, we had a great debate that summer. In the summer of 2011,  we said we wouldn't raise the debt ceiling without reform.    Without any reform.    Yes. I remember when, a couple of years after that, we  actually became that--our economy was equal to our debt. So the gross  domestic product--how much everything is worth that is produced in the  whole country--was about 17 or 18 billion at the time, as the debt sort  of crossed that.   We are now, depending on how you measure it, some say at like 140  percent of our GDP, and the interesting thing is, that is about where  Greece was when Greece began to declare its bankruptcy and was unable  to pay its bills.   It is alarming. It is foolish and unwise for us to say: Oh, there are  no consequences. I think there will be consequences, and the No. 1  thing that we are seeing now is inflation.    Yes. And I think that you are right. Having the world's  currency allows us--you know, many countries trade in dollars. You will  go into marketplaces all around the world, and what they are actually  exchanging is dollars. So as we have bought more goods than we have  exported, we import more than we export, we paid for that in dollars.  Some have described that as being able to export our inflation.   People have also said: Well, the dollar isn't perfect. It is a fiat  currency. It is being inflated.   But everybody else is so bad that we are sort of the cleanest shirt  in a closet full of dirty shirts.   So, yes, I think being the reserve currency has allowed us to last  longer, but there are immutable rules of economics that eventually  catch up to a country, and I think we approach those. I don't think  anybody can predict exactly when we get there, but I think we are  approaching a time--and it may not be a gradual unraveling. You know,  if you look back at the history of our marketplace, we have had these  black swan events. We have had these events where the marketplace, in 7  or 8 days in our history, most of the losses have happened  calamitously.   Even in 2011, when the market went down, there was a debate. They  said: Oh, it is because we risked the debt ceiling.   Well, many of us thought that the marketplace went down at that time  because we actually continued to borrow without reforming the process.    It is based on faith, and so when does the faith end? Faith  is not something particularly--it is hard to determine faith in the  dollar. One way you can determine it is, will people buy our bonds. One  of the indications that people lose faith in our currency is that when,  to borrow money, you see your bond prices rise; you see interest prices  rise. I think that is coming.   You know, we are already seeing inflation at a 5-percent rate.  Typically, you will see the interest rates rise as well. And there is  going to be a time there are going to be repercussions. I fully believe  that you cannot continue to borrow at this rate without ultimately  suffering, perhaps, an economic calamity. And I want to stop that for  our country.    Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week, I recognize an  outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Clear Cut Phocus, LLC of Louisville, KY, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Growing up in Louisville, John Mittel dreamed of being a doctor. As a  competitive swimmer, he developed an interest in health and fitness.  John's passion for innovation and engineering led him to the University  of Louisville, where he earned a bachelor of science in industrial  engineering. John then enrolled at the University of Louisville School  of Medicine to pursue his childhood dream. Like many students, John  relied on coffee, energy drinks, and soda for a caffeine boost. One  night, during a late-night study session, John thought, Why not just  put caffeine in water? Over the next 2 years, he worked with his  mentor, Tom O'Grady, to turn that idea into a business. They spent most  of 2016 developing their brand and fine-tuning the Phocus formula,  launching their product in 2017. After graduating from medical school  in 2018, John deferred his residency in ophthalmology to continue  building his company.   Today, Phocus is a thriving small business providing consumers  nationwide a healthy alternative to the traditional energy drink.  Headquartered in Louisville, Phocus recently celebrated its fourth  anniversary. To date, Phocus has developed 11 flavors of sparkling and  regular water infused with caffeine extracted from green tea,  electrolytes, and the amino acid L-theanine. Unlike traditional energy  drinks, Phocus beverages have zero calories and are free of sweeteners,  sodium, and additives. Phocus beverages are available at several  regional and national retailers and are featured in over 200 corporate  offices across America. In 2020, Phocus Cola was named the Best New  Product at BevNET's Best of 2020 Awards.   Like many small business owners, John and Tom are actively involved  in their community. Locally, Phocus regularly supports community  organizations, including the Louisville City Football Club's youth  soccer clinics and the American Junior Golf Association's Justin Thomas  Junior Championship. During the holiday season, Phocus has teamed up  with ESPN Louisville for its ``Cram the Van'' toy and clothing drive  for children in need. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company donated  200,000 cans of Phocus to 472 hospitals and healthcare facilities  across 40 States. In May of 2021, their ``Buy One. Gift One. A Case for  Teachers.'' program donated cases of Phocus to teachers nationwide in  recognition of Teacher Appreciation Month. Phocus's community  involvement, success, and products have been profiled in local and  national outlets, including WDRB, WAVE3, Louisville Courier-Journal,  Louisville Business Journal, MarketWatch, Fox News, and CNBC.   Clear Cut Phocus, LLC is a remarkable example of the resilience and  adaptability of locally owned small businesses. Small businesses, like  Phocus, form the heart of towns across Kentucky and play a critical  role in Kentucky's beverage industry. Congratulations to John, Tom, and  the entire team at Phocus. I wish them the best of luck, and I look  forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky, and  beyond.                            ____________________
