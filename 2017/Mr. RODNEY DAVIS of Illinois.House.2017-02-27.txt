 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  former Congressman, respected mentor, and good friend Bob Michel.   Bob was a war hero earning two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart, and  four battle stars. He was also one of the most respected members of  Congress of all time. His 38 years of service in the U.S. House of  Representatives and the incredible footprint he left on Central  Illinois and this country will never be forgotten.   Bob's ability to reach across the aisle to make a divided government  work for the people he represented was second to none, a trait we  should all strive to emulate each day. Bob taught me that  bipartisanship matters and working together to get things done is even  more important in the polarized environment we have today. That's where  Bob Michel excelled and that's the legacy I'm going to remember.   Finally, Bob taught me to be myself, to always do what I think is  right for my constituents, and to not be afraid to go home and explain  why I voted the way I did. I was honored to attend Bob's funeral this  past Saturday, along with many others who knew and loved him. My  thoughts and prayers are with his family. He will truly be missed.                            ____________________
