 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chairman and his  extraordinary leadership on this important topic.   I rise today to urge support for this broad, bipartisan reform  package which expands and modernizes the GI Bill to better serve our  military families. The bill includes a bipartisan proposal that I have  worked on with Congressman Mark Takano of California to help veteran  students impacted by school closures, like ITT Tech and Corinthian  Colleges, based in our home States.  [[Page H6169]]    When ITT Tech abruptly closed its doors, 40,000 students nationwide,  including 7,000 veterans, were left without a degree or path forward.  Jason Nyikos, a U.S. Navy veteran from Greenfield, Indiana, in my  district, had to start his degree completely from scratch after  spending 2 years at ITT Tech. Not a single credit transferred, and his  GI Bill is going to run out before he can get a new degree. He told my  office: ``To spend 2 years of my life at a place with nothing to show  for it is one of the biggest disappointments.''   Jason's story is, sadly, one of thousands. It is not fair to these  veterans that they would lose their GI benefits through no fault of  their own, and if we really care, we need to do something about it.   The Takano-Messer proposal restores GI Bill benefits to veterans who  were attending ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges when they closed so  they can earn their degrees elsewhere. It also helps veterans who may  be impacted by a school closure in the future.   Our military men and women count on their GI Bill benefits to build a  career and a life after they have served our country. This bill will  make sure they get a chance.   Madam Speaker, I urge your support and again thank the chairman for  his efforts on this important issue and all of the reforms in this  bill.
