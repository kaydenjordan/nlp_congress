 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a woman- owned small business that provides an enriching environment for  children and serves a diverse community. This week, it is my pleasure  to honor Best Memories Academy of Orlando, FL, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   For 20 years, Best Memories Academy has provided quality childcare  for families in Orlando, FL. When her son was 2 years old, Lyana  Vazquez, originally from Puerto Rico, began searching for a daycare  program that would provide instruction in English and Spanish, but  options were limited in the Orlando area. Undeterred, Lyana founded  Best Memories Academy, to provide daycare and preschool programs with  an emphasis on bilingual education.  [[Page S3012]]    Over the years, Best Memories Academy has expanded its services.  Lyana developed a bilingual curriculum and built strong relationships  with Orlando's growing Latino community. She hired educators who spoke  English and Spanish, incorporating the LENA Grow Program into their  training. This research-based program enabled staff to begin  conversational language teaching during critical stages of language  learning. In 2019, Best Memories Academy began offering kindergarten  and first grade instruction in addition to voluntary prekindergarten  and after-school care. They partnered with the Early Learning Coalition  of Orange County, ELCOC, to host educational workshops and community  outreach events, becoming one of the premier daycare centers in the  area.   Like many other small businesses, Best Memories Academy experienced a  sharp decline in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. As student  enrollment dropped, Lyana modified her business operations to comply  with the latest best practices from the Center for Disease Control,  Florida Department of Health, and Florida Department of Children and  Families. Together, she and her team assembled and dropped remote- learning packets for students, taking special care with the materials  for children whose families lacked internet access. Despite the  challenges, Lyana was determined to stay open to care for the children  of essential workers and keep her employees paid.   When the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program PPP, Lyana immediately applied. The PPP provides  forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and nonprofits who  maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine days after  she submitted an application, Best Memories Academy received funding  for a PPP loan in early April. As a result, Lyana was able to keep her  12 employees paid and keep her business open until Florida began to  reopen and students returned. For Lyana and her team, the Paycheck  Protection Program didn't just provide a salary--it provided hope.   Best Memories Academy is a notable example of the role of  relationship-driven small businesses in building community. I commend  their work to provide high-quality bilingual education to children  ranging from infancy to elementary school. Congratulations to Lyana and  the entire team at Best Memories Academy. I look forward to watching  your continued growth and success in the Orlando area.                            ____________________
