 Mr. Speaker, my friend from Maryland makes an excellent  closing case in court, because he knows that this is going to be in  court, because he knows that this is constitutionally infirm. He is  trying to make the case that is going to have to be made in court on  the losing side of the argument, because it is very clearly  unconstitutional to add D.C. as a State by statute.   And what we have here today is a simple question: Does anybody in  this room believe that if Lubbock, Texas, had been set up as the  Capital seat of the United States of America, that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle would be arguing to give it the position of  statehood?   No, of course not.   This city was set up by the Founders to be the Capital seat of the  United States of America. It was not set up to be a State. And when my  friend said that every other State has been added by statute, none of  those have been specifically set up as the Capital seat of the United  States of America.   This should be rejected. It is unconstitutional. D.C. has never been  a State. It shouldn't be a State, and it is not going to be a State.
