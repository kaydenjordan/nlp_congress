 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3237.   While I support some of its provisions, I have strong concerns about  many items included in this bill and the manner by which the majority  has crafted it.   As the Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I  am strongly supportive of the reimbursement to the National  [[Page H2630]]  Guard for the costs incurred due to their extended deployment in  support of Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies. We need  to reimburse them as soon as possible to avoid having to cancel drill  weekend and other training.   Our Guardsmen and women have patriotically taken time away from their  families, careers, and communities to protect our nation's capital. I,  along with my colleagues, thank them for their service.   However, I am strongly opposed to the majority's proposal to stand up  a Quick Reaction Force comprised of the D.C. National Guard.   While Congress should consider the creation of a form of a Quick  Reaction Force, it should be comprised of law enforcement, not  military. They are better suited and have training that is more  specific to this mission.   Like much of this bill, the majority has hastily crafted this concept  in a partisan manner without thinking through all of the ramifications.  Our subcommittee has held no hearings on this issue. This issue  deserves a much more thoughtful and deliberate approach.   I also echo my colleagues concerns about the funding proposed to  create physical barriers around the Capitol complex. The extended  duration of the fencing has been entirely unnecessary. Continuing this  into the future is expensive, misguided, and is unfair to the American  people--who deserve access to their Nation's Capital.   For these reasons and others, I urge my colleagues to vote no.
