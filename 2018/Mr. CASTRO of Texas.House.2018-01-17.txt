 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I speak tonight on the issue of the  DACA program.   In 2012, President Obama issued an executive action to allow 800,000  young people, known as DACA kids, to remain in the United States. These  are young immigrants who were brought here at an early age by their  parents, people who had no choice in whether to come to the United  States, but, for many, this is the only home and only Nation they have  ever known.   These young people now face the threat of deportation if Congress  does not act as soon as possible. And certainly, by March 5, 800,000  young people will become subject to deportation. Already, there has  been a cost to Congress' inaction. Every day, 122 of these folks become  subject to deportation.   We all understand in this body the long history of immigration to the  United States and the incredible contributions that immigrants from  around the world have made to our Nation. These are people from  Germany, Ireland, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. From literally every  corner of the globe, people have come here lending their talents, their  energy, their creativity, and their passion to making sure that the  United States remains the greatest Nation on Earth. That is the case  with the DACA kids.   Today, I am joined by several of my colleagues who are going to share  some stories about DACA recipients, their lives, and the contributions  they are making in our American communities and in American life.   But before I yield to my first colleague, I want to run through, for  a minute, the requirements for somebody to be a DACA recipient. This  has sometimes been, obviously, a very passionate, sometimes heated  debate about what should happen with the DACA recipients and whether  the Congress should even commit itself to coming up with a DACA  solution. Whether it is people making comments on television or  sometimes comments you read online, it is clear that there is a lot of  misinformation out there--sometimes, willful misinformation--about who  these people are.   So I want to read real quickly the requirements for somebody to be a  DACA recipient.                                time  1815    First, they were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012.   Second, they came to the United States before reaching their 16th  birthday.   Third, they have continuously resided in the United States since June  15, 2007, up to the present time.   Fourth, they were physically present in the United States on June 15,  2012, and at the time of making the request for consideration of  deferred action with USCIS.   Fifth, they had no lawful status on June 15, 2012.   Sixth, they are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a  certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general  equivalency development--GED--certificate, or are an honorably  discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United  States.   And, seventh, they have not been convicted of a felony, significant  misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and did not otherwise pose  a threat to national security or public safety.   This addresses two of the common questions or, sometimes, criticisms  that you hear about the DACA program, which, first, is the idea that  some of these folks are criminals. Well, it makes very clear in these  requirements that that cannot be the case.   And then, second, this idea that, hey, these folks, if they wanted  to, they could have just become citizens. Again, number five was: had  no lawful status on June 15, 2012, when the program commenced.   These are energetic, hardworking folks that we can be very proud of  who are making significant contributions to American society.   Congress must act--and we should act this week--to come up with a  DACA solution, to make sure that no more of these kids are subject to  deportation, that their lives are no longer left in the balance, and  that their futures are secure. These are folks who are in college, who  have graduated and have gone into different fields, different  professions, teachers and many other different professions that are  represented by the DACA students now. Congress must act to make sure  that they can stay in the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, before I bring up my next  colleague, Congresswoman Barragan talked about the incredible DREAMers,  DACA recipients that are in her district, and I have many in my  district. I represent a very large city in Texas, the city of San  Antonio--I have the main San Antonio district--and you can imagine that  we have our fair share of DACA recipients in San Antonio.   I want to read, really quickly, the story of just one of them. Her  name is Lisa.   Lisa is a first-generation American who immigrated to the United  States from Canada in October 1996 at the age of 6. Lisa learned she  had, unknowingly, overstayed her visa on December 19, 2010, just a day  after the DREAM Act stalled in the Senate, when she received, in the  mail, a notice to appear in immigration court, which is the first step  in deportation proceedings.   She went to elementary, middle, and high school in San Antonio.  During that time, she was a Girl Scout, logged more than 700 hours of  community service during her high school years, and spearheaded a  fundraiser that raised $10,000 to help pay for the bone marrow  transplant of a young leukemia patient whom she had never met.   In 2008, she graduated from a San Antonio high school with summa cum  laude honors, ranking in the top 6 percent of her class. She spent the  summer working as a congressional intern for the United States House of  Representatives, right here--for my predecessor, Charlie Gonzalez-- before heading to Northwestern University to study journalism and  political science. Lisa was sitting at her college graduation ceremony  on the day that President Obama announced the DACA program, June 15,  2012.    Her work permit has enabled her to take out a mortgage, buy a car,  get a job, pay taxes, renew her driver's license, and repay six  figures--about $114,000--of student loans used to fund her Northwestern  University degree.   Today, Lisa is a communications associate at a nonprofit. As a  reporter, Lisa's work has been published in The Washington Post,  Huffington Post, San Antonio Express-News, Boulder Daily Camera, The  Denver Post, and several other places. Her story is just one story of  the incredible folks who are part of the DACA program that are  contributing to the greatness of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres).    Mr. Speaker, the Congresswoman was talking about  the support for DACA, and it is true that surveys consistently show  that the American people support the DACA kids at about 83 percent or  so. That is an incredible, overwhelming majority support for this  program.   She mentioned the possible tradeoff. There has been this argument  that we should pass a clean Dream Act, for example, which is a DACA  fix, and whether it should be paired with anything else, like, if we  are going to pass a DACA bill, what is the price to pay for that? That  is the common debate. What is the President, or what is the majority,  going to demand for that?   But as Congresswoman Torres mentioned, I would just point out that  that 83 percent support among the American people is not 83 percent  only if you build a wall. The American people don't say: We support the  DACA kids, but only if you build a wall across the United States of  America. They say: We support the DACA kids, and we want to make sure  that those kids can stay and continue to live in the United States of  America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Congressman  Costa, for his remarks. He made several very important points. One of  them was the economic benefits of the DREAMer population, the DACA  population, on their communities and how not only for California and  his district, but for so many other parts of the country where you do  have DACA recipients, it would be a real economic blow to deport these  folks, to uproot them from the communities and simply get them out of  here. It would be an economic blow to the economies of those cities and  towns and States and, of course, to our Nation.   The second thing that I thought was very important is really the  human element that right now, as you can imagine, these 800,000 young  people are watching the United States Congress. Their parents, their  brothers, their sisters, everybody who loves them realizes that their  future hangs in the balance. They are living in fear and incredible  anxiety wondering whether they are going to be allowed to stay in what  is for most of them the only place they have ever known as home.   It would be like deciding that I am going to go live in Egypt or live  in Uruguay or anywhere else. I simply have no connection to those  places as home.   That is what these young people are facing if this Congress refuses  to act. That is what they are facing now.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being a  champion on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Soto for his  wonderful words. He also brought up a few important things that I think  we need to remember.   The first is this issue of DREAMers, or undocumented immigrants, is  often in the American debate reduced to the idea that all of these  folks are Mexican or from Mexico, when, in fact, it is actually a very  diverse group of folks who are in the category of DREAMers or who are  part of the DACA program.   So I would like to ask Mr. Soto to describe the community that he  represents around Orlando and some of the different groups that are  represented in the DACA program.     Mr. Speaker, there are people of European  descent, of Asian descent, certainly of Latin American descent, and of  African descent who are part of the DACA program. So I am glad that the  gentleman went through the variety, the diversity of the people in his  area who are part of this program.   Now, bear in mind, my grandmother was from Mexico. My grandmother  came here around 1922 as a 6-year-old orphan. I remember a few years  back, this professional genealogist for a publication looked at my  family's history because we had never formally looked it up, and she  found the documents of when my grandmother came to the country. I  remember there was a box in the form that said, ``Purpose.'' In other  words, the purpose for why she was coming. And it said, ``To live.''   I mean, that is how easy it was back then around 1922 to come to the  United States, to live in this Nation.                                time  1845    It obviously has become much tougher since then. It just speaks to  the wonderful, incredible diversity of people who have come here from  different places around the world.   And then Congressman Soto mentioned one other important thing, which  is the historical context by which we find ourselves in this place.  When you think about it, there is this intense debate going on right  now and this incredible push to do a DACA fix by the end of the week,  hopefully; and a lot of people, I think, who may not have followed the  volleying and the back and forth for a while are wondering why this is  such a crisis now.   We know the immediate answer, which is, if we get to March 5, there  are 800,000 of these young people who will be deportable, subject to  deportation, who are part of the DACA program. Already, every day that  passes, 122 more become deportable.   There was an opportunity a few years ago to deal not only with this  part of the immigration issue, but to achieve what is called  comprehensive immigration reform. And by ``comprehensive,'' that just  means that you are dealing not just with one part of immigration, but  you are dealing with all of the different issues associated with  immigration.   So it was DACA, but it was also issues with visas, like tech visas  and agricultural workers. It was dealing with the parents of the  DREAMers, for example.   And that bill that passed through the Senate with 68 votes, a wide  majority in the Senate in 2014, it came over to the House and, based on  public reports and what the Members of Congress had stated their  support would be for or against that bill, there was a majority, over  218 Members--again, based on public reports; we never took the vote,  but based on public reports--who said that they basically would have  supported a bill like that.   At the time, Speaker Boehner refused to put that bill on the floor  for a vote because of something called a Hastert rule. The Hastert rule  is basically an informal rule that says that the Speaker of the House  won't put a piece of legislation on the floor for a vote unless that  piece of legislation already has the support of a majority of the  majority. And at that time, the piece of legislation, even though it  probably had 225 or 230 supporters in Congress, a clear majority to  pass, didn't have over 50 percent support of the Republican Conference,  which represented the majority party.   Now, my last point on this, and I know you know this, but when a  Speaker governs with the Hastert rule, oftentimes the will of the  majority is ignored in this House of Representatives, but it also does  something very insidious. It allows about 25 percent of this body to  control 100 percent of the legislation that comes through here.   So I thank the gentleman for bringing up the history and the context  because this Congress and this country missed an incredible opportunity  in 2014 to deal not only with the DACA issue, but also with the many  other issues associated with immigration. So I thank Congressman Soto.   Now I yield to Congressman Correa, a wonderful new Member from  California, and welcome him.  [[Page H461]]         I thank Congressman Correa. He is right. The  DACA kids are going to school with our kids, are going to college with  our kids, are in our workplaces. They are people who are contributing  and whose futures hang in the balance, depending on what this Congress  does or does not do.    Certainly.    He is right. And they are part of a long legacy  of immigrants to this country.   The United States has this paradoxical history when it comes to  immigration. We are, of course, very proudly a nation of immigrants,  but each wave of immigrants has also faced its own bouts with  discrimination.   When the Germans came here in the 1800s, they were said by some to be  too dirty to be considered Americans. The Irish were greeted in cities  like Boston and New York with signs that read ``NINA,'' no Irish need  apply, for the jobs that were available. The Chinese were excluded from  our country for decades.   During World War II and the frenzy that ensued, Japanese Americans,  but also Italian Americans and German Americans, were interned,  including in my home State of Texas.   In every generation Americans have also stood up and changed course  and become more welcoming for each of those groups, and I believe that,  in this generation, in this time, this is part of that shift, for  Congress to finally address this issue head-on and fully welcome these  DACA kids as Americans and pass legislation to do that.   I thank Congressman Correa for his words.   I yield to Congressman Suozzi, from the other side of the country,  the wonderful State of New York, a freshman Congressman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman for sharing  his dad's life story and what this country meant to him and the  importance of coming up with a solution, a fix, as soon as possible.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for reminding  us of something that is often lost in this conversation and debate,  which is the fundamental humanity of the people that we are talking  about. Whether they have a green card, whether they are documented or  undocumented, the fact that we are talking about the lives of human  beings, too often that is lost in what is sometimes a contentious  debate.    There is no question that for a lot of them, as  you talk to them, you can see what a soul-crushing experience it is,  and, as your dad wrote in his yearbook, I think many of these kids have  the same feeling. They want to be fully accepted as real Americans,  which they obviously feel part of this country, feel like it is home,  but are not sure whether America accepts them.    Mr. Speaker, just to make some closing remarks  before I yield back the balance of my time, Congress has to take action  now. We can't wait any longer for another 122 DREAMers every day, DACA  recipients, to become subject to deportation, and certainly can't get  to March where 800,000 of the DACA kids will lose their futures in  America and become subject to deportation.   The issue of immigration and border security, all of these things are  among the thorniest issues in American life no matter where you go in  the country.   But we are a nation of immigrants, and this is one way that we will  gauge the soul of this Congress and of this Nation and determine  whether we are going to continue to live up to the Nation that we  strive to be, which is a nation of immigrants, of people from different  countries who have made such a beautiful, incredible, strong and  powerful nation, have crafted that Nation together.   And I would just remind those who are against the DACA kids, who  would argue for inaction, who argue that they should get the hell out  of here, that this country has been blessed throughout the generations  that people from every corner on Earth have wanted to come to the  United States of America. Fifty years ago, if you asked somebody who  was living in Europe or Asia or Latin America or anywhere else around  the world where on Earth they would want to go if they were going to  leave their home country, the answer 50 years ago was very clearly the  United States of America.   There is a scarier day in this country than the day when everybody  wants to come here. That is the day when nobody wants to come here. The  challenge for all of us as legislators and basically as Americans is to  make sure that when you ask that same question of somebody 50 years  from now who is living abroad where on Earth they would want to go if  they were going to leave their home country, that they still feel  comfortable believing it is the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
