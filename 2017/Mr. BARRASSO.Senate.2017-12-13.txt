 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the tax relief and tax reduction legislation that the conference  committee is currently working on. To me and to all Americans, this is  a very important piece of legislation. I think it is going to get even  better as the House and the Senate work to hammer out the differences  to help lower the tax rates for American families.   When you look at this legislation, there are so many policies that  will help to make America's economy grow. Families across the country  will get a tax break. It is what they need. It is what they have been  looking for, for a long time. Main Street businesses will also get a  tax break. When people get a raise like that, they invest in their  families, and they invest in their communities. They create jobs. Wages  go up. The economy grows, and our Nation gets stronger.   You don't have to take my word for it. Respected mainstream  economists are saying exactly the same thing. They agree that our  economy needs to grow. They agree that the legislation we are working  on--which passed the Senate, passed the House, and is being joined  together--will deliver the growth that our Nation needs.   In October the Council of Economic Advisers put out a report looking  at some of the ideas for tax relief. This is a group that advises the  President on economic issues. Their report found that the tax plan,  like the one Republicans wrote, will grow the economy between 3 percent  and 5 percent. That is real growth. It is strong growth, and it is good  news for America.   There was another study that came out in October. That was by a group  of  [[Page S7993]]  economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston  University. They did their own calculations and used their own numbers,  and they found the exact same good news for the American economy. Just  like the other report, this one said that the Republican tax plan would  grow the economy by between 3 percent and 5 percent.   A third study was released in November. It was by the Tax Foundation.  Again, it is a respected group of economists who study this kind of  issue for a living. They looked specifically at the legislation as it  was introduced in the Senate Finance Committee and, then, passing the  Senate. This group found that the plan would increase the size of the  economy by 3.7 percent. That is the same range, between 3 and 5  percent, but more specifically, 3.7 percent.   Then, there was a fourth analysis by one more group of nine respected  independent economists. This group wrote about their conclusions in a  letter to the Treasury Secretary on November 26. They wrote that they  expect this tax relief plan to boost the economy by 3 percent over the  next 10 years.   We have four different entities, four different estimates, four  different groups of prominent economists. They looked at the tax relief  plan. They looked at it in different ways and used different analyses,  and they all found that it would grow the American economy by very  similar amounts, all by at least 3 percent.   There was one other study that some people have been talking about.  This was an estimate by a group called the Joint Committee on Taxation.  This group predicts that growth under the Republican plan will  increase, but by just 0.8 percent over those next 10 years. That works  out, roughly, to eight one-hundredths of 1 percent a year. All of these  other groups say at least 3 percent, maybe 5 percent, and this other  group says less than 1 percent over a decade. It is hard to believe.   Why is this one group, which is being quoted often by the Democrats,  so far out of line, out of the mainstream, with what other economists  are saying? The reason they reached such a different conclusion is that  they did their analysis very differently from all the other groups.  This committee combines a few different economic models into their  estimate. That is reasonable. When we look closely at the models they  combined, we found that they counted the most pessimistic models much  more heavily than they did the more realistic models. So, of course,  they are going to come up with an overly pessimistic conclusion.   I think it can be useful to take these more negative views into  account. Nobody thinks we should just pick from the rosiest scenario or  base our policies on one prediction. That is not what is happening  here. We have four different groups of economists that predict strong  economic growth of at least 3 percent. The one outlier is much more  pessimistic, much more cautious.   Another thing to remember is that even this very cautious estimate  says that the economy will get bigger because of the Republican plan  than if we did nothing at all. Even the pessimistic group is saying:  Oh, yes, the economy will grow under the Republican plan. They say it  will reduce deficits by an additional $400 billion over the next 10  years.   I think we are going to do a whole lot better than that because our  economy is going to grow much faster. Under President Obama and  Washington Democrats, we had 8 years of policies that held back our  economy and caused it to grow at a very tepid, slow pace. Economists  looked at these policies, and they said that if things continue on that  path, we can expect the economy to grow by about the 1.8 percent we  have been seeing through the Obama administration.   With Republicans setting the agenda, those policies are history and  so is this slow economic growth that had been created during the Obama  years. Look what just happened in the last two economic quarters of  this year. Over these 6 months, our economy grew at a pace of more than  3 percent. The economy has created more than 2 million jobs since  President Trump was elected a little over a year ago. The economy is  responding--responding to policies that Republicans have been talking  about and to what we have been doing in terms of eliminating so many  punishing, burdensome, expensive regulations that have caused such a  drag on our economy.   When we pass legislation like this tax relief act, it will give  businesses confidence that we are keeping our promises. It gives them  confidence that they can keep hiring, keep investing, and keep creating  more jobs.   Take a look at the fact that there are 2 million more new jobs since  election day of last year. Someone said: Oh, no, you have to wait until  Inauguration Day to start counting. I disagree. I will tell you that in  my home State of Wyoming, on election night, when the results were in  and it was known that Donald Trump had been elected President of the  United States, there was immediate optimism, immediate confidence, and  an immediate positive spring in people's steps. The decision at that  point by the American electorate said: Yes, it is time for this economy  to take off. And it has.   When someone comes out with an estimate about economic growth and  they don't take into account all of these different things, I think,  maybe, they are living in the past, when they were looking at an  economic growth model of 1.8 percent. I think, maybe, they got so used  to the anemic growth we had in the Obama years that they are still  expecting that to continue into the future. They are not taking into  account that things are different now, that Republicans are passing our  economic plans, and that the burdensome regulations and the redtape has  been cut. They are not taking into account that President Trump is in  the White House.   Those things make a very big difference when it comes to sustaining  this progress that we have seen over the past year. Four out of five  studies agree that the Republican tax plan will deliver the kind of  economic growth that the American people want and the American economy  needs--a strong, healthy, and growing economy.
