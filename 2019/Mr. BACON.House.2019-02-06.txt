 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Omaha Public  Schools Foundation and its director, Toba Cohen-Dunning for their  commitment to the children attending Omaha Public Schools.   The Foundation was established in 1984 with $1,555, gifted by  teachers and staff. It is now a multimillion-dollar foundation serving  the students and teachers in Nebraska's largest school district.   Last November, the Foundation was recognized with the Investor in  America Award by the Partners for Livable Communities which  acknowledges groups and individuals who use creative public and private  partnerships to create more opportunities for livable communities.   As director of the Foundation, Toba directs a unique model of social  entrepreneurship that invests the revenues from early childhood  education and childhood programs to scholarships for high school  seniors, teacher innovation and classroom grants, and community  partnership projects.   Madam Speaker, I offer my congratulations to Ms. Cohen-Dunning and  the staff of the Foundation for their commitment to our children.                            ____________________
