 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized as in morning business for such time as I shall consume.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, this week, after 3 years of planning and  construction, we now will be dedicating tomorrow and officially opening  the Museum of the Bible.   This is led by Steve Green of Hobby Lobby. We all remember Hobby  Lobby of Oklahoma. Steve has been a friend of mine and his parents have  been friends of mine for a long period of time. He is the chairman of  the board of directors for this long-awaited museum that will allow  visitors from not just this country but from all over the world--they  will be coming here to see what it is all about and how this plays a  pivotal role in our country's history. There is no better place than  Washington, DC, in our Nation's Capitol, to remind us of the scope of  the Bible's impact on our history and our narrative. It has been long- awaited.   Indeed, one of our Founding Fathers, Patrick Henry, was renowned for  his readings of the Bible. He said at the end of his life: ``This book  is worth all the books that ever were printed, and it has been my  misfortune that I never found time to read it with the proper attention  and feeling till lately.''   He is the one--and not many people are aware that historians are  relooking at the history of this country, and they are saying we could  not have won that war. I mean you have to sometimes close your eyes and  envision the greatest army on the face of this Earth coming down with  thundering marches, going through Boston, and going up to Lexington and  Concord. There is no way in this world that a handful of trappers and  hunters could have won that thing. Yet we know why, and he knew why,  when you talk about Patrick Henry. They said: We are not strong enough.  It can't be done.   There is one thing they overlooked, and that is the strength that  comes from God that we had, and they didn't have. He said:         We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means       which the God of nature hath placed in our power. . . . armed       in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that       which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy       can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our       battles alone. There is a just God who [reigns] over the       destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight       our battles for us.    And he did, and they fired that shot heard around the world.   I think that is really important today to think about because people  come to this country and they want to know what makes America work.   I have been privileged to sponsor the African dinner every February,  and people come in from all over Africa. They are always surprised when  they come and they find out walking through the Capitol what real  significance God and the Bible has to the history of this country. We  are the largest Christian community in the world. We cannot and should  not deny the role our Judeo-Christian values played in the formation of  this country.   Our first President, George Washington, was steadfast in his belief  of God, His law, and that liberty is God's gift. Washington's  leadership was based on the conviction that Americans are entrusted by  God to preserve basic freedoms established in the Constitution.   In a letter, Washington wrote, ``We should be very cautious of  violating the rights of conscience in others, ever considering that God  alone is the judge of the hearts of men and to Him only in this case  they are answerable.''   It is clear our Founding Fathers recognized and enshrined the  importance of religious liberty, one of our most precious and  foundational religious freedoms that allowed them to live their lives  according to the teaching of the Bible.   The Bible's role in the founding of America is just one remarkable  example of how the Bible has profoundly shaped world history. It has  influenced cultures in every corner of the globe, and the Museum of the  Bible, which is going to be opening tomorrow, pays tribute to its  impact and intersectionality with the world religions.   Whether considering the Bible through a secular or faith-based lens,  it is impossible to deny its impact on individuals, countries, and,  indeed, all world history. The Museum of the  [[Page S7280]]  Bible is the first educational experience I have encountered that truly  appreciates the full magnitude of the Bible's role throughout history.   The six exhibits, curated by a panel of faith leaders that span  religious and geographic divides, truly bring the Word of God to life  in a way that positively educates, informs, and encourages people of  all faiths and beliefs to learn more about the Bible   General Washington reminded us in his Farewell Address: ``Let us with  caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without  religion.''   Steve Green's father David founded Hobby Lobby. I remember this so  well because I was in the State legislature at the time this happened.  They started in their garage making frames for pictures. It turned out  to be this giant, worldwide corporation, the largest arts and crafts  retailer in the history of America, currently or in the past.   Remember Hobby Lobby, when ObamaCare required that all employers  provide free access to the pills that terminate pregnancies, David  clearly recognized this as a violation of his faith. That is what  America is all about. If you believe in it, you do it, you take a risk.  He was risking millions of dollars, but the morality was so significant  from the teachings of the Bible that he went ahead and did it. He took  the challenge all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won in a split  decision. He successfully argued the importance to maintain the  fundamental freedom of religion to apply his faith convictions to how  he operates his private business.   David won his case, but his family understood we needed to do more.  So he started the Museum of the Bible. I actually was there last June,  when it was under construction at the time, as we walked through and  visualized what it was going to look like later on. It is magnificent.   They have a stage, and you live on the stage. He is going to have  performances there. I am so anxious to be there tonight, the night  before the official opening, to see now what it looks like.   I am so grateful David's son Steve and his entire family are leading  this effort to make the Bible and its impact more accessible to the  whole world. I am especially honored that the museum will open on my  birthday tomorrow. I am not sure they really knew that when they made  the decision, but somebody knew it.
