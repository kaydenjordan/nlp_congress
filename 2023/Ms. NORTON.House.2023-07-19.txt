 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment that would increase safety risks, delays, cancelations,  diversions, and noise at National Airport, all for the personal  convenience of some Members of Congress.   The Federal Aviation Administration and the Metropolitan Washington  Airports Authority that manages Reagan National and Dulles Airports  have both concluded that increasing the slot and perimeter rules would  be harmful to the flying public.   The slot and perimeter rules at National Airport exist to ensure  operational viability for both National and Dulles International  Airports. National and Dulles work as an integrated airport system to  meet the needs of the traveling public.   Dulles has the operational capacity, space, and infrastructure to  handle larger, long-distance flights and more flights per day than  National Airport. National Airport already has the busiest runway in  the Nation, was built as a small regional airport, and was never meant  to manage flights from across the country.   Mr. Chair, I urge the Members to oppose this amendment.
