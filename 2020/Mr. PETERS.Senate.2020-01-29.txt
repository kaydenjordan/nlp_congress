 Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is from Senator Peters and is for the  House managers.         Does the phrase ``or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''       in Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution require a       violation of the U.S. criminal code or is a breach of public       trust sufficient? Please explain.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. The Framers were very clear that abuse of power  is an impeachable offense. In explaining why the Constitution must  allow impeachment, Edmund Randolph warned that ``the Executive will  have great opportunities of abusing his power.''   Alexander Hamilton described ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as  ``offenses which proceed from the . . . abuse or violation of some  public trust.''   The Framers also described what it meant. It was impeachable for a  President to abuse his pardon power to shelter people he was connected  with in a suspicious manner. Future Supreme Court Justice James Iredell  said the President would be liable to impeachment if he acted from some  corrupt motive or other or if he was willfully abusing his trust.   As was later stated in a treatise summarizing centuries of common  law, abuse of power occurs if a public officer, entrusted with definite  powers to be exercised for the benefit of the community, wickedly  abuses or fraudulently exceeds them.   So when the Framers said this--that abuse of power was impeachable-- it was not just an empty, meaningless statement. Remember, the Founders  had been participating with overthrowing the British Government, a King  who was not accountable.   They incorporated the impeachment power into the Constitution late,  actually, in the drafting of the Constitution. They knew they were  giving the President many powers, and they specified, if he abused  them, that those powers could be taken away.   Now, the prior articles that the Congress has had on impeachment did  not include specific crimes. President Nixon was charged with abusing  his power, targeting political opponents, engaging in a coverup.   There was conduct specified. Some of it was clearly criminal. Some of  it was not. But it was all impeachable because it was corrupt, and it  was abusing his power.   In the House Judiciary Committee, we had witnesses called by both  Republicans and Democrats. The Republican-invited constitutional law  expert Jonathan Turley testified unequivocally that it is possible to  establish a case for impeachment based on a noncriminal allegation of  abuse of power.   Every Presidential impeachment, including this one, has included  conduct that violated the law, but each Presidential impeachment has  included the charges directly under the Constitution.   It is important to note that a specific criminal law violation was  not in the minds of the Founders, and it wouldn't make any sense today.  You could have a criminal law violation, you could deface a post office  box. That would be a violation of Federal law. We would laugh at the  idea that that would be a basis for impeachment. That is not abuse of  Presidential powers. It might be a crime. And yet, you could have  activities that are so dangerous to our Constitution, that are not a  crime, that would be charged as an impeachable offense because they are  an abuse of power. That is what the Framers worried about. That is why  they put the impeachment clause in the Constitution, and, frankly, they  opined that, because of the impeachment clause, no Executive would dare  exceed their powers. Regrettably, that prediction did not prove true,  which is why we are here today with President Trump having abused his  broad powers to the detriment of our national interest for a corrupt  purpose, his own personal interests.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Senator.    Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for the House  managers that I will send to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Peters asks the House managers:         Does an impeachable abuse of power require that a       President's corrupt plan actually succeed?    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, the answer is  no. Just as, although this is not a criminal offense, if you attempted  murder but didn't succeed, you would not be innocent. The President has  attempted to upend the constitutional order for his own personal  benefit. He used the powers of the--let's put up slide 11, if we could.  He has used the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference,  and we know this by the President's own statements, the Acting Chief of  Staff's confession, substantial documentary evidence, and witness  testimony. And this has grave consequences for our national security,  for threatened election security, as well as undermining U.S.  credibility and our values abroad.   Now, because the President continues to act in this manner, we  believe that this is an ongoing threat. While the impeachment was going  on, the President's personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani, was in Ukraine,  continuing this scheme, and when he landed--he was still taxiing--the  President and he were on the phone.   The President was asking him: What did you get? What did you get?   So this is an ongoing matter. The fact that he had to release the aid  after his scheme was revealed does not end the problem.   I have listened with great interest to the back-and-forth in the  questions. It is hard because I want to get up and answer all of the  questions, and I can't, but I do think that the President has made it  clear that he believes he can do whatever he wants--whatever he wants-- and there is no constraint that is being recognized by the Congress.   Mr. Mulvaney, as we have noted, has acknowledged that the President  directly tied his hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine to  conduct a political investigation, and he told us to just get over it.   The President's lawyers have suggested we should not believe our eyes  because Mr. Mulvaney--when I was a kid, they would say: Don't believe  your lying eyes--walked that back later. We have an opportunity,  actually, to hear from a witness who directly spoke to the President,  who, apparently, can tell us that the President told him that the only  reason this aid was held up was to get dirt on the Democrats.   If we just think about it--put Ukraine to one side--if a Chief  Executive called the Department of Justice and said, ``I want you to  investigate my political opponents. I want you to announce an  investigation,'' there wouldn't be any question that that would be an  improper use of Presidential power. It is really no different when you  follow a foreign government except that it is worse because one of the  things that the Founders worried about was the involvement of foreign  governments in our matters, in our elections. So, yes, the fact that he  [[Page S687]]  didn't succeed in that particular instance does not mean that we are  safe.   I was stunned to hear that now, apparently, it is OK for the  President to get information from foreign governments in an election.  That is news to me, you know, that the election campaign laws prohibit  accepting anything of value. A thing of value is information. If you or  I accepted material information from a source--an email, a database,  and the like--without paying for it or from a foreign nation, that  would be illegal; but the thought that this--as we go forward in this  trial itself, we are creating additional dangers to the Nation by  suggesting that things that have long been prohibited are now suddenly  going to be OK because they have been asserted in the President's  defense.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Wyoming.
