 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Liberty High  School Lady Panthers for winning the 2022 Texas University  Interscholastic League Division 4A State championship.   This is the Lady Panthers' second consecutive State title and the  third in the last 5 years. Amazing.   During their historic season, the Lady Panthers had a record of 38  wins and only 6 losses before defeating the Sweeny Bulldogs in the  State championship game on June 5.   I am proud to say six Lady Panthers were named to the State UIL  Softball 4A All-Tournament Team: Kylie Bishop, Kamdyn Chandler, Reese  Evans, Hollie Thomas, Bryana Pantalion, and Bailee Slack. Senior third  baseman Kylie Bishop was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.   In a pregame ceremony before Liberty's State title game, Head Coach  Karen Slack received recognition as the 2020-2021 National Federation  of State High School Coaches' Texas State Softball Coach of the Year.   Madam Speaker, I again congratulate the Lady Panthers on their season  of triumph. I am so very proud of all of them.  [[Page H5983]]                                ____________________
