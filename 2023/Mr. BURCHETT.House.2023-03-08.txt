 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Lieutenant Ruth Coughlin,  an American hero who served in the Navy faithfully from 1953 to 1958.   Lieutenant Coughlin was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina. After  high school, she went to St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama,  where she graduated as a registered nurse. From 1944 to 1953, she  worked in private practice in ophthalmology and oral surgery practices.   In 1953, she joined the Navy as a Lieutenant Junior Grade and was  stationed in Maryland at Bethesda Hospital. During her career she  served as a nurse aboard a medical ship that made 32 round trips  crossing the Atlantic Ocean from Brooklyn, New York, to north Germany.  In 1957, she was reassigned to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Corona,  California, where she met her husband, Dennis.   They moved to Knoxville and raised five children together. She will  be turning a very young 100 years old this month. I think it is very  appropriate during International Women's Day that we honor her.   So happy birthday, Ruth.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our Armed Forces, like  Lieutenant Ruth Coughlin, who has dedicated her life to the service of  her country. It is my honor to recognize Lieutenant Coughlin as the  Tennessee Second District's March 2023 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
