 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, a month ago, our Nation  stood on the highest mountaintop, marveling at the supposed  limitlessness of our domain.   Today, barely 3 weeks later, awakening from an abundance-induced  stupor, we find ourselves deep in the valley, peering perilously into  the abyss.   I hope that the safety net we are attempting to purchase today with  our Nation's scarce treasure doesn't dull too much the alarm that this  crisis has sounded for our country to reform its ways.   I pray that from this low point, we will seek out a great revival of  faith in our Almighty God and a renewed commitment to the principles of  freedom, liberty, and self-reliance.   For those in this Congress who have used this crisis to loot the  public treasury and serve special interests above the common good, I  trust that our people and history will judge you as harshly as you  deserve.   And today, I give thanks for our President.
