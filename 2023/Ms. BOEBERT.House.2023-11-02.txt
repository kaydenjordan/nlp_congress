 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  redirects $5 million from government bureaucracy to hazardous fuels  reduction activities within the Bureau of Land Management to prevent  catastrophic wildfires and save lives.   The year I was elected to office, Colorado suffered the worst fire  season in Colorado history with the three largest recorded wildfires we  have ever had. Hundreds of homes were destroyed and evacuated as  Coloradans endured more than 100 days of fire.   The Cameron Peak fire burned more than 208,000 acres and more than  460 structures to the tune of $6 million in property losses. The East  Troublesome fire, on the border of my district, killed two people.   Coloradans also suffered severe health issues resulting from  significant smoke from these fires. Wildfire smoke causes serious  disorders including eye and respiratory tract infections, reduction of  lung function, bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma, and even premature  death.   Catastrophic wildfires also cause significant damage to the  environment. A few years ago, NASA concluded that one catastrophic  wildfire can emit more carbon emissions in just a few days than all  vehicle emissions in an entire State over the course of an entire year.   Decades of mismanagement have left our Nation's Federal lands  vulnerable to insects and disease and ripe for a catastrophic  wildfires. The good news is that there is finally significant  bipartisan support throughout the country to prevent wildfires, and the  Forest Service is seeking to treat 20 million acres of national forests  and grasslands and 30 million acres of State, local, Tribal, and  private lands over the next 10 years.   However, we need to do more, as Federal agencies have stated that  more than 1 billion acres throughout the country are currently at risk  of catastrophic wildfires. Our Federal lands are overgrown and poorly  managed, making them more susceptible to wildfire, disease, and bark  beetle attacks.   There are Federal lands in Colorado and in the West where we once had  50 to 100 trees per acre but now we see 500 to 1,000 trees per acre.  This is a massive overgrowth in our forests that we need to manage.  There are also 6 billion standing dead trees in the Western United  States. Some people call that a problem. I call it a tinderbox waiting  to ignite.   Fuel treatments are effective, and Federal agencies have made clear  that ``over 90 percent of fuel treatments are effective in changing  fire behavior and/or helping with control of the wildfire.''   Let's put the lives of the American people first and take significant  action to benefit our environment by passing my hazardous fuels  reduction amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I don't think that this is something that  should be opposed. Redirecting $5 million from government bureaucracies  to hazardous fuels reduction activities is very common sense. We are to  be good stewards of our land, and part of that is being proactive  rather than reactive.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment that redirects  $5 million from government bureaucracy to active forest management  activities at the U.S. Forest Service to prevent catastrophic wildfires  and save lives.   Each year in the United States, about 65,000 wildfires burn more than  10 million acres. Wildfires kill people and destroy everything they  own, including their homes and sentimental family heirlooms that can  never be replaced. Some of the stories of loss I have heard from people  in my district are truly heartbreaking.   Our forests are overgrown and poorly managed, making them more  susceptible to catastrophic wildfires. We can reduce the size and  severity of wildfires through active forest management, which will also  protect our watersheds and municipal water supplies. A healthy forest  means healthy watersheds.   According to the Colorado State Forest Service, more than 24.4  million acres of Colorado forestland impact Colorado's water supply,  where 80 percent of the State's population relies on those forested  watersheds for municipal water supplies.   Healthy forests act as a natural water filter and storage system and  are critical to maintaining healthy watersheds. In the United States,  forests are a source of drinking water for over 180 million people.   Historically, wildfire suppression has consumed more than 50 percent  of the Forest Service's budget. The Forest Service only harvested 3.2  billion board feet in 2020 compared to over 10 billion board feet in  1990.   The current flawed approach causes us to spend billions of dollars on  the back end to suppress fire, neglecting fire prevention and putting  our communities at increasing risk of catastrophic fires.   The Forest Service's own fuel treatment effectiveness database  reports that over 90 percent of the fuel treatments were effective in  changing fire behavior and/or helping with control of wildfire.   Wildfires are also getting more intense, and we are seeing more crown  fires that burn hotter and cause increased ecological damage to soil  and watersheds. Unfortunately, Federal agencies have failed to  recognize this correlation and timber harvests being down nearly 80  percent over the past 30 years.   This also negatively impacts education and local communities as,  historically, 25 percent of the receipts from timber harvests went  toward schools and important infrastructure projects for the  communities that we all serve and love.   Let's pass my active forest management amendment that will help  prevent catastrophic wildfires and save lives.  [[Page H5279]]    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment that  utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary of the Director of the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Elizabeth Klein, to $1.   Ms. Klein is a radical environmentalist and a partisan hack  compromised by special interests and mired in ethical conflict. Her  conflicts of interest were so severe that even Senator Manchin voted to  block her nomination as Deputy Secretary of the Interior.   As deputy director at the New York University School of Law's State  Energy and Environmental Impact Center, Klein placed and paid the  salaries of legal fellows in State attorneys general offices to advance  Michael Bloomberg's radical environmental agenda.   The use of private money to conduct public business is ethically  flawed. An Indiana attorney general categorized Ms. Klein's program as  an ``arrangement through which a private organization or individual can  promote an overtly political agenda by paying the salaries of  government employees.''   In just the first year of the program, SEEIC fellows participated in  filing at least 130 regulatory, legal, and other challenges to  President Trump's policies.   Now, Ms. Klein is working for the Federal Government and on the other  side of lawsuits that she helped file. Under President Biden's own  ethics rules, she should be prohibited from participating in matters  involving her former employer.   During her testimony to the House Committee on Natural Resources, I  questioned Ms. Klein about her failed nomination to become Deputy  Secretary of the Interior. I asked if she had been provided with a  recusal list and formally requested that she provide this list to the  committee. Ms. Klein told the committee that she was happy to provide  the list.   Shamefully, it took a letter from the committee and this aggressive  committee questioning for Ms. Klein to send the committee a very  delayed recusal list that should have been in place almost immediately  after her hiring.   Ms. Klein spent several years funneling money from Michael Bloomberg  to sue the Trump administration and pay for the Green New Deal lawyers  she had placed in attorneys general offices across the country.   Given her myriad of Federal lawsuits and conflicts, there should be  little to  [[Page H5293]]  nothing that Ms. Klein is allowed to work on at any subagency within  the Department of the Interior.   Senior Federal employees are required to be transparent in their  ethical obligations and act impartially, placing their sole loyalty to  the Constitution and the laws of the United States.   Ms. Klein's history of infiltrating State governments with Michael  Bloomberg minions and supporting lawsuits against the Federal  Government makes it impossible for her to meet the ethical obligations  that her position of public trust requires.   Ms. Klein's continued employment as Director of the Bureau of Ocean  Energy Management has been riddled with a controversial and extensive  history of ethical conflicts and is a stain on the Department of the  Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.   Radical, partisan extremists have no place in the Federal Government,  especially those in charge of our energy industry.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to restore  integrity to the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Ocean  Energy Management.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment that prohibits  the Biden administration from taking any action to finalize, implement,  or enforce their proposed Endangered Species Act rule proposed on June  22, 2023.   For far too long, radical environmentalists have weaponized the ESA  against farmers, ranchers, landowners, and our rural communities. The  proposed rule abandons clear and well-functioning Trump-era reforms in  favor of one-size-fits-all mandates from disconnected Washington  bureaucrats. These new regulations will only make it more difficult for  true conservationists to assist with species recovery.   In 2019, the Trump administration modernized the Endangered Species  Act for the first time in nearly 40 years. The Trump administration  added more flexibility for affected stakeholders while also ensuring  species recovery plans take a tailored and targeted approach.   With these proposed rules, the Biden administration moved to repeal  and replace these changes with more mandates that don't work for the  people on the ground.   In 2019, President Trump and his administration recognized the  differences between threatened and endangered species. In doing so, FWS  rescinded the prior blanket rule that automatically granted endangered- level protections to species listed as threatened.   Joe Biden's plan to restore this blanket rule will lead to more red  tape and burdensome regulations on rural communities, and they simply  can't afford that.   Similarly, the 2019 reforms to section 4 regarding listing and  delisting of species and designations of critical habitat were a  welcome change. These reforms removed constraints that previously  prohibited agencies from researching and sharing the economic impact of  a listing determination under the ESA.   Joe Biden's proposal removes those flexibilities and includes a  mandate that the agencies must designate unoccupied areas as critical  habitat.   The 2019 modernization efforts also updated section 7 to clarify the  interagency consultation process and codify alternative consultation  mechanisms to provide greater efficiency.   The rule established standards to ensure that effects analysis for  proposed actions is limited only to activities that are reasonably  certain to occur and must be backed by clear and substantial  information.   Eliminating these important modernizations made by President Trump  and his administration will only result in further one-size-fits-all  responses to threatened and endangered species that will benefit  absolutely nobody, including the species.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment to  prevent these egregious new rules from taking effect and steer the ESA  back to its intended purpose of actually helping species recover  without being a barrier to prosperity for our rural communities.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just would note that we understand how the  comment periods work under the Biden administration. Typically, they  are for a topic that impacts our rural communities. In the West, there  is a real rural and urban divide, and it is always my effort to  highlight that and give our rural communities a strong voice in the  efforts that we are promoting.   Unfortunately, usually for the topics at hand that are impacting our  rural communities, the comment period meetings are often held in urban  areas where it is difficult for our farmers and ranchers to even travel  to so they can have their comments heard.   Also, these bureaucrats already have their minds made up. They don't  care what they are reading in the comments, they don't care what is  being said during the comment time.   Their position is solid, and the American people do not want more red  tape.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  prohibits the Bureau of Land Management from taking any action to  finalize, implement, or enforce a Draft Resource Management Plan and  Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to end new oil leases  on 1.6 million acres in Colorado.   Colorado's West Slope used to have a booming energy production  economy. Unfortunately, we have been regulated into poverty in  Colorado's Third District.   I remember when I owned a small business, roughnecks used to come  into my restaurant, and I knew that it was going to be a good,  successful, and profitable day because I had mud on my floors to clean  up. However, through regulations, there was no more mud to clean up on  nearly any of our business floors, and many businesses shuttered  forever.   There used to be 112 rigs on the West Slope, but now we have 4  drilling rigs. Now not-in-my-backyard extremists and job-killing  Federal policies have driven away these good-paying jobs. The Bureau of  Land Management's Draft Resource Management Plan for the Colorado River  Valley field office and Grand Junction field office is the latest  fossil fuel attack.   This proposed land grab could remove over 1.6 million acres of public  lands in Colorado from future oil and gas leasing and establish nine  different areas of critical environmental concern and over 100,000  acres of BLM land.   If this proposal is finalized, the United States will lose access to  vital energy resources, many more than 600 fewer wells projected by the  agency to be lost by 2043.   The consequences will be felt far beyond the State of Colorado where  the residents will lose their livelihoods and see increased gas and  energy prices. BLM is proposing to close all areas with no known, low,  and moderate oil and gas development potential and is basing its  analysis of the oil and gas potential on out-of-date information that  does not take into consideration modern technology.   The Permian Basin was once thought to be low to medium, and now it is  the highest producing oil field in the world. As a result, the Permian  Basin would be closed if this proposal had been in place in New Mexico  and Texas prior to the significant amount of production that is now  occurring.   This proposed land grab is nothing short of partisan politics meant  to further restrict access to the oil and natural gas development that  could reinvigorate the economy of the West Slope of Colorado and help  ensure energy security for all Americans.   There are already stringent standards and requirements in place for  all oil and gas producers that aim at reducing environmental and  cultural impacts. This proposed rule is yet another blatant land grab  designed to dismantle the fossil fuel industry and force a green  transition.   Closing the door to over 1.6 million acres of vital public lands for  energy development is not just an issue of economics, it is a threat to  our Nation's energy independence and security. This proposal goes  beyond necessary environmental consideration and instead seeks to  restrict access to promising resources hindering the potential for  economic growth and prosperity, particularly on the West Slope of  Colorado.   Rogue bureaucrats at the BLM shouldn't be unilaterally locking up  more land in Colorado. It is urgent that we block this overreach and  prioritize responsible energy production that will help reduce gas  prices during these challenging times.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, from day one in his administration, Joe Biden  declared an all-out war on American energy production and exploration.  He made it clear that he cares more about appeasing the radical climate  change activists than protecting the millions of oil and gas workers  and producers in America.   I was disappointed but not surprised this July when the Biden  administration filed this proposed rule entitled fluid mineral leases  and the leasing process, which mandates provisions from the partisan  so-called Inflation Reduction Act, better known as the Green New Deal  in disguise, which increased the royalty rate for production on Federal  lands while also increasing and creating new fees for domestic energy  producers.   This new fluid mineral leasing rule is further proof that Joe Biden  is using every tool in his administration to dismantle American energy  production. It increases bonding levels for the production on Federal  lands and proposes ending nationwide bonding and increasing the minimum  bond amounts for individual lease bonds and statewide lease bonds from  $10,000 to $150,000 and from $25,000 to $500,000 respectively.   This significant increase will tie up capital that would otherwise be  put back into production and is unjustifiable as there are only 37  orphaned oil and gas wells on BLM-managed land.   These increases will impact smaller producers who can't afford to  operate in the market. These additional fees will ultimately harm  returns and reduce revenues to State and local governments by  disincentivizing development on Federal lands.   The proposed rule also introduces the idea of using preference  criteria to inform the BLM's selection of lands for lease sales. BLM's  rationale for this change is to avoid conflict areas with sensitive  cultural wildlife and recreation resources. This means that the BLM  field offices could avoid leasing in all areas with endangered or  threatened species--maybe that is their goal--critical habitat or even  nearby recreation areas, a move that would greatly limit leasing on  Federal lands.   With the wars happening in the Middle East and in Europe, and with  OPEC significantly lowering oil production, we cannot rely on foreign  nations to control our energy supply.   America makes the cleanest energy in the world. American innovation-- in particular, fracking--has allowed America to be the global leader in  reducing emissions since 2000. We need to stop buying oil and gas from  Russia, stop begging OPEC, Venezuela, and even Iran to produce energy  for us, and start producing more clean, reliable, affordable energy  responsibly here in America.   We must restore American energy dominance and produce clean, reliable  energy right here at home. I urge adoption of my amendment, Mr. Chair,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment to  prohibit funding for the Bicycle Subsidy Benefit Program at the  Department of the Interior. I wish I were kidding.   The DOI Bicycle Subsidy Benefit Program provides taxpayer dollars to  DOI employees and paid student interns or unpaid student volunteers for  the purchase, improvements, repair, storage, and/or maintenance of a  nonmotorized bicycle that is used as a primary means of commuting to  and from work, as well as a monthly stipend. You can't make this up.   American taxpayers' hard-earned money is being wasted on covering  bicycle commuting expenses such as bicycles, bicycle locks, bicycle  parking storage, bicycle safety equipment, bicycle improvements or  accessories, including reflective lights, racks, bicycle repairs, and  general maintenance, personal safety and protective equipment,  including high-visibility safety apparel, headwear, bicycle gloves, and  bicycle share memberships, as well as getting paid to bike to work.   DOI employees are going to bike to work because they want to bike to  [[Page H5296]]  work, not because taxpayers are being forced to shell out $20 a month  to Federal bureaucrats that participate in this absurd and ridiculous  program.   Coloradans across my district are struggling right now as they deal  with the disastrous effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic  policies. The Biden administration has unleashed record inflation on  Americans that has decimated our bank and retirement accounts,  increased gas prices to record levels, raised utility bills, driven up  grocery prices, and made it harder to live for all American people.   The primary root cause of this record-breaking inflation was  trillions of dollars of wasteful Federal spending. This excessive  spending has real life consequences. American families will pay a  $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently 20 million Americans  can't even afford to pay their utility bill.   We have seen a 4.3 percent decline in real wages since Biden took  office. Americans have lost more than $2 trillion in retirement  savings. America is $33 trillion in debt, with a $2 trillion a year  deficit, and Democrats want us to continue to print money and pay  bureaucrats to bike to work when our so-called Commander in Chief  doesn't even know how to properly ride one. Maybe we should subsidize  some bicycle lessons for the President while we are at it.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to cut  wasteful Federal spending by prohibiting funding for the Bicycle  Subsidy Benefit Program at the Department of the Interior. Mr. Chair, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, riding a bicycle is great. It is wonderful.  Sure, we want fresh air. Sure, we want exercise. It is great for our  health, but it is not great for the American taxpayer to subsidize this  to bureaucrats.   What about western Colorado? Are we going to subsidize our Bureau of  Land Management personnel to ride horses into work? Do we pay for their  feed, their lot storage? Do we get to pay for all that as well? It is  never ending.   The gentlewoman pointed out that this unfairly targets DOI. I am  happy to defund this program in every agency across the Federal  Government. We just happen to be speaking about the Department of the  Interior right now.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, on rollcall No. 567, I mistakenly voted  ``aye'' when I intended to vote ``no.''                   Amendment No. 15 Offered by Mr. Collins
