 Mr. President, as I begin, I want to talk about another  subject here in a moment, but I also want to react to what the Senator  from Illinois said with regard to the debt limit.   I think it is important to point out, as folks on the other side and  the White House talk about the need for a ``clean debt limit''--in  other words, a debt limit that increases the amount of borrowing  without anything whatsoever attached to it--that in 7 of the last 10  debt limit debates, there were budgetary or policy items that were  negotiated and attached--in 7 of the last 10 debt limits. Many of those  were insisted upon by the Democrats at the time. In fact--I pointed  this out yesterday--President Biden, when he was Vice President back in  2011, made statements that he couldn't understand how anybody could not  understand the importance or the need to negotiate on a debt limit  increase and other policy matters related, hopefully, to spending and  debt.   It seems to me, at least, that a debt limit debate presents an  opportunity to actually do something about the debt and to address the  issue of spending. There have been a number of good suggestions made in  a bill that has been sent over to us from the House of Representatives  about how to do that--about how to save money, how to make government  more efficient, reallocate, reprioritize how we spend money, and,  hopefully, reduce the amount of debt that we actually have going  forward and, perhaps, the need to again raise the debt limit.  [[Page S1525]]    It seems like every time we have this conversation, everybody laments  the fact that we have to do this and that we have this huge debt. Well,  one way to address that would be to actually have a conversation about  what we might do to reduce the debt in the form of spending reforms and  budgetary changes that could address both the spending and the debt  issue. So 7 of the last 10 times, that has happened, and in many cases,  it has been instigated by the Democrat leaders, including Senator  Schumer.   One other observation about that--because I think it is important--is  you talk about spending and debt. Think about just the absolute  aggregate levels that we are now dealing with in terms of debt. I make  this point because, back in 2010, the amount that we spent annually on  interest on the debt was a little under $200 billion; and in 2022, last  year, the amount that we spent on interest on the debt--in other words,  just to finance the debt, to pay the interest on the amount of  borrowing that we have in this country--was $475 billion. So, in that  time period from 2010, we went from paying a little under $200 billion  a year in interest on the debt to $475 billion a year in interest on  the debt. That is a 142-percent increase. That is going to go up  dramatically, as we all know, because interest rates are going up. So  now the cost of borrowing is increasing dramatically. In fact, over the  next 10 years, the estimate is that 50 cents out of every dollar that  we borrow will go toward nothing but paying the interest on the debt.   So, when you are $31 trillion in the hole--$31 trillion in debt--it  seems logical to me--and I think it does to most Americans because they  have weighed in on this, if you believe any of the polls--to address  the issue of the debt as you are raising the debt limit, which is  precisely what the House leadership in the House of Representatives did  when it passed a bill last week and sent it to the Senate for  consideration, including a number of spending reforms that would reduce  not only the amount of spending that we have but also the amount of  debt significantly. It would reduce the amount of debt over that time  period by about $500 billion. It is actually significantly higher than  that--several trillion dollars over the next 10-year period. That is a  significant amount of money. The amount of interest saved is about $500  billion. The total amount of savings on the debt is about $4.5  trillion.   So they are making an earnest effort at addressing what is a highly  colossal problem for our country if we don't start reining it in and  getting it under control. And I think it behooves the U.S. Senate to  consider--and the President as well--what we might do to address  spending and debt instead of declaring, as the Democrat leader did  about the House bill, that it is dead on arrival in the Senate. There  are a number of ideas in there that, I think, should be supported by  both sides and that are meaningful in terms of what they do, obviously,  by the amount that they would save.   But 50 cents out of every dollar borrowed over the course of the next  10 years--in each of the next 10 years--would be used for nothing more  than to pay interest on the debt, which today--or as of last year,  2022--is already $475 billion each and every year. There are 55 percent  of the American people, including 58 percent of Democrats, who think  that, before we raise the debt limit, we ought to do something to put  some restraints in place--some budgetary restraints--that control the  amount of spending in this country and, therefore, the amount of  deficit and debt that we rack up.
