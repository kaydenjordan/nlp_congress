 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the  healthcare topic for 15 minutes.    Mr. President, I am going to speak mostly about some  Medicaid reforms that were proposed in the BCRA, but in the course of  the discussion, I am going to touch on some of the issues that our  colleague who just finished raised.   As we know, the BCRA bill is not going to be the vehicle we will take  to a conference committee with the House, but I hope we will get to a  conference committee with the House, and I hope the result of that,  among other things, is that we will address the need to make important  reforms to Medicaid because they are long overdue.   I will start with a chart which illustrates our Federal deficits and  what exactly is driving our Federal deficits. The fact is--I think we  all know here--we have two big categories of Federal spending. One is  the discretionary spending which Congress approves at Congress's  discretion every year. The other category is the programs on  autopilot--programs where spending is driven by a person's eligibility  for the program without Congress acting in any way.   That latter category we call mandatory spending. In 1980, that was  only 50 percent of the Federal budget. By 1995, it was 64 percent. Last  year, it was 70 percent of our entire budget, and we are on a path to  have these mandatory spending--the blue line. We can see the growth in  mandatory spending. We can see the relative lack of growth in the other  categories of spending, be it defense or nondefense discretionary  spending.  [[Page S4382]]    The budgetary problem we have is mandatory spending. This is not  breaking news. This is nothing that is controversial. Anybody who has  taken an honest look at the numbers can come to no other conclusion.  The discretionary portion of the budget, which used to be the lion's  share of the budget, has been relatively flat. Actually, it has even  declined in recent years. The mandatory spending has been going through  the roof.   Of course, there are multiple problems with this, not the least of  which is--at this kind of growth in mandatory spending--the first thing  it does is it squeezes out all other categories of spending. We are  already living through that, as the discretionary spending--including  on our Nation's defense--has been declining because you can't do so  much of both, but in time you could zero out all the discretionary  spending, and there still will not be enough for all the mandatory  spending which is coming our way if we stay on the path we are on.   Where is all this mandatory spending coming from? The next chart  shows that pretty clearly. The bulk of mandatory spending, especially  in recent years, is from Medicaid. The reason I say that is, Social  Security is a big program, but Social Security has a dedicated revenue  stream. The payroll tax historically used to cover all of it. For a  while there, it covered more than the ongoing payments for Social  Security. While that fluctuated when we suspended the payroll tax, by  and large, the payroll tax pays most of the Social Security costs that  we have day-to-day.   Medicare also has a revenue stream that is dedicated from payroll  taxes, but it doesn't cover nearly as large a percentage of the  Medicare costs as Social Security so we see the green line generally is  higher than the blue line.   The line which is higher than all by far is the Medicaid line because  there is no dedicated revenue stream to Medicaid, and the net expense,  therefore, is by far the biggest of all our entitlement programs.   Medicaid has been growing at a really shocking rate for years. In  1980, Medicaid spending was only 2.4 percent of our budget, a half a  percent of our economy; by 1995, it was almost 6 percent of our budget;  and today it is 10 percent of our whole budget, 17 percent of all  healthcare spending. So this is happening because Medicaid is growing  much faster than our economy is growing.   The fact is, no Federal program can grow faster than the economy  indefinitely because the economy has to fund the entire Federal  Government. Hopefully, funding the government is only a portion of what  our economy is doing. The main purpose of our economy is to provide a  livelihood for the people who create it, but Medicaid, as we can see,  is growing at a staggering rate compared to our economy as measured by  GDP.   This picture right here summarizes, really, for me the very  definition of an unsustainable Federal program because as it continues  to grow at a rate that is much greater than our economy, it necessarily  is consuming an ever greater percentage, an ever greater portion of our  economy and our Federal budget. Nothing can grow faster than our  economy indefinitely. It is just arithmetic. Eventually, it would  become bigger than the economy, which is obviously an impossibility,  and long before that happened, it would cause a fiscal crisis. This is  the very essence of what is unsustainable.   You don't have to take my word for it, and I am certainly not the  first person to observe this. We could take the words of Democratic  President Bill Clinton, who told us this very thing. Back in 1995,  President William Jefferson Clinton said:         We all now, looking ahead, know that our number one       entitlement problem is Medicare and Medicaid. They are       growing much more rapidly than the rate of inflation plus       population.    Now, President Bill Clinton wasn't making this point because he is  some kind of ideologue who wants to get rid of Medicaid. I don't think  he has ever been accused of that. It is not because he has some  passionate ideological commitment to reducing the size of government. I  don't think he has ever been accused of that. I think Bill Clinton was  making this point because he knew this program was unsustainable, and  he wanted to reform it so it would be sustainable, so our Federal  budget would be sustainable, so Medicaid would be there for the next  generation. I think that was Bill Clinton's motivation at the time.   So what was his solution? What was it that Bill Clinton thought we  ought to do about this program that was unsustainable?   President Bill Clinton suggested the Federal Government put caps on  the amount of money it would contribute to the States based on the  number of individuals enrolled. In other words, it was a per  beneficiary limit on the Federal contribution. That was what Bill  Clinton proposed in 1995. He wanted to maintain the eligibility of  individuals to participate in the program, but he wanted to put limits  on what the Federal Government's share would be. He wanted to have it  grow at about the rate the economy would grow so you wouldn't continue  to have this wildly accelerating line relative to this modest growth  line but that the two lines would converge, because then, as Bill  Clinton knew, the program would be sustainable over time. We would be  able to afford it.   One might wonder, what did Congress think of this idea at the time.  This is 1995. Bill Clinton came along and said: Let's establish per  beneficiary caps on Medicaid expenditures by the Federal Government,  and let's limit the growth of those caps to about the growth of the  economy. That was Bill Clinton's idea.   Helpfully, the Democrats, who controlled the Senate, decided to weigh  in on the matter, and on December 13, 1995, Senator Patty Murray--who  serves with us today--submitted a letter to the Congressional Record. I  am going to read a very brief comment she made when she submitted this  for the Record. The senior Senator from Washington, Patty Murray, said:         Mr. President, I hold in my hand today a letter to       President Clinton that is signed by all 46 members of the       Democratic Caucus. This letter urges him to hold firm to our       commitment to basic health care for children, pregnant women,       the elderly, and the disabled in this country. This letter       supports a per capita cap approach to finding savings in the       Medicaid program.    It was signed by every single Democratic Senator. They expressed  their strong support for the Medicaid per capita cap structure.   I want to be very specific about this because as they developed the  particulars, they decided the cap should not grow at an index that was  tied to healthcare spending. They wanted it to be tied to an index  which would grow at the rate of the economy overall, and they proposed  it would go into effect the very next year. They didn't want to wait.  They didn't want to have a transition. They didn't want it to be  gradual. They wanted it to go into effect the next year. They proposed  implementing the changes for the very next fiscal year.   So you can imagine that some of us are a little bit surprised by the  shrill, over-the-top attacks we have been hearing from the other side.  We Republicans have been accused of launching a war on Medicaid. We  have been accused of draconian cuts. We have been accused of wanting to  decimate healthcare for the most vulnerable. We could go on. As you and  I both know, all across this country, on this floor, in every form  imaginable, our Democratic colleagues have attacked Republicans for the  proposal in the BCRA bill we have been considering.   What is really so outrageous about this is, we proposed the  Democratic solution. What we proposed was Bill Clinton's idea, as  ratified by every single Democrat serving in the Senate at the time,  including several who are still with us today. We proposed that we take  Medicaid and restructure it the way the Federal Government reimburses  States for their expenses so that we would put caps on the amount the  Federal Government would contribute per beneficiary. We would allow the  caps to grow, but just as President Clinton and all the Democrats in  the Senate suggested, we would make sure that growth eventually  converged to the growth of our economy so we would have a sustainable  program.   There are two big differences between what the Democrats proposed in  the mid-1990s and what many of us have proposed these last few weeks:   One, we proposed that the change occur more gradually. We suggested  that we would implement these  [[Page S4383]]  changes, but we do it over time, not suddenly, the way they had  proposed it.   The other big difference, I would suggest, is they proposed this  structural change to Medicaid before ObamaCare came along and made an  unsustainable program worse. We are proposing it in the aftermath of  that huge problem.   I get our Democratic colleagues have done a 180 reversal. I get they  no longer acknowledge that this is unsustainable. I get that they don't  want to do anything about entitlements. I understand all that. You are  entitled to change your opinion, you are entitled to decide you want to  ignore this issue, but it is a little bit over the top to attack our  motives, our integrity, when we are proposing exactly what they  themselves proposed just a few years ago under President Clinton.   I wish we could have a substantive discussion about the policy  without the character attacks.   Let me get into a little bit more about these changes to Medicaid.   As the Presiding Officer very well knows, traditionally, Medicaid was  available, from the time the program was launched, to four categories  of Americans--four categories of people who were of very low income and  were deemed to be unable to purchase healthcare for themselves. Those  are the elderly poor, disabled, blind and disabled children, and adults  with dependents. So the program set up a partnership with the States--a  generous partnership. The Federal Government has always paid a majority  of the costs, ranging anywhere in some States as high as 75 percent of  the costs and no State less than 50 percent--on average, 57 percent.   ObamaCare came along and created a new category of eligibility. Under  President Obama, for the first time--under ObamaCare--a new category  was created; that is, adults, working-aged, able-bodied people with no  dependents, would now be eligible for Medicaid if their income was  below 138 percent of the poverty line. The Federal Government would pay  all of the costs initially, and then after a short period of time, it  would go to 90 percent. Then the Federal Government would pay 90  percent in perpetuity.   Well, there are a few problems with this design. The most fundamental  and obvious is the Federal Government couldn't afford this. We were not  on a sustainable path before, and now we have created this whole new  liability which can only make it worse and bring a fiscal crisis closer  to the present.   The second thing is, when States have no skin in the game, we find  out they behave as though they have no skin in the game. When States  have to contribute only 10 percent of the cost--think about it. Every  dollar a State spends in this category gets matched with nine Federal  dollars, nine free dollars. That is a huge incentive to spend a lot,  and guess what. That is exactly what they have done. Medicaid spending  in this category has ended up being over 50 percent more than what was  expected.   So what did the Senate propose in our legislation? We proposed not  that we would disallow this coverage, not that we would eliminate this  category of eligibility, not that we would throw a single person off  Medicaid--we have said, in fact, we will codify the expansion. We will  make it permanent. No one loses eligibility, no one gets thrown off.   What we will do is gradually, over 7 years, we will ask States to pay  their fair share for this new category--this expansion category, the  able-bodied adults with no dependents. We will ask the States to pay  the same amount for these folks that they pay for the traditional four  categories of eligibility. That is the first category.   The second reform we proposed is what I alluded to earlier, the Bill  Clinton-Democratic Senate proposal of establishing per beneficiary  caps. That was in our legislation. What the underlying Senate bill did  was allow the spending to grow very rapidly on those caps. Only in the  eighth year did we ask that the growth rate slow down slightly so we  would have a reasonable chance so the growth in the program would be  about the same as the economy. That is what we proposed. That is what  was in the bill. That is what we have been hearing about--all of these  draconian cuts.    Let's get to the discussion about these cuts. We have another chart  that illustrates this because it has been a favorite theme for some of  my colleagues on the other side to talk about all of these cuts.   If you look at the CBO score--again, this is the Senate BCRA, the  legislation on which we didn't get enough votes this week to pass, but  I hope we will revisit it--the largest of the so-called cuts in  Medicaid spending comes from CBO's assumption that if you repeal the  individual mandate--the statute that says you must buy insurance, you  must have insurance--millions of people on Medicaid, millions of people  who did get free health insurance, will decide: Oh, I don't want free  health insurance anymore. If I am not being forced to buy it, I am not  going to take free healthcare. Why would I do that?   I don't know about you, but that is a little counterintuitive to me.  To my friend from Oregon who is attacking the so-called skinny bill,  100 percent of the so-called Medicaid cuts in that bill come from  exactly this source. The assumption is that, if people are not forced  by the government to have insurance, they will not want Medicaid. You  can decide how much credibility you want to put in that assumption. It  strikes me as ridiculous, but that is the truth. That is the reality of  the so-called CBO cuts in Medicaid.   In the BCRA, that was only the lion's share of the so-called cuts.  Another category of so-called cuts to Medicaid in the CBO analysis of  the BCRA are their assumptions about expansion. They decide that under  current law, if nothing else happens, a whole lot of States will choose  to become Medicaid expansion States.   They haven't made that choice yet. They can't point to which ones. It  is a political decision in the various States. They don't know who is  going to be leading those States. They have no idea about how that  would happen, but yet they predict States that have chosen thus far not  to be Medicaid expansion States would adopt the expansion under current  law. If we passed the law that was proposed earlier, those States would  not make that decision. Furthermore, some States that have expanded  will rescind the decision to expand.   Any honest person, including the folks at the CBO, have to  acknowledge that this is entirely speculative. They can't name a single  State that will expand under the current law but hasn't yet. They can't  name a single State that would rescind its expansion having already  done so. They are just speculating that could happen.   That, my friends, is the lion's share of the CBO's headline numbers  about all these cuts in Medicaid.   Let me go to chart 5. Despite that, even if you accept the CBO's  unbelievable assumptions that people only participate in Medicaid if  they are forced to and that these mysterious States will expand and  others will not--these are the draconian cuts--each and every year,  under the BCRA, Federal spending on Medicaid grows. It grows every  year--every single year. It is only in Washington that spending can  increase every year, and it is a draconian cut.   No, the truth of the matter is that what we do under that legislation  is that we slow down the rate of growth. We slow the rate at which the  program grows to a rate that is sustainable, so that this program is  viable, so that we are diminishing the certainty of a fiscal crisis.  That is what we do.   If somebody has a better idea for how we put Medicaid on a  sustainable path, I am all ears. I would love to hear it. In the 1990s,  our Democratic colleagues proposed exactly what we are proposing now.  That was a very constructive idea. Unfortunately, there wasn't a  consensus to do it, and that is a shame.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to go back to their notes, to go back  to the discussion, to go back to the arguments they were making  together with President Bill Clinton on the floor of this Senate and  around the country about Medicaid, because we are making those  arguments now. You would think we might be able to find some common  ground.   The fact is that Medicaid is a very, very important program. The most  vulnerable Americans depend on Medicaid to a very significant degree.  The fact is that, in its current form, it is unsustainable. Our  Democratic colleagues in the past used to recognize  [[Page S4384]]  this. They used to acknowledge this, and they used to want to do  something about it. I urge them to return to that attitude so that we  can work together and get something done.   The sooner we act on this, the sooner we can have gradual, sensible,  thoughtful reforms that make the program sustainable and allow our  States to plan for these changes and allow for a transition. If we wait  too long, the fiscal crisis that will hit us will force sudden and  draconian changes.   We are not going to vote on this provision today. This was embedded  in the BCRA. That is behind us this week, but it is my hope that we  will pass a version of ObamaCare repeal that will enable to us to go to  conference and that we will be able to begin to repair the enormous  damage to the individual markets that ObamaCare has done, that we will  be able to stabilize them, that we will be able to move in the  direction of consumers actually having control of their own healthcare  once again, and that we will put Medicaid on a sustainable path,  because the time is overdue.   I yield the floor.
