 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA Employee Fairness  Act. We rely on the work of dedicated healthcare professionals to care  for our veterans who risk their lives for our country. Yet, our laws do  not provide an adequate voice for those workers to ensure care is of  the highest quality.   The COVID-19 pandemic showed us why that voice is necessary.   This bill changes that by granting all VA healthcare providers the  same collective bargaining rights. It means that healthcare workers can  have a greater say in protecting patients, ensuring clinical  competence, and setting wages and benefits.   It would provide rights for over 100,000 VA doctors, nurses,  dentists, and chiropractors, including more than 350 nurses at the  Buffalo VA Medical Center.   I am proud to be one of 218 cosponsors of this bill on the floor  today, and I urge my colleagues to please support it.
