 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of Cullen Talton, the longest-serving active sheriff in  the Peach State, the State of Georgia.   After 51 years of serving his community, Mr. Talton has decided to  complete his final term serving Houston County before retiring. Sheriff  Cullen Talton was elected in 1972, and he served as a commissioner  before becoming a sheriff. He is known for being a trusted,  respectable, and devoted servant of the community.   To honor his many years of service and dedication, local leaders,  community members, and his family gathered at the Houston County Annex  before the commissioners meeting to celebrate the longtime sheriff.   I congratulate Sheriff Talton on his remarkable achievements and  well-deserved retirement. His dedication and years of service are  admirable and greatly appreciated.              Recognizing National Homelessness Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  November as National Homelessness Awareness Month.   In Georgia, over 10,000 people do not have housing. This includes  fathers, mothers, and nearly 700 veterans.   During this month of recognition, many groups across the country are  putting on events designed to help people struggling with homelessness.  Oliver Maner LLP in Savannah is one of the many groups helping to fight  homelessness during this month of recognition. Events such as Oliver  Maner's Donation Drive and the Homeless Veterans Stand Down event are  essential to highlighting and helping to fight this critical issue.   This month is a time when we come together as a community and as a  nation to reflect on the issue of homelessness and its impact on  countless lives. By raising awareness, we can show our support and help  those who need it the most because every family, especially veterans,  deserves a safe and stable home.                          Remembering Bill Miltiades     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Bill Miltiades, who passed away on August 31, 2023.   Bill was a knowledgeable and committed Realtor. For many years, he  had been dedicated to the success of the Savannah Area Realtors  Association. He served on countless boards and received many awards in  both his work and personal lives. This past year was Bill's 24th year  as a member of the Distinguished Sales Society.   Bill received his bachelor's degree at the University of Georgia and  his master's at the Institute of Textile Technology in Charlottesville,  Virginia. He started Bill Miltiades Management in 2011 and then became  a broker of his own realty company in 2018.   Bill was loved by many, including but not limited to his devoted  sister, Marta; brother-in-law, Sean; and his favorite person in the  world, his niece, Starlyn. He will always be remembered as a genuine  soul with endless kindness and care for the people around him. Bill was  very proud of his family, his country, his church, his friends, and his  community.                         Congratulating Connor Daniel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Connor  Daniel, who won sixth place at the Junior World FITASC Championship  this summer.   FITASC is a unique and difficult shooting sport. It requires  participants to keep their guns still until the shooting clay they are  targeting becomes visible.   This summer, Connor joined Team Beretta USA, an honor in its own  right. From there, he traveled and competed in the 2023 World FITASC  Sporting Championship Finale Beretta World Cup in Hungary. Connor said  that he is honored to have joined Team Beretta, and his results show  that he has represented them and his country well.   I again congratulate Connor on winning sixth place. I look forward to  seeing his sporting career continue to flourish.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I know it is hard to believe,  and I know that my friends across the other side of the aisle find it  hard to believe, but the Iranian regime is not our friend. They are no  friend to the U.S., nor to our allies.   It is not that we don't care. Yes, we do care. The Iranian regime is  one of the world's leaders in state sponsored terrorism, and they  cannot be appeased. We know that. That is why it was alarming when  President Biden freed up $6 billion in previously frozen funds for Iran  in September. I am glad that this was later refrozen due to the  pushback from my colleagues and I--who don't trust Iran any further  than we can pick them up and throw them--to use that money responsibly.   The expectation of receiving the funds no doubt contributed to the  uptick in terror we have seen in the Middle East. I think everyone  would agree with that.   According to our intelligence community, Iran provides $1 million a  year to foreign terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah.   On October 7, Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists brutally attacked  Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking over 200 hostages. This  legislation, the No Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act, places immediate  and mandatory sanctions on foreign financial institutions that  facilitate the transfer of the restricted Iranian funds covered under  President Biden's deal.   It is imperative that the $6 billion remains permanently off-limits  to the Iranian regime.   So long as President Biden and his administration continue to weaken  our country on the world stage, House Republicans stand ready to  respond with strength.   Mr. Chair, I look forward to voting for this legislation, and I urge  my colleagues to pass this vital legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of Cullen Talton, the longest-serving active sheriff in  the State of Georgia.   After 51 years of serving his community, Mr. Talton has decided to  complete his final term serving Houston County before retiring.
