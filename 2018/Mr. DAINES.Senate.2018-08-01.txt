 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Olivia Mitchell of Wheatland County.   At just 11 years old, Olivia took third place on her Americanism  essay at the Montana Department of the American Legion Auxiliary  convention. She wrote on a topic that is far beyond her years, serving  as a testament to her exemplary work. Olivia said she loves to write  and even finds it relaxing.   Olivia lives in Judith Gap and will soon be a sixth grader at Judith  Gap School. She is able to balance her school work and extracurricular  activities, including hunting, fishing, and sports with ease. Olivia  loves to hunt. She already has a mule deer under her belt and has a  goal to bag an elk and antelope next. She loves being outdoors and  hopes to visit Yellowstone National Park soon. Her values and work  ethic can be attributed to her loving parents, Lane and Christie  Mitchell, and her two younger sisters. Olivia is a compassionate leader  and loves to help her community.  [[Page S5580]]    I congratulate Olivia on her accomplishments. I look forward to  seeing her succeed as she continues to grow.                            ____________________
