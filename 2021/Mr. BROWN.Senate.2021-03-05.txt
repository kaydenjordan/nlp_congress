 Mr. President, every time banks need help and every time  large corporate interests need help, this body rises to the occasion,  but when it is a bunch of workers or a bunch of small businesses, we  are going to turn our backs? Unions, chambers of commerce, and small  businesses--pretty much everyone--agree we need to get this done.   I have listened for years to my colleagues' speeches extolling the  value of hard work and the virtues of small businesses. This is your  chance, my friends, to live up to your own words and help these  workers.   In collective bargaining, they negotiate at the bargaining table.  They gave up money today to put money in pensions for the future. If  you support working Americans, vote no on this motion. Let's pass a  solution which actually honors the dignity of work.    Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. Don't believe the  false argument that most of the funding goes to New York. In New  Jersey, they get the same treatment as everyone else.   The alternative formula offered by the amendment is indefensible. One  small city would get 2,400 times their annual transit budget.   And think about the workers. Think about the drivers and the clerks  who put themselves dealing with the public every single day and the  anxiety coming home at night about potentially having COVID. The way we  treat essential workers is crucial in this bill. If you care about  workers and if you care about the dignity of work, vote no on this  amendment.    Mr. President, may I ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds  also?    Thank you. The transit formula in the American Rescue Plan  Act is the exact same formula developed with Republicans, some of that  coming out of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee for the  relief bill we passed in December. This formula uses data and not  politics to allocate funds.                          Vote on Amendment No. 944
