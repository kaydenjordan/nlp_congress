 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the important  contributions of amateur radio operators in Arizona and across the  Nation.   Throughout our Nation's history, amateur radio has served an  important purpose. From providing a means of communication in times of  crisis, to assisting emergency operators in natural disasters, amateur  radio operators are an important part of the communities across our  country.   Arizona is home to at least 23,000 amateur radio operators and  hundreds of amateur radio groups and clubs. This week, the American  Radio Relay League will host their annual field day, where thousands of  amateur radio groups across the country will prepare for future crises.   Since 1933, amateur radio operators have practiced the rapid and  effective deployment of radio communications equipment through these  field day events.   I am honored to recognize the important contributions of amateur  radio operators, and I wish them a safe and effective field day this  weekend.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Bilirakis) for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3723, the Consumer Safety  Technology Act.   This is important legislation that helps the U.S. solidify its  position as a world leader in technology and innovation while  protecting our constituents.   This legislation builds on the American COMPETE Act, which sought to  remove burdensome regulatory barriers to promote American innovation  and consider how safely using artificial intelligence can transform the  future.   This is also a critical step in maintaining our global competitive  edge in emerging technologies over foreign adversaries like China. It  will make us less reliant on these bad actors for important  technologies.   The Consumer Safety and Technology Act establishes a pilot program to  explore how to safely use artificial intelligence to protect consumers  from unsafe products while advancing cutting-edge American innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
