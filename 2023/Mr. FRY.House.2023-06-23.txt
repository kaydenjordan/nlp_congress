 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday next.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Henry Williamson, an  aviation mechanic with 50 years of dedicated service, most of which he  spent working at the Conway-Horry County Airport.   Mr. Williamson, of Horry County, began his career in aviation after  receiving a degree in aircraft maintenance from the Florence-Darlington  Technical College.   In honor of his dedication to the industry as an aviation mechanic,  Mr.  [[Page H3131]]  Williamson was recently awarded the Charles Taylor Master Mechanic  Award from the Federal Aviation Administration. This is an award that  only 40 South Carolinians have ever received.   I want to express my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Williamson for  this much-deserved recognition and thank him for his dedication to  keeping his customers safe in the skies.                            ____________________
