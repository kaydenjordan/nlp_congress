 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for next week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who  is my friend and the majority leader of the House.    As it relates to the continuing resolution that I know  the gentleman said may come up, we haven't had any details that have  been shown to us on what that might look like in terms of other items  in addition to some kind of short-term or even what the duration of a  short term would be.   If there are any dates that the majority has already started thinking  about that would be included in a continuing  [[Page H7863]]  resolution, any extraneous items--there is some other funding that has  been thrown about. There has been talk about Senator Manchin, that  there may be some agreement that Senator Manchin would have some kind  of permitting reform. I am not sure if that would be a part of a  continuing resolution or a stand-alone bill.   If the gentleman could provide any clarification on any of those  items that we haven't been privy to in conversations, I yield to my  friend.    Obviously, we will be staying in touch on that.  Hopefully, Ms. Lofgren will have some conversations with Ms. Granger  about details because we haven't seen those yet. We surely would like  to be more involved in those discussions.    As we are more in the first half of September,  obviously, this would all be at the very end of September. Hopefully,  we wouldn't wait until the midnight hour. We are all aware of the  deadline.   Hopefully, we can get something brought, ideally agreed upon by both  sides, which we are nowhere near right now, but at least to have more  direct conversations well in advance of the deadline, so we are not  here watching the clock strike midnight wondering.     Hopefully, we can start seeing actual language next week  so we can either get to a place where we are in agreement or try to  resolve those areas of disagreement.   As the gentleman was talking about the calendar and other items that  may be coming up, I noticed there were no conversations about any of  the legislation that we have been talking about bringing to the floor  to address inflation.   We just saw Tuesday, as the President was holding a party at the  White House to celebrate inflation, we saw, yet again, more devastating  news on the inflation front, to the point where the markets tanked  during that party at the White House.   We have a package of bills that would help bring down inflation,  bring down energy costs, and help those families who are struggling as  we get ready to face another cold winter. There are expectations right  now by all the experts that energy costs will go up again because we  have limited supply here in the country.   As we identify those bills and yet not see any of them being listed  for debate on the House floor, can we try to get some kind of direction  on whether this majority will work with us to bring bills to the floor  to address these real problems that are hurting families all across the  country?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of different bills the  gentleman mentioned. Each one of them, by the way, when you rack them  up, adds up to trillions of dollars in new spending. If trillions in  Washington spending were going to solve the problem, then we would have  no inflation.   Obviously, it has gone the opposite direction, and it is going the  opposite direction because of the trillions of dollars in new spending  if you go down the line. Obviously, the gentleman went through all of  those things, and I would like to respond to a number of them because  it just doesn't mesh with the realities of where our economy is today.   If you look at the numbers--and we can talk about other countries-- other countries have passed bad policies that have wrecked their  economies. You can see Europe right now finally having a renewed debate  on energy policy because they passed some really foolish energy  policies that are destroying their energy economies and making them  more dependent on Russia, for example, to get their oil and to get  their natural gas. They are finally waking up.   A lot of them shut their nuclear plants down, which is safe, sound  nuclear energy. They wrecked their economies. They are starting to  reverse that. I am glad they are finally waking up and reversing  course.   It seems like right here in Washington the failed policies that  President Biden has put in place, they want to double down on. When you  look at the results of it, that is why we get where we are which is  double digit increases in food costs that our families are facing.  Electricity costs over 15 percent higher just over the last year, and  it is about to get worse because the bill that the President was  celebrating at the White House had another increase in taxes on natural  gas, which will raise those costs even higher.   Mr. Speaker, I will yield to the gentleman in a moment.    Mr. Speaker, electricity rates are 15.8 percent higher  than last year.    In America. This is all in America. Families that we  represent are facing the burden of all of these policies that started  in Washington that are ultimately ending up taking money out of their  pockets.    When you go to the grocery store--if you can afford to get there--if  you find the food on the shelves, it is 13\1/2\ percent higher. We have  seen the list, whether it is eggs, dairy products, bacon, some of them  are 30 percent higher individually, but it adds up to about 13\1/2\  percent more that you are paying at the grocery store.   Mortgage rates. If somebody is trying to become a first-time home  buyer, which is part of the American dream, today it is 110 percent  higher to get a mortgage than it was a year ago. Most economists,  including many Democrat economists, point to the trillions in spending  in Washington as the reason for that. Families have figured this out  and said: Stop the madness.   Yet, again, at the White House in the most tone-deaf thing I have  seen in a while, the President is having a party celebrating a $730  billion increase in taxes and spending at the exact same time that the  market is tanking because of the inflation created by all this  spending.   To finish it up, transportation costs are 11.3 percent higher. That  is what is happening in America.   Again, Europe did a lot of these same bad policies. They figured it  out, and  [[Page H7865]]  they are starting to reverse course. They just got rid of their Prime  Minister in England because of what they did to wreck their energy  economy.   We brought bills--as I shared with the gentleman over months--we have  brought a number of bills forward that would solve these problems, and  not one of them has been scheduled for a vote on the House floor. We  want to address this problem. We don't just sit back and go: Well, it  is happening in other countries, so let it stay racking up in America.  It doesn't need to.   These are all unforced errors that are the result of failed policies,  and instead of stopping the failed policies and working with  Republicans to turn it around and lower these costs, it seems like  there is a desire to just double down and talk about trillions more to  spend.   If spending was solving the problems, then we would have none of  these problems. The problems have gotten worse with each multi-trillion  or multi-hundred-billion-dollar package of legislation that has come  out of this body.   At some point, I would hope that the other side would look and  recognize and say, okay, forget about Europe and Asia. They need to  look in the mirror and say, why did they create some of their problems?   We can do something about these problems. We brought those ideas  forward, and every single time we have been told no, which must mean  that this is okay. Because this is not okay to us, and there is a way  to reverse it.   If just spending more money and having parties at the White House to  celebrate that spending while Rome is burning is where we are going to  be, I think there is going to be a day of reckoning on that. I don't  think the country is comfortable where we are. And when the idea is to  just keep spending more money and act like--maybe it is another $5  trillion--what is the number that is going to finally get us out of  this mess? If it was trillions, we would be there already.   Maybe, just maybe, we need to look at going the other way. Stop  paying people not to work, for example, when everybody is looking for  workers. Unfortunately, the IRS is looking for 87,000 more people. And  as CBO just confirmed, a lot of that is going to be going after  hardworking families, families making under $400,000 a year, even  though we were promised on this floor that wouldn't happen.   We brought an amendment to ensure that President Biden's promise  would be upheld. We brought an amendment that would say and ensure no  American making under $400,000 would see their taxes go up with these  87,000 new IRS agents. The majority rejected that amendment. Literally,  the day of the vote, the Congressional Budget Office came out and  confirmed that it is over $20 billion in new taxes.   That bill is going to cost families making less than $400,000. Those  families are already struggling. They would love to save up and buy a  new house. They can't even afford to get to the grocery store to pay  13\1/2\ percent more. If they try to go get a mortgage today, they are  going to be paying more than double for that mortgage than they were a  year ago.   At some point we have got to stop these failed policies that are  causing these problems. Go look at what some of these other countries  are doing to finally reverse course because they are, and they need to,  but so do we. I would hope that we would bring some of those bills to  the House floor because we could start reversing these horrible trends  now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, first, to clarify, it wasn't me who said  that the IRS agents, this new army of 87,000 IRS agents, would be going  after people to collect $20 billion more in taxes who were making less  than $400,000.   It was the Congressional Budget Office who put in their report the  day of the vote that that is exactly what would happen, is that those  IRS agents would, in fact, be going after people making less than  $400,000, to the tune of $20 billion in new taxes.   We brought an amendment to stop that from happening, to say they  can't go after those people making less than $400,000, which is what  the President promised. The Congressional Budget Office report was  right there, saying $20 billion is what they would pay in new taxes.  The majority rejected the amendment. So clearly, the intention was to  have those IRS agents go after them.   Again, those weren't my numbers. That was the Congressional Budget  Office. If there is a dispute the gentleman has, take it up with them.  But they were the ones who came out with that report the day of the  vote. Maybe that was why the bill was rushed through. But we pointed  that out, and no one disputed that the Congressional Budget Office put  those numbers out there.   But the President still kept saying, don't worry. They are not going  to go after them, not a dime. But CBO said $20 billion in new taxes  those low- and middle-income families will pay. We tried to stop it.  The majority rejected it.   Now, to go to the oil and gas comments the gentleman made about  President Biden, you would think, listening to your comments, that Joe  Biden was John D. Rockefeller, and he is drilling everywhere. Well,  let's first----     And I won't say the gentleman did, but as the gentleman  talked about all this production and drilling that is going on and all  this oil that is coming out, it was Joe Biden who said, as a candidate,  ``no more drilling on Federal lands. No more drilling, including  offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill,  period.''   Then he carried out policies to back that up and stop drilling.   We have pointed out many times, major companies in America that want  to increase production, as the gentleman did say, that they are not  increasing production. They tried, and they have been rejected on the  permits they would need.   You can't just go drill a new hole tomorrow. Every well ultimately  depletes. We all know that. That has been going on since man invented  the ability to drill for oil in the world. So as oil depletes, you need  to get new permits to go into these areas. The Biden administration,  over and over again, rejected those new permits.   So there are leases out there. Again, a lease might be like you have  a car. You have got a car in your driveway. Well, if you don't have an  engine in the car, the car is not functional.   If you have a lease, the lease doesn't do you any good if you can't  get the permits to build pipelines. We have talked about the pipeline  problems as this administration, over and over again, has blocked new  pipelines.   How do you move the oil? How do you get the permit to go and explore  for more?   So what the President did--again, if we were just maxed out on  drilling here, why did the President get on Air Force One and fly 5,700  miles to Saudi Arabia to beg them to produce more oil? They said no  because they don't have the ability over there.   The President called Vladimir Putin and asked him to drill for more  oil. Putin said no.   You don't need to ask those countries to produce more oil because we  have it here, but there is documented evidence, over and over, where  this administration has said no to permits, no to the ability for us to  produce more of our own energy.   So what happens? The price goes up. They are talking about, during  this winter, the inability for people to have home heating oil. So they  are importing it from countries like Russia because they are not  allowing more production here, where companies are trying to produce  more and being turned down by this administration.   The Secretary--I think it was the Secretary of Energy--when asked,  what is your plan to produce more in America, she started laughing. It  is not a laughing matter, but that has been the attitude of this  administration.   To finish up on the point where the gentleman started talking about  all these bills that we voted against, starting with the $1.9 trillion  spending bill that this administration came right out of the box with.  As the economy was starting to turn around, and people were starting to  bring workers back, trying to get workers back, a $1.9 trillion package  of bills came forward to pay people, in part, not to work, to stay at  home; made it harder for people to get workers back.   But what it also did--and this is something we brought up during the  debate--checks were being sent to people.   Well, we pointed out that checks were going to end up going to people  in prisons, and we were told that wasn't going to happen. Just like  with the 87,000 IRS agents, when CBO debunked that. Don't worry; nobody  in prison is going to get checks. Turned out later, the Boston bomber  got a check.   Who knows how many billions of dollars went to prisoners to be paid-- taxpayers are already paying for them to be housed, to be fed, to get  healthcare. But then they also got checks, actual checks in stimulus  money. We had an amendment to stop that from happening.   But ultimately, yes, we voted against those things because we wanted  to see our economy back open.   When there was this idea that everybody had to stay home, that wasn't  the case when we started last year. In fact, many States started to  open again. There were some States that stayed shut down.   By the way, you can see a massive movement around the country, where  New York State alone lost about a million people who moved to States  like Florida because they didn't want to be shut down anymore when  there was a State that was open, following safety protocols, protecting  their people, but allowing people to live in freedom again and live  their lives.   So people moved out of States, the shut down States like California  and New York and moved to States that were open. You can see the  numbers, and they are dramatic numbers.    So not every State handled it the same. But the States that opened  were  [[Page H7867]]  having a lot more success in protecting their people at the same time,  but the States that stayed closed had devastating consequences.   Not to mention what we saw with children being shut out of school,  the learning that wasn't happening. Those are devastating numbers we  are seeing today because this administration changed the science--and  that is documented--changed the science over at CDC to cater to the  unions who wanted to keep schools shut down. So millions of kids didn't  learn at the levels they should have, and those numbers are still  showing up today, that those kids were left behind; lost a year or 2  years they will never get back because other kids were in school  learning, when the unions wanted to work with the Biden administration  to keep schools shut down.   So those are the things that we tried to address. None of those bills  were allowed to come to the floor. But that is where we are.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, if Joe Biden wants to keep producing more  energy, we are giving him opportunities, but he says no. He said ``no''  many times, and he campaigned on that. We will continue to push to  bring those bills to the floor.   We are going to continue to push to bring bills to the floor to solve  a lot of these problems that we have identified, and we have bills to  address them. If the majority doesn't want to bring them up, I  understand. That is the prerogative of the majority, but we are going  to still keep talking about them.   We are going to still keep pushing every opportunity we can to bring  down inflation, to lower energy costs, and to address so many of these  other problems that people are still facing today.   If that single mom who is working as a waitress two shifts is going  to be audited by some new IRS agent who is tasked, under the terms that  we saw, with going out and generating that money, if the result of that  is that she has to pay more money, it doesn't mean she is cheating on  her taxes. If all of a sudden an auditor is coming after you, who knows  what kind of pressure they are putting?   But it is 87,000 more IRS agents tasked with going and generating not  $20 billion. The $20 billion is just for the people making under  $400,000. It is over $250 billion that some of the numbers show that  they have to generate, meaning they are going to have to go out and  find that from taxpayers.   That doesn't mean every one of those people they audit is a tax  cheat. It just means that person is going to now face an audit who  otherwise is working two or three shifts to meet the demands of these  higher costs that they are facing because of inflation.   We are going to continue fighting for those hardworking families and  fighting to lower the burden on this government, take some of that heat  off so they can spend more time at home with their family, not working  two or three shifts or worrying about the next audit they are going to  face from a new IRS agent who is told to go generate more money.  Hopefully, we can address that. We will continue to push for that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, we will continue to be honest with the  American people. It was the administration that used the 87,000 number.  If that number should be lower, I would love to hear what that number  would be.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland. If the gentleman  has a number, please tell me because that is what we heard from the  administration.    We will continue to tell the truth about these policies.  Clearly, there is a disagreement on many of them, but that is why we  have this debate. I look forward to continuing it with the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
