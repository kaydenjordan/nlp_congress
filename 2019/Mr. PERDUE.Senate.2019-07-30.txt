 Madam President, today I wish to recognize the  members of the Greenbrier Middle School STEM Competition Team from  Evans, GA: Jordan Epstein, Emily Forshee, Kendall Schneller, Carissa  Veriato, and Sam Weinstein, as well as their teacher, Mr. David  Phillips.   Last October, the team competed in the STEAM competition at Augusta  University. The team designed, built, and launched a rocket that was  powered by water pressure and carrying a chicken egg. The rocket  successfully landed in the landing zone that was only 30 feet in  diameter.   The team won grand prize in that competition for middle school  engineering, and received an invitation to the International Young STEM  Maker Competition at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. They were the  only American team to have received an invite.   The team worked to design a house that was powered by water as well  as a new concept for electric vehicles. Out of 111 teams from around  the globe, Greenbrier was awarded second place for their work. On top  of that, the team's faculty leader, Mr. David Phillips, was awarded  second place in the Best STEM Teacher competition.   These bright young people and the teachers who guide them have made  the State of Georgia and all of America very proud. Please join me in  congratulating Mr. Phillips and all members of  [[Page S5193]]  the Greenbrier Middle School STEM Competition Team for their incredible  achievements. Thank you.                            ____________________
