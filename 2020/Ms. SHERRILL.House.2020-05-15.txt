 Mr. Speaker, to date, 10,000 New Jerseyans have lost  their lives to coronavirus; 1.1 million, their jobs.   The toll of the pandemic on New Jersey cannot be understated, nor can  the need for additional relief. That is why I fought for desperately  needed aid for State and local governments, a repeal of the SALT cap,  increased funding for hospitals, testing, tracing, and PPE.    In these times, we must stand together as a Nation. We must be bold,  we must be resolute, and we must be brave.
