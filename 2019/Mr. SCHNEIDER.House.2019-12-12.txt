 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with a grieving  nation to honor the lives of three Navy sailors whose lives were  tragically cut short in the heinous act of terrorism at the Naval Air  Station in Pensacola, Florida.   Kaleb Watson of Coffee County, Alabama, and a recent graduate of the  U.S. Naval Academy was 23 years old, and an aspiring pilot.   Mohammed Sameh Haitham was an all-star athlete and always anxious to  help others. His 20th birthday would have been next week.   Cameron Walters of Richmond Hill, Georgia, was 21 and hoped to become  an airman. According to Cameron's father, nothing made him prouder than  to be able to wear the uniform of a United States sailor.   When confronted with the mortal threat of an active shooter, these  sailors charged the gunman, an action that is credited with saving  countless lives.   Mr. Speaker, Naval Station Great Lakes is in my district. Each year,  more than 40,000 pass through Great Lakes to become sailors in the  United States Navy. Cameron Walters and Mo Haitham were two such  sailors.   The men and women who hear the call to duty and volunteer to wear the  cloth of our Nation are role models for all of us. Let us take this  time to recognize their commitment and let us commit as a Nation to  ensure the heroic sacrifices of Kaleb Watson, Cameron Walters, and  Mohammed Haitham will never be forgotten.
