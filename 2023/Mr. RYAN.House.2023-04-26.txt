 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in  strong opposition to the default on America act.   I risked my life in combat because I believe in this country, our  strength, and our compassion. This bill falls far short of those  American values.   In New York alone, my home State, it threatens food assistance to  54,000 people and cuts preschool and childcare for 17,000 kids. It puts  at risk Meals on Wheels for over 1 million seniors nationwide. It would  cut $30 billion in support to our veterans.   I don't know about my colleagues, but I believe in a country where we  don't let our kids and our seniors go hungry, and we never break faith  with our veterans.   The cuts in this bill are just cruel, and they would have  catastrophic consequences for American families.   In combat, it was my sacred duty to make sure we left no one behind.  This bill leaves far too many Americans behind.   I implore my colleagues from both parties to instead pass a clean  debt ceiling increase.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion  to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
