 Madam Speaker, May marks National  Preservation Month. This year's theme is ``People Saving Places.''   This Congress can do that by supporting the Historic Tax Credit  Growth and Opportunity Act. This bipartisan bill, which I introduced  with Congressmen LaHood and Blumenauer, builds on the success and  lasting benefits of the Federal historic tax program.   Over the last two decades, my western New York community has seen  over $1.2 billion of investments in more than 250 rehab projects made  possible thanks to historic tax credits.   Across the Nation, historic tax credits have driven $122 billion in  private investment and supported millions of jobs.   By restoring and expanding the historic tax credit program through  the Historic Tax Credit Growth and Opportunity Act, we give the country  an opportunity to rebuild stronger and communities the tools to invest  in the revitalization of their neighborhoods.                            ____________________
