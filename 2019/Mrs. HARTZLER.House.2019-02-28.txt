 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Police  Chief Lyn Woolford of the Ashland, Missouri, Police Department for  being voted America's Favorite Crossing Guard.   Chief Woolford was recently selected the winner of a contest  sponsored by Safe Kids Worldwide, a nonprofit organization that works  on behalf of families and communities to keep children safe from  injuries. As a result of this competition, the Ashland School District  will receive $10,000 to improve pedestrian safety.   Chief Woolford can be seen every schoolday guarding intersections  near Ashland's schools to make sure that children get across the road  safely, and the children--many of whom, along with their parents, voted  for him online--love him.   It is not unusual to see Chief Woolford wearing colorful hats and  outfits as he guides the children safely across the road. It might be a  bright chicken hat or a multicolored parrot hat. No matter the hat, the  mission is the same: to brighten the children's day and to see that  they get to school safely.   Through his actions, the children have a community role model and a  beloved friend in their local police department. Ashland Police Chief  Lyn Woolford epitomizes the service of our law enforcement officials  and deserves our thanks and appreciation.   Congratulations, Chief Woolford. You truly are making a difference.                            ____________________
