 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and the chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee for his distinguished leadership.   I thank our Speaker for her persistent leadership.   I thank all of the Democratic Members and Republican Members who  understand what this legislation is.   It is a survival cash payment for Americans making under a certain  amount, which means they are on the survival pathway.   Maybe they haven't spoken to the constituents of, I believe, probably  90 percent of the Members of this Congress who have said they are on  the edge and they are about to go over. They can't pay their rent or  buy food. They are in food distribution lines. Before I came here  Sunday, I was at a church, and we were giving out food.   I asked during the spring for $3,000. I was willing to go for $600 so  that desperate Americans could get enough to survive.   Mr. Speaker, I am supporting this. I ask my friends and colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to recognize that, when you are privileged to  stand in a place like this where the constitutional Fathers gave us the  opportunity to lead this government, stand for the American people.   I support the CASH Act because it is survival for Americans.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong support of  the CASH Act, a bill to provide $2,000 in direct payments to  individuals.   It was welcomed news that the President signed the COVID-19 relief  bill that also includes the Omnibus Appropriations for Fiscal Year (FY)  2021.   This bill:   Accelerates vaccine distribution and crushes the coronavirus;   Provides rent, food, unemployment, and direct payment to put money in  the Pockets of the American People through: direct payments worth up to  $600 per adult or child;   Averts the sudden expiration of Unemployment Insurance benefits for  millions and added a $300 per week UI enhancement for Americans out of  work;   Delivers key tax benefits for Struggling Families--through changes to  the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit that help ensure  that families who faced unemployment or reduced wages during the  pandemic are able to receive a strong tax credit based on their 2019  income;   Provides strong support for Small Businesses by providing: $284  billion for first and second forgivable PPP loans, $15 billion in  dedicated funding for live venues, independent movie theaters, and  cultural institutions, and $20 billion for targeted EIDL Grants which  are critical to many smaller businesses on Main Street;   Funds Education, Child Care & Students by providing: $82 billion in  funding for colleges and schools, and $10 billion for childcare  assistance to help get parents back to work and keep childcare  providers open;   Provides Pell Grant expansion to reach 500,000 new recipients,  ensuring more than 1.5 million students will now receive the maximum  benefit; and  [[Page H9157]]    Supports the Global Fight Against COVID--with an additional $3.36  billion for a total of $4 billion for GAVI, the international vaccine  alliance, recognizing that we are not truly safe until the whole world  is safe from the coronavirus.   I will vote for the CASH Act because it increases direct payments to  individuals from a $600 direct payment to $2000, which will help  families struggling with the economic impacts of COVID-19.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as  of December 23, 2020, that 18,170,062 cases of COVID-19 resulting in  321,734 deaths had been reported in the United States.   The new year will mark a terrible milestone for the United States-- the last time we saw death like this in our nation was during the 1918  Flu Pandemic, which recorded a total of 675,000 deaths in the United  States.   What the costs will be to our nation for the over three-hundred  thousand deaths have yet to be fully calculated.   It is a tragedy that too many households who have lost a member to  COVID-19 are struggling to accept these deaths, but it is also the  friends, co-workers, business owners, professionals, students,  teachers, wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, and  grandparents who also are feeling these losses because someone that  mattered to them is no longer here.   Each of these lives could have had dozens of connections with other  people who were not able to be with them during their final moments on  this earth who are lost to us because we too often only consider the  immediate household.   My deepest concerns are for the medical professionals who are seeing  more death than soldiers who have fought on battlefields in defense of  our nation since World War II.   Death every day for medical professionals who pride themselves on  robbing death by keeping the very ill or critically injured alive are  themselves wounded by each loss in ways that we cannot understand.   Too many of our medical professionals are losing that battle with  death as they attempt to treat extremely ill COVID-19 patients because  they do not have access to: sufficient amounts of essential therapies,  or the special trained staff to administer interventions that could  save lives.   Medical people also have not had the universal support of political  leaders who are willing to promote wearing of face coverings, social  distancing, and handwashing to limit the spread of severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the infection that  causes COVID-19.   There is a hidden cost to the fool-hearty disregard for the  seriousness of this moment in American history.   My concerns are for the economic impact and the long-term damage to  our nation's health care delivery system.   Today we will focus on the economic injuries caused by COVID-19, and  I look forward to working with my colleagues on addressing the systemic  long-term issues caused by unequal access to the health care.   Small businesses and working men and women of this great nation are  the life blood of the economy, and who pay the lion share of federal  taxes, now find themselves, through no fault of their own, in need of  assistance in the form of direct payments that will provide a bridge to  them and to the economy for the next few weeks so that the next  Administration will have time to assess and craft the relief package  needed to get the nation over the last hurdles of the pandemic's  economic impact.   Since the 1980s, corporate income tax revenues have become a smaller  share of overall tax revenues paid to the federal government.   In 2017, President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-97, which  substantially and permanently changed the U.S. federal tax system for  the wealthy and large corporations.   Most of the changes to the individual income tax system in P.L. 115- 97 for those less well off are temporary and scheduled to expire at the  end of 2025, after which the rates for these individuals will return to  what it was for 2017.   In contrast, many of the tax cuts made in P.L. 115-97 affecting  corporations and wealthy individuals are permanent, in other words they  will keep the drastic cut in corporate taxes.   The facts are that working individuals and small businesses support  the U.S. government's federal tax system.   The largest source of revenue to the federal government is the  individual income tax, which in 2019, generated $1.7 trillion.   The second-largest source of federal revenue is payroll taxes, which  is collected by employers and is often paid quarterly.   In FY2019, payroll taxes generated $1.2 trillion in federal revenue  or thirty-six percent of the total revenue for the federal government.   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that federal income  tax revenues in FY2020 will be $1.5 trillion, and payroll tax revenue  will be $1.3 trillion.   In FY2020, it is projected that about 47 percent of federal revenue  will be generated through the individual income tax.   In FY2019, corporate tax receipts were only $230 billion, or nearly 7  percent of federal revenue, and in FY2020, corporate tax receipts are  expected to be $151 billion, less than 5 percent of federal revenue.   Receipts from other sources are also projected to increase in FY2020  to $298 billion, from $271 billion in FY2019, which will result in 9  percent of total revenue up from 8 percent the previous year.   Obligated social insurance federal program payments for Social  Security and Medicare are paid through payroll taxes and are expected  to generate an additional estimated $1.3 trillion, or 35 percent of  revenue in FY2020.   The $2,000 in payments to individuals will be used to pay bills,  rent, utilities, car notes, or purchase needed items like winter coats,  and other essentials, which will translate into income for small  businesses.   All of this spending will generate local, state, and federal tax  revenue as it fuels consumption and the provision of services that are  still available through the economy.   Overtime basic Keynesian economics has proven itself to be a reliable  economic model and has repeatedly proven that money turning over in the  economy makes more money.   There is a reason why it is important to stimulate the economy during  a deadly unchecked pandemic, the chief of which is its depression of  the national and global economies resulting in a downturn creating  recession conditions.   We know the end of the COVID-19 pandemic's vice on the economy is  insight with the delivery of a vaccine, but we are not there yet--we  must help the American people, and most importantly our small  businesses, endure until we reach seventy percent herd immunity.   The use of direct payments is the Keynesian solution that is winning  the day across the globe for countries able to support their economies  in this way.   Payments to individuals allow them and not the government to make  spending decisions on their household's essential life-sustaining needs  such as paying for housing, utility bills, food, and clothing which  allows money they spend to circulate through the economy like blood  throughout the body.   People in this nation can and should be trusted to make decisions  regarding how they spend the funds provided by the stimulus because  they know their needs.   Consumers will spend money with small businesses who should have the  freedom to pay their workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers will  be free to buy goods from other businesses, and those businesses will  pay their workers and suppliers, and so on.   In this way, the $2,000 in spending by each individual is actually  spent more than once as the effect of each dollar spent creates more  spending.   This is called the expenditure multiplier effect: an initial increase  in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy, and has a larger  impact than the initial $2,000 amount spent.   The economy needs to be inoculated against recession, which is what  the $2,000 in individual payments will do, and it will need a booster  in about thirty to sixty days.   If the overwhelming majority of those who will receive the $2,000  were planning to put it in a bank account and not spend it, then this  bill would not be needed because the basic needs of the people would be  satisfied, but we know this is not the case.   No one is benefiting from the COVID-19 economy.   The U.S. poverty rate has grown at a historic rate over the past five  months, with 7.8 million Americans falling into poverty after the  expanded $600 a week in unemployment assistance expired at the end of  July.   This represents the greatest increase since the government began  tracking poverty sixty years ago.   In the city of Houston, nine key service sectors accounted for  seventy percent of all jobs lost which totaled 1,343,600.   Houston workers lost jobs in the following areas:   Healthcare 391,000; retail 303,600; food service 267,000; finance  166,000; private education 63,400; arts and entertainment 37,400;  accommodations 28,700; air transportation 20,200; and other services  115,800.   In addition to these positions, jobs were also lost in other areas,  the largest of which was construction which shut down 30,700 jobs;  professional and business services followed, with 25,300 jobs lost,  although 13,900 were in temporary and provisional jobs in employment  services; upstream oil lost 12,300 in March/April; and non-oil  manufacturing lost 7,700 jobs.   Americans out of work due to COVID-19 have generated 86 million  jobless claims, with  [[Page H9158]]  new claims being filed in recent weeks topping 800,000.   Millions of Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic have  fallen thousands of dollars behind on rent and utility bills, a clear  warning sign that people are running out of money for basic needs.   If this is not enough evidence of what is happening, look at the  miles of vehicles lined up outside of food distribution centers for  assistance; we have all seen this occurring in each of our states.   Moody's Analytics warned in November 2020 that 9 million renters said  they were behind on rent, according to a Census Bureau survey.   The Bureau of the Census reports that twenty-one percent of all  renters are behind on their rent, of which twenty-nine percent of Black  families and seventeen percent of Hispanic households are behind on  theirs.   The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's analysis of persons who  were employed prior to the pandemic reports that 1.3 million of these  households are now an average of $5,400 in debt on rent and utilities,  after those people had lost jobs and their family's income dropped.   The new COVID-19 stimulus bill, already agreed to by both the House  and Senate and signed by President Trump, restores unemployment  assistance, but cuts that assistance from $600 a week to $300 a week  without consideration for the facts on the ground for the millions of  Americans who remain out of work due to COVID-19 public health policy,  and have been without sufficient income since August 1, 2020.   In fact, the decision about a $600 a week in addition to unemployment  benefits is a good idea for those in labor markets with high costs of  living like New York and Washington, D.C., but may have far outstripped  the going rate for labor and the actual cost of living where the  spending power of $600 exceeded market costs for living expenses.   The Congress may need to revisit models for future programs of this  type and provide a formula that is based on the actual spending power  of funds provided so the ability of meeting the cost-of-living needs  can be more in line with the intent of the funds provided.   This may mean that, depending on where someone lived at the time a  disaster of this nature was declared, the amount they would qualify for  receiving may be different depending on the spending power of a dollar  where they live.   Today, we have twenty million Americans who are receiving some kind  of unemployment aid, and about 12 million of the unemployed stopped  receiving their benefits.   The nation is on the cusp of a recession that is in danger of  becoming a double-dip event that would plummet the economy into a  precarious economic state that will take much more than a $2,000  payment to each individual to overcome.   For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting for  the CASH Act to increase individual payments from $600 to $2,000.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong opposition to the Administration's seemingly callous veto of the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021 and proudly announce my intention to vote to override  this reckless veto.   I take this action because I disagree with the President that  preserving monuments and memorials and naming military installations  for the defenders of slavery who took up arms against the United States  to achieve their aims is more important and a higher priority than  providing the funding, resources, and support to the nation's military  and civilian defense person, one of the nation's most respected  institutions and its most diverse and representative.   Other than his pique at being on the short end of what is by his own  account an Electoral College landslide and being routed by seven  million votes in his failed bid for reelection, there is absolutely no  basis for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan NDAA  and deny our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty  pay many of whom live in or are from my congressional district.   It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a Commander-in-Chief to deny  to more than 100,000 federal employees the paid family leave child  care, housing and health protections authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or  to withhold from our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve.   The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, negotiated under the careful  stewardship of Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Ranking Member Mac  Thornberry in the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman  James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ranking Member Jack Reed of Rhode Island  is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation reflecting the nation's  sacred commitment to those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes,  and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution.   The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought after benefit for tens of  thousands of Vietnam-era veterans who are struggling with certain  health complications after being exposed to Agent Orange while serving  their country.   In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 billion in military  construction projects to fortify critical infrastructure and base  realignment and closure clean up, it contains important new tools to  deter adversaries China and Russia from attacking or threatening our  national interests; and mandates reforms to make the Pentagon more  efficient, innovative, and cost-effective.   In the legislation there are significant bipartisan provisions to  strengthen our posture on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and  to fortify our alliance with NATO and our security relationship with  Israel.   With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, expectant mothers in the  military could receive free loaner maternity uniforms because the  legislation directs the Department of Defense to conduct a pilot  program to issue maternity uniforms and related items to pregnant  military members on a temporary and as-needed basis.   Madam Speaker, this is important because women make up about 21  percent of the Air Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent of the  Army; and 9 percent of the Marine Corps.   Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed reforms to prevent sexual assault,  a matter of great importance to the public and my colleagues,  particularly those of us from Texas, where Fort Hood is located and  where Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was murdered to prevent her from  reporting the sexual harassment and abuse she suffered from her direct  superior in the chain of command.   I am very grateful to Congressman Brown of Maryland, himself a  veteran of the Armed Services, for his leadership in ensuring the NDAA  authorize and approve the renaming of military bases currently named  for persons who took up arms for the Confederacy and against the United  States.   I am very pleased that included in the legislation is my language  directing the consideration be given to distinguished and heroic  African-American and Native American servicemembers in the renaming of  military bases.   Removing the stain of bases and military installations being name for  confederate traitors is an act of profound reconciliation and healing.   For too long African Americans servicemembers have been forced to  tolerate the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the rebel  flag, knowing through oral history the brutality of those who  voluntarily fought for the Confederacy.   The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlightened era where the names of  traitors who took up arms against the United States will have their  names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations.   These individuals will not be forgotten; instead they will have a  permanent place in history and their records will be studied and  examined in full by historians and scholars.   Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that FY2021 NDAA directs the  Department of Defense to take concrete actions to recognize and  memorialize the contributions made by African Americans and Native  Americans servicemembers in defense of our nation.   The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.   In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.   At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors answered the call and were decisive  in the nation's epic battles for freedom and liberty, including:   Revolutionary War (1776-1783); War of 1812 (1812-1814); Mexican- American War (1836); Civil War (1861-1865); Spanish-American War  (1898); World War I (1914-1918); World War II (1941-1945); Korean War  (1950-1953); Vietnam War (1965-1975); Gulf War (1991); and Operations  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war.  [[Page H9162]]    The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming danger--when the fate  of the American Experiment was on the line.   Our thanks to the military for always answering the call of duty-- whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of day--we  know that we can count on you.   The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but today we have the  opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young men and  women who preserved freedom in the world, even at a time when the  blessings of liberty were denied to them at home.   The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 NDAA recognizes that there is  no shortage of distinguished veterans, and especially African American  and Native American veterans, who are worthy of the honor of naming a  military facility in their honor.   Let me provide for the record some representative candidates.                              UNITED STATES ARMY    General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black four-star general in the  Army and 1951 West Point graduate who attended the service academy  before the Army was desegregated and served in Korea and Vietnam, with  valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a training officer as part  of the U.S. military support mission in Liberia. He went on to become  the first black commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, deputy chief  of staff for operations in U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces  Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO Military Committee.   William Harvey Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, while a member of the 54th  Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black  regiment.   The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.   Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''   The ``Six Triple Eight'' unit was instrumental in establishing and  maintaining morale because it assured that mail from the battlefront  and the home-front flowed efficiently and timely.   Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army Nurse Corps was the first  nurse to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.                              UNITED STATES NAVY    Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, when he acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, the  USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor.   He was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the  third highest honor awarded by the United States Navy at the time.   Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Rushmore.   She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe, and commander of Allied Joint Force Command  Naples.                           UNITED STATES AIR FORCE    In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell became the first  female African American fighter pilot in the Air Force history and her  flights in Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly  combat missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing and the first African  American woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has logged more than  1,110 hours in the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.   Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air  Force to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her  retirement in 1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman  in the Air Force.   In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. became the first African  American Major General in the United States Air Force. As the organizer  and commander of famed 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee  Airmen, his place in history will be forever remembered and revered.   General Davis received many decorations during his career, including  two Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star and on December 9,  1998, General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President  Bill Clinton.                          UNITED STATES COAST GUARD    Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known for writing letters for  his shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him  promoted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959.   Haley ultimately received a number of military honors, including the  American Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an  honorary degree from the Coast Guard Academy but most of you know him  also as the author of ``Roots,'' the path-breaking and epic retracing  of a family's history from the Gambian coast in Africa to the New World  in America.   In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.   Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today's active duty military is  comprised of persons of color, of which 17.8 percent are African  American.   This percentage outpaces the percentage of African Americans in the  general population (13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% of  African Americans in the commissioned officer ranks.                               NATIVE AMERICANS    The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during House consideration of the  NDAA was expanded to include Native Americans.   It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to the securing our nation since colonial times  to the present.   One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become ``code talkers.''   Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.   The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.   The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.   This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing  codebreaking machines.   The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.   During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.   Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.   The Navajo Code was never broken.   Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.                           BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS    Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the  NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the  extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic  terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of  white supremacy, such as extremist groups like the Boogaloo Boys and  the Proud Boys, is reflected in the Conference bill.   The concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.   We have witnessed too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes and  Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity to coopt or to provide cover for attacks.   Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email,   The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.   The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.   For all these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting to  override the President's unwise and ill-considered veto of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021.
