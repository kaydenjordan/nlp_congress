 Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, Congress  appropriately gave 18 standing ovations  [[Page H10060]]  in appreciation for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from Ukraine for  stopping war criminal Putin's invasion.   His address to the joint meeting of Congress was historic and  heartfelt. Sadly, the world is in a competition between democracies  with rule of law as opposed to autocrats by rule of gun. The first  target is Ukraine with clear warnings to Moldova, Georgia, Taiwan,  Israel, and America.   The resolve and courage of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian  people have unified Republicans and Democrats, NATO with Finland and  Sweden, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Australia  supporting Ukraine.   President Zelenskyy is a symbol of freedom and courage for Ukraine  and all who cherish democracy and oppose murderous invasion maintaining  borders.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan's safe haven to America.   God bless Ukraine. God bless President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine  will achieve victory for a merry Christmas.                            ____________________
