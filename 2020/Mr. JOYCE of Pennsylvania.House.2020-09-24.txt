 Mr. Speaker, during National Small  Business Week, I join with my fellow Americans in honoring workers,  entrepreneurs, and the small business community.   From farms and factories to shops and cafes, small businesses employ  hardworking Americans and provide important goods and services to their  neighbors. In Pennsylvania and around the country, small businesses are  not only the backbone of our economy, they are the heart our  communities.   This year, they have faced extraordinary challenges. During the  coronavirus crisis, many small businesses, following Federal, State,  and local mandates, have been forced to radically change the way they  do business or even temporarily close their doors.   As jobs were put into jeopardy, Congress quickly acted to provide  targeted relief to American families, workers, and small businesses.  Under the CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program was enacted in  record time. This unprecedented program served as a vital lifeline to  millions of small businesses. Already, the Paycheck Protection Program  has saved more than 50 million jobs across our country. For those  workers and their families, this policy is personal.   Just last weekend, I stopped by Boyer Orchards in Bedford County. As  I was waiting to buy their famous apples, I had the opportunity to  speak to my fellow Penn Staters Matt and Ellen Boyer and their sons and  all who work for them tirelessly to keep this family business running.   Like many farms and orchards, they had tough choices when they lost  business during the coronavirus shutdown, through no fault of their  own; but, thankfully, they had the support to make ends meet and, most  importantly, to keep their hardworking team on the payroll.   The Boyer family attributes the Paycheck Protection Program with  helping them weather the storm, and they even called this program a  godsend.   Today, I am happy to report that the orchard is open and business is  booming and the apples are plentiful. I can confirm that they were well  worth the wait.   As we celebrate the success of the Boyer family, I also recognize  that  [[Page H4888]]  there are small businesses that are still struggling under the  burdensome State and local mandates.   The deadline to apply for Paycheck Protection Program support has,  unfortunately, passed, and yet too many businesses remain closed or  restricted. Some small business leaders are wondering how long they can  survive. And, frankly, if we do not act, we risk losing them  permanently.   Most of our small businesses have been built by hardworking families  over generations. Will Congress let this be their end? Will we allow  families on Main Street to be used as bargaining chips in Washington?   Mr. Speaker, we cannot permit small businesses to be wiped out by a  virus. This is a time for choosing, and we in Congress must put  politics aside and extend a lifeline to the American small businesses.   Congressman   Steve Chabot, the top Republican on the House Small  Business Committee, has introduced commonsense legislation that would  reopen the Paycheck Protection Program, free up over $137 billion of  unspent funds, and extend this program until the end of this year. This  plan makes sense, and I encourage every Member of Congress to support  it.   If 2020 has taught us anything, it is to plan for the unexpected.  While many circumstances beyond our control remain uncertain, Congress  has an opportunity now to offer small businesses security, and, most  important, we have the chance to offer hope to these hardworking  Americans.   As my friend Congressman Chabot said earlier this week, our economy  is depending upon America's small businesses, and American small  businesses are depending on us.   This Small Business Week, there are livelihoods that are on the line.  American families are counting on us. American workers are counting on  us. It is time that we deliver for them.                            ____________________
