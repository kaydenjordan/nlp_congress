 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sangamon  County's Pleasant Plains High School girls basketball team, who brought  home the school's first State championship last weekend.   Last Saturday, at Redbird Arena in Normal, the Pleasant Plains  Cardinals defeated the two-time defending champion Chicago Marshall  Commandos in a performance dominated by Pleasant Plains' defensive  efforts.   The Cardinals held Marshall to 32 percent shooting and forced 12  turnovers in the game, winning by a final score of 43-37. The  Commandos, who have won 11 previous State titles, led for only a minute  the entire game.   The Pleasant Plains victory was not without drama, however, as the  Cardinals allowed a 13-point, fourth-quarter lead to dwindle to just 1;  but, on the strength of strong senior leadership, the Cardinals were  able to seal the game and bring a State championship home to Pleasant  Plains.   The Pleasant Plains girls team made all of Illinois very proud with  their accomplishments this season, finishing with a 28-3 record. Each  girl's commitment to the champion team and their community is truly  inspiring.   Congratulations to Coach T.J. Fraase and the Pleasant Plains  Cardinals.                            ____________________
