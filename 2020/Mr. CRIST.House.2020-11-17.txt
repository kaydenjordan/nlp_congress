 Madam Speaker, we need a COVID relief package, and we need  it now. America is the richest country in the world. In fact, America  is the richest country in history.   The CARES Act and the Fed pumped trillions of dollars into the  economy this spring all while interest rates sank to historic lows. Our  economic might was built for this moment--for this emergency. We can  afford to meet the needs of our people and our economy in this  pandemic. The economists, in fact, are urgently telling us that the  problems of today vastly outweigh the potential debt problems of  tomorrow. This is especially true if inaction means laying off  firefighters and people losing their homes.   We know we can help our people, and experts agree we should help our  people. But all my constituents know is that that has not happened. We  have a sacred duty to get it done.                            ____________________
