 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today, as I have on so many  occasions, to give voice to the 3.5 million Americans who call Puerto  Rico home. Their lives have been turned upside down by Hurricane Maria,  and now more than ever, they desperately need to be heard. I invite my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in amplifying the  voices of millions of Puerto Ricans calling out for help and the  millions here on the mainland who have yet to hear from their families.   Here on the floor with me today are aerial photos of the destruction  caused by Hurricane Maria, the astounding damage I saw firsthand when I  toured Puerto Rico by helicopter on Friday, pictures largely taken by  me.   Take this collapsed bridge in the municipality of Utuado, situated in  the central mountains of Puerto Rico. Every day, the 30,000 Americans  who live in Utuado depend on these bridges to cross the beautiful  rivers that run through it, but today those 30,000 Americans are  secluded, waiting in the dark, and wondering when help will arrive.   Images like these have stayed with me from the moment I left Puerto  Rico, and I share them today because the people of Puerto Rico need our  collective voices and support to stop this humanitarian crisis from  devolving into a full-blown American tragedy.   This is another example of some of the devastation of a large number  of homes in a community.   If we hope to overcome the monumental challenges before us, we need a  full grasp of the reality on the ground. I thought that is why  President Trump went to Puerto Rico this week--to get a dose of  reality. Instead, the President continued to feed on his own warped  version of reality. The President told the people of Puerto Rico that  they should be ``very proud'' that the death count was only ``16 versus  literally thousands of people'' who died in ``a real catastrophe like  Katrina''--a real catastrophe like Katrina. And certainly that was a  catastrophe, but this is no less real for the people of Puerto Rico.  Yet, moments later, the AP reported that fatalities in Puerto Rico have  tragically risen to 44. And while I pray it is not the case, I fear  that it may be even worse, because we have secluded communities that  still have not gotten access, so we don't know what is happening there.   In short, the situation is perilous, and we don't have a moment to  waste.   Like many, I had hoped that during his visit to Puerto Rico, the  President would take the high road and set a new tone after his  administration's woefully delayed and inadequate response to Hurricane  Maria. Instead, the President took victim-blaming to a whole new level.  He told emergency responders and local elected officials: ``I hate to  tell you, Puerto Rico, but you have thrown our budget a little out of  whack.''   Well, Mr. President, perhaps we have to dial back the budget- bursting, trillion-dollar tax cuts you want to give to billionaire  families like yours, because it is going to take more than paper towels  to help the people of Puerto Rico.   In this country, we don't turn our backs on Americans in need. We  don't complain about how much it costs to restore power to hospitals or  rebuild roads in ruin that connect people to their government and  essential services or get clean drinking water and food and medicine to  the hungry and the frail. We are the United States of America, and we  are there for each other, whether it is Texas after Harvey or Florida  after Irma or New Jersey after Sandy or Puerto Rico after Maria.   If you heard the President speak earlier this week, you would heard  that everything is going great and that he in particular is doing the  greatest job any President has ever done in the history of the world.  The administration will tell us that the majority of hospitals are open  but leave out the fact that many are running on emergency generators at  significantly reduced capacity. They will leave out how the shortages  of ambulances and fuel and functional roads have made getting to the  hospitals nearly impossible. Even if you do find a way there, the  hospitals might not have the medicine, supplies, or doctors you need.   The administration will boast that it has set up 11 distribution  points for food, water, and other necessities, but what good is a  distribution center that takes hours to reach and is out of supplies  before you get there?   They will brag about how half of the people have access to running  water but neglect to say that in some rural areas in the north, barely  over 13 percent of people have access to running water.   They will boast about all of the buildings being inspected--something  that even the Governor of Puerto Rico questioned--but look at this  image I took 5 days before the President landed. This is just 25  minutes outside of San Juan. Hurricane Maria destroyed many of the  wooden homes that populate the island and weakened many of its immense  structures, as the picture showed that we had up before. Here is an  example of it. So you see that all of  [[Page S6338]]  these homes are destroyed. Some of them are not made in the same way.  Here is a cement structure that is also totally destroyed. I saw the  same sights across Puerto Rico in communities near the capital, in the  mountains, and along the coast.   What does all this tell us? It tells us an unfortunate truth: that  the administration's response to this crisis has been woefully  inadequate from the start.   For 2 weeks, Puerto Ricans cried out for help--help accessing clean  water, help powering hospitals, help feeding families. Yet the  President accused them--the victims of this historic natural disaster-- of being ingrates clamoring for handouts. He dismissed the urgency of  their situation, and he effectively called the mayor of San Juan  another nasty woman who should pipe down.    Well, this is the mayor of San Juan, wading hip deep in water. Does  this look like a woman who isn't taking responsibility? No. To me, it  looks like a leader doing everything she can to save lives.   I knew from the start that we weren't getting the full picture, and  because the administration went out of its way not to provide support  for a bipartisan congressional delegation to visit the island, I  decided to go myself. After all, it will be the responsibility of  Congress to fund disaster relief and long-term recovery on these  islands, and we need the facts in order to produce the right  legislation. So last Friday, I boarded an Americans Airlines flight to  Puerto Rico.   Now, let me be clear. I have visited the island of Puerto Rico I  don't know how many times over the past 25 years, both in my official  capacity as a Member of Congress and personally to vacation. It is no  exaggeration to say that the island I saw on Friday is not the island I  have known and loved. The lush, green, tropical landscape that comes to  mind when we think of Puerto Rico was mostly devoid of life.   I met with the Governor of Puerto Rico. I spoke to local law  enforcement officials, first responders, and Federal FEMA officials.  With the help of the Governor's office and the Puerto Rico Joint Forces  of Rapid Action--or FURA, as they are known on the island--I saw the  damage by helicopter. I saw debris and mudslides and fallen trees on  the inland streets, destroyed homes sprinkled with the occasional yet  all-too-familiar blue of FEMA tarps. A dead green hue covered the  landscape that was such a foreign sight to me that I caught myself  thinking I was somewhere else.   This was an all-too-familiar scene--the scene of a strong cement  structure of a building, on the surface impervious to the strong winds  of a hurricane, yet now on the verge of sinking into the Earth. The  hurricane eroded so much land that in some inner parts of the island,  landslides have become the new norm. The people who live here may never  be able to return. Entire generations of close-knit communities may  never be the same.   Despite these dire conditions, during my visit to Puerto Rico, I felt  the spirit of community and commitments shared by so many Americans  across the island. After Hurricane Maria, they woke to devastation, no  communication, and the isolating affects of roads being cut off by  fallen trees, electrical posts, and debris. As they wait and wonder  when their government will come to their aid, they are doing everything  they can to survive. They have taken matters into their own hands. They  are clearing roads, sheltering relatives who lost their homes, and  working together to care for the most vulnerable. So through it all, I  saw the hard-working spirit alive in Puerto Rico that I see whenever I  speak with Puerto Rican families there and across New Jersey, where so  many of my constituents are mobilizing to send help as they anxiously  wait to hear from their families.   Like so many Americans, I too worried about my family on the island.  My brother faces health challenges, and I worried about his care.  Fortunately, we had a brief moment to meet, and I was able to give him  some supplies--help one person. But as tough as this situation was, he  is one of the lucky ones. He lives in a suburb of San Juan which is  relatively better off than the more remote, rural areas.   Let's look at a chart of our recovery status. Fifteen days after the  storm ravaged the island, where does it stand? Well, 93 percent of our  fellow Americans are still without power. I can tell my colleagues  firsthand that the heat and the humidity from all of the water that  came from Maria is stifling. It is oppressive. It is hard to breathe.   Sixty percent of Puerto Rico has no cell phone service, meaning  people have no way of connecting to their families on the island and  outside of the island or calling for help if they needed it. If they  did, we could have pinpoint accuracy of search and rescue missions.   Day by day, fewer and fewer Puerto Ricans have access to clean,  running water. From October 2 to October 3, the population with running  water dropped from 29 percent to 13 percent.   The truth is, this situation would be unacceptable in any major city  on the U.S. mainland, but, as the people of Puerto Rico know all too  well, they don't get the same treatment as their fellow citizens on the  mainland. The ugly truth is that for generations, Congress has treated  the people of Puerto Rico not as our fellow Americans, not as people  who have fought and bled for their country, like the famous  Borinqueneers, an all-Puerto Rican infantry division, who received,  recently, the highest decoration Congress gives collectively--the  Congressional Gold Medal. They haven't treated them as first-class  citizens but as second-class citizens.   Hurricane Maria didn't create this disparity, but it exposed the  longstanding inequities that have hindered the island's success for  generations. The people of Puerto Rico don't receive equal Medicaid  funding, Medicare coverage, or access to tax credits. They aren't just  numbers on a ledger; they are long-term care for a grandparent,  treatment for a critically ill child, and a fair shot to make a living  wage and raise a family.   This didn't happen overnight. These wrongs add up over time. As  Governor Rossello said so eloquently:         I invite you to reflect on why Puerto Rico is in the       current state of disadvantage and inequality. It's not       something that happened just a few months or few weeks before       this storm. It is a condition that has happened for more than       a century in Puerto Rico.    I invite you to reflect on the reality that even after the storm hit  Puerto Rico, even when it was evident it was a disaster in the United  States, only half of our U.S. citizens knew Puerto Ricans are U.S.  citizens. So when Hurricanes Irma and Maria slammed into Puerto Rico,  these disparities, these inequalities, were laid bare.   None of this should have taken the Trump administration by surprise.  We knew the storm was coming. We knew for days that a category 5  hurricane was on a collision course with Puerto Rico, just as  communities across the island were picking up the pieces after Irma. We  have known for years about the island's aging infrastructure, like the  downed power line pictured here.   In short, all of us knew Hurricane Maria was a recipe for disaster  that would leave 3.5 million Americans imperiled, disconnected, and in  the dark. It should not have taken the administration 12 days to issue  a disaster declaration--something I called for--for 100 percent of the  island because, as I saw on Friday, there is no community in Puerto  Rico untouched by this tragedy. Focused leadership would have had a  three-star general on the ground the moment the clouds parted, not 8  days after the storms struck.   We needed medical evacuation vehicles and vessels, aid and relief  delivery systems on standby, the USNS Comfort ready for immediate  deployment--something I called for. Instead, the administration told us  helping Puerto Rico is hard because it is an island in a big ocean--but  it happens to be an island of 3.5 million U.S. citizens.   We have no more time to waste. That is why it is so urgent that we  take action now. If we could send 20,000 troops to Haiti, surely, we  can get more boots on the ground saving American lives in Puerto Rico.  We need more helicopters airdropping food and water to secluded  communities. We need generators delivered and the repair of  communication towers expedited.   It is up to the President to mobilize every resource possible--to  save lives, to get the lights turned on, to rebuild bridges, to reach  secluded communities, to reconnect families. We can't  [[Page S6339]]  afford to waste any more time, not when lives are on the line, not when  elderly residents in nursing homes grow frailer by the moment, not when  hungry American children have nothing to eat, not when communities are  without clean drinking water for days on end. We need to keep the  pressure on the administration.   That is why I wrote the President, urging that he activate the  Defense Production Act of 1950 so the military could more quickly  deliver vast private sector resources to those in need. That is why my  colleagues and I wrote to the White House and urged FEMA to waive  disaster relief cost sharing because, as the Governor told me: I have  no revenue coming in. I have no revenue coming in, and the likelihood  of revenue coming in, certainly in the short term, is not there. How do  you acquire the 70 or 75 percent Federal assistance if you don't have  the 25 percent to put up? That is why we have written the USDA asking  that they use all available resources to get food to the people of  Puerto Rico.   This is an all-hands-on-deck situation for the Federal Government,  but Congress also has a responsibility to act. That is why I sent a  letter to Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan urging that they bring  forward an emergency supplemental aid package and fund community  development block grants for disaster recovery. It is up to us in  Congress to immediately authorize, not just the emergency funding  needed to save lives in Puerto Rico but also the assistance needed for  a full-powered recovery.   We must give Puerto Ricans the tools to rebuild. That means making  sure Puerto Rico's financial control board gives the Governor the  flexibility to spearhead this recovery. Board members of that control  board should be on the island, assessing the damage, speaking to the  survivors, allowing Governor Rossello to create a new budget that  reflects Puerto Rico's post-Maria reality. The damage, by some  estimates, could be as high as $90 billion, so adjusting expectations  and enabling flexibility is absolutely critical going forward.   I have said it before and I will say it again. The people of Puerto  Rico must come before Wall Street creditors. As it turns out, this is  one area where the President and I can find common ground. Just last  night, he called for Puerto Rico's debt to be wiped out. I hope all of  us--the administration, my colleagues in Congress, and the fiscal  control board--can work together to jump-start Puerto Rico's recovery.  That must include enabling flexibility, addressing the island's  crippling debt, and ensuring that pensions are protected and paid.  Imagine not getting your pension--no longer working, having no income,  and then your pension is not protected. How do you make it? All of us  in the Senate have a responsibility to stand with Puerto Rico. How we  respond to this crisis will have profound consequences, not just for  the Americans who live in Puerto Rico today but for generations to  come.   We need to pass a disaster package that matches the astounding damage  suffered by the island. The photos I have brought to the floor today  give a glimpse--not anywhere near the whole picture--of the devastation  on the ground. It is not enough to reconnect a faulty, ailing power  grid. It is time to be proactive and rebuild Puerto Rico so it is  prepared for the next storm and for the 21st century. It is time to fix  the underlying disparities which have hindered Puerto Rico's success.  Otherwise, we will simply be rebuilding a broken foundation.   Let me close by saying, I remind my colleagues that Puerto Ricans are  not just citizens of the United States--which, in and of itself, should  speak to the compelling arguments we should be engaged in helping  Puerto Rico as our fellow Americans. They have fought to defend our  Nation from World War I to the War on Terror. Take a walk down to the  Vietnam Memorial, and you will see Puerto Rican names engraved in that  stone far in excess of the number of people proportionately to the  American population. Throughout our history, Puerto Ricans have given  their lives so they may remain part of the ``land of the free.'' To  this day, more than 10,000 Puerto Ricans serve in every branch of the  U.S. Armed Forces.   Let's also remember that beyond the 3.5 million citizens living on  the island, there are 5 million Puerto Ricans living in our States, in  our congressional districts, and in our communities. In the aftermath  of this unprecedented disaster, these Americans deserve the same  rights, the same respect, and the same response from their Federal  Government. That is what I told leaders from New Jersey's Puerto Rican  community earlier this week--assemblymen and women, mayors, community  leaders, and concerned citizens.   We all remember how hard it was to secure the funding we needed to  rebuild New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. We had to  fight tooth and nail every step of the way, and, guess what, we had two  U.S. Senators from New Jersey and 13 Members of Congress, joined by our  colleagues from New York--two U.S. Senators from New York and a whole  host of congressional Members as well as from Connecticut, which was  also affected. It was an incredible time here to try to get relief.   Americans in Puerto Rico have no vote in the Senate, they have no  votes in Congress, and the fight to rebuild Puerto Rico will be that  much harder, but, as I have in the past, I intend to be their voice and  their vote in the U.S. Senate.   Now is not the time to pretend like recovery will be a piece of cake.  No one--not the Governor, not the President, not any one of us--should  sugarcoat the human catastrophe playing out in Puerto Rico. It is time  for honesty about the conditions on the ground, the challenges we face,  and the actions we must take.   Yes, Puerto Rico is an island in the middle of a very big ocean, but  we are the most powerful nation on the face of the Earth. We have the  most advanced military capabilities ever known and the most skilled  Armed Forces in the world. We have to be there for 3.5 million  Americans who are in need. We are the United States of America. We do  the impossible. Give our men and women in uniform any mission, and they  rise to the occasion.   If we conducted the Berlin Airlift, set up tactical operations in the  mountains of Afghanistan, built green zones in Baghdad in the height of  the Iraq war, then surely we can save the lives of Americans in danger,  and surely we can save those lives and help rebuild Puerto Rico. We  must not rest until every American is safe and the work of rebuilding  is done.   I yield the floor.
