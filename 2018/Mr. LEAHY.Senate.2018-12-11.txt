 Mr. President, after months of hard fought and oftentimes  contentious negotiations, the Senate passed the conference report on  the 2018 farm bill, titled the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, by  a vote of 87 to 13. This conference bill tracks closely with the bill  passed by the Senate earlier this year and embraces the bipartisan  tradition of the farm bill. This is well-balanced legislation that will  provide much needed certainty to the country's struggling farmers;  maintain food security for millions of American families; provide for  cleaner waterways, better soils, protected open space, healthier  forests, and the preservation of family farms; will make our drinking  water safer; and will give rural America a much-needed economic boost.   I thank Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow and all of their  staff, as well as my own staff, who have worked day and night on this  bipartisan effort. As I know from being chairman of the committee  during the 1990 farm bill, it is no easy task to balance the needs of  the various regions and commodities and the sometimes conflicting  priorities among Senators when we are working within a fixed budget.   This farm bill makes continued improvements to the Margin Protection  Program, MPP, after the enhancements to the program that I led in  February of this year. The newly named Dairy Margin Coverage program  brings the margin level up to $9.50, lowers premium costs for a farm's  first 5 million pounds of milk, and allows overlap of this program and  other Department of Agriculture supported insurance programs. This bill  will also help farmers initially blocked by USDA from enrolling in MPP  due their participation in the Livestock Gross Margin Insurance for  Dairy. They can now retroactively sign up for the improved margin  protection program and access the critical benefits they missed out on  this spring. A new program to incentivize milk donation is also  included in this bill and will allow processors and producers to  partner with charitable organizations to donate milk and reduce the  waste of milk dumping.   As the father of the organic farm bill, I am pleased that the 2018  farm bill increases the funding for the Organic Agriculture Research  and Extension Initiative and guarantees $50 million a year in mandatory  funding by fiscal year 2023. This will ensure baseline funding for  future farm bill debates and further protect this critical investment  in our local and organic food system. I must add though that I am  concerned by one aspect of this bill that I felt was an unnecessary  change to the Organic Foods Production Act. From the beginning of the  farm bill process, it was clear that some agricultural groups and some  Members of Congress did not fully comprehend the importance of the  National Organic Standards Board, NOSB, and the role that it plays in  maintaining the integrity of the organic seal. Since first authoring  the Organic Foods Production Act, I have long argued that the statute  was working well, and the many tweaks and adjustments Members sought  could easily be addressed administratively.   As such, I was opposed to the statutory changes sought by the House  and Senate bills and am disappointed that two of the NOSB provisions  related to the redundant language on voting procedures and those  dictating the composition of the board were included in the final farm  bill.   While I view the NOSB provisions included in the final bill to be  silent on the 2013 sunset policy change, I remain opposed its inclusion  because I believe it only causes confusion in the organic market and  unnecessarily muddies the waters on an already contentious issue within  the organic community. With respect to the makeup of the board, the  current statute already included a carefully crafted balance of  perspectives and interests. I feel strongly that the voice of the  independent organic farmer must remain a prominent part of the NOSB and  should not be diluted or drowned out as larger organic companies seek a  role on the board with their employees or representatives. I  [[Page S7426]]  feel very strongly that the two NOSB handler seats versus the farmer  slots are a more appropriate avenue for such companies to be  represented on the board. While I am disappointed that this House  provision was included in the final farm bill conference agreement, I  will continue to support the nomination of independent organic farmers  to the NOSB farmer seats and the unique perspective they bring to the  board.   Ranking Member Stabenow must be applauded for the newly combined  Local Agriculture Market Program, LAMP, that also secures $50 million  by 2023 and will allow the work of local food programs to continue  bringing fresh, local, and nutritious food to the tables of Vermonters  and Americans everywhere. For Vermont farmers hoping to diversify and  remain viable, this bill legalizes the growth and sale of hemp as an  agricultural commodity and allows growers to be eligible for crop  insurance. The compromise addresses concerns raised by criminal justice  advocates regarding the hemp farming ban of individuals with drug- related felony convictions, and I am glad Vermonters will more fully be  able to take advantage of this durable and profitable crop.   The conference agreement continues the proud tradition of providing  nutritional assistance to our fellow Americans with the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and wholeheartedly rejects the  provisions included in the House bill that would have cut food access  for millions of families. This bill continues our commitment to  worldwide stability and productivity with programs like McGovern-Dole,  Food for Peace, the Global Crop Diversity Trust, as well as valuable  research to support farmers here at home and around the world. When  people here and abroad do not have to wonder where their next meal may  come from, children do better in school, workers are more productive,  and our world is stronger.   Our Nation's conservation tradition is reinforced in this bill, with  significant funding and necessary improvements to programs like the  Agricultural Conservation Easement Program conserving family farms, the  Environmental Quality Incentives Program fighting nitrogen and  phosphorus runoff, and the Conservation Reserve Program in which I was  able to include a fix allowing Vermonters to use the Conservation  Reserve Enhancement Program to further protect water quality where they  were disqualified before. The worst of the House of Representative's  forestry provisions were negotiated out of this bill to make sure we  are protecting our forestland based on the best available science and  expertise.   This bipartisan farm bill provides critical economic development  support to address the unique challenges and needs faced by our rural  communities. The Rural Economic Area Partnership, REAP, Zone is renewed  to continue developing our rural economy and the Northern Border  Regional Commission, NBRC, is reauthorized and increased to $33  million, with an additional $5 million to build capacity in eligible  counties. This bill also expands the eligible territory for NBRC  investment to all fourteen counties in Vermont. The Commission will  build upon the more than $10.5 million in matching funds and $18  million in total economic development and infrastructure projects  invested in Vermont since 2010. The bill reauthorizes the good work of  State Rural Development Councils through 2023 and reestablishes the  position of Under Secretary for Rural Development that had been  eliminated, in the 2017 USDA reorganization. I am pleased that I was  able to reach a compromise for a 10-year reauthorization of the  National Oilheat Research Alliance, NORA, a vital program that funds  the development of improved and efficient oilheat technology to  increase safety and reduce consumer costs.   I would be here all night if I were to talk about all of the wins for  Vermont that were included in this farm bill, so I will close by saying  that the 2018 farm bill should be viewed as a watershed moment in much  needed bipartisanship and compromise. It will help millions of  Americans, farmers, families, and children and will protect our natural  resources, economic vitality, and public health. This is why we are  here: to help people who need it, protect our national security, and  ensure our planet is productive and clean for this generation and for  generations to come. This bill must pass the House of Representatives  and be signed by the President to deliver real help to real Americans  everywhere.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have long supported juvenile justice  programs, and I have long supported runaway and homeless youth  programs. During the 20 years I served as the top Democrat on the  Judiciary Committee and in my current role as the vice chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, I have championed bipartisan reauthorizations  and supported funding for these programs, overcoming the House of  Representatives, which zeroes out juvenile justice programs in its  appropriations bills year after year. These programs make a real and  lasting difference in the lives of the children and teens they serve.  The two programs are funded separately in separate appropriations  subcommittees, and their reauthorizations have traditionally moved  separately.   I am pleased the Senate today passed the long-debated Juvenile  Justice Reform Act. This legislation makes needed, comprehensive, and  long overdue updates to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  Act. It mandates research to study, identify, and address  disproportionate minority contact in the juvenile justice system and  separates young offenders from adult jails and prisons. It also  reauthorizes funding for key juvenile justice programs. Funding for  these vital programs is key to preventing youth from coming in contact  with the juvenile justice system and ensuring youth have the  opportunity to get the help they need to avoid repeating the cycle.  Reducing recidivism is not just the moral thing to do; it saves future  State and Federal dollars.   The Grassley substitute amendment, which passed the Senate this  evening, reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act at a lower  level than I support, and a lower level than is supported by the  providers and advocates in the field who know firsthand what the actual  needs are to help these youths. It also fails to make important  programmatic improvements that Senator Collins and I have been working  on for years. These improvements include provisions to prevent and  respond to human trafficking--to which runaway and homeless youth are  particularly vulnerable--by requiring staff training to identify when a  child entering their program has been a victim. Training program staff  to identify young victims of trafficking helps ensure staff refers  children and teenagers to appropriate services and takes steps to  prevent their further traumatization. These young people have  experienced major, unimaginable trauma, and we need to make sure they  receive the right counseling and treatment to help them recover. Our  reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act also includes  important nondiscrimination language to ensure all youth who try to  access programs can do so regardless of their faith, race, or sexual  orientation. Unfortunately, these improvements will have to wait.   While we have much to celebrate with the passage of the Juvenile  Justice Reform Act, I am disappointed that some Members on the other  side of the aisle demanded the inclusion of an extension of the Runaway  and Homeless Youth Act and lowering its authorization without the  improvements contained in my legislation with Senator Collins. The  House passed and the Democratic hotline cleared H.R. 6964, a clean  version of the juvenile justice Reform Act with no reference to the  Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans on  the Judiciary Committee refused to run the hotline on the Republican  side. This in effect held hostage these important juvenile justice  reforms to leverage authorization cuts to a completely unrelated  program.   These two pieces of legislation have not moved in the same  reauthorization bill in 30 years. They are funded through different  appropriations bills, administered by difference departments, and their  authorizations serve different purposes. Senator Collins and I have  worked for years on a comprehensive bipartisan reauthorization  [[Page S7427]]  of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and expressed our concern with  including a lower reauthorization with no improvements as part of  Juvenile Justice Reform. Unfortunately, members on the other side were  willing to hold up passage of Juvenile Justice Reform for yet another  Congress, over an unrelated program.   In the interest of ensuring programmatic improvements and  reauthorization of juvenile justice programs, Senator Collins and I  agreed to a 2-year reauthorization of Runaway and Homeless Youth  programs at an 8-percent reduction from its last authorized levels.  Although I am disappointed that Runaway and Homeless Youth programs are  reauthorized even in the short term without needed programmatic  improvements, I look forward to working with members of the House and  Senate to pass a bipartisan, comprehensive Runaway and Homeless Youth  reauthorization in the 116th Congress.   It is my understanding that the House Committee on Education and  Workforce will prioritize a comprehensive reauthorization of Runaway  and Homeless Youth next Congress, and I hope the Senate Judiciary  Committee will do the same. If so, we have a chance to make a real  difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable children in our  Nation. It is time we seize it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this evening the Senate unanimously passed  the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018. I was one of the earliest  cosponsors of this bill, and I strongly support it. For far too long,  the Chinese Government has tightly restricted access to Tibet,  preventing U.S. diplomats and journalists from reporting on the  systematic human rights abuses and destruction of Tibetan culture  perpetrated by the Chinese Government and arbitrarily preventing  Tibetan-Americans from visiting their families. Passing this  legislation represents a strong, bipartisan step toward addressing that  decades-long injustice. I would like to thank Senator Rubio and  Congressman McGovern for their work on this legislation over several  years.   The Chinese Government arbitrarily requires a special permit for a  foreign diplomat, reporter, or tourist to visit Tibet, a requirement  China does not impose for travel to any other provincial-level  jurisdiction, even Xinjiang. The Chinese Government frequently denies  requests for these permits to Tibet. Even when it does grant permits,  it generally requires foreigners to be accompanied at all times by a  government-designated guide. This arbitrary system not only makes it  exceptionally difficult to report on the situation in Tibet, but it  also gives the Chinese Government significant leverage, which it  reportedly exploits in various ways, over persons who hope to obtain a  permit.   In a 2015 white paper, the Chinese Government claimed that, under  Chinese rule, ``Tibet has been transformed from a poor and backward  society to one that is advanced in both economy and culture.'' Setting  aside that this statement would look perfectly at home among the  discredited justifications for 19th century colonialism, if it were  true, then one would expect China to welcome the world to witness its  rule in Tibet; yet in 2016, the Washington Post reported that Tibet  ``is harder to visit as a journalist than North Korea.'' International  media cannot even enter Tibet except on infrequent, tightly controlled  tours organized by the Chinese Government. The situation is much the  same for U.S. diplomats.   It is not just journalists and officials whose freedom of movement is  restricted. Tibetan-Americans attempting to visit their homeland report  undergoing a discriminatory Chinese visa process, different from what  is typically required for American citizens, and often find their  requests arbitrarily denied. I have heard about this problem directly  from my Tibetan-American constituents in Vermont. I have spoken about  it with the leader of the Tibetan Government-in-exile.   This issue has even touched a Tibetan-American member of my staff,  Nima Binara. His 89-year-old grandmother, Kaedungkhangsar Yangchen  Dolkar, was a naturalized American citizen who hoped to see her  homeland and her relatives one last time before she passed away, a  visit the Chinese Government refused to grant. Denying a person's right  to visit their homeland is a petty display of authoritarian control and  one that we should not tolerate in the 21st century.   I vividly remember visiting Tibet in 1988 and meeting its warmhearted  people, appreciating its profound culture, and seeing its breathtaking  landscape. With this legislation, we are now a step closer to the day  when all American tourists, journalists, and diplomats can make such a  trip without undue restrictions. This legislation will also make it  more difficult for China to hide its atrocious human rights record in  Tibet behind a cloak of isolation. It will make it easier for Tibetans  inside Tibet to interact with the outside world and more likely for the  world to realize that Tibetans are a distinct people who deserve their  right to self-determination.   The House has already unanimously passed this bill. I urge the  President to sign it into law without delay.                            ____________________
