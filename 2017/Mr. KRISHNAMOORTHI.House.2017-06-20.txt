 Mr. Speaker, the healthcare bill the Senate  leadership is writing has not been subjected to any public hearings or  debate and, to this day, the contents of the bill remain a secret. This  bill is being written by 13 men--Republican men. And because it is  being written in secret, only those in the room have a say.   Under normal circumstances, every Senator would have the chance to  read and debate a bill, just as we had in the House. But these are not  normal circumstances.   As that secret committee reshapes our healthcare system behind closed  doors, no woman has a seat at the table, no Democrat has a seat at the  table, and 77 percent of Americans do not have a Senator at the table.   The Senate leadership has deprived nearly 250 million Americans of  representation in the writing of this healthcare bill because they  thought no one would notice. They will be proven wrong.                            ____________________
