 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit funds from  being used to carry out the District of Columbia's Health Insurance  Requirement Amendment Act of 2018. This is essentially the District's  version of ObamaCare's individual mandate with a few important and  troubling distinctions.   The mandate requires that all residents of the District of Columbia  purchase government-sanctioned health insurance or pay what the  District calls a ``shared responsibility payment.''   However, the mandate goes even further by allowing D.C. authorities  to place liens on, seize, and sell the property of their residents if  they are unwilling or unable to pay the tax penalty.   Let me repeat. If a D.C. resident chooses not to purchase the  government-sanctioned health insurance plan or purchases health  insurance that doesn't meet the District of Columbia's preferences,  they will now have the authority to impose a tax penalty or seize and  sell that person's assets.   But it gets worse.   Every plan available through the D.C. Health Link covers elective  abortion, which means that the mandate forces individuals who don't  wish to purchase this coverage to choose between violating their  conscience and facing a tax penalty or, even worse, having their  property seized.   I am sure you will hear objections to Congress meddling in District  of Columbia affairs, but I will remind those objectors that Article I,  section 8, clause 17 of the Constitution vests Congress, not the D.C.  City Council, with the authority to exercise exclusive legislation in  all cases whatsoever regarding the District.   When the District of Columbia makes it a priority to force the  residents to buy insurance coverage they neither want nor need, it is  incumbent upon Congress to exercise their constitutional authority and  prohibit the use of funds to carry out this policy.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).  [[Page H6538]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the other distinguished  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlemen from North Carolina,  Mr. Meadows and Mr. Walker, for their support of this amendment. And I  would just like to point out, as Mr. Meadows was pointing out, this is  really about defending rights.   This amendment prohibits the District of Columbia Council from  imposing on individual property rights. It denies people the option to  buy less expensive health insurance and insurance that they want and  need.   I would like to also point out that in ObamaCare, even there, there  was no force imposed on people to buy health insurance. They could pay  the penalty, or they could apply for a waiver with the IRS and,  literally, millions did that. At no time did ObamaCare pose a threat to  people's property rights, as this amendment does.   So, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to stand up for the rights of  the citizens of the District of Columbia to protect their property  rights and support this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.
