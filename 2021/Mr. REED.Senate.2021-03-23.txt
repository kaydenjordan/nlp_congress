 Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the  Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Rhode Island  Fishermen's Fairness Act along with my colleague Senator Whitehouse.  This legislation seeks to address a longstanding inequity in our  nation's fisheries management system that denies Rhode Island a voice  in the management of many stocks that our fishing industry relies on.   Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, Rhode Island has voting membership on  the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) since NEFMC-managed  stocks represent a significant percentage of landings and revenue for  our state. However, Rhode Island has an even larger stake in Mid- Atlantic fisheries. Yet, it does not have voting representation on the  Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), which currently  consists of representatives from New York, New Jersey, Delaware,  Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.   According to data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), between 2015 and  [[Page S1710]]  2019, Rhode Island accounted for approximately a quarter of the  commercial landings from stocks under MAFMC's sole jurisdiction, both  by weight and value. The significance of commercial landings from  stocks managed by MAFMC is growing every year for Rhode Island,  accounting for 58% of Rhode Island's federally managed commercial  fisheries landings in 2019.   After making an appearance during last summer's Democratic National  Convention, Rhode Island calamari quickly became a social media  sensation, and for good reason. Calamari (or squid) is by far the most  important commercial species in the Ocean State. In 2019 alone, Rhode  Island landed over 5.5 million more pounds of squid than any other  state on the East Coast. But, Rhode Island does not have a formal say  in how this species is managed because it does not have representation  on the MAFMC.   The legislation we are introducing offers a simple solution with a  sound precedent. North Carolina was added to the MAFMC as part of the  Sustainable Fisheries Act in 1996. Like Rhode Island, a significant  portion of North Carolina's landed fish species were managed by the  MAFMC, yet the state was not represented on the council.   Just like the 1996 law that added North Carolina, the Rhode Island  Fishermen's Fairness Act would create two seats for our state on the  MAFMC. One seat would be appointed by the Secretary of Commerce based  on recommendations from the Governor of Rhode Island, and a second seat  would be filled by Rhode Island's principal state official with marine  fishery management responsibility. To accommodate these new members,  the bill would increase the MAFMC from 21 to 23 voting members. This  would guarantee Rhode Island the same minimum representation as other  states currently on the council, without altering their status.   With mounting economic, ecological, and regulatory challenges, it is  more important than ever that Rhode Island fishermen have a voice in  the management of the fisheries they depend on. I urge our colleagues  to join us in supporting this commonsense legislation.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr.          Scott of South Carolina):   S. 912. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  provide information regarding vaccines for seniors as part of the  Medicare & You handbook and to ensure that the treatment of cost  sharing for vaccines under Medicare part D is consistent with the  treatment of vaccines under Medicare part B, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Finance.
