 Mr. Chairman, today, I join many of my  colleagues in taking the first steps to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   My home State of Minnesota has been hit especially hard by this law.  Minnesotans have seen their health insurance choices shrink, while  their premiums, copays, and deductibles skyrocket. I should know.   For the last, in fact, over 5 years, I have been in the individual  market and my own insurance premiums have nearly tripled, and I have  gone through three insurers.   Minnesotans have seen a 50 to 67 percent increase in the premium  costs this year alone. That is the fourth highest increase in the  country.   As Democratic Governor Mark Dayton of Minnesota stated: ``. . . the  Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. . . .''   In fact, politicians in Minnesota are looking for waivers from the  Affordable Care Act; not more of it. The other side likes to talk about  healthcare access. Mr. Chairman, I would argue that the single biggest  obstacle to healthcare access right now is the Affordable Care Act. It  is not sustainable.   It is time to repeal this failed legislation and replace it with  meaningful reforms that empower consumers, expand choice, and increase  affordability.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, so all Minnesotans  and all Americans can have access to affordable and portable health  care.
