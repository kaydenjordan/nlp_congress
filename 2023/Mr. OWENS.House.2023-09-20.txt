 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 684, the  resolution condemning Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's  unconstitutional actions violating New Mexicans' Second Amendment  rights.   The Second Amendment is not an optional legal provision that  bureaucrats can toss aside at their whim. It is a fundamental principle  to ensure that every law-abiding citizen has the God-granted right to  protect themselves, their families, their property, and their  liberties.   Growing up in the Deep South, I witnessed how Black Codes and Jim  Crow laws unjustly restricted minority communities from owning  firearms. In the mid-1950s, Martin Luther King, Jr., kept firearms for  self-protection, but his application for a concealed weapons permit was  denied because of racist gun control laws in his State.   Gun control laws proposed by Democrats and State legislatures,  Congress, and the White House aggressively erode our basic  constitutional rights. As it was in the civil rights era, the Black  community has seen this movie before. As Democrats abridge our rights  to self-protection, they legislate away the commonsense tools for Black  Americans to protect themselves. As they push ``defund the police'' and  ``soft on crime'' policies, it is the urban Black community that  suffers. We are now experiencing all-time highs in homicide, robbery,  car thefts, physical assaults, and destruction of Black-owned  businesses.   House Republicans will never waver in our commitment to defend the  rights of all law-abiding citizens, regardless of race, creed, color,  or ZIP Code. We will continue to fight to safeguard Americans'  inalienable rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. It is an  honor to lend my support to this House resolution. I pledge to continue  to champion the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. I thank  Representative Johnson for bringing us together for this purpose.                                time  1500
