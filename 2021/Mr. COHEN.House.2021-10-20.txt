 Madam Speaker, I just had to come back. I was leaving and  saw the lady's speech on the TV, and I had to come back.   If prices have gone up in New Mexico and the country, a large part of  the reason why prices have gone up is because of the pandemic, because  people have been sick and out of work. That has caused the supply  chains to back up and other things.   She didn't count in that, because of Joe Biden, people have gotten  $300 a child per month to help pay for those goods, and because of  actions by mostly the Democratic Caucus, sometimes bipartisan, but  mostly the Democratic Caucus, they got stimulus checks and other  benefits. So they have come out on top.   What people should not forget is that we need to vote for the  bipartisan infrastructure bill that has 17 Republicans on it from the  Senate.   I have broken with my Progressive Caucus to vote for it because it  creates jobs, and it is the right thing for America. My Republican  colleagues should break from their caucus and commit to vote for the  bipartisan infrastructure bill, too.   If you are not for Build Back Better, that is your business. It is  your business on infrastructure, but infrastructure is bipartisan. The  Senate made it bipartisan. And I broke with my Caucus and my sub- caucus, and other people will, too, to vote for it.   Build Back Better is fine, but you should break and vote for the  infrastructure bill. That is something we should get together on.                            ____________________
