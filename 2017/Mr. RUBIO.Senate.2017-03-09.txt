 Mr. President, Seema Verma has a proven track record of  helping States create patient-centered healthcare systems that improve  quality and access and give individuals and families more control over  their healthcare. Due to a family commitment, I was unable to  participate in the cloture vote. However, I strongly support Ms.  Verma's nomination and look forward to working with her on the many  important healthcare issues facing Florida and our country.
