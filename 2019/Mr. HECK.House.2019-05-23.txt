 Mr. Speaker, it was, indeed, 100 years ago in this very  room that the House of Representatives passed the 19th Amendment to the  United States Constitution, granting women the right to vote.   The vote was here, but the work was out there, because the fact is  the victory was due in no small part to the countless trailblazers who  championed women suffrage throughout the decades.   Many of those trailblazers called home that which I call home: the  Pacific Northwest. That included activists like Emma Smith DeVoe of  Tacoma and Mary Arkwright Hutton of Spokane. It was because of their  efforts that Washington State became the fifth State in the Union to  enact women suffrage in 1910. These efforts built the momentum to pass  and ratify the 19th Amendment nearly a decade later.   But the point is, as we celebrate this anniversary, let us not allow  the progress we have made beget complacency; because the long, hard- fought battle for equality and representation spans generations and  continues to this very day.   Let's continue to affirm those principles as we recognize and  commemorate the 100th anniversary of women's right to vote.                            ____________________
