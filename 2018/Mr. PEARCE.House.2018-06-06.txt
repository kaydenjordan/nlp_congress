 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, before I start, I would like to join my  colleague from North Carolina in recognizing the leadership of Chairman  Shuster on this important bill and the manner in which it is brought  forward with full amendment process allowed.   My amendment is fairly simple. It simply asks that the Corps of  Engineers would pay their bills. The Corps of Engineers, according to  an authorization under WRDA of 1999, is allowed to enter into projects  where a cost share is joined in with communities and organizations  throughout the States.   Many locations in New Mexico are still owed money for projects that  were commissioned over a decade ago. The town of Bernalillo, the city  of Rio Rancho, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, and the  county of Bernalillo all have projects that are owed money.   One of those projects, a simple arsenic treatment facility, cost $12  million. The Corps and the community both agreed that they would move  forward with the project and the cost sharing agreement. A decade  later, the Corps still owes money on that particular project.   At one point, the Corps expressed they had forgotten that they owed  that money; so it is just important for the government to pay its bills  on time.   This amendment is fairly simple and straightforward. It just  authorizes that and ensures it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
