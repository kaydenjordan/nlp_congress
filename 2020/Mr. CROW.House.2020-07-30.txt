 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of en bloc package No.  2, which contains my bipartisan amendment to provide resources for a  key national defense priority.   The threat to our servicemembers from sophisticated, state- manufactured unmanned aerial systems, or drones, is serious and  requires us to pursue innovative and advanced solutions.   My amendment would increase by $5 million the Army RDT&E air and  missile defense advanced technology line in order to integrate and  demonstrate a modular, multimission capability consisting of  surveillance, electronic warfare, and high-energy laser into a remotely  operated robotic vehicle. The integrated prototype would demonstrate an  ability to remotely detect, identify, and mitigate UAS threats so that  we can better protect our troops and bases.   I would like to thank Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Calvert  for working with me on this amendment. Additionally, I would like to  recognize Mr. Lamborn, Mr. Langevin, Mr. Buck, and Ms. Haaland for  their leadership and support on this issue.
