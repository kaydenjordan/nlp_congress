 Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, we can  bring up H. Res. 178, an important piece of legislation affirming the  House's commitment to protecting Social Security and Medicare.   Protecting Social Security and Medicare must be a front and center  priority of this Congress. We should be doing everything we can and  using all of our power to work in a bipartisan way to make sure we  protect Social Security and Medicare, as opposed to moving forward  aggressively to raise military spending once again where we already  spend more on our military and on our military industrial complex than  the next 10 countries combined.   The American people need to know the Republican Party is attempting  to invest more in war than it is in protecting our seniors.                                time  1245    Some of our seniors--55 million Americans--have been paying into  Social Security and Medicare for 50 years, and by 2035, 75 million  Americans will call themselves seniors.   We must protect our seniors. They have paid into our system. We must  ensure that they have access to healthcare, to housing, to money in  their pockets, and to food on the table. We often, particularly my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, seem to continue to  marginalize and neglect the most vulnerable people in our society--our  seniors included, our children included, and those who live in poverty  included.   I represent New York's 16th Congressional District. It is one of the  most diverse districts in the country. We have urban, suburban, and  rural areas. I am constantly in the community talking to my neighbors.  Never do I hear that we should invest more in the military industrial  complex than we do in protecting Medicare and Social Security. I never  hear those words.   I also want to identify our veterans as another vulnerable group that  Republicans continue to leave behind, as not one Republican in the  House voted in support of the PACT Act.   I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and once again, let  us do everything in our power to preserve and protect Medicare and  Social Security. Let's not let the Republican Party cut it.
