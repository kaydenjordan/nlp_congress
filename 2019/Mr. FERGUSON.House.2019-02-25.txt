 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Coweta County  Sheriff Mike Yeager.   Sheriff Yeager has dedicated over 35 years in law enforcement to  keeping his community safe and serving his neighbors, both on and off  of the job.   In fact, it would take far longer than I have here tonight to list  all of the many organizations--such as the Georgia and National  Sheriff's Association, the Newnan-Coweta Public Safety Board, and the  Boy Scouts--so many organizations that he has served to make his  community and State a better place.   It is no understatement that Sheriff Yeager is a pillar of his  community and a model public servant. It is a testament to his hard  work that President Trump appointed him to be the U.S. marshal for the  Northern District of Georgia. I cannot think of anyone who is better  suited for this position.   We are awfully proud of Sheriff Yeager and his accomplishments, and I  know that he will continue to serve his State and our Nation well.                            ____________________
