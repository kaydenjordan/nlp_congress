 Mr. Chair, I rise today to defend the Second  Amendment rights of law-abiding Nebraskans.   In Nebraska, the need for firearms is the same today as it was even  when the Second Amendment was enacted before we were even a territory  of the United States.   Rural Nebraskans depend on their firearms for self-defense and for  protecting their livestock. They also know how to handle firearms, to  store them securely, to handle them appropriately, and perhaps to even  let neighbors who are able to use them safely borrow them to meet their  needs.   I have serious concerns. The bills we are considering today and  tomorrow are going to criminalize this behavior for Nebraskans who have  done this for generations and won't even know that they are breaking  the law.   Should a rancher who lends a rifle to a neighbor to address threats  from predatory animals face a year in prison and a $100,000 fine? No.   Should a legally carrying farmer who is injured at work be subject to  arrest for handing his firearm off before being taken to the hospital?  No.   These are exactly the situations this bill would create, while doing  little to address the real problems underlying crime in our society.   Mr. Chair, this is a bad bill, and I urge its swift rejection.                                time  1315
