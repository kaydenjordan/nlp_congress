 Mr. Speaker, today's debate is perhaps one of the most  dangerous games to be perpetrated in my time in Congress by the radical  right.   This bill risks our economy, our Nation's credit rating, American  jobs, retirement savings, and healthcare access.   Mr. Speaker, there is a proposal on the table, raise the debt  ceiling, full stop, just like we did under the former President. Then  let's have a robust debate about spending in a budget debate and in the  appropriations process.   But that is not what the radical right has put on the floor today. I  cannot support a bill that would cut funding for our Nation's veterans,  would cut funding to Minnesota public schools, would cost jobs, and  economists say would increase the likelihood of a recession.   This is not a serious bill from the radical right, and there is no  more serious issue facing our country right now than the prospect of  defaulting on our debt.   This is a dangerous game my colleagues are playing, and it needs to  be cut out.
