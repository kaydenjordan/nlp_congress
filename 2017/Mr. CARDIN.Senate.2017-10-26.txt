 Madam President, I rise to address the latest mass  shooting in our country. This one took place last week in my own State  of Maryland, in the city of Edgewood, in Harford County, which is  northeast of Baltimore.   In this case, the suspect gathered coworkers at his place of  business, Advanced Granite Solutions, and began shooting. He killed  three coworkers  [[Page S6840]]  and critically wounded two others who remain in critical condition at  the Maryland Shock Trauma Center. The suspect then fled to Delaware.   According to an article in the Baltimore Sun, he shot an acquaintance  in the head at a car dealership. The victim was in stable condition and  later identified his attacker to police. The suspect was finally  arrested after a brief foot chase, and police said the suspect threw a  gun at them after spotting law enforcement approaching.   This terrible shooting in Maryland came a few weeks after the worst  mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which occurred in Las Vegas, NV,  on October 1. This mass shooting from a hotel room targeting  concertgoers at an outdoor music festival left 58 dead and more than  500 people wounded, with dozens of victims still in the hospital today,  some of whom are in critical condition. These are just staggering  numbers. But I want to put a human face on this for my colleagues and  talk about one Marylander who was injured in the Las Vegas attack.    The Baltimore Sun shared the story of Tina Frost. Tina is a native of  Crofton in Anne Arundel County, MD. She is a 2008 graduate of Arundel  High School in Gambrills. She was a star soccer player in school, and  she now lives in California and works at the accounting firm of Ernst  and Young.   The story begins:         Before a bullet from 32 stories above cut through her face,       Crofton native Tina Frost drove from San Diego with her       boyfriend to see one of her favorite country artists in Las       Vegas. . . . Becky Frost said her 27-year-old sister had lost       her right eye and was in a Las Vegas intensive care unit       after a two-hour surgery. [She] said her bubbly and       charismatic older sister was in a coma that the family       expected to last about a week. Another sister wrote on       Facebook that the family was waiting to see the extent of the       brain damage. ``We're sticking together and praying,'' Becky       Frost said.    Tina Frost did wake up from the coma and was recently transferred to  Maryland for additional surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.  According to family members, she underwent a second successful surgery  last week. The family's website update said: ``We are thankful Tina is  still being a true fighter and warrior!''   Today, I want Tina and the entire Frost family to know that they are  in our thoughts and prayers. I understand that their community has  already been raising funds to help defray Tina's medical expenses for  her recovery.   This is just one example of hundreds who were victimized in Las  Vegas. I am just heartbroken by the terror in Las Vegas. With the  entire country, I am grieving for the senseless loss of life and  praying for the victims, their families, and all those who were injured  like Tina Frost, whether by gunshots or the chaos that ensued.   Much thanks also goes to the first responders, including our police,  fire, ambulance, and emergency medical workers, who saved countless  lives by helping those around them and running toward danger instead of  running away from it.   Thoughts and prayers console victims and their families, but actions  speak much louder. We must be outraged at this latest shooting, and we  must act. Congress must act. States must act. Weapons of war should not  be in the hands of civilians. We see the deadly results in Las Vegas  just as we have seen before in Orlando, Blacksburg, San Bernardino,  Aurora, Sandy Hook, the streets of Baltimore, and elsewhere across this  great country. We need to do everything in our power to stop the  carnage of these shootings. How high does the death toll have to get  before we enact real, bipartisan reforms that will make the American  public safer and reduce the risks that come from allowing such easy  access to dangerous weapons primarily designed for the battlefield?  Assault weapons are not needed to hunt deer or ducks; they are only  meant to kill people, and they do far too often in this country.   I urge my colleagues to be bold and fight to break the cycle of what  could only be described as a callous disregard for the victims of gun  violence. More talk will not save lives; only action and real change  and Federal and State laws can.   This attack and others like it in recent years tear at the heart and  leave us angry, frustrated, and confused. We as a nation must resolve  to stop those who wish to do harm to Americans from committing,  encouraging, and abetting acts of terror. We as a nation, as a  community, and as an American family must take action to change minds,  hearts, and finally change policies. We can stop others and save lives  by taking immediate action.   I was disappointed that Congress missed yet another opportunity to  enact commonsense, reasonable gun safety measures after the June 2016  shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL, which killed 49 people  and injured 53 others. The mass shooting in Las Vegas has now sadly  surpassed those numbers.   In the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock used a bump fire stock  device, which allowed a semiautomatic rifle to fire at a rate similar  to that of a fully automatic weapon--a rate of about nine bullets a  second. Fully automatic weapons are generally illegal under current  law. Paddock also stockpiled a virtual arsenal in his hotel room, as  police found 23 firearms in the room. Police also found a large  quantity of ammunition, including numerous high-capacity magazines  capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece.   The preliminary assessment--with the understanding that the  investigation is still ongoing--from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives is that the shooter legally purchased all these  guns, bump stocks, and ammunition. It is outrageous that a mass shooter  was legally able to purchase a device designed to convert his gun into  a military-style weapon with no legitimate civilian use. It is  outrageous that a mass shooter was legally able to purchase high- capacity magazine clips with no legitimate civilian use. These are  weapons of war. You don't need them for hunting, and you don't need  them for self-defense.   Earlier this month, I convened a roundtable meeting with law  enforcement officials at the First Baptist Church of Highland Park in  Prince George's County, MD. The group included officials from the  local, State, and Federal levels, including the sheriff, police chief  of Prince George's County, State delegates, the State attorney general  of Maryland, and representatives of the U.S. attorney's office.   Maryland has progressive laws on gun safety and has taken steps to  ban weapons of war and high-capacity magazines that have no legitimate  civil purpose. The group echoed the concern to me that if Maryland has  strict laws relating to gun safety that protect both the public and  police officers, what is to stop someone from driving over the border  to one of our neighboring States in order to procure guns? That is why  we need a strong national law to protect all Americans, and Congress  should act on commonsense gun safety measures.   What can we do in Congress? I have cosponsored the Automatic Gunfire  Prevention Act, which Senator Feinstein introduced. In the Las Vegas  shooting, the gunman was able to unleash hundreds of rounds of gunfire  on the crowd, likely by using the bump stock device.   Fully automatic guns or machine guns are already banned for civilian  use under the National Firearms Act, but a loophole exists that allows  for these bump stock devices, as well as similar accessories, to  convert semiautomatic weapons to emulate automatic weapons. Senator  Feinstein's legislation would close the loophole in current law that  allows conversion devices and accessories to be available to the  public. The bill bans the sale, transfer, importation, manufacturing,  or possession of bump stocks, trigger cranks, or anything that  accelerates a semiautomatic rifle's rate of fire. Semiautomatic rifles  typically have a rate of fire of 45 to 60 rounds per minute; a bump  stock could increase the semiautomatic rifle rate of fire to 700 rounds  per minute or 9 per second.    I have also cosponsored the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device  Act, also known as the Keeping Americans Safe Act, introduced by  Senator Menendez. It prohibits the possession or transfer of large- capacity ammunition magazines--more than 10 rounds per magazine--with  limited exceptions for law enforcement personnel. Senator Menendez's  bill authorizes a buyback program for high-capacity magazines using  Byrne JAG grants.   To me, these two bills represent a practical, commonsense approach to  [[Page S6841]]  promoting gun safety and reducing the threat of gun violence without  impinging on the rights of legitimate owners.   As NBC News recently reported, more Americans have died from gunshots  in the last 50 years than in all the wars in America's history. Since  1968, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun-related  incidents, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention.   I have also cosponsored the Background Check Expansion Act,  introduced by Senator Murphy. This bill would expand Federal background  checks to cover the sale and transfer of all firearms by private  sellers, just as licensed dealers are required to do so under the  existing Brady law, with certain limited exceptions.   Under current law, unlicensed or private sellers are not required to  conduct a background check prior to transferring a firearm. This is  outrageous, and Congress should act right now to close this dangerous  loophole. It should not matter whether you buy a gun at a local gun  store or a gun show or the internet--you should have to pass a basic  background check to make sure the guns are kept out of the hands of  people who should never have one.   Congress has an obligation to act. As I have indicated before, we  need to act. Inaction is not an option. Many of our States have acted  as well, including my own State of Maryland, but we need a national law  that applies to all 50 States to ban bump stocks, prohibit the sale or  transfer of high-capacity magazine clips, eliminate the private  ownership of assault-type weapons, and require universal background  checks for all purchasers.   The time for action is now. We cannot wait. Congress should come  together and address the real problem, which is lax gun safety laws,  and should pass commonsense gun safety measures to protect all  Americans. Let's not wait for the next mass shooting, when we send our  thoughts and prayers to victims and then stand by and pretend we are  helpless and powerless to prevent another tragedy. Let's take action  now.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee held a hearing on an issue that I consider one of  the greatest moral tests of our time in the conduct of U.S. foreign  policy--the situation in Burma, where the Burmese military is  committing ethnic cleansing and is perpetrating atrocities.   We have a humanitarian crisis. We have perpetrators who expect  impunity and a situation, under the watch of the international  community and the Trump administration, that is allowing for the  perpetration of atrocities.   Ethnic cleansing is defined by the United Nations Commission of  Experts as ``rendering an area ethnically homogenous by using force or  intimidation to remove persons of given groups from an area.'' Half of  the population of the Rohingya in Burma have left--600,000 people out  of 1.2 million. I might add that, of those who remain, many are  dislocated. There has been a systematic burning of their villages. This  didn't just start. It has been a campaign that has gone on for a long  period of time, since a 1982 law that denies the Rohingya citizenship,  even though they have been residents for generations.   The Rohingya are denied freedom of movement. They are denied freedom  of education. They are denied healthcare. This has been a systematic  effort to destroy an ethnic community.   We have seen this happen far too long in too many places around the  world. Once again, we see this happening today in Burma. Once again,  this is the expectation: Well, it is far away; we will just let it go  along.   The Senate should be outraged about what is happening. We need to see  the international community come together and say: No, we will not let  this continue. We will hold accountable those who are responsible for  these actions, we will provide humanitarian need immediately, and we  will stop this type of conduct in a civilized society. This just cannot  occur.   In fact, I think what is transpiring in the Rakhine State today is  genocide. I know there will be some discussion about whether it is  genocide or not based upon technical definitions. Yet what we see in  Burma today clearly meets the definition of ``deliberately inflicting  on a group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical  destruction in whole or in part.'' That is what is happening in Burma,  and that is genocide.   The Burmese military is clearly trying to destroy the Rohingya  population. For decades, the Burmese Government has systemically  repressed the Rohingya people. This is a fact, and they have  deliberately failed to integrate the population into the general  population. As the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights correctly  stated, the ``decades of persistent and systematic human rights  violations . . . have almost certainly contribute[d] to the nurturing  of violent extremism, with everyone ultimately losing.'' They complain  about extremism. Yet they are creating it.   In my opinion, we are witnessing a military-sponsored ethnic  cleansing campaign on the Rohingya, and it will take significant  engagement from the international community, at the highest levels and  in partnership with the Burmese civilian government, to address and to  hold the perpetrators accountable for these horrific acts.   Seventy-five years ago, the world and the United States could have  claimed ignorance or lack of information as an excuse for inaction in  the face of crimes against humanity, genocide, and barbarism. Today, we  have no excuse.   Unfortunately, the Rohingya crisis is not the only vexing challenge  Burma faces. The Burmese military continues to hold significant  influence in politics and in the economy. The peace process, which  sought to end a longstanding civil war in the country, has stalled.  There are significant reports of human rights issues such as human  trafficking, free speech infringement, and political repression. The  military control Burma today. That is unacceptable, and that is why we  imposed sanctions, because of military control. Sanction relief was  given for what? So that people could be ethnically cleansed?   I was pleased to hear State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi committed to  implementing all of Kofi Annan's Rakhine State recommendations and to  ensure that the Rohingya, who have fled in the face of brutal military  repression, have a right to return to their homes. However, she must  continue to make this a top priority and work with the international  community to provide both the safety of the Rohingya left in Burma and  those who want to come home. It is going to be difficult since their  villages have been destroyed. Are they going to live in camps? Will  they have protection? Will they be safe? If the past is any indication,  we have real challenges ahead of us.   Although I would count myself among those who have been disappointed  with the civilian authorities and think they should have been more  vocal, I am keenly aware of the real limits of their power and ability  to  [[Page S6843]]  govern under the current Burmese Constitution and the military's  control of a large portion of Burma's economy.   We have a challenge on our hands in Burma, and we need to be engaged.  But the civilian leadership must take responsibility and must speak  out. Too often, the international community has done too little, waited  too long, or been caught unprepared by events that should not have  surprised us. We continue to forget the lessons of the past and fail to  live up to the post-Holocaust pledge of ``never again.'' Ignoring the  genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity that continue to rage  around the world sends a message to the global community that atrocity  crimes are tolerable. We must respond robustly to the crisis unfolding  in Burma because it is the right thing to do and because it is in our  national interest to do so.   The United Nations is calling the military campaign ``a textbook  example of ethnic cleansing'' against Rohingya Muslims. From credible  human rights organizations and newspapers, there are consistent  accounts of widespread extrajudicial killings, arson, rape, and other  atrocities. At least 288 villages have been decimated, according to  Human Rights Watch, which has used satellite imagery as evidence of the  devastation caused by the so-called ``clearance operations.''   These current attacks on the Rohingya follow decades of state-led  persecution and dehumanization. Government efforts to deny Rohingya  citizenship rights, to restrict their freedom of movement and the  practice of their faith, and to deny their basic human rights have all  been identified as precursors to a genocide.   The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights found that  the attacks were executed in a well-organized, coordinated, and  systematic manner by the Myanmar Security Forces, often supported by  the armed Rakhine Buddhists. They have described the attacks as a  ``cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without  possibility of return.''   There were also appalling acts of sexual violence, which clearly  amount to crimes against humanity and/or acts of genocide that must not  be forgotten. Women and girls, some as young as 5, were raped by men in  uniform in front of their families. U.N. and other health workers said  that after this most recent August 2017 military crackdown, they  treated dozens of Rohingya women and girls who escaped to Bangladesh  for injuries consistent with violent sexual attacks.   One woman told Human Rights Watch that she and four other women were  taken to a hut, slashed with knives, and sexually assaulted. The  soldiers then set the hut on fire. She was the only one to escape  alive. Another woman who was raped still has injuries from the machete  attack and beatings that accompanied the rape and said she barely  managed to escape from a burning house.   I also want to draw attention to the needs of the survivors, their  families, and communities. There is an acute lack of healthcare  available to the survivors, including reproductive health,  psychosocial, and other critical services.   Seventy-five years ago, the world--and the United States--could have  said they did not know what is happening. Today we do. Today we have no  excuse. Instead, the international community must hold the perpetrators  accountable. In addition, to date, no real progress has been made  either holding perpetrators of serious violations accountable or in  addressing the root causes underlying the situation in Burma.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to act.   The strong statements by Ambassador Haley and last month by the Vice  President must be followed up with action. The administration should  lead efforts for action in the Security Council. The Security Council  should insist that persons responsible for grave abuses be held  accountable for their crimes. It also should press the Burmese  authority to cooperate with the U.N. factfinding mission established by  the United Nations Human Rights Council and grant unfettered access to  its staff to Burma, including the Rakhine State.   We need to know what is happening on the ground. We need to know that  in order to protect people and to get the evidence necessary to hold  the perpetrators accountable. The Council should send a clear message  that it stands ready to take additional steps to ensure justice,  including through the International Criminal Court, and urge member  states to pursue other mechanisms that might provide justice for recent  abuses.   I should also add that Bangladesh deserves credit for keeping its  borders open to the influx of refugees--600,000 have fled to  Bangladesh, and they kept their borders open. Bangladesh has been one  of the few bright spots in the current crisis and should continue to  honor its promise to build shelters for new arrivals, accelerate  humanitarian assistance, and provide the needed medical service for  this traumatized group.   I also believe the United States needs to reevaluate our policy and  approach to Burma. We need to have a policy in regard to Burma that we  understand, that addresses these human rights violations, that  reevaluates our approach for our relationship with the Burmese  military, and that relooks at how to best use sanctions as a way to  seek additional leverage with the Burmese Government and military.   I am working with a number of my colleagues, on both sides of the  aisle, on legislation to seek to clarify U.S. policy and to address  some of these issues.   As the President prepares for his upcoming trip to the ASEAN Summit  in the region, Congress will be watching closely to see if he makes  Burma and human rights a top priority during this trip and to see what  he and his administration choose to undertake in the coming days to  address the tragedy unfolding in Rakhine State.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
