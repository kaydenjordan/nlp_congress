 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the HEROES Act. This  bold relief package recognizes the commitment to our Postal Service,  providing critical emergency funding for the fiscal solvency of the  Postal Service, to ensure we fulfill our democratic duties to be  counted in the 2020 Census and vote in the upcoming primary.   It also demonstrates that we will stay committed to our local  governments to have the resources that they have lost during this  pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, this investment is for our families, for our  communities, and for our country.
