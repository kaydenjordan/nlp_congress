 Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last month, I was grateful  to join House Republicans in passing the Limit, Save, Grow Act, which  will limit government spending, reduce the Federal regulatory state,  and promote pro-growth energy and economic policies, creating jobs.  House Republicans, led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have acted  responsibly to address the debt limit deadline.   On behalf of American families now and in the future, this  legislation should next pass the Senate.   Americans are struggling every day with 40-year-high inflation, jobs  destroyed, rising gas prices, and the highest interest rates in  decades. Unfortunately, President Biden has insisted on a blank check  to increase the debt ceiling without any reforms on how Biden spends  and wastes taxpayer money.   This legislation will save an estimated $4.8 trillion over 10 years,  maintaining a strong national defense and protecting Medicare and  Social Security.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
