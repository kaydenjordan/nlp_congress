 Madam President, I would like to start by saying a few  words about the horrific shooting that occurred in Houston, TX, at  about 5 o'clock yesterday.   A team of narcotics patrol officers from the Houston Police  Department were serving a warrant. As soon as they breached the door at  the home in southeast Houston, the suspects opened fire. Four officers  were hit; one critically, and one other was injured as a result of an  unrelated mishap. Three of these officers were in good condition, and  two remained in critical but stable condition in the hospital.   For the case agent, the most senior officer on the narcotics squad,  this was the third time he had been shot in the line of duty--once in  1992 and again in 1997. He told Chief Art Acevedo: ``I had to get in  there because I knew my guys were down.''   I echo the Houston Police Union President Joe Gamaldi, who said last  night that enough is enough. This type of attack against law  enforcement is unconscionable and unacceptable. These are dedicated  public servants who have taken an oath to serve and protect our  communities and who potentially sacrifice their very lives every day to  keep our families safe.   Today, with a heavy heart, I want to thank the Houston Police  Department and law enforcement officers across the country who put on  the uniform each morning, never knowing what the day might bring. We  are incredibly grateful for their service and the tremendous sacrifices  they make.   I also want to acknowledge the work of the Houston Fire and EMS  Department who moved Heaven and Earth to ensure these heroic, wounded  officers got the medical care they needed as soon as possible.   I thank my friends Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Chief Acevedo  for their leadership during this very difficult time for the city of  Houston and our entire State.   My wife Sandy and I are praying for the officers, their families, and  their brothers and sisters in blue.                                     S. 1    Madam President, on another matter, the Senate is, of course,  considering S. 1, a package of four bills that were considered in the  115th Congress, but the clock ran out before these bills could be voted  on, on the Senate floor.   Each of these bills enjoys broad, bipartisan support, and I am glad  we have the opportunity to push this legislation over the finish line  this week.   The administration recently announced that U.S. troops will begin a  conditions-based withdrawal from Syria. While we await additional  details on the timeline and extent of this move, we must take action to  ensure the stability of the region during the process and reassure our  allies of our commitment.   My friend and colleague Senator Rubio, the lead sponsor of this bill,  once compared the threat of ISIS to a tumor. He said: If you treat a  tumor with radiation, it will get smaller and smaller and smaller, but  if you stop before it is completely gone, it will come back. So it is  with ISIS.   First and foremost, the Strengthening America's Security in the  Middle East Act supports our allies in the region, including Israel and  Jordan. With Israel in particular, the bill authorizes the United  States to provide military assistance to support funding cooperative  programs to develop, produce, and procure essential military equipment,  such as defensive missiles and rockets. This will help Israel maintain  its qualitative military edge against increasingly well-equipped,  Iranian-backed forces.   This bill also provides U.S. State and local governments with greater  flexibility to counter the boycott, divestment, and sanctions, or BDS,  movement. This anti-Israel crusade has waged economic war against the  Jewish State by pushing companies around the world to boycott any  business with Israel or its entities.   This does not outlaw BDS activity but instead provides State and  local governments with the same flexibility afforded to private  companies. They can decide not to do business with companies that are  boycotting or divesting from Israel.   To support our ally Jordan, this bill authorizes legislation to  strengthen our defense cooperation. With an estimated 740,000 refugees  in Jordan--a very small country--this legislation recognizes the  immense impact the ongoing conflict in Syria continues to have on  neighboring countries, including Jordan, and it supports that  government's effort to provide ongoing humanitarian support.   The final piece of the bill speaks to the ongoing conflict and  humanitarian crisis in Syria, which has claimed the lives of some  400,000 people--400,000 people. It provides aid to impacted communities  and condemns the heinous human rights violations committed by the Assad  regime. Notably, it imposes new sanctions on anyone who does business  with or otherwise financially supports the Syrian regime.   This is certainly not an effort to put Humpty Dumpty back together  again.  [[Page S734]]  Unfortunately, Syria has been broken by the civil war and the fact that  Iran, Russia, and terrorist organizations are all vying for space and  influence, but it is an important step to protect U.S. interests in the  region. That is what this bill represents.   Notably absent are strong measures focused on addressing the region's  primary antagonist, the nation of Iran--the world's leading state  sponsor of terrorism.   Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, is a branch of  Iran's Armed Forces with an unconventional role. Unlike military  operations that promote national security, the IRGC tries to squash  democracy movements both at home and abroad by pushing its extreme  ideology beyond Iran's borders. This branch wields vast power and  influence, and it uses its capabilities to spark turmoil throughout the  Middle East.   What I find particularly concerning is that the IRGC, the primary  military appendage of the Ayatollah, is the one in control of Iran's  ballistic missile system. That is the same program which,  unfortunately, only accelerated under the previous Presidential  administration of President Obama.    The primary enemy of the IRGC is Israel, which it threatens both  directly through its land bridge across Iraq and Syria and indirectly  through its support of terrorist groups, such as Lebanese Hezbollah,  Hamas, and other Palestinian militant groups. The IRGC funds terrorist  proxies by providing heavy weapons, training, and funds to advance the  Iranian regime's goal of regional domination. It has helped Hezbollah  alone to amass more than 100,000 missiles capable of striking virtually  anywhere in the State of Israel.   The financial machines that keep these operations afloat consist of a  clandestine network of front companies, including energy, construction,  telecommunications, banking, and financial sectors. We are not talking  about just a handful of small businesses here. It is estimated that the  IRGC alone controls one-quarter of Iran's economy.   So, yes, this legislation does take important steps to promote U.S.  interests in the Middle East, but actions against the IRGC are  desperately needed.   In addition to the threat already posed by this group, we cannot  allow our withdrawal from Syria to open up the window to Iran and its  terrorist proxies. Today, I am offering an amendment to this  legislation that will address the actions of the IRGC. This amendment  enjoyed bipartisan support last Congress with 8 bipartisan cosponsors  in the Senate and more than 220 cosponsors in the House. This amendment  is entitled the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Economic Exclusion  Act, and it will take steps to increase economic pressure on the  aggressive actions taken by Iran and executed by the IRGC.   The bill will impose additional sanctions on the IRGC by lowering the  threshold to sanction entities supporting these activities. That means  the front companies that are bankrolling the IRGC's attacks against our  allies can now be sanctioned, effectively cutting off their cash flow.  In addition, it penalizes any other person or company that supports the  IRGC, including a complete ban on transactions with U.S. businesses or  individuals.   Of course, in order to sanction any entity, we first have to know  that they are associated with the IRGC. This bill would require that  entities for which there is a reasonable basis to believe IRGC owns at  least 33 percent be reported and included. It also requires a report  analyzing foreign and domestic supply chains that in some way support  or aid the IRGC and its activities.   I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, which takes a  strong stand against Iran, the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism, and  its military arm, the IRGC. This group has supported the genocidal  Assad regime and has the blood of countless innocent civilians on its  hands.
