 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the fiscal  year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I would like to  start by thanking Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Thornberry, and the  House Armed Services Committee staff who have worked  [[Page H6934]]  tirelessly throughout this past year to get us to this point. It's a  good bill and I encourage my colleagues to support the conference  report.   As the Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I worked closely with  members on and off the committee to ensure the bill addressed key  priority areas affecting our military.   First, the bill includes a number of bipartisan provisions aimed at  addressing climate change. The bill does the following: requires an  update to the Department of Defense Climate Change Roadmap; requires a  report on the implementation of provisions from the FY2020 National  Defense Authorization Act related to installation master planning,  updates to the Unified Facilities Criteria, sea-level rise modeling,  and climate assessment tools; includes an alternative fuel vehicle  pilot program to require the military departments to expand their use  of alternative fuel non-tactical vehicles to increase the use of hybrid  and EV vehicles; requires the Department to submit a report on its  greenhouse gas emissions for the last 10 years within 180 days of  enactment; requires the Department to invest in research and  development of advanced water harvesting technologies that would aid in  addressing water security issues in areas impacted by drought due to  climate change; expands the Department's ability to use installation  resilience authorities to support climate resiliency projects at  National Guard Facilities owned by the State; and requires the military  services to assess their water use at installations in regions  experiencing water scarcity, maximize use of landscaping practices that  reduce water usage, and improve their water conservation.   The bill also includes provisions that address energy resiliency for  military bases, including the following: requires a report on efforts  taken to ensure fuel consumption, distribution, and logistics are being  considered across the Department and that steps are being taken to  reduce consumption of fossil fuels by 30 percent in 25 years to reduce  the number of resupply convoys and oilers required in a contested  environment; requires the Department of Defense to institute energy  metering on critical military facilities to assess the energy  requirements and plan to ensure resilient power sources for these  facilities; establishes a pilot program to develop microgrids on  military installations that integrate emergency diesel generators to  demonstrate how microgrid emergency diesel generator backup power could  create efficiencies and resiliency while reducing costs and emissions;  promotes the use of on-site energy production to promote military  installation energy resiliency and energy security; requires an  assessment of the Department's installation and operational energy  usage; re-establishes the Operational Energy Capability Improvement  Fund, which was eliminated in the budget request, and authorizes $65  million to demonstrate and field technologies that reduce fuel  consumption and logistics; establishes an Operational Energy budget  line to enhance transparency and congressional oversight of the  Department's efforts to reduce fossil fuel usage and make conservation  gains on operational platforms; and requires the Comptroller General to  assess the Department's progress towards meeting net zero goals for  installations to include an assessment of the cultural and legislative  barriers to meeting these goals.   The bill continues efforts to address contamination associated with  per- and polyfluorinated compounds around military installations,  including the following provisions: requires the Secretary of Defense  to notify all agricultural operations in an area where covered PFAS has  been detected in groundwater that is suspected to originate from use of  firefighting foam on a military installation; requires the Department  of Defense to notify the congressional defense committees when there  has been an uncontrolled release of PFAS-containing firefighting agent;  establishes a prize that can be awarded by the Secretary of Defense for  innovative research that results in a viable replacement agent for  firefighting foam that does not contain PFAS; requires the Department  of Defense to survey and report on non-firefighting agent technologies,  such as hangar flooring and firefighting equipment, that will help  facilitate the phase-out of PFAS containing firefighting agents; makes  technical corrections to the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act  to ensure that all National Guard installations are eligible for  funding under the Defense Environmental Restoration Account for PFAS  remediation; establishes an interagency coordinating body for PFAS  research; prohibits the Department of Defense from procuring certain  items containing PFAS, including cookware, carpets, and upholstery with  stain-resistant coatings; authorizes the Department to work with  private entities to spur research, development and testing of PFAS-free  fire-fighting agents; requires the National Institute of Standard and  Technology to study the safety of firefighting equipment with respect  to protecting fire fighters from PFAS, and conduct research on  improving the safety of this equipment; authorizes $90 million for  research lines that support development of PFAS remediation and  disposal technologies and firefighting agent replacement; and  authorizes a total of $1.4 billion for environmental remediation and  BRAC accounts which support a range of remediation activities, to  include those related to PFAS, at current military installations,  formerly utilized defense sites, and installations closed by BRAC.   The bill also builds on the Committee's previous legislative and  oversight activities to ensure that military personnel and their  families live in quality housing and that the Department and private  housing partners are responsive to resident concerns. The bill does the  following: requires a report on the oversight of known environmental  hazards in government owned family housing, including overseas housing;  requires the Department of Defense to report on the feasibility of  standardizing privatized housing performance metrics to better allow  the Department to track trends across the housing enterprise; for  future and renegotiated privatized housing agreements, requires that  funding for housing maintenance and recapitalization be prioritized  ahead of housing management and other fees in the payment structure;  updates minimum health and safety standards for all military base  housing, requires transparency for private housing company contract  performance fees, and requires a report on the status of other military  housing reforms; increases transparency by requiring DOD to notify  Congress of large expenditures coming from the family housing  reinvestment accounts; repeals the provision in Title 10 that allowed  the Department of Defense to place families in substandard housing  units; requires the Secretary of Defense to implement Comptroller  General recommendations for improvement of military family housing; and  authorizes an additional $60 million for oversight and improvement of  the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) program and to  continue addressing environmental and maintenance issues in government- owned family housing.   Other important provisions that I am pleased are in the conference  report include the following: establishes an independent commission to  make binding recommendations to the Secretary of Defense for the  modification or removal of all names, symbols, displays, monuments, and  paraphernalia that honor or commemorate the Confederate States of  America or any person who served voluntarily with the Confederate  States of America from all assets of the Department of Defense; amends  the national emergency military construction authority (10 USC 2808) to  set an annual limit of $100 million for the domestic use of the  authority and $500 million for overseas projects, with an exception for  medical projects that may be necessary to support response to a health  emergency or pandemic; does not backfill military construction funds  stolen for the border wall; makes technical corrections to the Paid  Parental Leave benefit provided through the FY20 National Defense  Authorization Act to ensure that Federal Aviation Administration,  Department of Veterans Affairs, and certain other civilian employees  inadvertently omitted from the legislation receive the paid parental  leave benefit; establishes the Office of Local Defense Community  Cooperation and codifies in law the Department of Defense entity that  runs the Joint Land Use Study, DOD Schools, Defense Community  Infrastructure Program, and Defense Manufacturing Community Support  Program to ensure stability and effective community engagement;  authorizes $50 million for the Defense Community Infrastructure Program  (DCIP) and clarifies congressional intent with respect to the  implementation of the program; provides long overdue benefits to  Vietnam-Era Veterans, adding hypothyroidism, bladder cancer and  Parkinsonism to the Agent Orange Presumptive Conditions List; and  prohibits retirement of the RQ-4 or U-2 aircraft until specific  certifications or waivers have been provided to Congress.   I'm also pleased this NDAA includes a 3 percent pay raise for our  troops and includes several provisions that establish a National  Maritime Logistics Fleet to bolster America's maritime sector. This is  accomplished by strengthening US-flagged vessel requirements for the  transportation of military cargo and fuels, creating a Tanker Security  Program to address the shortfall in US-flagged, US-crewed tankers, and  requiring the Navy to initiate an affordable, domestic built sealift  ship. Strengthening our maritime logistics will bolster our nation's  commercial shipping industry and enhance our military's capabilities by  improving the overarching defense industrial base that supports each  branch of our armed services.   I am also pleased with the inclusion of the remaining provision of my  bill, H.R. 2617, the Occupational and Environmental Transparency Health  Act, to require DoD to integrate information from the Burn Pit Registry  into servicemembers' Electronic Health Records to aid in the  collection, documentation, and tracking of any exposures to  Occupational Environmental Health (OEH) hazards. The legislative  [[Page H6935]]  intent of H.R. 2617 has been fully accomplished through the NDAA as  last year's FY20 NDAA required DoD to input any OEH hazards exposure  into servicemembers' records while deployed so it is tracked throughout  their career and into veteran status.   Overall, I am proud of the Readiness Subcommittee's contribution to  this year's bill and would like to thank the Readiness staff, Brian  Garrett, Jeanine Womble, Melanie Harris, Jay Vallario, John Muller,  Dave Sienicki, and Sean Falvey, and my personal staff, Betsy Thompson,  Marcus Jones, and Danusia Hubah, for their tireless work. Marcus and  Danusia will be departing the Hill after next week, and I would like to  personally thank them for their hard work and sharing their expertise  with us this past year. Both Marcus and Danusia have been invaluable  members of my staff and we will miss them dearly.   This bill helps advance our military's near-term readiness goals and  drives the Department to plan for and take action against long-term  threats. The conference report also authorizes funding that will  strengthen DOD and the country's ability to respond to potential COVID- 19 resurgence and other infectious diseases in the future. With that, I  urge my colleagues to support the FY21 NDAA.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the final  ``Water Resources Development Act of 2020'' (S. 1811). Working with  other members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I  am very pleased to reach agreement with the Senate on a truly  bipartisan bill and the fourth biennial Water Resources Development Act  (WRDA) to be passed by Congress since 2014.   My Congressional district includes 200 miles of the Sacramento River  and is adjacent to several major ports. WRDA 2020 includes key  provisions for the California Delta and Central Valley to authorize and  expedite construction of flood protection and aquatic ecosystem  restoration projects, address harmful algal blooms, and give local  agencies greater flexibility in using federal Army Corps funds to  better meet local needs. Under Chairman DeFazio's leadership, the bill  finally fixes the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to ensure that regional  dredging and navigation projects are fully funded.   I secured Congressional authorization for the Delta Islands and  Levees Ecosystem Restoration Project, Yuba River Ecosystem Restoration  Project, and Sacramento Regional Groundwater Bank in WRDA 2020. These  projects provide critical flood protection and make local communities  across the Central Valley more resilient to climate change.   I also secured deauthorization of the Sacramento Riverbed Gradient  Restoration Facility and Western Pacific Interceptor Canal, returning  these former Army Corps projects to full local control.   WRDA 2020 also expedites completion of the Army Corps' feasibility  studies needed for the San Francisco Bay to Stockton Navigation  Improvement Project, Lower Cache Creek Flood Risk Management Project,  and Sutter Bypass and Sacramento River Basin Floodplain Management  Project. I look forward to securing Congressional authorization for  these projects once the Army Corps completes the requisite feasibility  studies.   Working with Rep. Doris O. Matsui (CA-06), I secured inclusion of our  ``Yolo Bypass System Improvement Act'' in WRDA 2020 to improve  coordinated planning for all restoration projects and federal  permitting in the Yolo Bypass.   Lastly, I am very pleased that the new Army Corps harmful algal bloom  program established under WRDA 2020 includes the California Delta as a  focus area. This will better protect the Delta's precious ecosystem  from toxic algal blooms.   The House report for WRDA 2020 includes my amendment directing the  Army Corps to report to Congress on implementation of the Small  Business Act across all the Corps' missions. This strengthens  Congressional oversight over the Corps' contracting process and ensures  that the Small Business Act is implemented fully in an equitably  distributed manner, as intended by Congress.   I want to extend a special appreciation to my colleague Rep. Grace F.  Napolitano (CA-32), chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources  and Environment, for her tireless work in this WRDA for the entire  California delegation. WRDA 2020 ensures that Army Corps projects in  California requiring earthquake-resistance and other seismic safety  costs remain equally competitive for federal funding compared to  projects in other states.   I urge all Members of Congress to support this bipartisan WRDA 2020,  which is expected to be signed into law this year. This two-year  authorization bill provides the federal support and certainty needed to  keep Army Corps projects across California on time and on budget.
