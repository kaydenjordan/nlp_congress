 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the United States of America has  always paid its bills on time--always. It is an unbroken record that  dates back to our founding--a 232-year streak--and that unbroken record  has helped the United States become the anchor of the global financial  system and the many benefits that it brings to every American in our  country. But now, as we have heard on this floor over the last 2 days  and more, Senate Republicans are threatening to end that unbroken  record.   Senate Republican Leader McConnell has not only said that he and  Senate Republicans will vote against increasing the debt ceiling to  allow us to pay bills that are already due and owing but that they will  block a vote on the measure altogether. That would destroy our economy;  it would throw our country into a recession; it could cause the loss of  millions of jobs all over the Nation, and trillions of dollars of  wealth would collapse.   What makes this threat by Senate Republicans so especially outrageous  is that they know exactly what devastation will be caused by their  actions. In fact, in 2019, Senator McConnell himself stressed the  importance of raising the debt limit so we could avoid an unnecessary  economic meltdown.   Here is what he said then:         We need to address the debt limit. It secures our Nation's       full faith and credit and ensures that Congress will not       throw this kind of unnecessary wrench into the gears of our       job growth and thriving economy.    He knew, plain and simple, that refusing to increase our debt limit  would throw a wrench into the gears of our job growth.   In fact, after voting to raise the debt limit that year, he said:         We raised the debt ceiling because America can't default .       . . That would be a disaster.    ``That would be a disaster.'' That is what the Senate Republican said  about what happens if you don't raise the debt ceiling--the exact thing  that he and Senate Republicans are threatening to do right now.   The Republican leader, Senator McConnell, was not alone in expressing  those sentiments. When President  [[Page S6638]]  Trump was in charge, Senate Republicans voted to raise the debt limit  three times, and the Democrats joined them in doing that when President  Trump was in office because we, too, understood the consequences of  failing to pay our bills on time. And let's not kid ourselves. There  are lots of things that President Trump and Senate Republicans did over  those 4 years that we disagreed with--policies that we thought were  irresponsible, not good for the country--including the 2017 Trump tax  plan that provided huge tax breaks to the biggest corporations in the  country, tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, with over $2 trillion  added to our national debt. They didn't pay for a dime. Not a penny of  that was paid for--it was all on the credit card--but when it came time  to pay the bills that were due and owing for our country, the Democrats  joined the Republicans in lifting the debt ceiling because we knew the  devastating consequences of the alternative.    Let's also be very clear that the moneys that we currently owe, that  are currently due and owing, are largely made up of the debt incurred  when President Trump was in office. The national debt increased by a  total of $7.8 trillion during that 4-year period. In fact, over one- quarter of our entire national debt comes from those 4 years of the  Trump administration, and our Republican Senate colleagues spent those  4 years voting here in the U.S. Senate for policies that they now say  they don't want to pay for. They voted to put expenses on the credit  card, and now, when it is time to pay the bill on that credit card,  they are like: Sorry. We are out of here. The country is on your own.   So this is, obviously, rank hypocrisy, plain and simple. If that were  all, it would be unsurprising--in fact, sadly, expected--but while the  hypocrisy is shameful, what is downright dangerous are the consequences  of that hypocrisy.   A recent study was done by Mark Zandi--he is the chief economist at  Moody's Analytics--who estimates that a prolonged default would cost  the U.S. economy up to 6 million jobs, wipe out as much as $15 trillion  in household wealth, and send the unemployment rate surging to,  roughly, 9 percent, just as we are working to again stabilize our  economy and pull out of the downturn that we have been in.   Now, those predictions are frightening, but they shouldn't be  surprising to anybody. You know, our constituents--none of us--can just  decide one morning, as they get up, to say, ``Do you know what? We are  not going to make a mortgage payment. We are not going to make a rental  payment. We are not going to make a payment for our cars,'' without  expecting to suffer some financial consequences ourselves.   So imagine, one morning, that the Senators here--in this case,  Republican Senators--get up and say: The United States of America is  not going to pay its bills today. That sends shock waves throughout the  entire country and system, and that is why you get the cataclysmic  results that Mark Zandi at Moody's Analytics is predicting, and that is  why we are hearing from every responsible adult that we can't allow  this to happen.   Six former Secretaries of the Treasury, having served under  Presidents of both parties, have urged the congressional leadership to  make sure we raise the debt ceiling and pay our bills that are  currently due and owing. They made clear ``postponing action to raise  the debt limit until too close to the deadline undermines confidence in  our political system at home and abroad.''   In other words, what they are saying is, when you go over the  waterfall, you are in deep trouble, but even if you get close to it and  can begin to hear the rumbling waters of that waterfall, so can the  rest of the world and the financial system, and that, in itself, ends  up causing economic damage.   As Secretary Yellen said, it would be ``unthinkable'' for the United  States to do what Senate Republicans are proposing to do, and the chief  policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that the United  States of America defaulting on its obligations is not an option.   They are all right. We should be listening to them and to the  American people because, if Republicans continue on the path they are,  it is going to cause job loss, and that loss in household wealth, as  well, will be hitting families throughout this country.   So, if the necessity of raising the debt ceiling is so clear, why are  we here?   Well, I have been listening to our Republican colleagues over the  last couple days, and they say, well, they don't want to raise the debt  ceiling because they don't like the Democratic plans to beat COVID-19,  and they don't like the Build Back Better agenda. There are two  fundamental misunderstandings with this argument.   The first, as I mentioned, is that these are bills that are already  due and owing, and Republicans voted for a lot of these policies. In  fact, I have seen them back home in their States telling their  constituents how they helped deliver relief for small businesses and  how they helped expand broadband. Well, that is part of the bill that  is coming due right now that we have to lift the debt ceiling to pay  for.   But they also fundamentally misunderstand what President Biden is  talking about in his Build Back Better agenda. I know, these days, it  is an alien idea to many of our Republican colleagues, but President  Biden and Democrats are planning to pay for the Build Back Better  agenda. We are putting out proposals to do that, to reform our Tax  Code, to reform our Tax Code in a way that we should do anyway,  regardless of the important investments that we need to make, and to  reform our Tax Code so that major multinational corporations cannot  continue to park millions and billions of dollars of profits in  overseas tax havens, like the Cayman Islands and other places, and  shirk their obligations to this country and to the American people.   We should shut down those loopholes. Some of those loopholes also  encourage those companies to move their plants and workers overseas. We  should shut down those loopholes. We should make sure that the IRS has  the capability to enforce the current law and taxes that are already  due and owing under current law. The current IRS Commissioner,  appointed by the former President, has said that we lose hundreds of  billions of dollars to people who are cheating on their taxes. That  hurts all the rest of us in this country, and most of those people are  higher income people. We need to make sure that the very wealthiest  people in the country--the billionaires--pay some taxes. We have seen  some years when they pay zero in taxes, some of them.   I keep hearing from our Republican colleagues that they don't want to  vote for this because of some future plan, even though what we are  talking about now is to pay for other things that have been previously  incurred which Senate Republicans voted for, and they are criticizing a  plan which we intend to pay for.   And, yes, we have planned to make some important investments with  that revenue. We intend to extend the tax cuts for middle- and lower- income families with kids. They are going to expire at the end of this  year, December 31. The up to $300 a month tax cut for families for each  child, that goes away if we don't enact the Build Back Better agenda.   We intend to reduce the cost of prescription drugs--something that is  hitting every American really hard in their pocketbook.   We intend to increase the availability and affordability of high- quality childcare. A lot of parents aren't reentering the workforce  because, like every parent, they want to make sure their child is in a  safe and secure place during the day, and it doesn't make economic  sense if they have to pay as much for that childcare as they make on  the job. So we need to address that issue.   We want to expand Medicare to cover vision, dental, and hearing  services. That is a big gap in the program.   So I hear Republicans down here railing against the Build Back Better  agenda even though every survey shows that the American people of all  parties support that agenda. And then I hear them say they are not  going to vote to lift this debt ceiling because of that proposal even  though we are planning to pay for that proposal.   I just heard one of our colleagues talking about inflation. The  reality is, if you pay as you go, then that is not a problem. The  problem is when people put everything on the credit card and then  decide not to pay for it. That is what the Republicans did during the  2017 Trump tax plan.  [[Page S6639]]    So I would just say to my colleagues: You yourself are on record here  in the U.S. Senate talking about what kind of economic devastation  would be caused if the United States defaults on its debts if we don't  lift the debt ceiling. You know what that action would mean for  American families because you have said it here on the Senate floor and  around the country. So don't threaten the American people and our  entire economy with something that you know to be so irresponsible.   I will end with this: You should do the right thing and join with  Democrats in lifting the debt ceiling to pay for bills that are already  due and owing and that you voted for. But, for goodness' sake, if you  don't want to do the right thing, at least get out of the way. At least  don't use the filibuster to prevent Democrats from doing the right  thing for the country. That is a cynical ploy. I don't know what the  political calculus is.   I have heard the Republican leader say that he didn't want the Biden  agenda to succeed, but, for God's sake, let's put country first, and  let's make sure that we do the right thing for the American people.  Let's lift the debt ceiling. Let's pay our bills on time, as we have  done every year throughout our history.   I urge my colleagues to either do the right thing on the vote or get  out of the way and help the country.   I yield the floor.
