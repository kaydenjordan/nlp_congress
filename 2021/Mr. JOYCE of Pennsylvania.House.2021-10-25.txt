 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in  strong support of America's small businesses.   Nearly half of American workers are employed by small businesses, and  their livelihoods are being threatened by new taxes and new regulations  that are being proposed by the administration and liberals in Congress.   In the past year already, our small businesses have been hamstrung by  arbitrary lockdown orders that have stunted growth and strained our  recovery.   Now they are being squeezed even harder by supply chain issues and  labor shortages caused by President Biden's policy of paying workers to  remain at home.   Now the President is refusing to address the crisis that his  administration has caused.   Recently, I visited Guy Chemical in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.  The supply chain issues that they face have delayed shipments for  months.   Problems ranging from backlogs at the Port of Los Angeles to a lack  of truck drivers on our Nation's highways have resulted in shortages  and backlogs that are straining businesses that actually hold our  communities together. Small businesses are truly the backbone of our  economy.   Let's be clear: This administration's failed policies are threatening  these American small businesses.   To make matters even worse, some Members of this body are now  threatening to impose new taxes that would take as much as 39 percent  of revenues away from these vital small businesses. This wasteful  taxation directly harms the Americans that work for small businesses  and rely on them for their daily needs and for their paychecks.   Now is the time to put a stop to this tax-and-spend spree.   Now is the time to stand up for the small businesses that truly  sustain our economy.   And now is the time to put Americans first and not the liberal  politicians.                            ____________________
