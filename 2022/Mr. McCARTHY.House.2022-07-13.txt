 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American  hero.   Ronald Reagan once said: ``Some people wonder all their lives if they  made a difference. The Marines don't have that problem.''   This is especially true of Hershel ``Woody'' Williams, who will be  lying in honor in the Capitol tomorrow. Until his death on June 29,  Williams was the sole surviving marine from World War II to wear the  Medal of Honor.   Then-Corporal Williams was a 21-year-old marine when his unit landed  on Iwo Jima in February 1945. He was thrown into bloody combat almost  immediately. Japanese forces were dug into a network of reinforced  pillboxes, and American forces were pinned down by heavy machine gun  fire.   Williams could see his fellow marines needed help, so he grabbed a  flamethrower and charged towards the enemy stronghold alone.   Can you believe he was just 21 years old when he did that? As his  Medal of Honor citation says: ``Covered only by four riflemen, he  fought desperately for 4 hours under terrific enemy small-arms fire and  repeatedly returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and  obtain serviced flamethrowers, struggling back, frequently to the rear  of hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another.''    Williams' actions, his citation concludes, displayed ``valiant  devotion to duty'' and enabled ``his company to reach its objective.''   Williams saw the American flag raised on Mount Suribachi that same  day.   Williams was honorably discharged 9 months later, but he reenlisted  in the Reserves twice. By the time he retired from the Corps in 1969,  he had served 20 years and risen to the rank of chief warrant officer  4.   Yet, Williams still felt the call to service after he retired. So,  among other things, he started the Woody Williams Foundation. Williams  and his foundation helped establish 104 Gold Star Families Memorial  Monuments across America to date, and right now more than 69 more  monuments are underway in 50 States.   Woody Williams went above and beyond the call of duty on the  battlefield and back home, and by lying in honor in the rotunda  tomorrow, Williams continues to serve our veterans.   Some people don't know this, but Williams said one of his last wishes  was to lie in honor in the Capitol, but it wasn't for himself. No, it  was for every Medal of Honor recipient who served in World War II. What  a hero.   Our veterans fought together as a team. They sacrificed as a team.  And now, thanks in part to Woody Williams, we will honor them as a  team.   One last wish, one final act of service. That was Woody Williams.  Selfless to the end.   As long as there are Americans like Williams and all the Medal of  Honor recipients we honor this week, this will always be the land of  the free and the home of the brave.                            ____________________     Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I  would like to speed this up, and with all due respect, not to yell  anything else, but if we did eliminate proxies, we could go to 2-minute  votes.   Now, with all due respect, the proxies were put in because of the  pandemic. It was put in during the pandemic. You no longer have that  from any procedure here. The proxies will take longer than 5 minutes.  If we want to be able to----    Madam Speaker, I thought the gentleman said yelling at  one another doesn't help.    Madam Speaker, if we look in the Chamber right now, we  have a large number of people here, not one person wearing a mask--all  right, three or four--and you can continue to wear your mask to vote in  person. I don't see how you are going to do a 5-minute vote with  proxies.   I understand the lecture you are giving to everybody, but on this  side of the aisle we will be here, we will vote, and we would gladly  like to do it the same way every other Congress has done it in history,  to be here and do the job like we expect the American people to do. And  we won't break until the proxies are done.
