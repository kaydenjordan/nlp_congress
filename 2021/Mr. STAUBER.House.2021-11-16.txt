 Madam Speaker, since Joe Biden took office, over 1.6  million illegals have been apprehended at our southern border. In fact,  over 164,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended at the southern border  just in October alone, marking the worst October in the history of the  Department of Homeland Security.   And if you think Biden's border crisis is bad right now, it is about  to get a whole lot worse. Included in Congressional Democrats'  multitrillion-dollar socialist wish list is billions of dollars to  green light illegal immigrant amnesty requests.   And recently, we learned that the Biden administration is  contemplating paying illegal immigrants who broke our laws up to  $450,000 each. To put this number into perspective, $450,000 is nine  times the median income for the household in the district that I  represent. To even consider these payouts is an insult to Americans who  go to work every day and pay their taxes.  [[Page H6300]]    Madam Speaker, these policies are the definition of insanity, and it  is no surprise that the majority of Americans think the country is  headed in the wrong direction. It is time we change course and do it  now.   Rather than allowing radicals to drive the agenda and push policies  that incentivize more illegal immigration, let's work together to  secure our border. Let's work together to put the American people  first.                            ____________________
