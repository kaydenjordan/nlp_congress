 Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, floor debate is both for the people in the room and the  people watching.   Many of the new Members have not yet voted on a substantive piece of  legislation. So, Mr. Speaker, I reach out with a little piece of  history--a large piece of history, perhaps--for the freshmen of both  parties.   First of all, this legislation is bipartisan. It is sponsored by both  Republicans and Democrats.   Second of all, when Mr. Conyers, Mr. Nadler, and I were 16 years  younger, in March of 2001, it was the last and only time that the  underlying law allowed for a regulation to be repealed. It was  prominently called ergonomics. It was repealed. I had the honor of  voting for that as a freshman.   Since that time, in spite of the many regulations that some people  don't like in one party or another, we have not seen fit to have a  joint resolution repeal a regulation.   So let's talk about what it takes to do that. It takes both Houses of  the Congress and the President of the United States to repeal a  regulation created by a bureaucrat, or many bureaucrats--a regulation  that may or may not be consistent with the law passed by this body, by  the Senate, and by a President in this or a previous Congress.   Again, for the freshmen, we are the body that creates laws, and we do  so through a complex and difficult procedure. We pass it out of the  House or Senate. We then pass it out of the other body. If the  President signs it, it then still is subject to court challenge.                                time  1400    Now, let's go through the regulatory process: Proposed by a  bureaucrat, given a period of time in which dissenters may be 100  percent, and still it becomes law if this body does not act. So now  that gives you a little feel for the underlying law. Used once on a  bipartisan basis to take back an unpopular regulation that has never  been resubmitted under both 8 years of a Republican and 8 years of a  Democrat in the White House, and I repeat, the regulation that was  previously recalled was so in error that it has never been redone in 16  years by two Presidents.   Now, let's talk about the bill we have before us today. We all know  that the House is a body that, when it wants to, can move fairly  quickly, and the Senate is a body that seemingly moves quickly only in  recess. The fact is that the Senate takes a long time, and we have many  regulations that may or may not be considered now or in the future.   All this legislation does is allow for us to dispose of one or more  regulations in an expedited fashion in this body and have it seen in  the same form in the Senate. Nothing more than that. It doesn't change  the underlying law. It doesn't change the fact that the House, the  Senate, and a President must concur on taking back what is essentially  a law--that is what a regulation is--created by bureaucrats not elected  by any of us. So let's keep it as simple as that.   For the freshmen of either party, when you go to make a vote on this,  remember, we are not changing the underlying law. Only one regulation  under the underlying law has ever been repealed, and it was bipartisan  in both the House and the Senate when it was repealed. It has been 16  years, and the few that will likely be considered under this act and  the underlying law will be just that, a relatively few regulations that  are believed to be unnecessary and for which the House, the Senate, and  the President concur.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute of my time to  the gentleman.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I won't be long. There is nothing mundane about what we  are doing here. Every day in America, Congress passes a law maybe, but  every working day in America, the bureaucracy passes regulations. The  fact is, the American people know that the so-called regulatory state  that has developed during the last half century means that, whether  Congress is in session or not, new laws are being created, new rules  that cause people in real America, working people and their companies,  to have to figure out what new hurdle they have to jump over just to  earn a living.   That is what we are talking about here, that at least when those are  grossly exceeded under the underlying law and intention of Congress,  Congress--the House, the Senate--in concert with the President, may, in  fact, use the same tool, essentially the making of law, in this case to  rescind to law.   I just want to again speak to the younger Members who may not know  the history of this. All we are really talking about here in this act  is, in fact, a law created to take away a regulation. What we are going  to vote on will allow for, one, two, half a dozen regulations, if there  were that many that we think are wrong, through our normal lawmaking  process, in many ways, to be rescinded. The House has to vote a  majority, the Senate has to vote a majority, and the President has to  sign it. There really isn't a whole lot of difference between that and  any other legislative business that we do here.   Now, I have worked with John Conyers both as a minority member and as  my chairman. He is a good man. In this case, I believe that if he  looked more broadly at the question of Congress' responsibility to  review laws made outside of this body that he would support me.  Notwithstanding not getting his support in this case, we do have both  Republicans and Democrats on this bill. I expect that on the vote, in  both the House and the Senate, it will be bipartisan, and any piece of  regulatory law that would come before this body and the Senate, I am  confident, would have bipartisan support in order to rescind a bad  regulation.   So I think for those who are concerned about the regulations somehow  running amok, no regulation will be rescinded under this law any  different than any normal piece of legislation passed out of the House  and the Senate and signed by the President.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleague from Tennessee has been a good friend on many issues. I  know he is passionate about regulations and laws that he would like to  have passed, and so am I.   All of us in Congress have seen that it is extremely easy--the longer  you are here, the more you will see it--it is extremely easy to stop  something here. The same is true about those 61 or so regulations. Any  combining of regulations, unless they are overwhelmingly disapproved,  actually makes them harder to pass. We are not going to put 61 pieces  of legislation, each of which has at least one or two or three or a  dozen Republicans who vehemently oppose that regulation being  rescinded. The fact is it is only the worst of the worst that are going  to be stayed through this process and then reevaluated by the new  administration.   I will mention, though, for my colleagues on the other side of this  debate today, that we do appropriations every year. The American  people, and for the freshmen who haven't voted on appropriations yet,  think of appropriations as somehow different than the law. It really  isn't. Appropriation is simply a law that provides funding.   Every appropriation bill during the entire nearly 8 years of  President Obama has been some form of a continuing resolution or an  omnibus. But as my colleague from Tennessee knows, every one of those  has had dozens to hundreds of laws attached to them. We call them  riders. We have terms for them. The fact is that a single  appropriations bill, often done just before the end of funding of the  government, always--always--has dozens, if not hundreds, of laws  attached to it.    So the idea that we don't group together things which are relatively  noncontroversial, that will cause someone to still vote for the bill in  spite of it being in there, would be to be dishonest to the freshmen  who need to know that we do for efficiency bring together things that  we can pass en bloc, and we do it all the time--and even major  legislation. I dare say, the Affordable Care Act and others are, in  fact, multiple pieces of legislation put together in one package.   So lest our freshmen who are about to take their first vote on a  piece of legislation--or one that could have a major impact-- misunderstand, bringing together multiple pieces into one bill is  common, but it is always done in order to gain votes or to maintain  votes. In fact, you do it at your folly if you lose votes.   I would say to my friend and colleague from Michigan that there is no  likelihood that 61 pieces of regulation will be put together because  there is no chance that there would be 61 pieces that even all  Republicans would agree should be revoked. I would imagine the number  would be less. I suspect that if my bill said 2 or 5 or 10, it would  still be opposed for the same reason, which is that it creates  inefficiency if there are multiple generally agreed bad pieces of  legislation that need to be considered.   Lastly, and I am not closing, but I think this may be one of my  closing remarks, for freshmen to understand, this isn't even about the  House. We have the procedures in the House where we could put these  together. This is about the Senate that can take 60 hours, 60  legislative hours or more, to do one piece of legislation. We know that  the Senate has confirmations to do of judges and appointees for the  Cabinet, and they have other legislative work, and we cannot afford to  have them backed up now or in the future if there are multiple  regulations that need to be rescinded.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentlewoman from Florida, I am sure, is well intended, but there  is nothing more transparent than calling up to the floor of this House  and debating the removal of regulations that have been found to be  excessive or extreme or simply not consistent with the law. That is a  transparent process. The term ``regular order,'' in fact, could not be  more appropriate to that process. We passed a law nearly three  Presidents ago, if you will, that simply called for this procedure.   All I am saying is we should not be mired down, if there are five or  six or eight bad regulations, in not combining them together for  purposes of getting them disposed of in a timely fashion. I might  suggest to everyone that they remember that many of us did not support  the regulation change yesterday as to the ethics oversight, because we  do believe in transparency and will continue to believe in  transparency.   Again, nothing is more transparent than bringing to the House floor  the debate about something that is believed to have been wrong done by  unelected bureaucrats. ``Bureaucrat'' is not a dirty word, but  ``unelected'' fits this process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I served on the Small Business Committee with Ms. Velazquez a long  time ago. One thing that we all know is, with regard to that committee,  the NFIB--the National Federation of Independent Business--and small  business groups alike are something we look at, even NAM--the National  Association of Manufacturers--and, of course, the Chamber. All of those  organizations support this legislation. They have written letters in  support, and I include in the Record those letters.

House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and       Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade       association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000       chapter members, I am writing in regard to the Regulations       from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017       (H.R. 26) introduced by Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) as well as       the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 (H.R. 21) introduced by       Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA).        From 2009 to present, the federal government imposed nearly       $900 billion in regulatory costs on the American people which       requires billions of hours of paperwork. Many of these       regulations have been or will be imposed on the construction       industry. ABC is committed to reforming the broken federal       regulatory process and ensuring industry stakeholders' voices       are heard and rights are protected. ABC supports increased       transparency and opportunities for regulatory oversight by       Congress and ultimately, the American people.        The Obama administration issued numerous rulemakings that       detrimentally impact the construction industry. In some       cases, these regulations are based on conjecture and       speculation, lacking foundation in sound scientific analysis.       For the construction industry, unjustified and unnecessary       regulations translate to higher costs, which are then passed       along to the consumer or lead to construction projects being       priced out of the market. This chain reaction ultimately       results in fewer projects, and hinders businesses' ability to       hire and expand.        ABC members understand the value of standards and       regulations when they are based on solid evidence, with       appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs and       input from the business community. Federal agencies must be       held accountable for full compliance with existing rulemaking       statutes and requirements when promulgating regulations to       ensure they are necessary, current and cost-effective for       businesses to implement.        ABC opposes unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulations       resulting from the efforts of Washington bureaucrats who have       little accountability for their actions. H.R. 26 will help to       bring greater accountability to the rulemaking process as it       would require any executive branch rule or regulation with an       annual economic impact of $100 million or more to come before       Congress for an up-or-down vote before being enacted.       Moreover, H.R. 21 will further enhance congressional       oversight of the overreaching regulations often issued during       the final months of a president's term and help to revive the       division of powers.        Thank you for your attention on this important matter and       we urge the House to pass the Regulations from the Executive       in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017 and Midnight Rules       Relief Act of 2017 when they come to the floor for a vote.            Sincerely,                                                Kristen Swearingen,      Vice President of Legislative & Political Affairs.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                                   Manufacturers,                                                    January 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Association       of Manufacturers (NAM), I am writing to express       manufacturers' support for the passage of H.R. 21, the       Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017, introduced by Congressman       Darrell Issa (R-CA).        The NAM is the largest manufacturing association in the       United States, representing small and large manufacturers in       every industrial sector and in all 50 states. Manufacturing       employs nearly 12 million men and women, contributes more       than $1.8 trillion to the U.S. economy annually, has the       largest economic impact of any major sector, and accounts for       two-thirds of private sector research and development. The       NAM is the leading advocate for a policy agenda that helps       manufacturers compete in the global economy and create jobs       across the United States.        The Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 would amend the       Congressional Review Act to provide Congress the authority to       consider one joint resolution of disapproval for regulations       en bloc as opposed to a single regulation at a time. As the       end of an Administration approaches, there is an incentive       for federal agencies to issue a significant number of       regulations. These are known as midnight rules, and H.R. 21       would allow Congress to effectively respond to regulations       that conflict with congressional intent, exceed an agency's       statutory authority or are hastily drafted and issued as an       Administration prepares its departure.        The problem of midnight rules is not new and is not unique       to a particular political party. As an administration       attempts to complete its regulatory agenda, an abundance of       midnight rules can overwhelm Congress' ability to engage in       proper oversight of federal agencies. Midnight rules can be       issued without justification and without an agency conducting       proper regulatory analysis. Congress should be granted the       authority needed to appropriately respond to the issuance of       a midnight rules that might not be drafted in accordance with       sound regulatory principles.        Manufacturers support a regulatory system that results in       regulations that efficiently and effectively achieve policy       objectives, and we urge you to support passage of H.R. 21,       the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,      Rosario Palmieri.                                   ____                 [From Americanactionforum.org, Jan. 3, 2017]                       The Regulatory Cleanup Begins                (By Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Patrick Hefflinger)         On Wednesday Vice President-elect Mike Pence is scheduled       to meet with House Republicans to discuss Obamacare repeal       and replacement plans. Republicans are expected to delay       repealing parts of Obamacare to allow for more time to design       a replacement health care plan. President Obama is expected       to meet with Congressional Democrats on Wednesday as well to       discuss plans for defending Obamacare from repeal.        Last week the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that       they had reached final agreements with Swiss banks on the       Swiss Bank Program. The program aims to help financial       institutions avoid criminal liabilities due to U.S. tax       crimes by granting banks non-prosecution eligibility if they       meet certain requirements. The Swiss Bank program was       initially announced in 2013.                  Eakinomics: The Regulatory Cleanup Begins         The tally has been mounting for years--over 3,000 costly       regulations totaling nearly $875 billion in finalized burden       costs. As the economy became increasingly festooned with rule       making and regulatory drag, conservatives have promised to       bring the regulatory state to sanity given the first       opportunity. That moment has presumably arrived. Congress       returns from the holidays with plans to get started.        Specifically, I expect that the House will begin cleaning       up the midnight regulatory onslaught by the Obama       administration. Historically, this would have required a       regulation-by-regulation use of the Congressional Review Act       (CRA). Instead, the House will consider a bill (HR 5982 in       the last Congress), which would permit Congress to disapprove       multiple midnight rules en banc--in a single resolution.        That takes care of the last-gasp efforts of the outgoing       president. But what guarantees better performance in the       future? The House will next turn to the Regulations from the       Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act. With the REINS       Act, Congress would have 70 legislative days to approve a       major rule with economic impact over $100 million. Only then       would it be sent to the president for signature. Without a       positive vote, the regulation would not take effect. If       enacted, REINS could save more than $27 billion in annual       regulatory costs and 11.5 million paperwork burden hours       according to AAF research by Sam Batkins.        Passage of the REINS Act (or other, similar, legislation)       would insert Congress more firmly into the regulatory       process, a significant change that is not done lightly.       However, the lesson of the past eight years is that even       without executive overreach the regulatory process does not       correctly balance benefits and costs; a recalibration of the       underlying process is overdue.                                                   Small Business &                                        Entrepreneurship Council,                                        Vienna, VA, January 3, 2017.      Hon. Darrell Issa,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Issa: The Small Business       Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) strongly supports the       ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.'' This legislation is vital as       it provides a needed check against the surge in new and       questionable regulatory activity that is flooding into the       Federal Register, which will eventually make its way to small       businesses.        While ``midnight regulations'' have been a problem across       Administrations, what is happening in the current period is       staggering. According to the American Action Forum, the       current output of midnight rules is up 42 percent over 2008,       and 48 percent over 2000. This regulatory surge must be       ``checked'' and contained by Congress before it causes       permanent damage to the competitiveness of many types of       small businesses.        The end-game push on the regulatory front will undoubtedly       show that shortcuts were taken in a process meant to protect       small businesses. Mercatus Center research found that the       quality of analysis suffers during the midnight regulatory       period, which means these regulations are ``excessively       costly'' or ineffective. Poorly constructed and politically-      driven regulation will only create more uncertainty and costs       for our nation's struggling small businesses.        Your legislation will provide Congress with needed       flexibility in using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by       allowing a CRA resolution to address more than one       regulation. This important reform enhances the CRA and allows       Congress to use its time efficiently to address the many       issues that face our economy and nation.        Thank you for your continued leadership on issues important       to entrepreneurs and  [[Page H83]]       small businesses. Please let us know how we can help to       ensure the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act'' is signed into law.            Sincerely,                                                    Karen Kerrigan,      President & CEO.                                   ____                        [From Townhall, Jan. 4, 2017]         The House Can Start Reversing Obama's Regulatory Overreach                           (By Christine Harbin)         President Obama has made a series of executive decisions in       his final weeks in office that will undoubtedly harm the       economy.        Particularly egregious were his recent announcements on       energy and environmental policy: He rejected the permit for       the Dakota access pipeline, exempted wind farm companies from       killing eagles, abused the Antiquities Act to remove western       lands from economic development, and prohibited federal       offshore drilling and mineral leases on millions of acres       across the country, including 115 million acres off the coast       of Alaska.        This flurry of regulatory activity is simply the latest in       a long line of overreaches from the Obama White House. The       outgoing president has consistently sought ways to enact his       agenda unilaterally over his two terms--notoriously ``working       around Congress'' in order to do so. A recent report from the       American Action Forum found that the Obama administration       issued 600 major regulations totaling $743 billion over the       course of his presidency. This is an average of 81 major       regulations--regulations that exceed $100 million by agency       estimates--per year.        Thankfully, the House of Representatives is poised to hit       the ground running in slowing the growth of the regulatory       state. Representatives will consider two important bills on       the floor as one of their first orders of business for the       year. Both bills, once passed by the Senate and signed by       future President Trump, will bring meaningful relief to the       American families and businesses across the country who are       currently drowning in red tape.        The first bill, Rep. Darrell Issa's Midnight Rule Relief       Act, is particularly important given the onslaught of       regulations coming from the White House and the scarcity of       available floor time in Congress. It would allow Congress to       disapprove of multiple so-called ``midnight rules''--      regulations finalized in the waning days of the       administration--using a single Congressional Review Act (CRA)       resolution, as opposed to disapproving of these rules       individually. This change will make it easier for Congress to       disapprove of the Obama administration's recent spate of       economically dangerous actions.        The second bill, the Regulations from the Executive in Need       of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, is also important. This would       require executive agencies to submit ``major'' rules--those       with an annual economic impact of $100 million or more--to       Congress for review and a clear up-or-down vote before the       rules take effect. This would assert Congress's proper role       in approving the rules that govern the country, an authority       which has been increasingly delegated to executive agencies.       It would also encourage more debate among lawmakers about the       size and scope of the federal government. Incoming Sen. Todd       Young championed this important legislation during his time       in the House; it's good to see Rep. Doug Collins introduce it       in this new Congress.        Both of these bills received bipartisan support in past       Congresses; they may enjoy even more in this current one.       Strange bedfellows could emerge in anticipation of the Trump       presidency. Democrats in Congress who want to limit the       ability of a Republican White House to enact new rules, as       well as Republicans who principally support limiting the size       and scope of government.        Americans across the county voted for President-elect       Donald Trump and a Republican majority in Congress because       they are tired of President Obama's harmful regulatory       agenda. It's little surprise that President-elect Donald       Trump swept rust belt states and the upper Midwest in the       recent election--these parts of the country have been       devastated by President Obama's regulatory overreach, and       they stood to lose even further under the threats of a       Hillary Clinton administration.        Congress is right to reverse President Obama's regulatory       assault on job creation and economic growth in this county,       and it should work closely with President-elect Trump in       peeling it back. Representatives should support the two       regulatory reform bills when they come up on the floor this       week, and they should seek additional efforts to overturn       these myriad rules, including future Congressional Review Act       resolutions of disapproval and adding appropriations riders       that would prohibit funding for implementation of the worst       rules, while executive agencies promulgate new rules to       eliminate them.        Doing so will send a strong message that lawmakers are       willing to stand up to the executive overreach of the past       eight years.     Mr. Speaker, the fact is we are hearing many people talk  about important regulations and of their somehow being taken out. Let's  understand that regulations can go both ways. These changes and the  underlying law can also protect the other way. The fact is now we are  in the future. You could have an administration that, in its final  days, changes regulations to make them more lenient to large  businesses, more lenient to polluters, more lenient to the employers to  the detriment of their employees. Regulations can go both ways, and  only the most extreme regulations--literally one since the enactment of  the underlying legislation--has ever been repealed.   I don't want to belittle my own legislation, but let's understand  that there won't be 61 en bloc being brought. There will be some, I  hope, and there may be more than one. Yet for Congress to take back,  piece by piece, its responsibility and then live up to that  responsibility should be all of our goals.   Now, this legislation was limited to midnight rules. Let's understand  that midnight rules are the rules done in the waning days of an  administration--7-plus years into this administration--and many of  these rules, in fact, were enacted after the last vote of the people. I  think it is important to understand that, on election day, the American  people delivered a resounding message to Washington: stop the  regulatory, Big Government onslaught that is killing jobs.   One of my colleagues earlier spoke of the fact that we had had so  many jobs--15 million jobs--created in the last 8 years. The percentage  of the workforce that is working in America today is the smallest in my  lifetime. It is smaller than it was 8 years ago, 16 years ago, or 21  years ago. We are not creating jobs at the rate of our population. We  should not have some sort of an accolade for regulations having created  a great economy if, in fact, that economy has grown less than 2 percent  a year and has not kept up with any historic 8-year period. To me, that  is an important part. Although the discussion I just had was about more  than regulations, let's understand that the growth of regulations--of  lawmaking--is certainly not the creator of jobs.   I think, when we look at the cost--and that is a lot of what we are  dealing with in the manager's amendment in this bill--we are dealing  with the recognition that we are looking at regulations in light of how  much they cost. Now, that cost is based on independent scoring. It is  not the administration's scoring and it is not my scoring. It is that  of the Congressional Budget Office's, an independent agency that  doesn't always give a score I want, but the score is not arrived  through partisan activities.   I reach out again to the Members who may not yet know that what we  are asking is simply to assert our normal ability in Congress and put  together one or more ideas for the efficiency of the body, to send it  from here to the Senate, and from the Senate to the President. What we  are proposing in this legislation as a small change to the underlying  legislation that has been with us for three Presidents is, in fact,  consistent with this body's doing its job, in regular order, in the  clear light of day.   I think the important message for this piece of bipartisan  legislation is: we are taking back a limited amount of our capability,  trying to streamline it, and giving the President an opportunity to  accept or reject a piece of legislation voted on by a majority of the  House and a majority of the Senate before it gets to the President. The  President, if he feels we have included even one regulation  inappropriately that he would like to retain, would veto our bill.   Lastly, I beg everyone to look at this for what it is, not for what  others say it is, because it is simply Congress doing its job in an  efficient fashion and consistent with 20-plus years of history and with  there being only one piece--one time--when a regulation was withdrawn.  No President since that time has tried to produce or has asked Congress  to pass a law so as to put into effect a regulation that, on a  bipartisan basis, the House, the Senate, and a President thought should  go. I urge the support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I remember Chairman Ed Towns who used to say  when someone ran on: The gentleman's time has long expired. I think we  might have that situation here, but I am going to give the gentlewoman  from Florida a moment more in just a moment.   The motion to recommit specifically sends it back to the committee.  That is not necessary. The fact is that if she wanted these changes and  wanted them enacted immediately there is a procedure to do so.   So I rise in opposition because this is certainly something that  would delay, would send this back to committee, and cause it to come  back again.   I will yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor) for a  question, if she wouldn't mind: Is there a regulation in those 61 that  would be affected by this that would affect any of the provisions that  you cited in your amendment?    Mr. Speaker, would the gentlewoman answer the question. Is  there 61, according to the ranking member, pieces of regulation that  [[Page H85]]  could be in the window? I just wondered if you had one regulation by  the Obama administration that concerned any of these issues that you  had in the act.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would ask that the  gentlewoman, if there are some, place them in the Record. I don't know  of any in the 61 that were granted, let's say, after June.   What I will say is that the reason I will be voting and urging my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit is not the  regulations that she alludes to but, in fact, the fact that this would  kill the bill by sending it back and having it delayed further.   So, in order to pass it today, because she did not set it up to  exclude these items and have them immediately considered, I cannot  support her motion to recommit.   What I will say is that when we look at regulations to put into a  package that may be a package of one or a package, if this passes, of  more than one, I certainly will expect that those regulations will have  to do with things which could have been done sooner, would have been  done sooner, and were done in the waning days of the administration for  no reason that was time sensitive.   The Affordable Care Act was passed in the first days of the  administration. If there is something in the last days of the  administration that has merit, I certainly would urge my colleagues not  [[Page H86]]  to rescind that regulation. But if there is something that should have  been done in year one, two, three, four, five, or six, I would ask why  it wasn't done then.   Having said that, it is unfortunate that this motion to recommit was  written in a way that would send it back to committee and, thus, cause  a substantial delay.   I would caution my colleagues that, at least from this Member, if you  have a motion to recommit and you want the amendment itself considered,  make it one that is immediate and not back to committee. The  difference, I think, is important. The Parliamentarian simply can  advise on how to write one that would prevent it having to get, if you  will, another delay of days or weeks.   I urge opposition to the motion to recommit.   I yield back the balance of my time.
