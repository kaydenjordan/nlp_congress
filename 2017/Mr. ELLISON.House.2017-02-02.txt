 I thank Congressman Raskin, and I thank Congresswoman  Jayapal.   Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the House of Representatives has  tremendously benefited by these two awesome freshmen who have come in  here like gangbusters. I am sure that my classmate and friend of many  years from New York, Ms. Yvette Clarke, will agree with me that we are  always trying to welcome these folks who have come straight off the  campaign trail, because you really know how people are feeling when  they come straight off the campaign trail--fresh. I am sure the  Congressman from Rhode Island, David Cicilline, agrees.    The people of this country are fundamentally fair folks. Our  countrymen and -women believe that everybody ought to be treated with  dignity and respect. Yes, we believe that we have to have an economy  that works for everybody. Absolutely true. We also believe that people  should be treated based on their behavior, based on who they are, based  on what they bring, not based on their race, their sex, their gender,  their religion. In fact, this idea is enshrined in the Constitution.   The first clause of the First Amendment reads: ``Congress shall make  no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free  exercise thereof.'' Later on in the Constitution, it reads that  Congress shall not impose any religious test for participating-- serving--in public office.   In America, you don't have to have one religious belief or another.  In America, you can be a Christian, a Muslim, a Jew, a Hindu, or of no  faith whatsoever. You can be Baptist; you can be Methodist; you can be  whatever you want to be. That is up to you, and it is a private matter.  Americans basically understand that this is right because the Framers  of the Constitution, people like Thomas Jefferson and others, looked  over at some of the Colonies and even looked at some of the conflicts  in Europe and said that we don't need to be mixed up--fighting--with  each other over religion.   Now, the Framers got a lot of things wrong. They got women's rights  wrong; they got race wrong; they got Native American rights wrong.  There were many things that they needed to correct in this Nation.   As the great Thurgood Marshall said, we were defective from the  start, and we needed to have civil wars and civil rights movements and  other movements to make this country the country that it is today.   Yet one thing we did decently in the beginning is with regard to  religious freedom--until now. Donald Trump is introducing a religious  test for whether or not people can be a part of this American story.   Donald Trump claims: Oh, I don't have a Muslim ban.   Wait a minute, President Trump. Wasn't it you who, on December 7,  2015, said that you were calling for a ban on all Muslims who enter  into the United States? Wasn't it you who said it multiple times  throughout your campaign? Didn't you say you wanted to have a Muslim  database for all of the Muslims who were in the country? Didn't you say  you wanted to shutter mosques? You said these things, and now, all of a  sudden, you are shy about saying that you are running a Muslim ban.   These people who say, oh, it is not a Muslim ban surprise me because  I am, like, I thought you all were proud of it. I thought you were  bragging about it. I thought it was how you rode your way into office-- by appealing to people's fears and trying to whip up hostility among  different Americans of different faiths and traditions. Yet now, all of  a sudden, you are shy about saying what you are doing, which is a  Muslim ban. Yes, it is a Muslim ban. Just because it doesn't ban every  Muslim everywhere does not mean that the people who are banned are not  banned because they are Muslim. That is exactly why they are banned.  That is why they are banned.   He was asked on a TV program: Would you give preferential treatment  to people of another faith?   He said: Yes, I would give preferential treatment to another faith.   He said it. It is on the record. So don't come telling me how there  is no Muslim ban. There is one, and these people who bragged so much  about it--I mean Trump and Bannon and all of the rest of them--should  not act like there is not a Muslim ban now. There is a Muslim ban. It  is a religious test for entry into this country. It is  unconstitutional; it is immoral; and it is wrong.  [[Page H926]]    I just want to say to all of my fellow Americans right now, if they  can ban Muslims, they can ban Jews; if they can ban Jews, they can ban  Seventh-day Adventists; if they can ban Seventh-day Adventists, they  can ban Mormons; and if they can ban Mormons, they can ban Catholics.  It is wrong, and we should stand up and say that it is wrong and  immediately demand that it be repealed right away. I think this is  absolutely critical that we do so.   I want to share a story for a moment longer, if the gentleman doesn't  mind, because I know we have some really excellent speakers coming  right behind me, and I want to yield to them as quickly as I can. I  want to share a story about one of the families that has been affected  in my own home State of Minnesota.   One person who was prevented from flying to United States this week  is a little girl from Somalia whose mother came to Minneapolis as a  refugee in 2013. This child was stuck in Uganda without her family  because she hadn't been born by the time her mother was granted refugee  status. When her mother, Samira, was given permission to come to the  United States 4 years ago, she was told to leave her daughter behind  with friends of the family in Uganda and apply for reunification in the  United States. This little girl was supposed to fly to Minnesota and  rejoin her family on Monday. Instead, her flight was canceled because  of the Muslim ban.   President Trump is not making our country safer. President Trump is  reinforcing the narrative of people who don't like our country.   What does ISIS ultimately say? That America is at war with Islam.   I am here to tell everybody on the planet that America is absolutely  not at war with Islam or with any other religion. The American people  are of a peaceful nation. The people who live in the United States want  to live in harmony with all of the other people of the world; but this  particular person who happens to occupy the Presidency doesn't reflect  the values that we represent. He doesn't reflect who we are. The thing  that he is doing is actually reinforcing the narrative of the people  who would mean to do all of us harm no matter what religion we may be.   I just want to sit down now and say: For the sake of this young woman  and for the sake of Samira's daughter, who is languishing in Uganda  right now and who wants to be reunited with her family, may we please  get rid of this ban and get rid of this unlawful executive order?                                time  1730
