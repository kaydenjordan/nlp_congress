 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on an urgent  matter confronting our country.   The American people are experiencing the worst series of self- inflicted crises in a generation.   Inflation is at a 40-year high. Gas is up 42 percent. Utilities are  up 20 percent.   Either President Biden doesn't care or is being insulated from  reality.   We saw the worst jobs report of the Presidency this last month. Self- induced labor shortages are plaguing businesses. Shelves are bare.  Container ships are stacking up.   We have the worst Biden-created border crisis in 30 years, yet the  President has time to go to Delaware every weekend but not the border?   Hundreds of Americans are still in Afghanistan, meanwhile President  Biden and Democrats are trying to ram through trillions in new tax  hikes.   So what is the administration working on? What are their priorities?  A national gender strategy. Are you kidding me? This administration  cares more about which pronoun you use than countering the Chinese  threat or the threat at our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better than this. My  constituents deserve better than this. Our Nation deserves better than  this.                            ____________________
