 Mr. Speaker, a month ago I was ready to speak right  here on the floor when this bill was abruptly removed. Apparently, it  wasn't bad enough that day, it wasn't harmful enough. But now it is  back worse than ever. So bad, it might actually pass.   I don't have a lot of time to explain, but let me tell you two groups  that are really going to say thank you: it is the billionaires and it  is the undertakers.   This bill will make health care more unaffordable and cause  preventable deaths. Meanwhile, it gives $600 billion--excuse me--$800  billion to the wealthy, to the billionaires. TrumpCare brings us higher  costs, less coverage, guts the benefits, has a crushing age tax, and  steals from Medicare. In my district alone, 43,000 people will lose  coverage. 9,000 of those are children. The elderly, Medicaid will be  lost, close to 2,000.   There is a reason they are trying to jam this down our throats. There  is no CBO score because they don't want to hear a score.   Mr. Speaker, let me make it plain. Let's put this bill in a coffin,  not Americans. Let's kill and bury this bill.
