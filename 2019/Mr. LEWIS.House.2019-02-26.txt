 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution.   Some of you may be old enough to remember when Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., traveled to Berlin in 1964. He reminded those gathered that  a man-made barrier could not change the fact that the people on both  sides of the wall were God's children.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you today: What does it profit our Nation to gain  a wall and lose our soul? North and south of the border, we are one  people. We are bound together by our common humanity.   Mr. Speaker, this executive action betrays our values, our democracy,  and the very soul of our Nation.   As Members of Congress in a nation of immigrants, we have a  constitutional mission and a mandate to preserve the balance of powers  and to oppose this monument to hate.   Today, each and every one of us has a moral obligation to do what is  right, what is just, and what is fair by passing this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
