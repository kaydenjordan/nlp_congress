 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in opposition to this rule and the underlying  resolutions.   The resolutions that this rule provides consideration for threaten  our air and don't protect the American people. My colleagues on the  other side of the aisle claim that somehow repealing these rules will  create jobs. It will actually destroy jobs, jobs that are associated  with recapturing methane.   This is what a methane flare looks like. I drive by them in Colorado,  and the potential for capturing, rather than flaring that methane, is  important for the quality of our air and to reduce our emissions.   The House majority has made it their priority to instill fear and  uncertainty in hardworking American families. People, who come here  legally on visas who have lived here for many years, even small  businesses, rather than focusing on jobs or having constructive  conversations about immigration, are worried about their employees and,  in some cases, even their owners being deported or not allowed back  after conducting business overseas.   Republicans apparently would rather help shield large corporations  from transparency, eliminate regulations that protect families from  water and air pollution, and require companies to follow wage rules.   To add to this uncertainty and fear, President Trump has signed an  executive order already that bans refugees and citizens from  predominantly Muslim countries. Well, America is a nation of  immigrants--those who fled political and religious persecution,  violence in their home countries, and those seeking to build a family  in a country that values freedom and upholds civil rights.    Our new President has decided that the best use of taxpayer money is  to build a wall on our southern border. Our President has used his  first 2 weeks in office to generate fear and uncertainty among  vulnerable households who may lose their health insurance rather than  create jobs and improve our economy. The new President has even limited  the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to communicate with  the public about things like methane flaring.   The two Congressional Review Act resolutions we are discussing  today--like the previous ones that, I should point out, do not follow  regular order--they didn't receive any hearings in this Congress. They  were a closed rule with no amendments allowed. I offered two amendments  to the methane rule amendment. Neither were allowed to even be debated  on this floor of this House, no less adopted.   I would like to quote from Speaker Ryan when he took the gavel in  October of 2015. He said: ``We need to let every member contribute--not  once they have earned their stripes, but right now.'' In a further  quote, Speaker Ryan said: ``The committees should retake the lead in  drafting all major legislation. If you know the issue, you should write  the bill. Open up the process.''   ``In other words, we need to return to regular order.''   Yet, here we are again with two CRAs that did not come through  regular order, did not have a hearing with no opportunity for Members  on either side of the aisle, Democrats or Republicans, with good ideas  to make these pieces of legislation any better. Apparently, Speaker  Ryan's commitment doesn't apply to CRAs or issues that keep our air and  water clean or protect workers.   I would like to ask that Speaker Ryan explain to his colleagues how  he is sticking to his commitment of regular order and to clarify what  that means.   Not one amendment was allowed to be heard on the floor on either of  these bills. This is a closed rule, including two of mine.   First, let's talk about the methane waste rule. It is very important  to my constituents where fracking has worsened the quality of the air  and upset neighborhoods across my district in Colorado.                                time  1230    The first amendment offered in the Rules Committee was to the methane  waste rule, and it would have added Bureau of Land Management  scientific findings. It would offer transparency and truth to this  Congressional Review Act, providing facts about methane, methane waste,  and why it is necessary for this rule to be moved forward. Without this  rule, we would be seeing a lot more of this in areas like my district  and my State.   In the last few weeks, a war on science has been begun by this  administration. If we support facts, then we should let facts speak for  themselves and be as objective as possible. We should have allowed that  amendment which would have listed the scientific truths around methane  and this rule.   Scientific facts are clear. The current rule would supply energy for  up to 740,000 more households per year. Rather than burn that methane  into the atmosphere, we can actually provide energy for 740,000 more  households; and that methane is 25 times more dangerous and potent as  carbon dioxide for worsening the impact of global warming.   Even if you want to ignore the energy impact of helping more  Americans have power or the climate impacts of increasing climate  change, if we look at this rule from a jobs perspective, this CRA would  destroy American jobs.   I would like to explain how this methane waste CRA rule will affect  the jobs of thousands of employees of the more than 70 companies  headquartered in the U.S. that provide services and equipment to  identify and capture natural gas and methane leaking from pipelines,  processing equipment, and wells, including many in my home State of  Colorado. This rule directly threatens the livelihood of many  businesses and employees in my home State.   If, for some strange reason, the job creation argument isn't enough  for you, how about the hundreds of millions of dollars American  taxpayers would collect over the next decade from additional royalties?   Oil and gas companies are required to pay for the methane they  collect and sell from public lands, and the more that is captured  rather than burned off, the better not only for the companies and the  employees, but also for taxpayers as we try to reduce our budget  deficit.   An estimated $140 million in royalties over the next decade would be  lost if this CRA moves forward. That is $140 million more in deficit  spending that this rule signifies if it were to pass, and  [[Page H890]]  that is why it is opposed by Taxpayers for Common Sense and most other  fiscally conservative groups.   Again, if job creation, science, and taxpayer savings aren't enough,  how about the cancer-causing impacts, carcinogenic effects, of oil and  gas drilling?   Stacy Lambright lives in Thornton, Colorado, near my district with  her husband, Eric, and her two kids, Jack and Molly. Stacy became a  community activist and a member of Moms Clean Air Force after she found  out her neighborhood park frequented by children and families was  directly next to a leaking oil and gas fracking well.   Stacy and her family have been living in the neighborhood for over 14  years, and they have started to experience health concerns after oil  and gas drillers moved in. Since 2015, Stacy's been documenting an  unusual amount of nosebleeds in her family. Just as recently as Monday,  her daughter had a nosebleed, while her son had six nosebleeds last  month, something they never had before. And Stacy's husband's asthma  has significantly increased.   They have lived in the neighborhood for 14 years and only recently,  since the drilling occurred, have they had these health impacts. There  have been no changes in their home or surrounding neighborhood other  than the increased amount of fracking and oil and gas wells and leaks,  documented leaks, to existing wells.   This methane rule further threatens the health of constituents as we  gather additional data, and that is why Stacy is advocating for  stronger legislation and better management practices, not worse  management practices, with regard to existing oil and gas wells.   The safety and health of Stacy's family should be a top priority for  Congress, but it appears, instead, the Republicans' top priority in  this resolution is bringing us back to a time when our water is  polluted, our skies are smoggy, and health issues from dirty air are a  burden for families.   I know it has been argued--we probably will again--that oil and gas  companies are fixing and capping leaks on their own, but that is false.  There is a massive amount of gas leaked every day, and these companies  have not reduced methane emissions from the field one bit. Again,  absent this rule, we will see more of this kind of activity, not less.   Another argument is that infrastructure, like pipelines, is important  to prevent methane flaring. And of course that is true, but a GAO  report says that only 9 percent of venting and flaring is due to the  lack of infrastructure, so it is only a small part of the overall  issue.   And, by the way, this rule doesn't block or in any way impede any new  infrastructure projects, and more infrastructure alone clearly won't  solve the problem of leaking wells and flaring methane.   The issue of leaking methane, in particular, is partially addressed  by this rule, which, by the way, doesn't go far enough. However, what  they wrote has been proven to work in creating jobs and cleaning up our  air.   In Colorado, we have a methane rule that, frankly, this rule is  largely based on, and I know it has worked in Colorado. And while we  need to do a lot better in my home State, at least some level of  baseline can work for the whole country.   Oil production on Federal lands went up 28 percent between 2010 and  2015 under the Obama administration. There is no question that BLM has  and still has authority to regulate methane. It is a waste of taxpayer  money, a misuse of our public lands to do anything other than to reduce  our methane emissions.   Just as an aside, the benefits of this rule include increased job  creation, cleaner air, healthier families, and the climate.    BLM was extraordinarily conscientious when drafting this rule. They  held eight public forums. They extended the comment period for 75 days.  Over 300,000 public comments were collected and addressed. The BLM's  methane rule was done out in the open with public input as opposed to,  by the way, this process, which was done behind closed doors, without a  public hearing, and didn't even have a committee hearing.   It doesn't make sense to use the CRA to repeal this BLM methane rule.  This BLM methane rule creates jobs, protects our families, saves  taxpayer money, and reduces our budget deficit.   The second amendment I offered got to the heart of the problem with  CRAs in general. Regardless of the rules that they are impacting, they  are a reckless, blunt tool, and they are not the right instrument for  honest, thoughtful legislating.   If Congress has a problem with the authority under which the methane  rule was issued, we should amend the statutory authority of the agency,  not use a congressional resolution of disapproval.   My other amendment simply said that the agency has the right and  authority to write a rule impacting this issue which, otherwise, the  CRA could effectively prevent; and due to that uncertainty, passing the  CRA creates even more uncertainty for the industry.   As the Denver Post, a newspaper that has endorsed dozens of  Republicans over the last few years, said in regards to this methane  waste rule: ``Congress is getting ready to use an ax where it needs a  scalpel.''   The Congressional Review Act is one of the most ridiculous tools to  be used by Congress, and, regardless of whether you disagree or agree  with the policy, the better way to approach it would be to amend the  statutory authority of the agency to make it clear whether they have  the authority to issue this kind of rule and under what conditions.   While we may disagree on that, and we may be able to offer and bring  to the floor amendments regarding agency authority, that is the  appropriate venue for this discussion.   Let's move on to the other bill under this rule, the Fair Pay and  Safe Workplaces bill. My Republican colleagues continue to refer to  this order as a problematic order. Unfortunately, it is another attempt  to mislead the American people. This is a tactic the Republican elite  have called ``providing alternative facts.''   The rule under CRA today comes from the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces  executive order, and it is sorely needed legislation. What this rule  says is, if you are a company that consistently breaks the law, without  regard for your workplace, workers, taxpayers, or the community, you  should not receive millions of dollars in taxpayer contracts.   It makes common sense to me. If you are abusing workers, have engaged  in tax fraud, why would we want to contract with you with our taxpayer  dollars?   Companies that cut corners in safety or fair pay, dozens of other  areas, shouldn't get to compete for our taxpayer money against good  actors and companies that play by the rules. Everybody needs to start  from a level playing field.   Now, to be clear, there are only a few bad actors. The vast majority  of companies have no issue at all with this rule. But unscrupulous  actors who have ignored the law, violated the law, cut corners, should  not be rewarded; and, to this day, there are a few bad actors that  continue to receive billions of dollars of your taxpayer money in  Federal contracts.   In 2010, a GAO report proved that there was a problem. GAO  investigated 15 Federal contractors cited for violating hundreds of  Federal labor laws enforced by the Department of Labor, OSHA, and the  National Labor Relations Board. The Federal Government awarded these 15  Federal contractors over $6 billion in government contract obligations,  your money going to known violators in 2009 alone.   How about that for waste, fraud, and abuse?   Now, look, I don't know about my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, but fiscal responsibility is core to my beliefs as a Member of  Congress. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of an amendment to require  a balanced budget.   I believe in the value of hard work and personal responsibility. If  we know a company is cutting corners, taking the easy way out, and  avoiding the responsibility of the law, why would we reward them with  your money?   Organizations throughout the country, representing a diverse group of  stakeholders, agree. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Service Employees  International Union  [[Page H891]]  all join me in opposition to this Congressional Review Act. They  recognize the value of hard work. They don't support companies who  cheat. I don't know why my Republicans colleagues do.   This rule modernizes an antiquated system. Right now it is virtually  impossible for procurement officials to know if company A has had any  violations when they are up against company B for a contract. If  company A has been cheating workers out of overtime and that allows  them to underbid Company B, they shouldn't get the contract and be  rewarded for violating the law.   This executive order will increase coordination, simplification,  access to information, and streamline the system.   This executive order does not set up any way for companies to be  banned or disbarred. That process has always existed and will still  exist alongside this as a separate, independent process. In fact, what  this process does is it provides a remedial path for companies to right  the ship, to get right with the law, to be eligible, once again, for  Federal contracts.   A simple or rare mistake should, of course, not bar a company from  participating in the Federal recruitment process. Instead, companies  with repeated and excessive transgressions should be helped to follow  the law and create a better workplace and be rewarded to be better  stewards of taxpayers dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.   What does this rule do? It enables the repeal of protections for  American workers. These are regulations that ensure that Federal  contractors must disclose labor violations across 14 basic labor laws.                                time  1245    Our Federal contractors employ approximately 28 million workers, and  while the vast majority of contractors are in compliance,  unfortunately, every year American workers are denied their overtime  wages, they are discriminated against for their gender, or their age,  or had their health and their safety put at risk.   Why is this Republican majority working so hard to ensure that  billions of taxpayer dollars continue to go to contractors that cheat  their workers? This executive order targets those bad actors and the  most egregious cases.   The intention of the executive order was to encourage compliance with  the law and level the playing field for contractors who are playing by  the rules. If there are no violations, bidders simply check a box.   What should we be doing here in this body? We should be increasing  worker protections, not demeaning them or decreasing them. The more  than one in five Americans who would be affected should be protected by  our labor laws.    I am prepared to close if the gentleman doesn't have any  remaining speakers.    I am prepared to close if the gentleman doesn't have any  remaining speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First of all, the gentleman from Oklahoma referenced that these have  been the subject of hearings. I would point out that there are over 50  new Members of this body who were not part of the last Congress who  have not had a chance to look at it. And there has been time.   They could have had hearings and markups last week or the week before  [[Page H892]]  prior to these bills coming to the floor. I just came from a hearing in  one my committees today. So they certainly could have been done  consistent with the timeline, had that been the desire.   But, again, the better approach, the correct approach, would be to  amend or change the authorities of the authorizing agency for these  rules, rather than use the CRA process.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's immoral and unconstitutional executive  order banning Syrian refugees and suspending immigration from many  countries is an attack on our core American values as a nation of law  and a nation of immigrants.   This callous indifference of human suffering not only has tarnished  and hurt our image abroad but harmed our national security by  alienating allies and providing terrorist groups with new recruiting  tools.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up Representative Lofgren's bill to overturn and defund  this dangerous executive order.   Let me be perfectly clear for people watching what this vote means. A  ``no'' vote on the previous question gives us the opportunity to  overturn this order and bring up Representative Lofgren's bill. A  ``yes'' vote means the House will continue to do nothing to stop  President Trump's executive action and, instead, choose with allowing  more methane to be spewed into the atmosphere.   This will be the third such vote the House takes this week, and, so  far, every vote cast by a Republican Member in Congress has been in  favor of turning a blind eye to President Trump's unconstitutional and  dangerous order.   The American people should take notice and insist that their elected  Representatives vote ``no'' and reject this administration's  disgraceful policy.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    The fact that these CRA proposals that we have before us  have not gone through any sort of special order, regular order; the  fact that CRAs are cumbersome and reckless tools; and the fact that all  they do is take away protections from our air and from our workers  should make it easy for every Member of this body to join me in voting  ``no'' on this rule and on the underlying bills.    We should be keeping regulations and standards predictable that put  Americans at the top of our priority list, not oil and gas companies,  and not companies that are bad actors and violate our law by refusing  to pay overtime to their workers.   We should value clean air, and we should value companies that play by  the rules. We should value regulations that protect our taxpayer  dollars rather than increase our deficit by $140 million. We can do all  of these things by simply defeating this rule and defeating the  underlying bills.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, ``no''  on the rule, and ``no'' on the underlying bills.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
