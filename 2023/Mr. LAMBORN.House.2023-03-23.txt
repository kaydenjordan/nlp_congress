 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of  Rights Act. This legislation reinforces parents' indisputable rights to  the protection and education of their children.   We have seen a push towards centralizing education by the government,  a mentality seen too often with the left taking away those decisions  from parents. This bill returns choice to the caretakers of our most  precious resource: The next generation.   Why do we need this bill?   We had a Democrat politician running for Governor in Virginia who  lost, who said: ``I don't think parents should be telling schools what  they should teach.''   Can you believe that?   I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should  teach.   Republicans believe in education, especially when parents are in  control. It is ironic that the leftwing has censored or banned books.  Harry Potter books have been burned because leftists don't like the  author.   Leftwing school districts in California have banned ``Of Mice and  Men'' and ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''  [[Page H1361]]    Mr. Chair, this bill puts parents in control. Everyone who cares  about the welfare of our youngest citizens should support this bill.
