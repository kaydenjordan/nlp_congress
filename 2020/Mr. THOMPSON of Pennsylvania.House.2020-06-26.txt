 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  June as National PTSD Awareness Month, and this Saturday, June 27, as  PTSD Awareness Day.   We need to do more to defy the stigmas surrounding mental health.  PTSD treatment is a crucial tool that helps many individuals,  particularly our Nation's veterans, process, cope, and treat emotional  and mental trauma.   Sadly, many of the men and women who have served in the United States  military return home with injuries and scars, but sometimes, it is the  invisible scars that hurt the most. Many struggle privately with PTSD  and feel there is no outlet.   PTSD Awareness Month is not only an opportunity to raise awareness  about this, but it is also an opportunity to raise awareness about  treatment options.   The Department of Veterans Affairs offers a variety of resources to  help those suffering from PTSD. Those seeking treatment should know  that telemedicine may be an option as well, ensuring our veterans  receive timely healthcare no matter where they live.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our Nation's veterans for their service, and I  encourage those who are struggling with PTSD to pursue treatment.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank our education  Republican leader for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the veto override of H.J. Res.  76.   The Department of Education first released borrower defense rules in  1994, which were rarely used over the next 20 years. After a large for- profit school closed in 2015, the Obama administration used this  opportunity to issue new regulations on borrower defense. These  regulations could cost the American taxpayer more than $40 billion and  encourage tens of thousands of borrowers--whether they were harmed or  not--to apply to have their loans forgiven. The 2016 Obama regulations  created more chaos than clarity and set massive loan forgiveness of a  loan, regardless of the cost to taxpayers.   However, in 2019, the Trump administration issued that new borrower  defense rule, which takes effect July 1. The new rule creates clear,  consistent standards and procedures for borrowers who have suffered  financial harm due to a misrepresentation by a school.   Specifically, the rule:   Ensures due process for all parties;   Holds all institutions--not just for-profits--accountable for  misrepresentations;   It delivers relief to students, including veterans, who have been  lied to and suffered financial harm;   It preserves student choice, including student veterans in  institutions that best suit their educational needs;   And it saves taxpayers $11 billion by incentivizing students to  finish their education rather than indiscriminately closing schools.   H.J. Res. 76 would undermine the repeal of the Trump administration's  borrower defense rule and go back to Obama regulations that harm  students and taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  measure.
