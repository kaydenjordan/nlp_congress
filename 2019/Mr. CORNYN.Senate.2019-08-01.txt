 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, when the Senate gavels out at the end of  this day, Members will head home for the August work period to spend  time with our constituents and family. I, for one, am eager to get back  home to Texas and spend time with folks in about every region in my  State. I have the honor of representing roughly 28 million people, and  it takes a little bit of time and effort to get around the State, but I  am looking forward to it.   I will have the chance to highlight some of the work that we have  been doing here in Washington and, yes, hear from my constituents, my  fellow Texans, on what they care most about, what they agree with, what  they disagree with, and everything in between.   With the passage of this bipartisan budget deal, we have now taken  care of our final piece of business for this work period. The funding  agreement we just passed will provide stability for our Nation through  2020 and deliver on some of the administration's key priorities. It has  been the result of extensive negotiations between President Trump and  Speaker Pelosi and represents a compromise between two sides that  typically don't agree on much, and, yes, ``compromise'' is still not a  dirty word. It is the only way things get done around here.   Obviously, this agreement is not perfect. That is the nature of  compromise and the hallmark of responsible government. By passing this  funding agreement, we are avoiding the possibility of a government  shutdown again this fall. Instead, it provides us the time and space  for wide-ranging debate about our government's spending habits. As our  national deficit continues to grow, that could not be more critical.   I was glad to see that through the President's tough negotiations, it  prevents 30 poison pills--or policy riders--from reaching the  President's desk. It is no secret that our friends across the aisle  have tried their best to eliminate the Hyde amendment, which, since  1976, has defined a consensus that no taxpayer funds be provided for  abortions. That argument is over until 2020.   We also know there will be no Green New Deal done--no undoing of the  President's regulatory reform through the backdoor.   Most importantly though, this funding agreement invests in our  military. If there is one priority for what we ought to be doing here  as elected representatives in the Federal Government, it is to provide  for the common defense and for our national security.   This funding agreement provides the Pentagon with the predictability  and flexibility they need in order to keep our country safe today and  tomorrow. A predictable and steady budget gives our military leaders  the ability to plan for the future and allows them to invest in the  innovative and cutting-edge tools our servicemembers need and ensure  that when the call comes, we are ready.   I was proud to support this funding agreement, and I am glad it is  now headed to the White House for the President's signature.                            ____________________     Madam President, over the last few months, I have spoken  at length on the Senate floor about a bill I introduced earlier this  year to reauthorize the Debbie Smith Act--legislation to help us end  the nationwide rape kit backlog.   This legislation carries the name of a fierce and courageous woman--a  sexual  [[Page S5290]]  assault survivor whose advocacy was born of her personal experience.   Three decades ago, Debbie Smith was taken from her home and taken to  a wooded area where she was robbed and raped by an unknown attacker.  She reported the crime to police and went to the emergency room for a  forensic exam, but because of the rape kit backlog, she had to wait  6\1/2\ years before finally receiving the call that her attacker had  been identified through a DNA test.   During that time, she lived in constant fear, wondering who he was,  where he was, and whether he would return to hurt her again.  Identifying offenders through DNA evidence is critical to providing not  only justice but peace of mind for those assaulted and delivering  justice to victims, and, yes, even exonerating the innocent. The power  of DNA testing is such that it can essentially rule out people from  being the alleged assailant or the actual assailant. So this is really  important for a number of reasons.   Sharing this information across State lines through the Federal  system can help us identify repeat offenders who would otherwise go  undetected. Knowing the potential impact, Debbie became one of our  Nation's most vocal advocates for eliminating rape kit backlogs,  including the reprehensible rape kit backlog I have been speaking  about.   In 2004, a bill that carries her name was signed into law to help  local and State crime labs partner with Federal law enforcement to  receive resources to end the Federal DNA evidence backlog. It is  because of the Debbie Smith Act that more than a billion dollars has  been provided to forensic labs across the country.   Since 2005, more than 860,000 DNA cases have been processed,  accounting for 43 percent of all forensic profiles in the FBI's DNA  database.   The Debbie Smith Act has also been central in eliminating the rape  kit backlog in my home State of Texas, which had reached the point of  more than 20,000 untested kits at one point earlier this decade.   As I said at the beginning, I introduced the Debbie Smith Act of 2019  to reauthorize this important funding stream that supports the  auditing, testing, and sharing of DNA evidence so we can eliminate that  backlog and ensure that it will not grow again in the future. The  benefits of continuing the programs created under the original Debbie  Smith Act cannot be overstated, and we must get this important  legislation to the President's desk before it expires at the end of  September.   Since it was first enacted in 2004, the Debbie Smith Act has never  lapsed or expired, and there is no excuse for allowing it to expire or  lapse this year. This bill is not controversial; it is not partisan;  and it is not divisive. In fact, when it came to the Senate floor, not  a single Senator voted against it.   Since we passed the legislation in May, the House of Representatives  has sat on its hands and has done nothing. After repeated requests from  myself, our other colleagues, and countless victims' advocates, Speaker  Pelosi has refused to bring the Debbie Smith Act up for a vote.   Earlier this week, the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents  more than 348,000 members, sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Leader  McCarthy urging the House to move this legislation.   We also heard from the National District Attorneys Association,  RAINN, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, and several other law  enforcement and victims' rights groups which are fully supportive of  this legislation. All of us are ready for the House to act.   I urge Speaker Pelosi to take up the Debbie Smith Act once the House  returns to Washington in September and before it expires or lapses. It  is simply unconscionable to let unrelated partisan bickering stop a  bill that brings justice to victims.
