 Mr. Speaker, the President continues to talk about how  the tariffs are working, how China is struggling, their economy is  hurting, and they are ready to make a deal.   The reality is American businesses are suffering. The trade tariffs  have had a negative impact on small businesses and consumers in my  district.   I recently met with SEMA, the Specialty Equipment Market Association,  an organization that represents nearly 8,000 businesses across the  country, 1 million workers, and revenue of over $45 billion. Seventy- five of those businesses are in California's 39th Congressional  District.   The ongoing uncertainty and threats of new tariffs create an  atmosphere of unpredictability and uncertainty that can inhibit growth  and innovation.   Mr. Speaker, while businesses want to address unfair trade practices,  they disagree with the administration's reckless approach to impose  tariffs. These tariffs have increased prices for American consumers,  hurt businesses, and harmed American families, not foreign countries.   China is no closer to making a deal than it was 6 months ago.   Let's end this reckless trade war for the sake of our consumers, our  businesses in California's 39th, and across the country.                            ____________________
