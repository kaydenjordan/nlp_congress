 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  career of Vern Squier as he celebrates his retirement as president and  CEO of the Centre County Chamber of Business and Industry and the  Centre County Industrial Development Corporation.   Vern's experience with chamber and economic development spans over  two decades. He brought his knowledge and passion for small business to  CBICC and CCIDC in 2011, where he served for a decade.   In his time with one of the largest countywide chambers of commerce  in Pennsylvania, he worked diligently to move the organization forward.   Vern worked closely with Penn State University's leadership and  utilized the output of graduates and staff to build job and wealth  creation in the community and in our region.   While in his role as president and CEO, Vern guided CBICC and CCIDC  to become the go-to organization for businesses in our community and  the greater Centre County region.   I thank Vern for his service and dedication to Centre County. We wish  him a fulfilling retirement. He has earned it.                            ____________________
