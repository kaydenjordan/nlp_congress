 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize June as  Iowa Beer Craft Month. This celebration honors our local craft  breweries which contribute so much to the economy and culture of our  State.   Iowa's craft beer industry continues to grow and thrive, creating  more than $1 billion in economic impact. Iowa Beer Craft Month offers  beer lovers across the State a wonderful opportunity to responsibly  explore the unique and amazing flavors and styles of our local  breweries, while also supporting Iowa small businesses.   I encourage all who can to raise a glass and toast to the exceptional  quality and craftsmanship of Iowa beer.                            ____________________
