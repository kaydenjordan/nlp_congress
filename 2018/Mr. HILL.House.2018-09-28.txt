 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 413.  [[Page H9256]]     Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to  congratulate the six Arkansans in the 2018 class of inductees of the  Arkansas Black Hall of Fame. This year's inductees include:   Kevin Cole, a celebrated painter, printmaker, and sculptor;   Brent Jennings, a prolific award-winning actor and director;   Lieutenant General Aundre Piggee, U.S. Army deputy chief of staff for  logistics at the Pentagon;   Darrell Walker, a former NBA player and current men's basketball  coach at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock;   Mary Louise Williams, a legendary educator and political leader; and   Florence Price, the first African American woman recognized as a  symphonic composer and to have a composition played by a major  orchestra.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize these six Arkansans who will  join the Hall of Fame's more than 140 members for their lasting  contributions to our communities and our State. I congratulate these  inductees who exemplify the spirit and dedication behind this fine  honor.                            ____________________
