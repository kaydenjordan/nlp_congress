 We have a few minutes left to go. I didn't realize the  colloquy was going on. I would like to give an opposing viewpoint.   In this legislation, we put parks over people. We spend billions of  dollars taking care of parks and don't spend a dime taking care of  those folks who live in those parishes and counties next to a  coastline. It turns out that 42 percent of Americans live in a parish  or county next to a coastline, and if you haven't noticed, we  increasingly have flood events. We increasingly have spent billions of  dollars rescuing people from floods, repairing their homes afterwards,  and trying to make them whole.   Now, we could have put legislation in this legislation that would  allow those people's needs to be met, but we are putting parks before  people, and that is a tragedy. We are going to spend billions on places  where we go on vacation, but we will not spend a dime where we live-- where we live--where we raise our children, where we help other people  make a living.   In this--particularly since we know that sea levels are rising--we  are going to increasingly have these events. We are, if you will,  being--I don't know how to put it--blind to the reality that is before  us.   And someone mentioned outhouses on top of a sinkhole--what a tragedy.  Do you know what really a tragedy is? When someone--no, when many  people--when whole swaths of a city are flooded out--that is a tragedy.   And we are out of time, but I will finish by this: I will feel a lot  better about this Senate at the point in which we begin to put people  over parks and spend at least something where people live as opposed to  where people vacation--not to take any money away from the parks but to  just put some money to where people live.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
