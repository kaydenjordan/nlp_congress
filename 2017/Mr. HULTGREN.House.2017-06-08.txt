 Mr. Chairman, I especially want to thank Chairman  Hensarling and the entire committee for all their hard work in getting  us to this point to be able to pass H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act,  a very important bill to reform significant parts of Dodd-Frank that  are failing. The Financial CHOICE Act is an important recognition of  the many mistakes that policymakers made leading up to and responding  to the financial crisis.   There is no doubt that the American people demanded changes from  Washington when the financial crash led to higher unemployment, huge  drops in home values, and lost hope and opportunities; but instead of  reforms that would increase competition and decrease systemic risk, the  Dodd-Frank Act grew government and piled new regulations on community  banks and credit units and enshrined too big to fail into law.   Forty-two community banks and 106 Illinois credit unions have closed  their doors since Dodd-Frank was signed in 2007. This is unacceptable.   I am grateful that regulatory relief legislation that I have  championed is included in the Financial CHOICE Act, things like the  Community Bank Reporting Relief Act and many other provisions that will  provide great relief to our local financial institutions. That is what  the Financial CHOICE Act is all about: giving opportunities back to  local communities to make good financial decisions for their future.
