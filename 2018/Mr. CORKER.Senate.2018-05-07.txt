 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.      Hon. Bob Corker,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

The       total estimated cost is $911.4 million.        This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy       and national security of the United States by helping to       improve the security of a major Non-NATO ally which is an       important security partner in the region. Our mutual defense       interests anchor our relationship and the Royal Bahraini Air       Force plays a significant role in Bahrain's defense.        The proposed sale improves Bahrain's capability to meet       current and future threats. Bahrain will use this capability       as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its       homeland defense. This sale will improve interoperability       with U.S. forces. Bahrain will have no difficulty absorbing       these helicopters into its armed forces.        This proposed sale of equipment and support will not alter       the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Bell Helicopter, Textron,       Fort Worth, Texas; and General Electric Company, Lynn,       Massachusetts. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in conjunction with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple       trips by U.S. Government and contractor representatives to       participate in program and technical reviews plus training       and maintenance support in country, on a temporary basis, for       a period of sixty (60) months. It will also require three (3)       contractor representatives to reside in country for a period       of two (2) years to support this program.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 16-36       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The following components and technical documentation for       the program are classified as listed below:        a. The AH-1 Z-model has an Integrated Avionics System (IAS)       which includes two (2) mission computers and an automatic       flight control system. Each crew station has two (2) 8x6-inch       multifunction liquid crystal displays (LCD) and one (1) 4.2 x       4.2-inch dual function LCD display. The communications suite       will have NON-COMSEC ARC 210 Ultra High Frequency Very High       Frequency (UHF/VHF) radios with associated communications       equipment (antennas, mounts). The navigation suite includes       Honeywell Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertial       Navigation System (INS) (EGI) w/ Standard Positioning Service       (SPS), a digital map system, a low-airspeed air data       subsystem, which allows weapons delivery when hovering, and a       AN/APX-117/A(V) IFF Transponder.        b. The crew is equipped with the Optimized Top Owl (OTO)       helmet-mounted sight and display system. The OTO has a Day       Display Module (DDM) and a Night Display Module (NDM). The       AH-lZ has survivability equipment including the AN/AAR-47       Missile Warning and Laser Detection System, AN/ALE-47 Counter       Measure Dispensing System (CMDS) and the AN/APR-39 Radar       Warning Receiver (RWR) to cover countermeasure dispensers,       radar warning, incoming/on-way missile warning and on-       fuselage laser-spot warning systems.        c. The following performance data and technical       characteristics are classified as follows for the AH-1Z       Airframe: countermeasure capability--SECRET, counter-      countermeasures capability--SECRET, vulnerability to       countermeasures--SECRET, vulnerability to electromagnetic       pulse from nuclear environmental effects--SECRET, radar       signature--SECRET, infrared signature--SECRET, acoustic       signature--CONFIDENTIAL, ultraviolet signature--SECRET,       mission effectiveness against threats--CONFIDENTIAL, target       sight system--up to SECRET, Tactical Air Moving Map       Capability (TAMMAC)--up to SECRET, Honeywell Embedded GPS INS       (EGI) w/SPS--UNCLASSIFIED, AN/ARC-210 RT 629F-23--      UNCLASSIFIED, AN/APX-117/A(V) IFF Transponder--UNCLASSIFIED,       VCR or DVR--up to SECRET, APR-39 Radar Warning System (RWS)--      up to SECRET, AN/AAR-47 Missile/Laser Warning System (MLWS)--      up to SECRET, AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispenser Set       (CMDS)--up to SECRET.        d. The APKWS is a low-cost semi-active laser guidance kit       developed by BAE Systems which converts unguided 2.75 inch       (70 mm) rockets into precision laser-guided rockets. The       classification is up to SECRET.        e. The AGM-114 Hellfire II Semi-Active Laser (SAL) Missiles       are rail-launched guided missiles developed and produced by       Lockheed Martin. The guidance system employs a SAL seeker.       The SAL missile homes in on the laser energy reflected off a       target that has been illuminated by a laser designator. The       laser can be on either the launch platform or another       platform that can be separated from it by several kilometers.       The target sets are armor, bunkers, caves, enclosures, boats,       and enemy personnel. The weapon system hardware, as an ``All       Up Round,'' is UNCLASSIFIED. The highest level of classified       information to be disclosed regarding the AGM-114 Hellfire II       missile software is SECRET. The highest level of classified       information that could be disclosed by a proposed sale or by       testing of the end item is SECRET and the highest level that       must be disclosed for production, maintenance, or training is       CONFIDENTIAL.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures which       might reduce weapon system effectiveness.        3. The consequences of the loss of this technology to a       technologically advanced or competent adversary could result       in the compromise of equivalent systems, which in turn could       reduce those weapons system's effectiveness, or be used in       the development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the Government of       Bahrain can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale of the AH-1 Z Helicopter and associated       weapons will further U.S. foreign policy and national       security objectives.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Bahrain.                            ____________________
