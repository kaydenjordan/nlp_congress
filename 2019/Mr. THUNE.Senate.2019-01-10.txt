 Madam President, yesterday President Trump and Republican  leaders once again tried to sit down with Democrats to break the  impasse over border security funding and fully reopen the government.  Yet, again, Democrats proved unwilling to offer any serious solution or  agree to work with the President in any way.   When the President asked Speaker Pelosi yesterday if she would be  willing to commit to funding the border wall if the government was  reopened, she said no--no.   Democrats are saying that we need to end this partial shutdown and  reopen the Federal Government. I completely agree with that, but it is  Democrats who are standing in the way of that happening. Instead of  seriously trying to resolve this shutdown, they are holding show votes  in the House and trying to score political points.   The administration made an offer on Sunday. Yet 4 days later,  Democrats have yet to respond. If they really want to reopen the  government, they will sit down and negotiate in good faith with the  President to arrive at a solution that both parties can support and  that the President will sign.   I have to ask: When did securing our borders become immoral?   It used to be that Members of both parties recognized that border  security was a basic obligation of our government and that we had a  duty to ensure that our borders were protected and that dangerous  individuals or goods were not entering our country, but apparently-- apparently--Democrats don't agree with that anymore.   According to Speaker Pelosi, building barriers to protect our border  is ``immoral.'' That is right--``immoral.'' According to the Speaker of  the House, protecting our border with barriers to prevent illegal entry  is ``immoral.''   Contrary to what Democrats would like people to believe, border  security isn't an issue dreamed up by hard-hearted Republicans to  oppress various groups of people. Border security is a national  security imperative--something that both parties recognized, until  recently. No country can be secure if dangerous individuals can creep  across its borders unchecked and unobserved.   Democrats talk about border barriers as if they are meant to prevent  anyone from entering our country. That is just false. America is a land  of immigrants, and we will always welcome new faces to America with  open arms. In fact, I, like many others in this Chamber, am the  grandson of immigrants who came through Ellis Island. My grandparents  obviously came and settled in South Dakota, but we have to make sure  that individuals who are coming to this country are coming here legally  and that we know who they are and why they are coming. We do that by  enforcing our laws and by securing our borders--with physical barriers,  Border Patrol agents, and technology--so that individuals can't cross  our borders illegally and undetected.   Leaving our borders open to any criminal, drug dealer, or human  trafficker who wants to sneak across isn't compassion. It is an  abdication of our responsibility.   Right now, we are facing a security and humanitarian crisis along our  border. Tens of thousands of individuals try to cross our southern  border illegally each month. That is a serious security problem. It is  also a humanitarian problem. Individuals attempting the journey to come  here illegally are vulnerable to exploitation, to illness, and to  abuse. One out of every three women attempting the journey to the  United States is sexually assaulted. A staggering 70 percent of  individuals become victims of violence along their way. Illness and  other medical issues are a serious problem. By failing to discourage  illegal immigration, we are perpetuating this humanitarian crisis.   The inadequate state of our border security--both around barriers and  through our ports of entry--also allows other problems to flourish,  like the flow of illegal drugs pouring into the country. Every week in  this country, 300 Americans die from heroin. Ninety percent of the  heroin supply--90 percent--flows across our southern border.   Democrats will say it doesn't come across, that it comes through  ports of entry. A lot of it does come through ports of entry--that is  part of our borders--and the President in his proposal has advanced  measures that would also deal with those drugs coming through our ports  of entry. But the fact of the matter is, we have to secure our border,  and that requires a whole range of measures as a part of that solution.   Democrats didn't always think that securing our borders was immoral.  In fact, in 2006, the Democratic leader and the ranking member on the  Senate Judiciary Committee voted for legislation to authorize a border  fence. They were joined in their vote by then-Senator Biden, then- Senator Clinton, and then-Senator Obama. In 2013, every Senate  Democrat, bar none, supported legislation requiring the completion of a  700-mile fence along our southern border. This legislation would have  [[Page S123]]  provided $46 billion for border security and $8 billion specifically  for a physical barrier.   As recently as last February, nearly every Senate Democrat--46 out of  49--supported $25 billion for border security--just last February.   In 2009, the Senate Democratic leader said in a speech: ``Any  immigration solution must recognize that we must do as much as we can  to gain operational control of our borders as soon as possible.''   Let me repeat that. In 2009, the Democratic leader said: ``Any  immigration solution must recognize that we must do as much as we can  to gain control of our borders as soon as possible.''   Then he went on to discuss progress that had been made on our border  security between 2005 and 2009, including ``construction of 630 miles  of border fence that create a significant barrier to illegal  immigration on our southern land border.''   That is right. In 2009, the Democratic leader not only didn't oppose  border fences; he was praising them for their effectiveness.   So what has changed? The need to secure our borders certainly hasn't  changed. Everybody says: Is it a crisis or isn't it a crisis? I would  say that having 300 people a day dying from heroin in this country is a  crisis, particularly given the fact that 90 percent of that heroin is  coming across our southern border. That strikes me as a crisis.   The President has changed, and that, more than anything else, is the  thing that has changed the minds of a lot of Democrats in the Senate  because we used to have a President Democrats like; now we have one  they don't like and, in many cases, they are openly hostile to.   For Democrats opposing this President and catering to the far-left,  anti-border-security wing of their party seem to be more important than  addressing the security and humanitarian crisis we are facing at our  border.   I venture to say that deep down, a lot of Democrats still realize we  need to secure our borders. I think many realize how important the  physical structure--some sort of barrier--is in making sure that the  border is secure. Certainly, those who protect our border would tell  you that, and certainly those who have observed what has happened over  the past 20 or 30 years--a border fence has been built in certain areas  of our southern border--would tell you that has been very effective.   I think it is important for us to listen to the experts and allow the  opinions of the experts to shape the policies we put in place. I think  what the experts have been telling us is that, yes, we need a  comprehensive solution, one that includes a physical barrier, one that  includes technology, one that includes manpower--all of which this  President, his team, have been willing to negotiate but none of which  the Democrats in the Senate or the House have been willing to sit down  at the table and be a partner in working out.   With their partial shutdown now into its 20th day, I hope they will  soon end this political theater and fulfill their obligations to keep  Americans safe.
