 Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the reauthorization of  the United States Fire Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters  Grant Program, the Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program, and the  SAFER grant program.   These programs are vital to protect the public and the Nation's  firefighters. Recent trends have shown that fire safety and prevention  remains a serious national concern. Data from the U.S. Fire  Administration shows that, while there are fewer fires and fire-related  deaths overall, fires are becoming more severe and costly in both lives  lost and property damage per fire. The best-trained, best-equipped  firefighters cannot always overcome the dangers associated with today's  severe fires.   This alarming trend jeopardizes the economic health of our  communities and our national goal of increased resilience to fire.  Adequate funding for the brave men and women who fight fires is  essential, but we must also be effective in reducing these trends by  preventing the fire's ignition and growth, in the first place, through  robust fire prevention.   I will work with the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to  request that the U.S. First Administration and FEMA investigate the  upward trend in fatalities and property damage per fire.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both Chairman Smith and subcommittee Chairwoman  Comstock for their leadership and hard work on the reauthorization  bill, and I hope to work with them to address these issues moving  forward.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
