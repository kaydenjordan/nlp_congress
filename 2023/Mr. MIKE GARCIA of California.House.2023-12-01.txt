 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to a friend and a true American hero.   Mike Kuper passed away on November 22, 2023, at the age of 70. He is  survived by his lovely wife, Yong; his son, Thomas; his daughter,  Melissa; and five grandchildren.   Mike dedicated his career and life to service. He served in both the  Army and the Air Force. He protected our community for three decades  working for the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. He influenced  hundreds of young men and women as the Law Enforcement Explorer Mentor.   Mike even continued to work as a reserve deputy after his retirement.  Simply put, he went above and beyond to help others his entire life.   Mike Kuper was a great father, a great husband, and a public servant.  He will be missed by his family, his friends, the L.A. County Sheriff's  Department, and the Lancaster communities.   Madam Speaker, may God bless Mike Kuper and all of our peacemakers.                            ____________________
