 Mr. Speaker, last night we heard the President of the  United States speak with great enthusiasm about our friendship with the  people of Ukraine and how we have shared values in terms of democracy,  in terms of sovereignty, and in terms of not having someone come into  their country and usurp their freedom.   President Biden also spoke about America's freedom in the world in  terms of our independence in terms of our own investments in our  economic future. America's excellence in science and engineering has  long been the envy of the world. Along the way other countries have  copied our model, investing in education and research and took over  some of the manufacturing of our supply.   We have, what was referenced by the President last night,  legislation, we call it the America COMPETES Act in the House of  Representatives. It is a blueprint for our independence and our self- sufficiency economically in the world.   With the House-passed America COMPETES Act we do three things. First  of all, we invest in chips, $52 billion in chips and semiconductors. Do  you know how many chips are in a car? There are 1,000; and in an  electric car, 2,000. In order for our auto manufacturers to continue to  create jobs and create products, we need chips. $52 billion.   Secondly, we reinvigorate our manufacturing base by addressing the  supply chain issues. Supply chain increases supply, reducing costs,  lowing inflation. This is very important. There is $48 billion invested  there.   Third, we invest in research and education into stem cell so we can  diversify the workforce to include many more people, everyone in our  country, as we advance science and technology and good-paying jobs for  the future.   Again, we are prepared to go into conference with the Senate on this  legislation. We are always ready to fight for the people. We expect to  have this legislation before too long, and when we do so we will be  lowering costs, increasing paychecks, and doing so for the people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his kind words, which I accept on behalf of our working in a bipartisan  way for our veterans over the years, Democrats and Republicans. And I  thank the chairman for his extraordinary leadership, both in this case  and earlier for our veterans, completing our Agent Orange  responsibilities to our veterans.   As well, I thank Congressman Ruiz, a doctor and a Member of Congress  who has been a champion on this issue, and Elaine Luria, a veteran and  a Member of Congress who has been so instrumental in bringing this  legislation to the floor.   When the President spoke last night about meeting the needs of our  veterans when it came to the burn pits, he received almost a unanimous  standing ovation for that. It was very encouraging to see the Congress  of the United States, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans,  recognize their obligation to our men and women in uniform.   It is important to note that over the past generation, over 3 million  of our courageous Americans have answered the call to serve and have  donned the uniform to protect our freedoms as heroic Americans, just as  people have done since our founding.   From the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan--I was  hearing this morning about Kandahar--and on bases and in military  theaters around the world, these heroes have risked their lives to  fight the enemy and yet, tragically, have had to face another deadly  threat due to exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances.   We always say about our military on the battlefield that we leave no  soldier behind, and when they come home, we leave no veteran behind.  Instead of receiving comprehensive, timely care and benefits, sometimes  they are forced to confront a disability claims process that is nearly  impossible to navigate. That is why the Honoring our Promise to Address  Comprehensive Toxics Act, the PACT Act, finally, faithfully fulfills  that pledge now and into the future, that we will leave no veteran  behind.                                time  1245    The budget costs of it are a cost of war. When we decide that we need  to engage and initiate military action, we should understand that the  cost is not just in our defense budget but also in our veterans' budget  when they come home.   Frankly, the cost of this bill is a fraction, if we are talking  budget, of the cost of the Republican tax bill that they passed in  2017, which added $2 trillion to the national debt. I don't hear  [[Page H1231]]  anybody complaining on the other side of the aisle about what impact  that had on veterans and their concerns about the fiscal soundness of  the United States.   So let's just put it to rest: If it is a cost that we must have for  our veterans--and this has been thoroughly researched, and others will  speak to that--then we cannot say we can't afford it. It isn't about  the price. It is about the value of what we get for this.   In the last 20 years, the VA has seen over a 60 percent increase in  rates of cancer due to toxic exposure. Eighty-six percent of veterans  from Iraq and Afghanistan report being exposed to the toxic fumes of  burn pits, and 88 percent of those exposed said they were experiencing  symptoms that could be related to that.   Potentially up to 3.5 million veterans deployed post-9/11 may have  been exposed to toxic fumes and substances. Despite this reality,  nearly 75 percent of burn-pit-related disability claims were denied,  Mr. Speaker.   Too often, the VA and Congress have said it is just too expensive to  care for, and there just isn't enough proof. The result of this  negligence has been tragic. Thousands of veterans and families have  been forced to suffer, including heroes like one I will quote, Staff  Sergeant Wesley Black.   Staff Sergeant Black was a Purple Heart hero who survived two tours  in Iraq and Afghanistan. In November, he died at the age of 36 from  colon cancer tied to toxic exposure from burn pits, leaving behind his  wife and new baby.   After serving his country with distinction, Sergeant Black should  have been able to retire happily, with pride. Instead, he spent his  final days fighting for the reforms contained in this legislation so  that no current or future veteran would be forced to endure the same  horror that he and his family did.   Staff Sergeant Wesley Black, before his passing, said: It is too late  for me, but it is not too late for the next veteran who walks down the  halls of the VA and goes in and complains about the signs and symptoms.   We must make sure it is not too late for other veterans, I say, and  when we send our servicemen and servicewomen into harm's way, we care  for them when they come home.   This is particularly important to me, because a long time ago, long  before I was in Congress, in 1981, I went and sat with veterans in  California, with Dick Gregory, who was making a big association with  the cause for Agent Orange, in 1981, California, veterans having a  hunger strike. Dick Gregory knew about hunger strikes from the civil  rights movement, and he was associating himself with them and  instructing them on how to survive a hunger strike, and I had the  privilege of being with them.   Little did I know at that time, it would take decades to address  their Agent Orange concerns. And it wasn't even complete until Chairman  Takano did so with the Navy legislation that he passed.   We cannot let that much time go by. That would be shameful to our  country.   Let us also thank Mr. Cartwright, who also included in his package  the Camp Lejeune Justice Act. Anyone who has heard from those families  coming from Camp Lejeune, not just the servicemembers but their family  members, who have been damaged related to injuries incurred while  serving at Camp Lejeune. The list goes on.   Again, thanks to Chairman Takano, Congressman Raul Ruiz,  Congresswoman Elaine Luria, and Congressman Matt Cartwright. I thank  everyone who has worked so hard to bring this to the floor. I want to  also thank Senator Tester, with whom Chairman Takano and our committee  have worked closely.   We share a goal. We have to find the complete package so that it is  comprehensive and fulfills our responsibilities.   Others will go into the particulars of it. I want to also salute the  distinguished Secretary of the VA, Denis McDonough, for the attention  that he has paid to making sure what we do honors the promise of the  PACT Act, so that the bill is written in a way that delivers in a  timely fashion to our veterans.   I could not have been more excited when the President of the United  States included this important initiative in his remarks, not only as  legislation but in the larger issue of what it means to our country,  how we value our veterans and how we want to pass this legislation and  get it to his desk soon so it will be a comfort to our veterans and  their families.   On the battlefield, we leave no soldier behind. When they come home,  we leave no veterans behind.
