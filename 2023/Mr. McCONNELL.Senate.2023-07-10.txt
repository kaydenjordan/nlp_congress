 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over 25 years ago, America made a  noble and necessary commitment--never again to deploy or produce  chemical weapons and to destroy our remaining stockpiles.   The Blue Grass Army Depot in my home State of Kentucky has been home  to the bulk of our Nation's legacy chemical weapons for decades. On  Friday, the depot safely destroyed the last nerve-agent rocket in the  U.S. arsenal.   Last week marks a major milestone in an effort that dates back to  President Reagan's call for a global prohibition on chemical weaponry  altogether. After a decade of bilateral negotiations, the United States  made an international commitment to ban their use, production, and  stockpile for good.   At that time, Blue Grass Army Depot stored over 500 tons of lethal  chemical agents. The Army's initial plan for eliminating the depot's  stockpile was incineration--literally burning the rockets.  Understandably, local residents were concerned about the potential for  poisonous leaks into the community, with schools and family homes  literally in spitting distance.   When I joined the Senate in 1985, our first victory was putting a  stop to new munitions entering the Commonwealth. The second came when I  passed legislation forcing the Army to explore more advanced disposal  options that ensured the safety of local residents. Over the years, I  have been proud to call greater national attention to this important  local issue. I fought to bring home nearly $7 billion in Federal  funding to support the responsible destruction of these munitions, and  I will continue to fight for Kentuckians until the mission is complete.    It has been the honor of a lifetime to lead this charge in the Senate  and to push for the safety of Madison County families each step of the  way. We wouldn't be here today without the singular focus and  determination of community leaders like Craig Williams, an extremely  effective local advocate who devoted much of his career to seeing this  project through. And, of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to the  operators, technicians, construction workers, and other staff for their  work on the ground.   Today is as much a story of local success as it is a reminder of  worldwide significance. The United States is firmly planted in a wide  international coalition that recognizes the moral imperative to reject  chemical weapons, and unfortunately, that coalition is more important  today than ever.   The authoritarian regime in Moscow that escalated a brutal war in  Europe last year is the same one that repeatedly and brazenly ignores  the Chemical Weapons Convention that governs our efforts. Vladimir  Putin has repeatedly used deadly nerve agents on foreign soil and  supported the Assad regime's use of devastating sarin and chlorine  against Syrian civilians.   As we condemn this horror, the American people can be proud that our  Nation stands squarely on the right side of history. Families in my  home State of Kentucky can rest a little easier.   Thanks to the dedication of so many, the United States has shown the  world that our commitment to the global prohibition on chemical weapons  is ironclad as ever.                            ____________________     Now on another matter, last month, the Supreme Court  wrapped up its productive term by deciding some especially  consequential decisions in favor of equal protection and Executive  restraint. In response, Washington Democrats offered a fresh example of  just how profoundly they misunderstand the Court and its role in our  government.   The President, who has flirted with calls for Court packing, warned  ominously that a coequal branch was ``not a normal court.'' The  Democratic leader who threatened Justices by name from the steps of the  Court branded it as ``MAGA.'' And this month, the Judiciary Committee  will attempt to force the Court to restructure itself in the name of  ``ethics.''   But for all the Democrats' breathless fearmongering, the record of  the Supreme Court's latest term tells a very different story. By the  numbers, the Court remains as ideologically diverse and unpredictable  as even passing students of our Constitution know it was designed to  be.   Nearly half the cases the Court heard this term produced a unanimous  outcome. It ruled overwhelmingly in both directions--striking down  union thuggery and declining to stop the Biden administration's open  border policy.   By contrast, just 9 percent of cases were decided 6 to 3, with each  of the Republican-appointed Justices in the majority. The exact margin  liberal commentators use to claim that the Supreme Court is  irredeemably polarized actually decided fewer than 1 in 10 cases this  term. This is the institution our colleague from New York likes to call  a MAGA Court. Really.   Here is the reality: In case after case, the exceptionally qualified  Justices Washington Democrats have spent years vilifying continue to  prove their strength and independent jurisprudence.   Justice Barrett was just as likely this term to vote with Justice  Kagan as with Justice Thomas. Let me say that again. Justice Barrett  was just as likely this term to vote with Justice Kagan as with Justice  Thomas. Justice Kavanaugh was more likely to vote with Justice Kagan.  And the Court's two most conservative Justices, Thomas and Alito, voted  together less frequently than liberal Justices Sotomayor and Jackson.   The Supreme Court is not in crisis when it refuses to reliably and  predictably advance Democrats' priorities. The Court is not in crisis  when it puts the text of our law above politics. The Supreme Court is a  coequal branch of government, and it should continue to do its job.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
