 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Cynthia  Vernon Warren.   Cynthia came to New Mexico in 1958 and fell in love with our  beautiful State. While she lived in Albuquerque for over 50 years,  Cynthia had a soft spot for the village of Truchas, frequently visiting  the awe-inspiring Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It is also where many of  her dearest lifelong friends lived.   Cynthia was an educator. She worked hard to support communities in  the South Valley. She taught English and reading, and started the  English as a second language program at Rio Grande High School. She was  a leader and served our kids as the chair of the reading and languages  department.   Cynthia also had a passion for politics, especially social and  environmental justice issues and civil rights. Along with her husband,  Bill, who served in the State legislature, Cynthia believed that she  was here on this Earth and in our communities to work for a better  future.   When Cynthia passed away last July, we lost a beloved wife, mother,  aunt, and member of the community. Today, it is an honor to pay tribute  to a woman who touched so many lives and so many New Mexicans with  love, care, and a passion for service.                            ____________________
