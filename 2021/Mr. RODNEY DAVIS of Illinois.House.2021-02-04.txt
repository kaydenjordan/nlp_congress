 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate the bicentennial celebration of the founding of Montgomery  County, Illinois.   Montgomery County was formed February 12, 1821, and named in honor of  Revolutionary War General Richard Montgomery. Montgomery County has a  rich history, including being a friend to Illinois' favorite son,  Abraham Lincoln, and providing a stretch of historic Route 66.   Montgomery County continues to be a vibrant community that supports  family, sports, fine arts, churches, and numerous organizations for  more than 30,000 residents that make up 20 municipalities. I am proud  to represent Montgomery County and the many people who make it a  wonderful place to live.   Congratulations to everyone in the county on celebrating their  bicentennial.                     Thank You to David A. Northern, Sr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  David A. Northern, Sr., for his leadership and service to the people of  Champaign County, Illinois.   I have had the privilege to work with David through his role as the  chief executive officer of the Housing Authority of Champaign County,  an organization which provides housing and related services to the most  vulnerable populations in our community. He oversaw various programs  that provided housing opportunities and assistance to over 13,000  citizens.   Under David's leadership, the agency launched numerous projects to  develop affordable housing, update existing properties, and bolster  support programs. David believes that the Housing Authority's mission  is just as much about transforming futures and putting families on a  path to economic self-sufficiency as it is to just providing homes.  That vision and drive has served him well.  [[Page H335]]    David's distinguished career and experience in Federal housing  assistance has been a blessing to Champaign County. While we will  certainly miss him in Illinois, we wish him the very best as he begins  a new journey as the president and CEO of the Housing Authority of  Birmingham District in Alabama, the largest in the State.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, wish to thank my friend David Northern for his  service to Champaign County and congratulate him and wish him the best  in his new home in Alabama.                          Remembering David Pickett     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  David Pickett, my friend from Taylorville, Illinois, who sadly passed  away right before Christmas.   David graduated from Taylorville High School in 1977, and then  graduated from Western Illinois University in 1981, with degrees in  accounting and computer science.   He will be remembered in our community for his entrepreneurial  spirit, his photography skills, and for his love of sharing with others  in the community. His most memorable feat in Taylorville will be taking  the hobby of photography and turning it into a business called Fun  Photo. It was his own sports photography business. I saw David at  sports events, and I still have pictures of my young kids in youth  football and youth baseball that line my household because David was  there. He was part of our community and he was part of our kids.   David was an avid fisherman, a diehard Cardinals fan. He had a talent  for cooking and loved to entertain his friends and family. His vibrant  personality and remarkable smile will be missed.    I really wish the best for his family right now. It is a sorrowful  loss for them, but also everybody in our hometown of Taylorville.  Shannon and my kids send our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Debbie;  his children, Mark and J.D.; his grandchildren, Libbey, Bennet,  Jamison, Charlotte, and Connor; his parents, James and Mary; and his  siblings, Linda and Tom.   David, may you rest in peace, my friend.                          Remembering Rosemarie Long     Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day today.  Last night, not just my good friend, but a great friend to our  community and Sangamon County, Illinois, passed away.   Rosemarie Long was somebody who I came to know as the head of our  local Republican Party in Springfield, Illinois. I can tell you that  Rose Long gave such good advice and great mentorship to many people  like me and others who have walked this institution. Rose Long was  somebody who cared about her community and cared about making her  country better.   My heart goes out to her family at this trying time, and I certainly  want them to know that I know without Rose's guidance, without Rose's  friendship, without Rose's support, I would not be blessed to serve as  a Member of Congress.   One thing about Rose, she was not shy, at all, of letting me know her  concerns about what we may or may not be doing right for her in this  institution. I cannot believe that Rose is gone. I cannot believe that  the world is going to be a better place without her. But I know one  place that will be better with her, and that is Heaven.   Good luck, my friend. May you rest in peace, and may God continue to  bless you and your family at this very sorrowful time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably  detained.
