 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  this effort to move forward with impeachment proceedings.   What happened on Wednesday, January 6, was nothing short of pure  anarchy. Those individuals who broke the law should be held accountable  for their actions. They should be prosecuted to the highest extent of  the law, and they should be put in jail.   This was one of the saddest days of my life, last Wednesday, Mr.  Speaker. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the police officers and  other law enforcement who carried out their duties on that tragic day,  including Officers Sicknick and Liebengood.   Right now, our focus should be on healing, healing our Nation. With  so many upset and dismayed at the actions of last week, it is our  responsibility to chart a path forward, to subdue the growing  animosity, and to find ways to heal our country.   Unfortunately, I don't believe this resolution will achieve those  goals, especially 7 days ahead of the inauguration. This is a very  serious and concerning effort during such a tense and fragile time in  our country.    I urge my colleagues to consider how this would further entrench  people during such a tense time. I cannot support this.
