 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  resiliency and the courage of Julian Stanford. Julian is a 17-year-old  high school student who was recently involved in a life-changing  accident.   While driving home after work on August 21, Julian attempted to avoid  an oncoming vehicle, resulting in paralyzing injuries. Julian was  transferred to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia, where his  treatment has been centered around healing and prayer.   Prior to his accident, Julian was an honor roll student and an active  leader in his high school's Republican Party. Known throughout his  community for his laughter and his love of music, Julian's passion for  life is truly inspiring.   Despite the extent of his injuries, Julian continues to fight daily  with his mom by his side. Julian is a living miracle whose  determination is remarkable.   I am praying for Julian and his family, that he makes a full  recovery, and I know he will go on to achieve great things.   Julian, we love you and you inspire us. Keep up the good fight.                Recognizing National Suicide Prevention Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  September as National Suicide Prevention Month. This important month is  an opportunity to remember those who have lost their lives to suicide  and share resources to fight the stigma surrounding mental health  challenges.   As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide  affects Americans from all walks of life. The challenges surrounding  mental health can be complex, but we owe it to our constituents to  utilize every resource to better understand the factors contributing to  suicide.   A critical part in suicide prevention is equipping ourselves and our  communities with the resources needed to fight this tragic occurrence.  From engaging in open conversations about mental health to checking on  our neighbor, there are steps we can all take to help those in crisis.   September may be Suicide Prevention Month, but community engagement  and prevention efforts should be maintained year-round.   I encourage everyone to educate themselves on the warning signs of  suicide, as it could save a life.                     Remembering Don and Margie Varnadoe     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Don and Margie Varnadoe of Glynn County, Georgia,  who tragically passed away on September 25. Don and Margie were aboard  Amtrak's Empire Builder train when it derailed near Joplin, Montana.   Don and Margie were known throughout the community for their service  to the Glynn County school system. Margie was a teacher, a principal, a  personnel director, and assistant superintendent. She was loved by her  students and peers for her dedication to educating our future  generations.   Don was a retired St. Simons real estate agent and school board  member for four years. During his term, Don focused on improving the  school system so that all students in Glynn County could have a  positive learning experience.   Both cared immensely for their community, and I am thankful for Don  and Margie's impact on Georgia's First Congressional District. Their  irreplaceable presence will be missed by all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues  to support legislation that I, along with Representative   Jim  Hagedorn, are introducing to ask the House of Representatives to  denounce Major League Baseball's actions in closing a plant in  Caledonia, Minnesota, and moving manufacturing jobs to communist China.   For more than two decades, Miken Sports has been located in the  Caledonia community. As an integral small business, Miken employs  nearly 150 hardworking Americans. This decision to close the plant and  move jobs to China directly defies Major League Baseball's position as  America's pastime.   There is nothing American about outsourcing jobs to China, removing  income from American workers, and destroying a community's economy. We  know that very well in Atlanta, Georgia.   Major League Baseball should be an unquestionable supporter of  American jobs. The League's decision to close the plant and move those  jobs to China is incredibly disheartening. America's pastime should be  supported by American-made products and jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Major League Baseball to live up to its  responsibility to the American people by reversing this decision to  keep these jobs at home and to purchase American-made products, and I  ask my colleagues for their support.                            ____________________
