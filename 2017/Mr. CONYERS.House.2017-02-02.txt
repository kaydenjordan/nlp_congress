 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 40, a measure that would vacate an  important rule issued by the Social Security Administration to help  reduce gun violence.   This resolution of disapproval is particularly problematic because,  pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, it would not only invalidate  this rule but prohibit the agency from adopting substantially the same  rule in the future, even an improved version of the rule. How unusual.   As we consider this resolution today, I ask my colleagues to  consider, for just a moment, how we arrived at this point and, more  precisely, what is at stake.   In 1968, after a decade of assassinations and gun violence, Congress  worked to pass the Gun Control Act. That law lists certain categories  of individuals who are prohibited from purchasing and possessing  firearms, including felons, fugitives, those who  [[Page H896]]  have renounced their citizenship, those who have been dishonorably  discharged, and also those ``adjudicated mentally defective.'' Today,  we don't commonly use that outdated and unfortunate terminology.  Instead, we refer to the ``Federal mental health prohibitor,'' which  remains an important--although challenging--feature of our Federal gun  laws.   Because it was common sense that we needed a system to help prevent  guns from getting into the hands of those who were legally prohibited  from possessing them, Congress took bipartisan action to enact the  Brady Act in 1993. That statute established a National Instant Criminal  Background Check System--some call it NICS--and it requires federally  licensed gun dealers to conduct checks on prospective purchasers in  order to verify that they are not prohibited on the basis of the  statutory categories.   Although unwisely limited only to sales conducted by licensed gun  dealers, the NICS system is extremely beneficial as far as it goes.  Critically, however, this background check system is only as good as  the completeness of the records it includes. This fact was tragically  underscored in 2007, when a student on the campus of Virginia Tech shot  and killed 32 people. The shooter had a mental health record that was  serious enough that it should have been reported to the system, but it  was not.    As a result, Congress enacted the bipartisan NICS Improvement  Amendments Act that same year in order to provide incentives for States  to do a better job of submitting disqualifying mental health records to  the system. The law also requires Federal agencies to submit any such  information that they have. While some States have done a great job of  complying with the law, others have not, which remains a critical  challenge. As we expect States to do more to comply, we must also  ensure Federal agencies are doing their part.   The rule under consideration, which was finalized last December after  an extensive rulemaking process that considered more than 91,000  comments from the public, is intended to impact only a very narrow  range of individuals whom the agency determines should be prohibited  from possessing firearms under the statutory mental health prohibitor,  which has been the law for decades. The rule applies only to those  individuals who have a very severe, long-term mental disorder that  makes them unable to do any kind of work in the American economy,  including even part time or at very low wages.   These individuals must have been determined through an evaluation of  all of the evidence that they are not capable of managing their own  benefits and must be assigned a representative payee. This designation  is given only after an individual is notified orally and in writing at  the outset of the process that the gun eligibility determination would  be the result of the assignment of a representative payee. After the  determination is made, the affected individuals may appeal the decision  to the agency and then, ultimately, to a Federal court.   Of course, we must avoid taking actions that would unfairly  stigmatize individuals who suffer from mental illness or a disability.  This is true in many respects, but, with regard to issues of public  safety, we must recognize that people who suffer from mental illness  should not be assumed to be dangerous. In fact, they are much more  likely to be victims of crime than to be perpetrators. With those  considerations in mind, my colleagues, it can be difficult to apply the  mental health prohibitor, but, still, we must apply and enforce the  law.   If I were proposing such a rule, I cannot say whether this process  would be exactly what I would recommend. We have not held hearings on  this issue, and we have not had the chance to examine all appropriate  considerations. I can say that the agency has undertaken a commendable  effort in accordance with President Obama's directive to ensure that  the NICS background check system has the information that it believes,  after a thorough rulemaking process, corresponds to a longstanding  category of firearms prohibition.   Accordingly, we should not completely disregard the agency's efforts,  and I urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose H.J. Res. 40.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Members of the House, we have some organizational support for  opposing this resolution. The first is the AFL-CIO, one of our largest  unions in the country. The second is the Consumer Federation of  America, and then there is this great organization, Everytown for Gun  Safety across the country.   In addition, the Americans for Responsible Solutions organization is  opposed to H.J. Res. 40. Finally, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun  Violence is also opposed to this measure, as is the Consumer Federation  of America.                                time  1415    If Members believe this rule needs further refinement or that it does  not afford adequate due process, then we should have the conversation  with an eye toward improving the rule, but that is not what has been  done. Unfortunately, this is what we are not discussing today. Instead,  H.J. Res. 40 would invalidate all aspects of this rule and prohibit the  agency from adopting substantially the same rule.   We should not summarily dismiss this rule, which would undermine the  effort to make the NICS more effective. If H.J. Res. 40 passes Congress  and is signed into law, some individuals will be able to pass firearm  background checks solely because Congress prevented relevant records  from being submitted to the system.   The Social Security Administration's rule is about making Americans  safer from the scourge of gun violence and, unfortunately, believe me,  H.J. Res. 40 would do the opposite.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  [[Page H904]]  and I would like to emphasize several points additionally.   The degree of impairment required for reporting to the NICS is  extremely high, to the extent that someone is not capable of working at  any job in the economy, no matter how basic. Someone receiving Social  Security benefits as a retiree, even if they have mental impairment and  have been assigned a representative payee, would not meet the criteria  for reporting to the NICS because they are not receiving benefits  because of disability.   Further, the rule went into effect in January, but compliance is not  required until December of this year. This would only impact claims  going forward and will not involve retroactively assessing individuals  already receiving Social Security disability payments based on mental  impairment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), my colleague, a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Members of the House, this is a very serious matter. This rule, and I  have to emphasize this, does not run afoul of the Second Amendment. You  can oppose this--well, let's put it like this: The Heller Court, in the  Supreme Court case, said that ``nothing in the Court's opinion should  be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession  of firearms by felons and the mentally ill.'' I emphasize ``and the  mentally ill.''   And it is in that sense that I join with the AFL-CIO, Consumer  Federation of America, Everytown for Gun Safety, Americans for  Responsible Solutions, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and  many thoughtful citizens who support the Second Amendment in opposing  the measure that is on the floor now.   I urge Members to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
