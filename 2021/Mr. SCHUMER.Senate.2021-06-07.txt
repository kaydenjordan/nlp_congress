 Madam President, the Senate returns to session with a  busy and consequential work period ahead of it. We will consider  landmark legislation to establish paycheck fairness, legislation to  boost American innovation in the 21st century, and in the final week of  June, legislation to protect voting rights and American democracy. The  Senate will consider all three of these issues this month.   We will start by finishing the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act,  now known as the USICA Act. The bipartisan legislation will be the  largest investment in scientific research and technological innovation  in generations, setting the United States on a path to lead the world  in the industries of the future. It includes the input of virtually  everyone in this Chamber--a product of over six committees and dozens  of amendments from our Republican colleagues.   Tomorrow, the Senate will consider a couple of final amendments  before passing this historic legislation. It will be one of the most  important things we will have done in a very long time. It will be the  largest investment in scientific research and technological innovation  in generations--decades.                            ____________________     Madam President, on judges, in addition, today and  tomorrow, the Senate will confirm the first of President Biden's  nominees to the Federal bench: Julien Xavier Neals of New Jersey and  Regina Rodriguez of Colorado. I also look forward to confirming other  highly qualified jurists later this work period, including Ketanji  Brown Jackson to serve on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. These are  the first of many jurists that the Democratic Senate will consider to  restore the balance to the Federal judiciary.   Under President Trump and Leader McConnell, the Senate became a  conveyor belt for nearly 200 judges. Many were woefully inexperienced  and far outside the judicial mainstream. Some were so extreme on issues  of race and voting rights that even some of our Republican colleagues  joined the Democrats in rejecting those nominations.  [[Page S3944]]    On the flip side, President Obama appointed 320 judges, and President  Biden now has the opportunity to fill more than 80 vacancies. Under  this Democratic majority, the Senate will swiftly and consistently  confirm President Biden's appointments to the Federal bench, bringing  balance, experience, and diversity back to the judiciary. Mr. Neals and  Ms. Rodriguez are two great examples, along with Ms. Brown Jackson.   In the same vein, today, I also announced two judicial  recommendations to President Biden: Myrna Perez, the director of voting  rights at the Brennan Center for Justice, to serve on the prestigious  Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and Dale Ho, the leader of the voting  rights project at the ACLU, to serve on the Southern District of New  York. Ms. Perez and Mr. Ho are two of the foremost voting rights and  election experts in the country. With a national focus on voting rights  right now, their elevation is timely, and their perspectives will be  invaluable. Ms. Perez would also be the first Latina to serve on the  Second Circuit Court since now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor.   Diversity on the Federal bench is very important to me, both  demographic diversity and diversity of experience. The courts have long  been packed with former prosecutors and corporate lawyers. It is about  time that civil rights attorneys, voting rights attorneys, and Federal  defenders start getting the nod. My recommendations of Ms. Perez and  Mr. Ho are part of that effort.   Last month, I also recommended Eunice Lee, an appellate attorney with  the Federal Defenders of New York, to serve as a judge on the Second  Circuit. Lee could become just the second Black woman to sit on this  prestigious appeals court, a court that has never--never--had a former  Federal defender on its roster.   Just like Ms. Perez and Mr. Ho, Eunice Lee will bring demographic and  professional diversity to the Federal bench. The three of them, in  tandem, will bring dynamism, brilliance, and a real diversity of  experience to courts in New York.   As a Senator from New York and as majority leader, I am intent on  restoring balance to a judiciary that has been thrown out of whack by 4  years of President Trump's selections.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on paycheck fairness,  tomorrow, the Senate will decide whether to take up legislation to  address the gender pay gap.   Right now in America, women earn, roughly, 82 cents for every dollar  a man makes. The gap is even wider for women of color. Even when you  account for educational attainment, Black and Latina women earn only 65  to 70 percent of what a White man makes with the same degree, whether  it is a bachelor's degree or an advanced degree. Many women with  advanced degrees actually make less than their male counterparts who  don't have them. So, looking at the facts, women with the same jobs,  the same degrees--sometimes better degrees than their male colleagues-- are making less money. That is the very definition of gender  discrimination, and it is holding back women in every industry and area  of the country.   The pandemic has only made matters worse. Faced with impossible  choices between careers and childcare, women have fallen out of the  workforce at an alarming rate. By one measure, the COVID-19 pandemic  has set women's labor force participation back by more than 30 years,  leading some economists to describe the 2020 year not as a recession  but as a ``she-cession.''   So there is a lot of work to do to not only recover from a  devastating year for women in the workplace but also establish an equal  playing field where women are paid what they deserve.   Senate Democrats have put forward a bill that would make it much  easier for women to petition for pay equity. It doesn't mandate that  employers set wages at a certain level. It doesn't have the government  reach into the private sector. It merely makes it easier for women to  overcome pay discrimination.   In my view, this straightforward, unobjectionable piece of  legislation should merit bipartisan support and should not require  changes. All 50 Democratic Senators are cosponsors of the bill--all 50.  Will our Republican colleagues step up to the plate and join us  tomorrow to advance this commonsense legislation?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 67, S. Res. 229.    Madam President, I know of no further debate on the  measure.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  preamble be agreed to and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of S. 1828 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. 1502 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Cortez Masto substitute  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 253.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Tuesday, June 8; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the Neals  nomination postcloture; that at 11:30 a.m., all postcloture time  expire; that following the cloture vote on the Rodriguez nomination,  the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus  meetings; further, that the postcloture time on the Rodriguez  nomination expire at 3 p.m.; that the order of Friday, May 28, with  respect to S. 1260 be executed immediately following the disposition of  the Rodriguez nomination; that the cloture motion on the motion to  proceed to H.R. 7 ripen following the disposition of S. 1260; and  finally, that if any of the nominations are confirmed, that the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:18 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, June 8, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
