 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1942, the  National Heritage Area Act.   We currently have 55 National Heritage Areas in operation  nationwide--these are sites of important cultural significances that  also spur jobs and have a positive economic impact.   And yet, no standardized process for administering National Heritage  Areas exists. This has led to inconsistent oversight and management, as  well as uncertainty for the future of these sites and future sites. The  bill we are considering today would fix this.   This bill would also include legislation I led this Congress that  would extend the authorization of the MotorCities National Heritage  Area in Michigan.   The stories told by MotorCities cannot be told anywhere else. They  are the stories of how auto tinkerers became titans, how the area  helped establish and expand the United States as an industrial power,  and how the automotive industry helped create the middle class.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  bill. And I thank Representative Tonko and Senator Stabenow for  spearheading this effort, and I thank leadership for moving quickly to  bring this bill to the floor before the 117th Congress closes.
