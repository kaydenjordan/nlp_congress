 Mr. Speaker, this is an opportunity for Congress to  reassert itself as an equal branch of government. The fact that it is  supposed to be three equal branches of government is not totally  accurate.   When we came up with the Constitution, we decided that we didn't want  to have an autocratic king rule us. That is why we had a revolution.  When the men met to write our Constitution, they made Congress Article  I. There was a reason they made Congress Article I, because the  Congress represents the people. It is not a king, it is not an  autocrat, and it is not a despot. It is the Representatives of the  people who make the laws. We are supposed to really be the embodiment-- and we are the embodiment--of the American people.   This President has thumbed his nose at the Representatives of the  people by not complying with lawful requests for documentation and  lawful requests for testimony for Congress to do its constitutionally  delegated purpose of oversight of the executive branch and laws that  are necessary for the betterment of this Nation.   This is about time Congress did act. I am proud of Congress for  bringing these bills, and I am shocked at the opposition for not  wanting the people's House--their House, their legislative body--to  stand up for future Congresses as well as this Congress for the  rightful power that it deserves to do oversight and perform its  functions with the best possible witnesses and testimony and materials  that could aid it in its efforts.   I support the contempt citations. I condemn the parties that have  thumbed their noses at us, subpoena under law, they are supposed to  arrive with documentation and appear to testify. If they object, they  can object there and then, not just disregard Congresses' subpoenas  that are lawful.
