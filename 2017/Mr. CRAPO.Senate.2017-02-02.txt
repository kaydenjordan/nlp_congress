 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the regulatory  burden imposed by the SEC's extractive resource rulemaking and offer my  support for the resolution to disapprove it.   I will take a few minutes to talk about the complicated history of  this rule and then about the concerns with the way it was formulated.   The SEC originally adopted the rule in 2012 and was challenged in  court by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute.  In 2013, the U.S. district court threw out the regulation, contending,  among other things, that the SEC misread the requirements of the  statute. The SEC did not appeal the decision, acknowledging that it  needed to rewrite the rule.   The SEC's proposed timetable for a new rule was delayed several  times, and in 2014, Oxfam America sued to compel the SEC to move  forward on a new rulemaking. The court ordered the SEC to file an  expedited schedule and, as a result, a new rule was proposed in 2015  and finalized last year.   As one can see, this rule and its various iterations have been  fraught with controversy for many years. Advocates of the rule have  said that it will combat corruption in resource-rich nations. The SEC's  final rule raised doubts about this. The final rule stated several  things, including: The direct causal relationship between increased  transparency in the extractive industry and social benefits is  ``inconclusive.'' In fact, it noted that ``research and data available  at this time does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions.'' Unlike  the potential benefits, though, the costs are reasonably certain.   The SEC estimated up to $700 million in initial costs and up to $590  million in ongoing annual costs. Put another way, each company would  endure between $560,000 and $1.6 million in initial costs, and between  $224,000 and $1.3 million in  [[Page S635]]  additional costs each year. We cannot view these costs as affecting  only the largest companies, but must consider the plight of the smaller  ones.   Just under half of all companies covered by this rule are considered  smaller companies, and they would be disproportionately impacted by  millions of dollars in fixed costs--money that could be better spent on  jobs and growth.   Finally, the President's statement of administration policy also  endorses this resolution. Some of the reasons it highlights include:         In some cases, the rule would require companies to disclose       information that the host nation of their project prohibits       from disclosure or is commercially sensitive.        The rule would impose unreasonable compliance costs on       American energy companies that are not justified by       quantifiable benefits.        Moreover, American businesses could face a competitive       disadvantage in cases where their foreign competitors are not       subject to similar rules.    I have repeatedly stressed the need for the U.S. financial system and  markets to remain the preferred destination for investors throughout  the world, and this rule harms this status.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to preserve the  integrity of our securities laws and capital markets.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to at this time enter into a  colloquy with my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson.    Yes, that is correct. What this resolution does is to  cause the current SEC rule to not take effect. As it was characterized  yesterday on the House floor and will be characterized further today on  the Senate floor, what the SEC will need to do is to go back to the  drawing board and come up with a better rule that complies with the law  of the land.    I thank my colleague. I will work to ensure that the SEC  implements all of its congressional mandates.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I yield back the remaining Republican time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of Morning Business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary  Committee be discharged from further consideration of and the Senate  now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 27.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to; that the Cruz amendment to the preamble be agreed to;  that the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and that the motions to  reconsider be  [[Page S661]]  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 43, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 6:30 a.m.,  Friday, February 3; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; further, that following leader remarks, the Senate resume  consideration of H.J. Res. 41, with no debate time remaining; finally,  that following the disposition of H.J. Res. 41, the Senate vote on the  motion to invoke cloture on the DeVos nomination, rule XXII  notwithstanding.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:06 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, February 3, 2017, at 6:30 a.m.
