 Mr. Speaker, today, I am proud to join my colleagues in  passing the Equality Act, which ensures  [[Page H3956]]  that LGBTQ Americans are treated equally.   In more than half our Nation, LGBTQ Americans can still be fired,  denied credit, and evicted from their home simply based on who they are  and whom they love.   It happened to someone in my State. He was a volleyball coach at a  college in Virginia. They had just finished their most successful  season when he was fired without explanation.   Unfortunately, in Virginia, there are no employment protections for  being LGBTQ, so he and his family moved to Washington State where there  are protections for LGBTQ workers, and they are thriving.   Not everyone can just pack up and leave, and they shouldn't have to.  That is why we need to guarantee that LGBTQ Americans have equal rights  and protections in all 50 States, no exceptions.   I urge the Senate to take action and pass the Equality Act so all  Americans are treated equally.                            ____________________
