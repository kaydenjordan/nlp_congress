 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this so- called Inflation Reduction Act.   Last year, we warned that spending trillions of dollars would cause  prices to spike but Democrats did it anyway--ramming through a  trillion-dollar Washington pork buffet, sticking families with the  bill.   Now, Speaker Pelosi is arguing for yet another tax-and-spending  spree, wasting hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on Green New  Deal priorities and raising taxes on middle-class families.   This will worsen inflation. It sics the IRS on hardworking Iowans-- adding 87,000 new IRS agents to target taxpayers.   Iowans are begging for us to get prices down, but instead, this bill  takes more of their hard-earned paychecks. And for what? So the wealthy  can get a discount on their electric vehicles? So we can increase  bureaucracy at the EPA to impose new regulations on our farmers?   Mr. Speaker, this bill ignores the pain that Iowans are feeling. It  is the worst policy at the worst possible time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this latest tax-and-spending  spree.
