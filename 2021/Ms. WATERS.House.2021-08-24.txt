 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, which would  [[Page H4369]]  pass the House's budget resolution. The budget resolution will make  historic investments in housing in this country.   We are in the middle of a housing crisis. As chairwoman of the  Financial Services Committee, it is not lost on me that more than  580,000 people experience homelessness on any given night, while  millions of families are, at this moment, paying the bulk of their  income toward rent.   The bottom line is that housing is infrastructure. This is why I  introduced groundbreaking legislation, the Housing Is Infrastructure  Act of 2021, to provide more than $600 billion to address our country's  affordable housing crisis, increase first-generation homeownership, and  end homelessness.   While the budget resolution only allocates $339 billion to the  Financial Services Committee, this funding is still historic and will  transform the lives of millions of families. However, we must first  pass the budget resolution so that we can then pass the President's  Build Back Better agenda, including this historic funding for housing  programs.   This rule also brings us one step closer to the critical House  passage of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   This President is going to bring all of the Americans who want to  come home, home.
