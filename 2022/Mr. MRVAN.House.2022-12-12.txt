 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation of the  legislation approved by the House earlier this month, the Jackie  Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act of 2022.   My fellow Hoosier and impactful public servant at both the State and  Federal level, was a champion for maternal, infant, and early childhood  home visiting programs.   These programs provide critical assistance to pregnant women and  parents with young children who face barriers to achieving positive,  maternal, and child health outcomes.   I appreciate that the legislation provides increased funding and  direction for services that will assist more families with in-home  support and initiatives to decrease child abuse and neglect.   I look forward to continuing to work with all of my colleagues in a  bipartisan fashion to complete this legislation and honor the legacy  and exemplary work of Congresswoman Walorski.                            ____________________
