 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my strong support for the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Lamb.   The world desperately needs a new source of energy that has zero- carbon emissions. Such a technological breakthrough is absolutely vital  to combating climate change and meeting our growing energy demands.   One such promising technology is fusion energy.   When commercialized, fusion will accelerate the transformation of  America's energy system, providing the foundation for our zero-carbon  energy economy of the future.   My colleague's amendment, which I'm pleased to co-sponsor, would  provide the basis for the United States to maximize its resources, both  public and private, to demonstrate and commercialize fusion energy.   His amendment would support public-private partnerships to make  fusion energy a reality by building full-scale demonstration  facilities--and creating new companies and more jobs here at home.   This is a race against time--not only to prevent the worst  catastrophes that we're beginning to see due to climate change, but  also ensuring adequate funds so that the United States is the global  leader in fusion.   As Professor Dennis Whyte of MIT wrote last year in The Washington  Post, ``This is a critical moment for such funding decisions. Other  governments are investing billions in fusion.''   The pending amendment's milestone-based funding program will support  the development of a U.S.-based fusion power industry by providing  funds to stimulate R&D and eventual commercialization of this new  energy source.   Each private sector participant will need to meet milestones agreed- upon in partnership with the Department of Energy in order to receive  the public funds.   Federal assistance would be made only upon completion of agreed-upon  milestones.   I urge support for the amendment as well as the underlying bill.
