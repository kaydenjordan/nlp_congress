 Mr. Chairman, let's be honest, we are not  here to solve a problem today. We are not here to change anything  today. This bill will do nothing to help people with preexisting  conditions.    Something not many people know about me is my family's history with  spina bifida.   I had an older sister, about 13 months older than me, who died 2  hours after birth because of spina bifida.   My older sister, who will turn 50 later this month, has lived her  entire life as a spina bifida survivor, spending the first 6 months of  her life enduring many surgeries. My mother knew that my sister was  going to be born with that very birth defect that took the life of her  first child. My sister had her first daughter, Kristen, who was born  with a devastating spina bifida condition. During the pregnancies, my  [[Page H3524]]  mother knew about my sister's birth defect and my sister knew of  Kristen's condition. In spite of that knowledge, their lives were not  aborted.   Kristen has a son who just turned 10. In spite of being in a  wheelchair for her entire life of 30 years, Kristen has been an awesome  mom to Daniel. Daniel will have an incredible story to tell about his  life because his great-grandmother and his grandmother did not seek  abortions to terminate the lives of their ``less than perfect''  children. He is alive today, and I am confident he will have an  incredible impact on those around him.   These aren't nameless, faceless people we are talking about. This is  my sister, my niece, and my family.   These preexisting conditions have had a massive impact on my life and  the lives of my family. These messaging bills are pointless. People  need help, not our talking points. Our goal should be success. We  should aim to write legislation that has a shot to become law and will  change people's lives for the better.   The aim of H.R. 986 is not to protect Americans with preexisting  conditions, but to interfere with the President's ability to govern.  These are real people and real problems that we are ignoring.   I believe that life is precious. Every life is worth protecting. We  have a lot of work to do and it is time to stop talking and act. That  is what we were elected to do here.   Mr. Chairman, the American people are tired of these political games.                                time  1445
