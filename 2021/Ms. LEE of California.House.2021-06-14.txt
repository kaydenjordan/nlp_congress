 Madam Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for yielding but also for her  tremendous leadership and for the Emancipation Trail that she so boldly  led. I am just amazed at what she shared with me earlier today and just  now on the floor.   Because, yes, I am a daughter of Texas. My grandfather was born in  1875--10 years after.
