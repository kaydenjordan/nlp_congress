 Madam Speaker, Kansans have impeachment fatigue. We are  exhausted. We are weary. We are sick and tired of 3 years of Democrats  trying to change the results of the 2016 election.   Kansans want to know why Congress can't pass USMCA, modernize  healthcare, or secure our border.   Regardless, if the Democrats want to go down into the bowels of this  Capitol, into the soundproof Star Chamber, it is my job to be the eyes  and ears of Kansans and to ensure a fair and due process will occur. My  efforts to do this thus far have been denied by the Democrats.   This entire process is anything but fair and defies democracy. But  what is worse, it is all done in secret.   This Ukrainian hoax has turned into a Soviet-styled silencing of the  press, with the Democrats leaking out only portions of the transcript  that might help keep them from allowing Donald Trump to be reelected  again.   Why isn't the press screaming bloody murder? I will never understand.   Madam Speaker, it is the President's job to investigate corruption.  Let's turn this process back to the people, and let the President make  his case to America.                            ____________________
