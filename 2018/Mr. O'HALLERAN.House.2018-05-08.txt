 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr.  Rodney Lewis, a respected member of the Gila River Indian Community, a  loving father, and a committed Arizonan who made a career fighting for  water rights for Indian Tribes across the country.   When he was a boy, Rod, as his friends called him, remembered  watching his family survive droughts that destroyed crops, and he would  listen to stories about the damming of the Gila River, which gave life  to those who lived in the region.   Mr. Lewis served his country in the United States Army infantry,  becoming an Army Ranger and rising to the rank of first lieutenant.  After being honorably discharged, Rod went to law school at the  University of California, Los Angeles, where his next chapter of  service began. According to his son, Governor Stephen Lewis, Rod came  home to serve his people, to bring back that education, that legal  expertise that the community and many Tribes did not have, which was  something extraordinary and very significant to the community--and,  later on, to the entire southwestern United States.   For over 30 years, Rod not only served as general counsel to his  community, but he was also sought after across the country as a  preeminent legal scholar on Tribal rights, water and energy law, and  Tribal gaming. He was the first Native American attorney to argue and  win a case before the United States Supreme Court. He was also the  first Native American attorney to be admitted to the State bar and to  practice law in Arizona.   One of Rod's longest lasting accomplishments is the Arizona Water  Settlements Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush.  He led the negotiations with the Federal Government, Arizona, and more  than 30 non-Indian parties for settlement of the community's water  rights and claims. The legislation set aside billions of gallons of  water for Arizona Tribes and helped avoid lengthy lawsuits. It also  helped settle the long-  [[Page H3786]]  lasting needs of water for the entire southern region of Arizona. I had  the honor of working with Rod on important water issues and saw  firsthand what his knowledge and passion did for his community and the  State of Arizona.   He and his wife, Willardene, met in the first grade and raised a  close-knit and passionate family. According to Governor Lewis, his  mother and father were the definition of soulmates.   My heart goes out to Willardene, Governor Lewis, John, Katherine, and  the whole community as they mourn their loss and celebrate the legacy  of a great man.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today on National Teacher  Appreciation Day to praise the work of educators and school staff in  Arizona and across the Nation. These men and women are shaping the  lives of our children and preparing them at every educational level for  a successful future.   I am married to a teacher, Mr. Speaker, and she and all teachers will  tell you that there is no such thing as a former teacher; they are  educators for life.   I am grateful for the teachers I have had over the years, and I am  proud to stand with Arizona and America's teachers as they demand  adequate pay for the important work they do.   Investing in education will spur economic growth, create jobs in  communities across the country, and allow future generations to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, we must do more to support our schools, our educators,  and our students.                            ____________________
