 Madam Speaker, children and families across the  country rely on their leaders in Congress for much more than thoughts  and prayers. They need us to take action to keep them safe.   Gun violence in this country is a horrifying epidemic. There have  been 18 school shootings in the past 7\1/2\ weeks. It is even hard to  talk about this.   It is difficult to argue, though, with people who are looking at  Congress and wondering whether too many Members in Congress are too  close to the NRA and the gun manufacturers. Congress actually passed a  law to prevent the CDC from even studying gun violence.   In difficult times, I, too, seek thoughts and prayers from friends,  clergy, and family, but this is not stopping the slaughter. I agree  with police officers across the country who say: Get the AR-15s out of  the hands of dangerous people now. Our children are being massacred in  their schools.   Madam Speaker, Speaker Ryan must put bills on the floor to address  gun violence or his party will go down in history as the party that  blocked solutions to this crisis.                            ____________________
