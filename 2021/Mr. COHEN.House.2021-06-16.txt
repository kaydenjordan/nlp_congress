 Mr. Speaker, we are not normal. We are not over the  pandemic. We are not over coronavirus and COVID-19.   Many people in our country, over a majority in my State of Tennessee,  have not been immunized, have not had the vaccine.   I urge everyone to get vaccinated.   When I was a young child, 5 years old, I got polio. Four months  before I got polio, my father gave the polio vaccine to second graders  in a test in Tennessee. He gave it to my brother in the second grade.  He took some vaccine home to give to me, but decided it was outside of  his call and didn't do it. I got polio. It has affected me every day of  my life since, and it affected my father as well.   I urge everybody to get the vaccine, not to regret it. Keep your  children, your family, and your neighbors safe and free from illness.                            ____________________
