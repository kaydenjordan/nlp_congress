 Madam President, reserving the right to object and with  great consideration for Senator Klobuchar's dedication on these issues,  many of which, as she has pointed out, we have worked together on, and  I think we will continue to, I just don't think this is the time to  make this kind of fundamental change.   I will admit that at its very first legislation after the 2018  elections, the House passed a bill, but, again, it was a bill that  would provide the Federal Government with unprecedented control over  elections in this country, despite the fact that for almost 250 years  now, the States have been responsible for this particular government  responsibility. To quote yet another time, Senator and then-President  Obama, in October of 2016, pointed out that the very strength of our  system was the diversity of the system. I think one of the strengths of  the system is the amount of local responsibility and local  answerability, frankly, for how the system works on election day.   Senator Klobuchar pointed out that we are fewer than 6 months until  the election. As a matter of fact, in our committee, I intend to hold a  hearing next month on the problems we have seen develop with this move  toward more people wanting to vote not at the polling place on election  day and how some States have dealt with those problems effectively and  how others haven't.   I will also say, to follow up on one of Senator Klobuchar's points, I  think funding is one thing. Helping the States help themselves is  something I think we can still do. We have done a considerable amount  of that up until now, since the 2016 elections, with a big commitment  in the CARES Act to make money available for States to regulate their  elections and be able to afford to do that. I think we can, will, and  should take another look at that, but 6 months before an election is a  dangerous time to change responsibility.   I think, to be absolutely clear, that at any time, this is a  responsibility that is better done at the local level. But when you  implement a new voting system with a big first election, that is a  problem.   We saw that in Georgia recently. Georgia was complying with the  request that both Senator Klobuchar and I and others had made to get a  system in place that has an auditable ballot trail--an absolutely  worthy goal. Georgia followed up, but even then, it might have been  better if they could have followed up on an election that wasn't quite  the same high-profile, high-turnout election that their first  experience had.   The responsibility for changing the system is hard enough in the best  of times. I think the States have had lots of time. My State and other  States have changed their law to allow more access to absentee ballots  in some States--and as a matter of fact, not even absentee ballots. I  got corrected by that with one of our election officials the other day.  Really, now we call them mail-in ballots. In Missouri, up until now, we  always called them absentee ballots. Though, one of the absentee  excuses had always been ``unable to get to the polls because of  health.'' But in the mail-in ballot ability, in our State, to  eliminate, for some ballots because of COVID-19 or health--eliminate  the notary requirement, States have done this. They had a lot of time.  They had a lot of notice. Most of them dealt with this. More  importantly, if it works, they get the credit. If it doesn't work, they  don't have anybody else to blame. They are working really hard because  of that to make it work.   The House bill was offered the first time in this body not long after  it passed. In March of 2000, I objected, again, to the federalization  of the election process--not the assistance, not the help but the  federalization of the process.   In May of 2020, the House passed yet another bill. I think that is  the bill we are talking about today or something like it. This time, it  was a bill that Democrats said would assist States with the pandemic.  First, we were going to assist States because of ballot security. Now  we are going to assist States because of the pandemic.   There has been a real desire at the Federal level to take over the  election process again. I don't think that is a good idea. If it was a  good idea, it wouldn't be a good idea 6 months before the election.   The provisions in the new bill are about the same as the provisions  in the old bill. They would provide the Federal Government with  unprecedented control over elections in this country. This bill  represents a one-size-fits-all Federal answer to a problem that I think  the Federal Government is not the best place to answer.   The estimated money needs of the States are something I am willing  to, and think we should, continue to talk about. But funding to accept  the new situation they find themselves in is different than  centralizing the process.   Instead of providing States with flexibility to deal with emergency  situations, for instance, this bill does just the opposite. This bill  tells States how to run virtually every aspect of their election. It  takes away authority to the States to determine their own process for  voter registration. In fact, it requires all States to institute online  voter registration at a time when we are more concerned than we used to  be about what can happen to elections online.   This bill tells States how many days of early voting they must have  and where the early voting locations need to be. It requires that all  States accept online absentee ballot requests. You  [[Page S3143]]  have online voter registration. Then you have online absentee ballot  requests and offers the requirement for no-excuse absentee ballots,  which I guess, according to my friend, the election administrator,  would be mail ballots. I am going to get better at explaining that  phrase. It tells States how and when their ballots must be delivered.  It tells them when they have to be counted. It requires States to  permit ballot harvesting.   Ballot harvesting is the only thing, I think in a decade, that a  candidate elected to the House of Representatives was not seated  because the House--this House, the current House of Representatives-- decided that ballot harvesting was the reason that person shouldn't be  seated; that people went around, collected ballots, apparently decided  which ballots they were going to mail in and which ballots they were  not going to mail in--if you look at the House determination that this  person wasn't lawfully elected. But this bill actually requires States  to allow individuals to go and collect ballots and turn them in, in  groups rather than some other way.   If States want to do that, they can do that. But apparently, it was  not good enough to seat a Member of the House of Representatives from  my party. It tells States how they must authenticate their ballots. It  prohibits them, however, from using any form of voter identification to  authenticate who the person is. It tells States what kind of envelopes  they have to use to put their ballots in.   What doesn't it do? It doesn't recognize, again, that for almost 250  years, States have successfully run elections in this country. If the  returns were in question, the people who were the local election  officials and the State election officials were the people who were  questioned. There was no ability to say ``Well, that is out of our  hands'' or ``Well, we don't really have anything to say about that.  Some person in Washington tells us what we have to do about that.''    States have successfully run elections during national disasters.  States have successfully run elections during pandemics. States have  successfully run elections during wartime.   On March 3, 2020, on Super Tuesday, early that morning, a tornado  struck three counties in Tennessee. Election officials were able to use  the flexibility they had as State officials to, No. 1, adjust the  polling location and, No. 2, move election equipment and carry out the  primary election successfully and without challenge. None of that, in  my view would have been allowed if this bill had been in effect.   Similarly, in response to the pandemic, many States, as I suggested  Missouri has, have changed their law and looked for ways to make this  process work. They have had a chance to try--in most cases already in  the primary or in some other elections, States have changed their  primary dates; they have expanded absentee balloting; they have  expanded early voting; they have altered polling place procedures to  ensure cleaning and sanitizing; and they have worked to recruit more  workers.   This bill, in my view, doesn't acknowledge the important  responsibility and answerability that local and State officials have on  election day. That was a job I had for about 20 years, part of that as  the chief election official in the State. I will just state that on  election day nothing is more important than voters feeling like their  vote was cast in the right way and counted in the right way, and there  was nobody but me to blame at the county level and then again at the  State level if that didn't happen.   So I think my friend Senator Klobuchar's comments are well-intended  and well-motivated. I just think we have a fundamental difference on  who makes these decisions. I would recommend to all of my colleagues  that if we ever make these kinds of changes, we should make them long  before 6 months before a Presidential election. If this bill were law,  State and local officials would not only lose the flexibility they now  have, but they would have a new place to pass the buck.   This is one of the desks that Harry Truman used on the Senate floor,  and he didn't have a ``pass the buck'' symbol yet, but he famously had  behind his desk, as President, a sign that said ``The buck stops  here.'' On these issues, the buck stops with the person you have chosen  locally and statewide to run your elections. I think that continues to  be the best course for us to follow.   Madam President, I object.    Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments  talking about a man who has been one of my closest friends for a long  time. Springfieldian Ed Pinegar passed away on May 23, 2020, at the age  of 74. He was the kind of person that many people will remember as one  of their best friends.   Ed loved his family, his church, and his community. He grew up in  Willard, attended Missouri State University, and became one of the most  successful auto and truck dealers in the middle of our country. Never  forgetting his rural roots, he eventually established Pinegar Land and  Cattle and became the leading breeder of Limousin Cattle in North  America. As with everything he did, this was an extremely successful  business.   Ed never forgot where he was from. For the last several years, one of  my favorite things was to go to Ed's farm with him early in the morning  to see what his plans were for the farm and catch up on what was  happening with the business and his family and friends. I will miss  those visits, but I am so glad to have shared those times with Ed.   Ed's life of service is too long to list, as are the recognitions he  received along the way. He served on the Missouri State University  board of governors and their board of trustees, was inducted into the  Missouri Limousin Breeders Association Hall of Fame, honored by the  Ozark Empire Fair Ground Gold Buckle Gala for his dedication to youth,  and with his wife Carol received the outstanding Willard Alumni Award.  He recently received the 2019 AFP Outstanding Philanthropist of the  Year Award.   Ed was dedicated to his family, his community, athletics, and his  faith. He was a loyal friend with a great sense of humor and an even  better perspective on life. He was a devoted Christian, active in his  church, and used the blessings of his work to invest in the places and  people he loved. He was generous in his giving and generous in spirit.  The Pinegar Arena is an indoor horse center and classroom that is part  of Missouri State's agricultural center. This is one of many examples  of how Ed gave of his time and resources investing in people and things  to help others.   Much too soon, Ed suffered a stroke, which took a serious toll on his  health and quality of life. Abby and I were encouraged by his early  recovery from those challenges and inspired by his family's dedication  to him as each of them, with Carol in the lead, loved and cared for  him. Much of his legacy will continue to live on through Carol and  their children Angela, Tad, Amy, and Abigail. Ed also leaves behind  nine grandchildren, who were lucky enough to spend time with their  grandfather who, despite his busy schedule, prioritized games, events,  and school performances.   I am grateful to have known Ed Pinegar and thankful for his impact on  my own life and that of those who knew him.                            ____________________
