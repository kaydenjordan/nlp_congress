 Mr. President, today I rise to honor the career of  New Hampshire State Trooper Scott Frye, who recently retired from the  force.   A native of Milford, NH, Scott served with the New Hampshire State  Police for more than 22 years as a road trooper, a member of the  narcotics unit, and most recently as head of the executive protection  detail. During his time in executive protection, Scott served under  three Governors, including for 4 years during my time as Governor.   Through our work together, I saw firsthand Scott's commitment to the  Granite State. He always sees the big picture; he can step into a room  and immediately assess it and the people in it, both as a security  risk, but also for need. Scott can find a way to connect with and put  almost anyone at ease. As a result, he is greeted as a welcome friend  wherever he goes in New Hampshire.   While Scott served for nearly a dozen years on the security detail of  Governors, he never lost sight of his commitment and obligation to  protect the safety of every person in New Hampshire.   Scott's experience and deep understanding of the Granite State were  an important benefit to those he worked with. When we would travel to  sites of natural disasters during my time as Governor, Scott always had  a sense about who needed to be checked in with and what a community or  a public safety official needed in challenging times. Even when his day  ended and he was officially off-duty, if he were on his way home and an  extra State trooper was needed, he would be there to help in any way  that he could.   Perhaps nothing exemplifies Scott's dedication, bravery, and heroism  more than when he was driving Governor John Lynch in 2012 and they  witnessed an accident. A car had gone through a guardrail, fallen into  an embankment, and caught fire. Scott pulled over, and along with an  off-duty firefighter, freed a man who was trapped in the vehicle--just  seconds before it was engulfed in flames. For his lifesaving action,  Scott was honored with a number of awards, including a Carnegie Medal,  a national honor that recognizes those who risk their lives to an  extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of  others.   Throughout his service, Scott approached everything with humor,  kindness, and patience. He never complained, and he always served with  an incredible amount of professionalism.   Above all, Scott's main commitment was to his family. His service  would not have been possible without the support and love of his wife  Susan, his sons Zachary and Matthew, and his extended family.   I am grateful for Scott's friendship and his years of dedication to  the people of New Hampshire. His retirement is well-deserved, and I  know that he will continue to look for ways to improve his community  and the entire Granite State.   I hope that you will join me in recognizing the years of service of  State Trooper Scott Frye.                            ____________________
