 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate San Jacinto College  Chancellor Dr. Brenda Hellyer on receiving the prestigious Quasar Award  for Economic Development Excellence from the Bay Area Houston Economic  Partnership.   This award is given to an outstanding individual who has demonstrated  a strong and continual effort to support the business foundations of  the Greater Bay Area Houston communities.   Dr. Hellyer is highly educated, earning her master's degree in  business administration and a doctorate in community college leadership  from the University of Texas at Austin, where she received the  Distinguished Graduate Award. She is also a certified public  accountant.   In 2009, Dr. Hellyer was named chancellor of San Jacinto College and  has since transformed the school with major renovations and the  development of many award-winning programs.   Mr. Speaker, 1 minute is just simply not enough time to properly  congratulate Dr. Hellyer, and I will submit an extension of my remarks  for the Record.                            ____________________
