 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, do we have a schedule this morning in  terms of debate on the floor?    I will, of course, defer to the chairman and ranking  member if they want to move forward on their legislation, but I would  like to ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.    I would be happy to accept that as a friendly amendment.                               Border Security    Mr. President, it pains me to say this on the floor of the United  States Senate, but there is no other way to describe what America is  facing today. By every objective and measurable standard, the policies  of our government constitute child abuse when it comes to the treatment  of these children on our border. Hardly a day goes by that we don't  hear another horror story involving these migrants and particularly  their children and babies.   Having been there and seen it and read the numbers, I will concede  that we are being overwhelmed, and for that, there should be some  understanding and perhaps even forgiveness if we don't respond as  quickly as possible. But this has dragged on and on for months. There  are children who are being held in detention under circumstances and  conditions which are an embarrassment to this country and unacceptable  in any civilized nation on Earth, period. It led me to join with 23  other Senators to write to the International Red Cross several weeks  ago.   The International Red Cross is called in to countries around the  world when jails and detention facilities have reached such a point  that you need an international arbiter to come in and declare to that  government and to the world how deplorable the conditions are.   I never dreamed there would be a moment when I would need to ask the  International Red Cross to review our own detention facilities in the  United States. What brings me to this point? Well, it is well  publicized in the press.  [[Page S4482]]  There is a New York Times story of June 21. Let me read it.         A chaotic scene of sickness and filth is unfolding in an       overcrowded border station in Clint, Tex., where hundreds of       young people who have recently crossed the border are being       held, according to lawyers who visited the facility this       week. Some of the children have been there for nearly a       month.        Children as young as 7 and 8, many of them wearing clothes       caked with snot and tears, are caring for infants they've       just met, the lawyer said. Toddlers without diapers are       relieving themselves in their pants. Teenage mothers are       wearing clothes stained with breast milk.        Most of the young detainees have not been able to shower or       wash their clothes since they arrived at facility. They have       no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap.    ``There is a stench,'' said Elora Mukherjee, director of the  Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School. . . . ``The  overwhelming majority of children have not bathed since they crossed  the border.''   I might find that hard to believe had I not seen for myself, at the  El Paso border crossing, what is happening. Albeit, it was several  weeks ago, but the circumstances described in this article on June 21  mirror what I saw in El Paso.   Let me say at the outset and very clearly say that many of the men  and women in the Border Patrol, Customs and Border Protection, are  good, caring people who come from families themselves and privately  have told me how heartbreaking these circumstances are. I am not going  to make excuses for any wrongdoing by any of them or any Federal  agency. I wouldn't try. But I do want to concede the point that there  are many who want to do better but don't have the resources to do it.   So why aren't we doing more here? Why, in this empty Chamber, isn't  the Senate coming together and working on a solution? We came up with  over $400 million in February--a special appropriation for humanitarian  purposes at the border supported on a bipartisan basis.   Last week, we reported a bill out of the Senate Appropriations  Committee 31 to 1 to appropriate $4.6 billion to come down and do  something about the circumstance at the border, a humanitarian response  and more. I supported it. Most have supported it on both sides of the  aisle. It is time to enact it and do it as quickly as possible. I stand  ready for that to happen as quickly as we can schedule it.   In the meantime, we need to ask the basic question: How have we  reached this point in this country? How have we reached the point when  it comes to immigration that it is such a national embarrassment?   Take a look at the record of this administration in 2\1/2\ years. As  you tick off the items of major policy decisions, you can find how we  reached this point today.   Remember the first one, the Muslim travel ban? We were banning people  from Muslim countries from coming into the United States.   Not too long after, this President decided he was going to eliminate  DACA--a program that allowed 800,000 young people in this country a  chance to live here without fear of deportation.   Then he turned around and eliminated the status of several hundred  thousand in the United States who were in temporary protected status  because they were escaping emergencies, crises in their own countries  and natural disasters.   He followed that up with the notion of zero tolerance. Remember zero  tolerance? Remember when Attorney General Sessions quoted the Bible,  for goodness' sake, as his justification for separating infants,  toddlers, and children from their mothers and fathers at the border?  Zero tolerance.   Finally, a Federal court judge in San Diego said: Enough. I want to  know who those children are, and I want to know where they are and  where their parents are.   It was a common thing to ask. It sounds like an easy request, doesn't  it? It turns out we didn't keep records. These kids were separated from  their parents without a record of where they were going or where the  parents were going. It took weeks, if not months, and still we can't  resolve the whereabouts of some of those families who were separated.   Then came the President's decision that he announced by tweet a week  ago that he was going to engage in mass arrests and mass deportations  in the United States. Do you know what that means? It means children  will be coming home from school to empty homes and wondering where Mom  and Dad are. They are gone, you know. They have been deported. The fact  that they have lived here for a number of years, had no problems with  the law, and are part of the community, and the fact that those  children and others in the household may be citizens doesn't seem to be  important to this administration.    When we come down to it, we have reached a point when it comes to  immigration--a stage I have not seen in modern times--where we are  being inundated at the border and are in complete chaos here in the  United States under the Trump administration. Oh, this President  promised us when he was elected that he was going to get tough. Boy, he  sure knows how to get tough. He doesn't know how to get effective. He  doesn't know how to cope with something as terrible as the  disintegration of the economies and social justice system in three  Central American countries that leads people to cash in everything they  own on Earth to give it to a transporter or smuggler to take them and  their kids to the border. That is where we are. That is why we need to  act.   First, we need humanitarian assistance--yes, count me in; the sooner  the better--to put diapers on these babies, to give them basic  foodstuffs, perhaps clean clothes. That is not too much to ask this  great United States of America.   Secondly, let's come up with an approach on Central America that  makes sense. Swearing at them, tweeting at them, saying you are going  to cut off all assistance to them hasn't worked very well, has it, Mr.  President?   I found out at the border that smugglers use the President's tough  talk to sell their case: You better get moving. He is going to get  tougher. He is going to build a wall. You better get moving. And in  panic, they do. This approach is not working. It is clear that it is  not working.   Finally, haven't we reached a point in the United States of America  where we know we need comprehensive immigration reform? I was part of  that effort 6 or 7 years ago. There were four Democrats and four  Republican Senators. We sat for months--myself, John McCain, Chuck  Schumer, Bob Menendez, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake, and  Michael Bennet. We sat for months every night working on another aspect  of immigration reform. We put together not a good bill--I think it was  a great bill. There was a lot of compromise in it that I didn't like,  but that is what happens when you sit down across the table and in good  faith try to resolve your differences.   We brought it to the floor of the Senate and got 68 votes in the  Senate. Democrats and Republicans said they are for comprehensive  immigration reform. As Senator Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican,  said a few weeks ago, if we had passed that bill and made it the law,  we wouldn't be facing the mess we are facing today. He is right to a  great degree. I don't think it would have solved all the problems, but  it sure would have solved a lot of them.   What happened to that bill after it passed the Senate with 68 votes?  It died in the House. The Republican House refused to even consider it.  So here we sit with this mess on our hands, with a President who tweets  at people and threatens mass arrests and mass deportation. And the  situation goes from bad to worse, to even worse, to embarrassing when  it comes to the treatment of children.   We can do better as a nation, this Nation of immigrants which I am  proud to be part of. This Nation of immigrants has absorbed people from  around the world in a systematic, orderly way in the past, and we can  do it again.   We need border security. No one should come in this country if we  don't know who they are and what they are bringing in.   Secondly, we cannot accept everyone who wants to come to America. It  has to be done in an orderly, thoughtful way.   Third, we should never accept anyone coming into this country who is  a danger, period. If they are here undocumented and dangerous, they  should leave, period.  [[Page S4483]]    Having said that, don't we all agree on that? Can't we move forward  in a constructive, bipartisan way to solve this problem, to end this  embarrassment? Once and for all, we have to say to the President that  tweets are not enough.   What this reporter saw, what she reported as stench on the border, is  something that should be an embarrassment to all of us. We are better  than that. We need to prove it.   I yield the floor.
