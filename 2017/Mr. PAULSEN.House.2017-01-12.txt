 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week we observed National  Human Trafficking Awareness Day, and we continue to shine a light on  this modern form of slavery. As a part of that effort, I am  cosponsoring the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act, which is the next  step in helping the victims of human trafficking.   The heinous practice of human trafficking exploits young girls and  boys. These victims are oftentimes our most vulnerable and are taken  advantage of by those with no regard for their well-being. The  Trafficking Survivors Relief Act will allow victims to petition courts  to have their criminal records cleared of nonviolent offenses that were  committed as a direct result of being trapped in human trafficking. It  is a very important step, Mr. Speaker, in helping these individuals get  the opportunity to return to living fulfilling lives on their own terms  and getting the fresh start that they deserve.   No man, woman, girl, or boy should ever be subjected to sex  trafficking. We must remain vigilant in our fight against this crime  and ensure that the victims receive the support and resources they need  because, together, we can stop human trafficking.                            ____________________
