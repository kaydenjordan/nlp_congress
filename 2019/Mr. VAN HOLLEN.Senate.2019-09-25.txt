 Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to urge  adoption of two resolutions that are going to be considered by the U.S.  Senate, instructing the conferees to the NDAA bill, which is the  Defense authorization bill. One of those motions urges the conferees,  or directs the conferees, to adopt bipartisan legislation introduced by  Senator Cotton, who is now the Presiding Officer in the Chair, and me  and others. It is called the 5G act, and it deals with Defending  America's 5G Future Act. What it does, very simply, is codify the Trump  administration's Executive order putting Huawei on what is called the  entity list and then making sure that before there is a change to this,  if you wanted to take them off entirely, that would require a  congressional action. But it also says that if you want to seek waivers  under that act, you should come to Congress and at least give Congress  the opportunity to disagree. This is very important to protect our  security, to protect U.S. technology from theft. I urge my colleagues  to support that resolution.                                  DETER Act    Mr. President, I am also here to urge my colleagues to support  another resolution. This one is directing the conferees to the Defense  authorization bill to support a motion and resolutions put forward by  Senator Rubio and me and others--again, a bipartisan resolution, making  it clear that we should deter foreign interference in U.S. elections.  It is based on the principles of bipartisan legislation, a bipartisan  act that we have introduced called the DETER Act. The idea is very  simple, which is this: We want to say up front that our intelligence  communities, or others in the administration, should inform Congress  immediately if there has been interference in our elections. If the  answer is yes, that would trigger immediate and stiff sanctions on  whatever foreign government is acting to interfere in our elections.   We can spend a lot of money and resources protecting our election  infrastructure and our election systems, and we should do that. We can  urge all of the social media companies to improve their platforms and  make it more difficult for foreign governments and adversaries to use  those platforms to influence and impact our elections.   None of those measures actually impose a big cost on a foreign  government  [[Page S5692]]  like Russia for interfering in our elections. All those things do is  make it harder, and we should make it harder. In this case, the best  defense is a good offense, meaning the best defense to having a foreign  government interfering in our elections is to discourage and deter them  from doing that in the first place.   Right now, what we have learned is there is no cost to Vladimir Putin  and the Russians for interfering in our elections. In fact, they assess  that they get a significant benefit from creating division within the  United States. If you are Vladimir Putin and you are doing a cost  benefit analysis--should I interfere in the U.S. elections or not?--you  conclude: Hey, I am going to gain something by creating this kind of  division and confusion within the United States. What we should be  doing is saying in advance and up front to Vladimir Putin and Russia or  any other foreign leader or government, if we catch you interfering in  our elections, you will definitely pay a price in the form of sanctions  against some of your financial institutions or key aspects of your  economic sector. We need to spell that out in advance.   This resolution requires that Congress be notified after the election  as to whether we have detected foreign interference. Next time, someone  like Vladimir Putin will know in advance that if we catch them, there  will be a price to pay, a penalty to pay. That will, of course,  discourage the activity in the first place.   It doesn't cost us a dime to do this. Yes, we should continue to  spend money, as I said, to harden our systems at home and better defend  ourselves. For goodness' sake, we should at least take the position  that we are going to let foreign powers know in advance, if we catch  you--and by the way, we will catch you if you interfere in our  elections--there will be an immediate and severe price to pay.   I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution. It is  appropriate that we are directing the conferees to the National Defense  Authorization Act to include this provision because, after all, the  reason we invest in our defense is to protect our country and to  protect our democracy. That bill should include a provision telling  foreign powers: If you mess around and interfere in our Democratic  elections, you will pay a price. That will make it less likely they  will do so to begin with.   I urge adoption of the resolution.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
