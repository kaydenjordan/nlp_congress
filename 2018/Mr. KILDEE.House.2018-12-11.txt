 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of Don  Krzysiak.   Don and his family are longtime members of the Bay City community.  Sadly, he passed away on Friday, after a battle with pancreatic cancer.  He is survived by his wife, Lois, and their children, Tom, Donnie, and  Melanie.   Don founded Krzysiak's House Restaurant in 1979, with just a handful  of employees, and grew it into the successful Bay City business that it  is today. In fact, the very first event after I announced I was running  for Congress was at Krzysiak's. He welcomed me with open arms and made  me feel welcome in the neighborhood.   I remember always buying paczkis from Don on Fat Tuesday. Every year,  [[Page H10039]]  all the money he made from those sales was donated to the Salvation  Army.   Don was not just a small-business owner, but also an important part  of our community. He helped people struggling to find employment and  supported people coming out of jail trying to start a new life.   Everyone who knew him at the family restaurant described him as more  than a boss, but everybody's friend. He loved to spend time with his  family and in his neighborhood, and he loved to listen to polka music.   Before opening the restaurant, he served in the U.S. Army. His  commitment to our country will always be remembered.   Mid-Michigan lost a great friend and a bright spirit this week. The  entire State of Michigan, the Bay City community, and I, personally,  will miss him.   Thank you, Don, for everything you have done.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House join me in a brief moment of  silence in Don's memory.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1165, condemning the  Assad regime and its backers for their continued support of war crimes  and crimes against humanity in Syria: nearly half a million Syrians  killed, 14 million Syrians displaced, and countless acts of atrocities  from the Assad regime supported by its backers in Iran and in Russia.  Clearly, it is right that Congress takes this step and acts.   This resolution urges a political solution to this conflict, to  ensure the Assad regime cannot use the air to target its own civilians.   This resolution brings much-needed attention to the atrocities of  this regime, which is responsible for horrific crimes, again, against  its own people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their hard work and advocacy  for this resolution that seeks to hold this regime accountable, and I  urge my colleagues to pass this legislation. It shines a bright light  on what is happening in Syria and the crimes committed by the Assad  regime, along with its backers in Russia and in Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this resolution, and, again, I  thank my colleagues for their work on this effort.
