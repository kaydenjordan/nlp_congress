 Mr. President, it would be hard to put into words  what Mabel Desmond meant to me, to her family, to her community, or to  the State of Maine.   To say that Mabel put service into every part of who she was is an  understatement. I knew Mabel for her dedication to her constituents in  Aroostook County and for relentlessly seeking what she felt would be in  the greater good of the State. That same quality applied to her life as  a mother, as a teacher, and as a friend. Her determination to make a  difference echoed throughout her life in countless ways. She knew that  one person striving to do the right things and being kind mattered.   Mabel's distinguished political career from 1994-2002 was during the  same time I served as Maine's Governor. It was clear right away that  she was a serious lawmaker; not one that would just go along with a  plan, not one who made any assumptions, and not one that could be  intimidated.   I grew to deeply admire her conviction over the years but never so  much as when she was the lone voice on the education committee who  would support the Maine Learning Technology Initiative ``laptop''  program, keeping the idea alive in the face of almost overwhelming  opposition. This act of courage on an idea I was passionate about as  Governor--and still so proud of today--has made an immense difference  for now decades of Maine students. As a teacher, she ``got it,'' and  the respect which her colleagues in the legislature had for her was a  key factor in the passage of the program. So many success stories of  kids who were able to pursue their dreams, all because of Mabel's  unshakable belief in a better future.   Mabel was my friend, someone I looked up to, someone who taught me  the value of thoughtful decision making. I will be forever grateful to  have known and worked with her and will miss her dearly.                            ____________________
