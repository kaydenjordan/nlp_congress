 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Freedom High  School of Woodbridge, Virginia, for winning its second straight  Virginia Class 6 State football title.   Last Saturday, Freedom defeated Highland Springs in a hard-fought  championship game. The Eagles won by a score of 42-34 to claim the  title, making them the first Prince William County high school to win  back-to-back State titles since 1999.   This win capped off an undefeated season for Freedom, and the Eagles  extended their winning streak to an incredible 29 games.   As the Representative for Virginia's Seventh District, I officially  congratulate Freedom High School's players and coaches, including head  coach Darryl Overton. I also congratulate the parents and faculty for  supporting these players and student athletes and guiding them through  a perfect season.   Today, on the House floor of the United States House of  Representatives, I proudly join my colleagues in recognizing the  remarkable accomplishments of the Freedom High School Eagles of  Woodbridge, Virginia.                            ____________________
