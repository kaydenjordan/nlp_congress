 Mr. Speaker, it used to be California was the land of  really good ideas and innovation, but the last 30 or so years it has  been a place where a lot of really bad ideas come from and impact the  rest of the country.   This morning I am talking about pork production in this country and  California deciding that it should dictate to the rest of the country  how it is done. There is not even that much pork produced in my home  State, yet they want to dictate how it works.   A proposition passed that says you cannot use gestation crates for  pork production. Gestation crates help piglets to not be squashed by  their mother, but it has been interpreted to be something completely  different.   We need H.R. 4417, the EATS Act, in order to have pork production in  this country that isn't dictated by some crazies at Berkeley in  California that say we can't have you produce like that.   We have already went through this with eggs. What this will produce  is shortages of eggs, shortages of pork, higher prices, and even  possibly lead to the importation of it because one State trying to  dictate and reach across State lines to all of the others with its  tentacles of its crazy ideas on how things should be done business- wise.   What will stop them from banning oil and gas being used to produce  things in other States? It will keep going and going until we stop it.                            ____________________
