 Mr. Speaker, this week marks 49 years since the  landmark Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade, 49 years since the  choice won over life in the eyes of the American people.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle applaud Roe v. Wade and  have no problem with the more than 62 million innocent babies who have  been aborted since 1973.   I, however, find these numbers to be sickening.   These children are just as worthy of life as a fully grown adult is.  They are created in the image of God just as you and I are, and their  lives should not be carelessly and despicably destroyed.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle preach and parade human  rights.   But where is the outrage for equal human rights for the unborn?   It is frighteningly nonexistent, and their lack of consistency makes  it very clear what their priorities are.   How can you claim to care for one life when you don't care for all  lives, no matter how small?                            ____________________
