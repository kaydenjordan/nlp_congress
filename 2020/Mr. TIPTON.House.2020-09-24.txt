 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Don Coram of Montrose,  Colorado.   Don was born in Montrose and raised in a farming and ranching family.  He has been married to his wife, Dianna, for 53 years. Together, they  have a son, Dee.   Don's agricultural background provided him with a thorough  understanding of the unique needs of the communities on the Western  Slope that led him to be a successful businessman and a well-respected  elected official.   Don began his career in public service first as a county  commissioner, later serving in the Colorado State House and, most  recently, as a Colorado State senator.   At the Colorado Capitol, he has extensive influence in crafting  legislation to preserve and to protect water rights, bringing resources  to local agencies to more effectively prevent and combat wildfires and  revitalize investment into Main Streets across the State. Don  consistently works with his colleagues across the aisle on commonsense  policies, which has earned him high remarks from legislators from all  four corners of the State.                                time  0945    Don's leadership, experience, and knowledge of rural interests and  needs have helped him to advance legislation that have no doubt  improved the lives of thousands of families and businesses and  communities throughout western Colorado.   While he would never admit it, Don is a role model for others. For  decades, he has selflessly supported local causes by serving on the  school board, the Delta-Montrose Vocational Center, volunteering for  nonprofits, and actively participating with several other local  organizations.   Don's efforts to serve his community reach all the way to Washington.  He has been a trusted adviser to me on numerous pieces of legislation  and always puts thoughtful consideration in any time I ask for his  input. Don has been a great leader for the Third District during my  tenure in Congress, and he is personally a good and loyal friend.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to give my utmost praise to Don for his  compassionate service to our great State and the Nation over the years,  and I wish him and his wife, Dianna, the best as they continue their  work to be able to improve the quality of life in communities  throughout the West Slope.                            Honoring Dianna Coram     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dianna Coram of  Montrose, Colorado, for her lifelong service to her community and to  the State of Colorado.   Born during the middle of a blizzard on her grandfather's farm,  Dianna is a third-generation Coloradan who truly embodies the unique  spirit of western Colorado.   Dianna has been a loving wife for over 53 years to her husband, Don,  with whom they have one son, Dee. Her husband, Don, noted to me that,  of those 53 years, 35 of those years have been happy.   Dianna spent most of her adult life building a reputation as a  respected figure in Delta and Montrose, where she spends much of her  time strengthening and improving her community through her dedicated  volunteer work with nonprofits, the local school, county fairs, and  organizations such as the Dolphin House, the Boys & Girls Club,  Downtown Improvement Group, the San Juan Cancer Center, and currently  serves as the Third Congressional District representative on the  Colorado State Fair Board.   Dianna's reputation reaches far beyond the West Slope. If you visit  the Colorado State Capitol and mention the name Dianna Coram,  legislators and staff from both sides of the aisle will give a smile  and be quick to share a story of her.   Dianna is always front and center in the political arena within the  Third District, where she has been active since the young age of 14. It  was then she could very well have been the only person of her age to be  found walking the streets of Montrose with a ``Barry Goldwater for  President'' sign.   A few years back, when the Montrose Chapter of Republican Women's  future was at stake, Dianna stepped forward as soon as their president  resigned. Since then, her work has paid dividends, where, just this  past year, it was the only chapter in Colorado to receive the Gold  Achievement Award.   Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to recognize Dianna for her hard  work for her community. Like so many others who have had the privilege  to be able to know her, I will always be grateful for her friendship to  my wife, Jean, and me.   Her service to the State of Colorado and the Third Congressional  District is truly appreciated by so many who have gotten to know her  over the years. I stand with the residents of Montrose in  congratulating Dianna for her achievements, and I look forward to her  continued success as a community leader.                            ____________________
