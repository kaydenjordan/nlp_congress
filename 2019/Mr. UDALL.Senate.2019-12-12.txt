 Mr. President, I rise to discuss Congress's ongoing  failure to assert our constitutional war powers. This failure is the  root cause of two pressing concerns that we currently face: first, the  seemingly endless U.S. involvement in Middle East wars; and, second,  the very real possibility that the Trump administration will involve us  in more of them.   The Founders were clear in their intent. The Constitution squarely  places the authority to ``declare war''--that is the phrase in the  Constitution--and places it clearly with Congress and Congress alone.  The Founders did this for good reason. For centuries, European monarchs  had drained royal coffers, levied heavy taxes, and lost countless lives  in wars that benefited themselves and not the people.   As Elbridge Gerry from Massachusetts said during the Constitutional  Convention, after another delegate suggested giving this war power to  the President: ``[I] never expected to hear in a republic a motion to  empower the Executive alone to declare war.''   The Founders vested this most consequential power in the legislative  branch so that any decision to go to war would have broad public  support. Since the Republic's beginning, there has been a tension  between the Congress and the executive branch regarding the use of this  power.   In the modern era, the balance has been upended. Our ability and  willingness to effectively check the Executive on war powers is  dangerously diminished. Congress has not declared war for any of our  major conflicts since World War II. But after the bloody, prolonged,  and politically divisive Vietnam War, Congress passed a War Powers  Resolution of 1973, overriding the veto of President Nixon. That  resolution requires Congress to issue an authorization for use of  military force, or an AUMF.   Immediately after 9/11, a nearly unanimous Congress--myself  included--authorized force against the perpetrators, al-Qaida and those  who harbored them, by which we meant the Taliban government in  Afghanistan. The 2001 AUMF authorized the United States' entering  conflict in Afghanistan to root out al-Qaida.   The Taliban was then expelled from power. Al-Qaida in Afghanistan has  been defeated. Osama Bin Laden is dead. And the now 18-year-old AUMF  has outlived its purpose, as a stunning Washington Post expose on the  Afghan war has now made clear.   The war in Afghanistan is the longest in U.S. history, but it no  longer has a clear purpose. The Washington Post successfully sued for  access to previously undisclosed government documents, dubbed the  ``Afghanistan Papers.'' These 2,000 pages of interviews and memos from  senior military, diplomatic, and White House officials tell a shocking  and tragic story. Three separate administrations have had no well- formed mission for the war but fought on anyway and repeatedly misled  the American people.   According to the head of the NATO command in Afghanistan in 2006,  ``there was no coherent long-term strategy there.'' The next NATO  commander, Army LTG Dan McNeill said:         I tried to get someone to define for me what winning meant,       even before I went over, and nobody could. Nobody would give       me a good definition of what it meant. . . . There was no       NATO campaign plan--a lot of verbiage and talk, but no plan.    A senior diplomat under President Obama said:         If I were to write a book, its [cover] would be: ``America       goes to war without knowing why it does.''    Over and over, senior officials describe the lack of strategic goals.  All the while, the government lied to the American people, claiming  success when there was none.   This war has cost 157,000 lives, more than 775,000 American troops  have been deployed, 2,300 American military personnel have been killed,  and more than 20,000 have been wounded. It has cost the American people  over $2 trillion--$2 trillion. These costs are tragic, inexcusable, and  it is time for this war to end.   The executive branch isn't the only branch at fault. Congress has sat  back and let the Executives stretch the AUMF to the point of breaking.  We have ducked the debates. We have ducked the hard votes. We need to  change that, and we can start with Afghanistan.   In March, Senator Paul and I introduced the American Forces Going  Home After Noble Service Act. This act would responsibly pull our  troops out of Afghanistan. The act declares victory in Afghanistan,  acknowledging that the original objectives have largely been met. It  sets guidelines for the safe and orderly withdrawal of troops, and it  repeals the 2001 AUMF once and for all. We should have a vote on this.   Afghanistan is just the largest of our ongoing Middle Eastern wars.  The 9/11 AUMF has been used to justify military ventures all around the  world--41 times to justify military action in 14 countries. I voted for  this authorization, and I know full well that Congress did not intend  that. More unauthorized conflicts are looming on the horizon.   I was encouraged earlier this year when the House passed--and a  majority  [[Page S7020]]  of the Senate supported--my amendment to prohibit war with Iran absent  congressional authorization.   Tensions with Iran have grown since the President withdrew from the  international agreement preventing Iran from developing nuclear  weapons. It has been a year and a half since the President dropped out  of the agreement, claiming he could get a ``better deal'' and mounting  his ``maximum pressure'' strategy. Since then, we haven't gotten  anywhere close to a better deal, but we have gotten much closer to war.   This June we were 10 minutes away from the President's calling a  strike on Iran, 10 minutes away from military escalation in the Gulf.  While the President's maximum pressure campaign has not succeeded in  forcing Iran into a better deal, it has succeeded in pushing Iran to  breach the nuclear agreement, and it has led to a cycle of violence in  the region and from Iran, attacking commercial ships in the Gulf of  Oman, moving short-range ballistic missiles into Iraq, and threatening  U.S. troops in Israel.   Since May, the President has increased troop presence by 14,000 in  the Middle East, and after initially denying it, the Pentagon is  considering sending an additional 14,000 troops. The risk of war with  Iran is very real, whether intentionally or by mistake, miscalculation,  or misjudgment. And the President claims he can go to war against Iran  without congressional approval.   In September, this body held a historic vote, voting 50 to 40 to  include the Udall-Kaine-Paul amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act to prohibit funding for war with Iran without  congressional authorization. We took a giant step forward to assert our  constitutional authority.   This amendment was germane and by rule it should have been included  in the final Senate NDAA, but the majority leader forced a 60-vote  threshold that should not have been applied. Nevertheless, the House  version did include the prohibition, and with Senate majority support,  it should have been included in the conference.   This week, the Senate and the House conference committee just  released their NDAA conference report. I am deeply disappointed that  they did not include our amendment. This is a major missed opportunity  to take back our authority and a missed opportunity to stop expansion  of war and U.S. interventionism in the Middle East. Another terribly  missed opportunity is the NDAA's failure to include a provision to  eliminate U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's disastrous war in Yemen.   Under the authority of the 2001 AUMF, our troops are supporting Saudi  Arabia in its war against the insurgent Houthi, but the Houthi are also  fighting al-Qaida, the actual target of the AUMF. We are fighting a  group fighting against al-Qaida. This is a prime example of the misuse  of this authorization.    The human cost is horrific. Since 2015, more than 100,000 people have  been killed in Yemen, including more than 12,000 Yemeni citizens. More  than 20 million Yemenis need humanitarian aid. There is no compelling  U.S. national security interest in aiding the Saudis in this war. We  should not be lending support to a war that the international community  recognizes as a humanitarian disaster.   In April, both Houses voted on a bipartisan basis to remove our  troops from this conflict unless Congress authorized force. The  President vetoed that bipartisan bill. The NDAA conference committee  missed an opportunity to step up and direct the President to take us  out of the Saudi-Yemen conflict. Again, Congress is ducking its duties.  For too long, Congress has hidden from making the hard decisions, from  taking the tough votes. We have deferred to the Executive under  Republican and Democratic administrations alike. The Founders placed  this power in our hands for a good reason. Those reasons are as sound  today as they were two centuries ago.   This is not a political issue. It is not a red or blue issue. It is  not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is a constitutional issue. It  goes to the core of our Constitution and our war powers in the  legislative branch in Congress. Everyone here has sworn to uphold the  Constitution. We can do so by upholding, not running from, our  constitutional responsibilities.   I yield the floor.
