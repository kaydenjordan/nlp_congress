 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  solidarity with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to  speak out against voter suppression. Voter suppression is a serious  issue that threatens the integrity of our elections. While the  Congressional Black Caucus members have highlighted their numerous  concerns, we should all be deeply involved in combating voter  suppression and expanding access to the polls for all Americans-- particularly in the wake of the destructive ruling in Shelby County v.  Holder.   When fellow Texan and former President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed  the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, our country was in the midst of  wrestling with literacy tests, the purging of voter rolls, and  intimidation by those who wished to keep minorities and other  vulnerable segments of the population from casting their ballots at the  polls. It was a difficult time in our nation's history, but one that we  seemingly overcame together in a broad recognition that all Americans  should have equal access to the polls. The positive effects of the  Voting Rights Act grew quickly apparent.  [[Page H5911]]    Following passage of the VRA, nearly 1 million black voters  registered to vote within just four years, including over fifty percent  of the black voting age population in every southern state. We  witnessed the number of black elected officials in the South more than  double, from 72 to 159, following the 1966 elections. By the mid-1980s,  there were more African Americans in public office across the South  than throughout the rest of the nation combined.   More than fifty years later, we are once again faced with the same  fight under a different, more sinister guise. The United States Supreme  Court's decision in Shelby v. Holder has brought our nation back to our  darkest times in history. Discrimination on the basis of race is a  persistent reality throughout many localities in states once protected  by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act--including my home state of  Texas. Absent these protections, many voters are at risk of losing  their fundamental right to vote.   On May 11, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order that would  create an ``election integrity'' commission. The stated purpose of this  commission was to combat voter fraud, but we know the true meaning  behind an executive order of this nature. It is to repeat the egregious  mistakes of our past and once again prevent legitimate voters from  exercising their constitutional rights to vote.   Mr. Speaker, the concerns of the Congressional Black Caucus and the  concerns of countless Americans are worthy of our time in Congress. We  must speak out against thinly-veiled commissions meant to suppress the  vote. We must bolster the Voting Rights Act to its former power and  encourage others to combat voter suppression and protect unfettered  access to the ballot.                            ____________________
