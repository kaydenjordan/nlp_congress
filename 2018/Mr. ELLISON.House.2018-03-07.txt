 Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today and the  people  [[Page H1451]]  of the United States because America needs universal, single-payer  healthcare. We spend more--over $9,000 per person--on healthcare than  any other nation in the world.   But for all that money, Mr. Speaker, we still have tens of millions  of uninsured. We have the highest infant mortality rate of any wealthy  nation on Earth, and we are last, last, in life expectancy among  wealthy countries.   Mr. Speaker, in a few moments I expect to ask for unanimous consent  that I may hereafter be considered the first sponsor of H.R. 676, the  Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act. The bill was originally  introduced by my friend, John Conyers. I have his support in picking up  the mantle where he left it and for the purposes of adding cosponsors  and requesting reprintings. I will do that in a moment.   But, Mr. Speaker, the money that we are spending on healthcare isn't  going to the patients; it isn't going to the surgeons. It is going to  the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry, who are raking  in record profits every day and are the major beneficiaries of our  policy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 676, the  Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act, a bill originally introduced  by Representative John Conyers from Michigan, for the purposes of  adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of  rule XII.
