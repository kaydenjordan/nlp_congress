 Madam Speaker, there is a border crisis. Let's just face  it. President Biden even slipped over the weekend and said it was a  crisis. Then the White House had to pull it back. When thousands of  people are crossing the border each and every day, it is a humanitarian  crisis, it is a health crisis, and it is a national security crisis  because we now know that at least a couple of the people that they  caught were on the terrorist watch list.   Just yesterday, the Governor of Arizona declared a State emergency  and sent National Guard to help our law enforcement in our border  communities. You know what the Customs and Border Patrol did under the  Biden administration? They dropped off 16 people, including kids, in  the middle of a park in a small community 80 miles north of the border,  Gila Bend, Arizona.   They don't have a shelter; they don't have a hospital there. They  have nothing. The mayor and his wife had to borrow a van to transport  these people to a Phoenix shelter. Now, what kind of President does  that?   If this happened, if these unaccompanied children were just left to  be handled by cartels, by a U.S. citizen, that U.S. citizen would be  charged with child abuse and be in prison right now. This is  unconscionable, and it needs to stop now.
