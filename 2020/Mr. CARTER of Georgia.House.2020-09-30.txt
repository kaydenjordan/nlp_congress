 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor a great American.   Mr. Royce Everett Carter of Blackshear, Georgia, passed away on  September 12 at the age of 85.   Royce was born and raised in Georgia, and he lived in Pierce County  for the past 52 years.   Committed to improving transportation and infrastructure in the State  of Georgia, he had worked for the Georgia Department of Transportation  as a project engineer for the State Highway Department until his  retirement.   Royce worked on several projects with T.R. Long Engineering over the  years, including the Royce E. Carter roundabout on New School Road,  which was dedicated to the work he did throughout his life to improve  his community.   He was a steadfast public servant who was always looking for  opportunities to improve the lives around him.   In his limited free time, he enjoyed golf, and took his appreciation  for it to new heights when he served on the board of the Lakeview Golf  Club and eventually became president.   Royce loved his friends, his family, his community, and his church  dearly, and he used every opportunity to make the most of the time he  spent on this Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the life he lived, and I know his  legacy will continue for years to come.   I know that every time I drive the Royce E. Carter roundabout, I will  remember the impact he made on Georgia's First Congressional District.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 209.
