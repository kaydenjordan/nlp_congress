 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the passage of  the Every Student Succeeds Act, which President Obama signed into law 4  years ago yesterday.   When I came to Congress, updating the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act was one of my top priorities, and I was proud to stand  with President Obama on the day that we finally left behind No Child  Left Behind.   More than 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law, and he said ESEA  represents a major new commitment of the Federal Government to quality  and equality in the schooling that we offer our young people.   I agree with President Johnson. When we promote and realize equity in  education, when we expand and invest in educational opportunities, we  can improve outcomes for all students at all levels.   Reauthorizing ESEA in 2015 was meant to put us closer to achieving  that equality envisioned in the original law, but there is still much  work to be done.   ESSA created new opportunities to make sure that all students,  regardless of their race, color, national origin, ZIP Code, or family  wealth, could have an equal opportunity to obtain a high-quality public  education.   It returned flexibility and autonomy to States and districts to set  high standards for all students, to evaluate schools using multiple  measures of student learning, and to design systems for identifying  schools in need of additional support.   With provisions I championed, States were also given the ability to  eliminate unnecessary or duplicative testing and access to resources  for fewer, better quality assessments. Importantly, the Every Student  Succeeds Act put more emphasis on well-rounded education that prepares  students to be creative, critical thinkers.   Since ESSA's passage, I have worked hard with appropriators to make  sure Congress fulfills the commitments made in this law with robust  funding of Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants.   As we continue to implement this law, strong Federal accountability  and support are necessary to make sure that the flexibility and  autonomy that States and districts now have is used to identify and  close achievement gaps, rather than to shirk responsibility to  students. We know there is more work to be done in that area, as well.   Unfortunately, the current Department of Education is more focused on  privatizing education than on making sure that the States fully  implement the law. They are not holding States accountable for  improving outcomes of disadvantaged students. This is most noticeable  in the Department's approval of State plans that ignore the performance  of subgroups altogether and the lack of guidance and regulation  available to help States implement the Every Student Succeeds Act.   As we reflect on passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act and the  opportunities it provides, I urge the Department of Education and  Secretary DeVos to support States and hold them accountable for  implementing this law with fidelity. My colleagues on the Education and  Labor Committee will continue our robust oversight of the Department's  implementation to make sure that the Every Student Succeeds Act  fulfills a promise we made to all students when President Obama signed  it into law.                            ____________________
