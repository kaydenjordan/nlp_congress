 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  continuing resolution to responsibly keep  [[Page H4926]]  the government open for 45 days. Shutting down the government should be  a last resort. My priority has always been to protect and represent my  constituents to the best of my ability, and I cannot justify shutting  down our entire government over obscure policy decisions.   Government shutdowns have real consequences on American lives. My dad  was an enlisted master sergeant in the Air Force, my mom had a GED, and  they both worked. My dad often had extra jobs on the weekend. I grew up  watching my dad at the kitchen table calculating how long it would take  to mail a bill so that the bill would get there after his one single  paycheck a month came in. Every single month, I watched that. He knew  exactly how many days it took.   A lapse in pay for these individuals means going without food. These  are real people that would be affected by the political games both  sides in Washington are playing.   To our nearly 10,000 hardworking Iowans in our district that work for  the Federal Government and are out of work, from heads of departments  to law enforcement officers to cafeteria workers to the Iowa National  Guard men and women who are protecting our southern border, I assure  you that I will remain steadfastly committed to keeping the government  open because at the end of the day I know your bills are still due.
