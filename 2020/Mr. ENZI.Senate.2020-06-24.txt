 Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the distinguished  career and retirement of Kim Cawley after 34 years of service at the  Congressional Budget Office. Kim has been Chief of the Natural and  Physical Resources Cost Estimates Unit for more than 20 of those years,  also spent over a decade as one of CBO's energy analysts. He is one of  that agency's experts on the Nuclear Waste Fund, the treatment of  Federal loans and loan guarantees, and the budgetary effects of Federal  insurance programs.   It is hard to overstate Kim's role in analyzing the budgetary impacts  of an incredibly broad swath of legislation over the past three  decades. He has been instrumental in providing objective, carefully  researched estimates of thousands of pieces of legislation that the  Congress has considered, debated, and enacted since the mid-1980,  including bills dealing with flood insurance, compensation for victims  of asbestos and oilspills, Federal property sales, and infrastructure  financing, to name just a few.   Kim has worked tirelessly with Members of Congress and our staff on  both sides of the aisle throughout those years. During many hours of  discussion and patient explanation, he could be counted on to be  forthright and fair. He embodied CBO's commitment to nonpartisan  analysis and helped the Congress understand the intricacies of such  complex laws as the Federal Credit Reform Act, the Terrorism Risk  Insurance Act, and the 9-11 Victims Compensation Act.   Kim has been a mentor and guide to dozens of CBO analysts. Thanks to  his  [[Page S3203]]  guidance and training, a generation of CBO analysts think harder, dig  deeper, and ask more probing questions when analyzing the estimated the  costs of legislation. Kim set high standards for himself and for the  Natural Resources Unit, and we are confident that they will continue to  provide timely and thorough analyses for the Congress thanks to what  they have learned under Kim's leadership.   I, along with House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, wish to  thank Kim for his years of dedicated service to the Congress and extend  to him our best wishes for a well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
