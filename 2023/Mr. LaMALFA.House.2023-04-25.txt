 Mr. Speaker, since January, Democrats and the President  have tried to falsely claim that House Republicans have no plan  regarding the Nation's debt ceiling crisis.   This week, we released our plan. As always, House Republicans have  consistently argued for reasonable, responsible debt limit increases  coupled with spending cuts.   Every debt limit debate in this body has been achieved via  compromise. It is absurd to think that our Democrat colleagues now  demand unilateral increases to our Nation's debt and balk at  Republicans for asking for something in return.   Our plan, the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, will save the American  taxpayers $4.5 trillion over the next decade. We will limit Federal  spending to fiscal year 2022 levels, which our government operated on  just 4 months ago.   In exchange, we will allow for a 1 percent annual growth in Federal  spending over the next 10 years, which is a compromise.    Included in the bill are clawbacks for around $60 billion in unspent  COVID funds. The pandemic is over, and this money that has not been  spent should be rescinded without delay.   Also included in the bill is our Lower Energy Costs Act, which has  already passed this Chamber with bipartisan support, lowering energy  costs for American families.   House Republicans' plan is economically sound, financially wise, and  still allows for a debt limit increase of $1.5 trillion. This is a  reasonable and responsible plan that will benefit all Americans.                            ____________________
