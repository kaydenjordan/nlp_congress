 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to call  attention to the tragedies that have been caused by gun violence across  our country, including the most recent attack, which left at least 26  dead after a lone gunman opened fire at a church in Texas on Sunday. I  join my colleagues in mourning for the victims and their families. Our  thoughts are with them and all those affected by what happened in  Texas.   At the same time, we remember that these heartbreaking events came  just 35 days after the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history,  when 58 were killed and hundreds were wounded in Las Vegas last month.  But as we look ahead, we cannot escape the fact that we can, and must,  do more to keep our communities safer. While no one policy will prevent  every tragedy, we need to come together on commonsense proposals that  would save lives.   I appreciate the words of my colleagues about mental illness and  funding for mental illness. I think that is very important. I come from  Minnesota, where Paul Wellstone was one of the leaders in making sure  that mental illnesses got covered by insurance, and I think we need to  do that and more.   Another area where we have found some consensus in this Chamber is  improving background checks. My colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator  Toomey have made that clear, and I supported their background check  legislation in 2013. But the fact remains that we didn't pass that bill  in the Senate. We fell short, and it was a disheartening day.   I remember having the parents of some of the Sandy Hook victims in my  office that morning. Yet what happened that day--you have to contrast  it with where the American people are. Consistently, whether it is with  public opinion polls or whether it is when you talk to people you meet  when you are at home, we have seen that Americans from across the  political spectrum support commonsense proposals to require background  checks, such as requiring background checks at gun shows. And they  support that by wide margins.   By the way, I look at this from a State that has a lot of households  that have guns. We are a proud hunting State. And with every proposal I  look at, I always think of my Uncle Dick and how he used to love  hunting and sitting in his deer stand. I think: Does this hurt my Uncle  Dick and his deer stand? And I don't think that the Manchin-Toomey bill  would in any way. When I look at these things, I have to evaluate them  that way because I know how many proud and law-abiding gun owners we  have in our State. But I don't see that closing this gun show loophole  by doing something more about background checks would hurt that hunting  tradition in any way.   When I talk to law enforcement around Minnesota, they stress the  importance of having effective background checks to stop felons,  domestic abusers, and people who are prohibited from having easy access  to guns from having that access. If you remember, part of the Manchin- Toomey proposal was to do more on sharing data and getting the data out  there. These efforts should not and do not have to infringe on  Americans' rights to own guns.   Another sensible measure that came out of the tragedy in Las Vegas,  which  [[Page S7047]]  we should take action on, is Senator Feinstein's legislation to close a  loophole that allows bump stock devices to convert semiautomatic  firearms into weapons that work like fully automatic guns. Law  enforcement recovered 12 of these devices from the hotel room of the  shooter in Las Vegas last month.   I hope we can find some common ground. Some of our colleagues across  the aisle have voiced some interest in this, and I hope we can do  something when we know that would have been helpful in that shooting.   Another area where we can find common ground is in taking action to  protect those who are at risk of gun violence from domestic abusers. We  were reminded of how important this is again this week, as reports have  revealed that the gunman in the Texas shooting had a history of  domestic violence, having been court-martialed for assaulting his wife  and child in 2012. He was sentenced to 12 months of confinement and  received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force. There are also  reports of ex-girlfriends and others who reported similar conduct.   I am sure the facts will be unveiled, but what I do know, regardless  of what the facts show right now, is that this connection between  domestic violence, stalking--those kinds of activities--and some kind  of homicidal behavior is something that has been well established.  According to recent research, more than half of mass shootings between  2009 and 2016--that is 54 percent--involved some kind of domestic or  family violence.   Before I came to the Senate, I spent 8 years as the top prosecutor  for Minnesota's largest county, so I have seen that connection. And I  have seen the connection between a history of domestic violence or  stalking that later leads to a more serious crime. That is why it is so  important that we have protection orders, and that is why it is so  important--as I look at the record of the shooter--that these cases be  taken seriously, so you actually get that misdemeanor conviction on the  record or you actually get a felony conviction or you do something  about the stalking behavior when it is reported to law enforcement.    When I was the county attorney in Hennepin County, we would have  cases we would sometimes pursue when a victim had reported it and the  police had gathered evidence--even if the victim later backed away and  was afraid to testify--because we knew it had happened, we had the  original testimony, and we had the evidence at the scene. We trained  the police on getting the evidence at the scene so that we were able to  actually make those cases. And you think about, in that instant, making  those cases; no matter how hard it can be sometimes when you have a  scared victim, it is really important.   When I was in the county attorney's office, I made prosecuting felons  in possession of firearms one of my top priorities. They weren't  supposed to have guns, and when they did have guns, we had to take it  seriously. I will tell you, some of the most disturbing cases that we  saw involved people with a documented history of harassment--of  stalking, of domestic violence--because you would see it building and  building, and sometimes it would be against one victim, but often we  would find out that there were others and that it was a pattern of  behavior, and one horrible case would erupt into homicidal violence.   There was one case I had heard of where a woman was shot to death by  her boyfriend. He killed her and then killed himself while both of his  kids were still in the house. It was ultimately his 12-year-old  daughter who went to the neighbors for help. The worst part of the  story is that it could have been prevented. In the 2 years leading up  to the murder-suicide, the police had been called to the boyfriend's  residence at least five times to resolve domestic disputes. Yet somehow  the man, with a history of violence like this, was able to have a gun  in his hand on the day he killed his girlfriend.   I wish I could say that it was a rare tragedy, but the truth is,  studies have shown that more than three women per day lose their lives  at the hands of their partners, and over half--this is an average--of  the women murdered by intimate partners in the country are killed with  guns. Many times these tragedies begin with incidents of stalking.   Research has shown that one in six women has experienced stalking  sometime during her lifetime, and 76 percent of women murdered by  intimate partners were first stalked by their partner. It is for this  reason that a number of years ago I introduced a bill called the  Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act to close some of  these loopholes in our existing laws. My bill would make sure that  those who are convicted of misdemeanor crimes of stalking are not able  to buy guns. It would also expand the definition of a domestic abuser  to include dating partners. The second part--when we had a hearing on  this bill on these issues in the Judiciary Committee, even the  Republican witnesses who were called supported the dating partner idea  because so many States have started to do that.   I introduced the legislation this time. It has been bipartisan in the  past, but the Republican Senator on the bill is no longer in the  Senate, although it is bipartisan in the House. But this time I  introduced it with Senator Hirono and Senator Feinstein, the only other  two women on the Judiciary Committee of 20 members. Congresswoman  Debbie Dingell from Michigan is leading the same bill in the House, and  her bill, as I noted, is bipartisan.   In 2014, we had a hearing on my bill. As I said, even the Republican  witnesses agreed that a major portion of the bill was a good idea. At  that hearing, we heard from Sheriff Christopher Schmaling of Racine  County in Wisconsin. He testified about the connection between stalking  and guns being used in violence against women. In his testimony, he  told the story of one woman from Wisconsin who, he said, had changed  his career. This woman had endured 3 years of a violently abusive  marriage before divorcing her husband. She then took out multiple  restraining orders against him over several years. That horrible day in  2004, he threatened her with a handgun, beat her with a baseball bat,  bound and gagged her, and left her in a storage unit to die. Through  what he described as some good breaks and some great luck, the Sheriff  and his partner rescued Teri before she died. As a result of the  ordeal, she had a miscarriage and had to have her toes surgically  removed. In his testimony, the Sheriff talked about the importance of  my bill's provision to extend the protections in current law to include  dating partners so that abusers would not be able to buy a gun if they  are convicted of beating up their girlfriend or boyfriend, regardless  of whether they lived together or had a child.   As the sheriff said, ``Dangerous boyfriends can be just as scary as  dangerous husbands; they hit just as hard, and they fire their guns  with the same deadly force.''   This is a simple point that you would think we could all agree on.  Sadly, we still have not been able to pass this bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the sheriff's written  testimony be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   written testimony of sheriff christopher schmaling--judiciary committee  hearing: ``vawa next steps: protecting women from gun violence''--july                                  30, 2014         Chairman Whitehouse, Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy,       members of the Committee, thank you for hosting this hearing       today, and thank you for the opportunity to testify.        My name is Christopher Schmaling. I am the sheriff of       Racine County, Wisconsin and have been a law enforcement       officer for 19 years. I am a conservative Republican, and I'm       here today to ask you to pass two laws that will protect our       sisters, our mothers, and our daughters by keeping guns out       of the hands of domestic abusers. The first bill is the       Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act of       2013, which will block abusive boyfriends and convicted       stalkers from possessing guns. The second is a bill that       would require criminal background checks for gun sales by       unlicensed sellers.        More than half of the women murdered each year are killed       by intimate partners or family members. That's 48 women       killed by husbands and boyfriends each and every month. We       know that people with a history of committing domestic       violence are more likely to become killers--and we know the       role that firearms play: When a gun is present in a domestic       violence incident, the chances that a woman will be killed       increase by 500 percent.  [[Page S7048]]         These numbers are tragic. As the top law enforcement       officer in Racine County and over my two decades on the       force, I've seen far too many of these tragic incidents       firsthand.        I want to tell you about one such domestic violence       incident, a tragedy that changed my career. In 2004, Teri       Jendusa-Nicolai was violently abused and left for dead by her       ex-husband. Teri had endured three years of a violently       abusive marriage before divorcing him, and had then taken out       multiple restraining orders against him over several years.        That horrible day in 2004, he threatened her with a .38       caliber handgun, beat her with a baseball bat, bound and       gagged her, and left her in a storage unit to die. My partner       and I were the lead investigators on the case, and through       some good breaks and some great luck, we rescued Teri before       she died. As a result of the ordeal, Teri had a miscarriage       and had to have her toes surgically removed.        Teri is one of the most wonderful people I've ever known,       and has been a tremendous advocate for victims of abuse in       the decade since she was nearly killed at gunpoint. We've       become very close since then, and my eyes have been opened to       the reality of domestic violence and gun violence. I've also       become close with Elvin Daniel, who is sitting here beside me       today, and have been moved by his sister Zina's story.        I'm proud to say we are the first county in the State of       Wisconsin to have a full-time domestic violence specialist.       We work closely with victims to figure out how best to       protect them. We've made this very intimate and very deadly       area a top priority for our department. So much of the crime       we face in Racine County is intimate partner abuse, and any       cop will tell you that domestic violence calls are the most       dangerous calls. The last thing a victim needs, and the last       thing my officers need, is for these dangerous abusers to be       armed with illegal guns.        We respond to domestic violence incidents differently than       other calls, because these are ``heightened risk'' calls--we       send more officers, we go ahead and assume that guns will be       involved, because they are so often involved. Abusers       routinely threaten to shoot my deputies and I upon arrival at       domestic violence calls. In fact, according to FBI data, over       150 law enforcement officers have been killed in action while       responding to domestic disturbances.        I'm proud to have worked on a great domestic violence bill       in Wisconsin in 2014 known as ``The Safe Act,'' a bill that       ensures guns are kept out of the hands of domestic abusers.       This bill was passed by a bipartisan majority and signed by       our Republican governor Scott Walker. This year alone,       similar bills were passed with bipartisan support in New       Hampshire, Minnesota, Vermont, and Washington. And in       Louisiana, where another Republican governor--Bobby Jindal--      signed the bill into law.        The first bill I'm asking you to pass today is the       Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act of       2013, S. 1290, introduced by Senator Klobuchar. This bill       would close a loophole that allows abusive dating partners to       buy and have guns--simply because they are not married to       their victims. And it would also block people with stalking       convictions from having guns.        Why is this bill so important? I can tell you firsthand       that domestic violence is horrific, whether or not the abuser       and victim are married. When we send our police into danger       to respond to domestic violence calls, we send the same folks       regardless of the couple's marital status. Dangerous       boyfriends can be just as scary as dangerous husbands; they       hit just as hard and they fire their guns with the same       deadly force. In fact, according to FBI data, more women are       killed in America by their abusive boyfriends than by their       abusive husbands.        This past March, just a couple hours from Racine County,       Cheryl Gilberg was killed by her ex-boyfriend in a domestic       dispute. The killer apparently shot Cheryl with her own gun,       after a struggle. According to news reports, she had been       seeking a restraining order at the time of the killing. But       in cases like Cheryl's, a restraining order isn't good       enough. If you've never been married to your abuser, federal       law likely will not stop him from buying a gun.        If Congress passes this bill, federal law will be catching       up with the states. Among the 22 states that prohibit gun       possession by domestic abusers subject to restraining orders,       19 of those states already include abusive dating partners.       And 42 of our states have recognized that dating partner       abuse is a form of domestic abuse by allowing victims to take       out domestic violence restraining orders against their       boyfriends.        The second bill I'm asking you to pass today would require       criminal background checks for gun buyers who shop with       unlicensed sellers. Current federal law prohibits many       abusers from buying guns, but only requires them to pass a       background check if they buy a gun from a licensed dealer.       This is a gaping hole in the law: It means a convicted wife-      beater can slip through the cracks and get a gun simply by       finding a seller who does not have his own gun store.        This is exactly what happened in Dane County: Tyrone Adair       was a domestic abuser who had been convicted of battery       twice, and was legally prohibited from owning a gun because       of a restraining order. So instead of going to a gun store--      where he would have had to pass a background check--he found       an ad for a 9mm Glock in a local paper, and met the seller at       a hardware store. There was no background check, though the       seller did ask, and I quote, ``You're not going to go out and       kill someone, are you?'' Tyrone Adair used that gun on a       horrific murder spree, killing his two daughters--ages 1 and       2--and killing their two mothers.        Background checks work. Sixteen states and DC already       require background checks for all handgun sales, and about 40       percent fewer women are shot to death by their husbands and       boyfriends in those states. And background checks save law       enforcement lives as well: about 40 percent fewer cops are       killed with handguns in those states, as well.        These are the cops that risk their lives when they respond       to domestic violence calls, rushing into the middle of very       dangerous and very intimate situations. We see the terror       that abusers can create when they are armed. We see the       impact on their wives and girlfriends, and on their children.       We're major proponents of community policing in Racine       County, and if I have my officers on the street, working       closely with our residents, I want to know that our laws are       doing everything they can to keep guns out of abusive hands.        So I'm here to speak for victims of abuse and to speak for       my cops. I've made it a priority to talk to victims. I've       seen the escalation over the years, from yelling, to battery,       to homicide. When an abuser has a gun, the victims say to me,       ``Sheriff, is not a question of if he'll use the gun to abuse       me; it's a question of when.'' And I recognize the value of       preventing even one gun from winding up in the hands of an       abuser: one gun may translate into one more lives saved.        So today, I'm asking you to pass S. 1290, which will apply       the same rules to all abusers, regardless of whether they are       married to their victims or not--and will prohibit convicted       stalkers from having guns.        And I'm asking you to require criminal background checks       for gun sales by unlicensed sellers, and ensure that abusers       don't get a free pass when they buy guns from them--often       strangers they meet online, at gun shows, or through       classified ads. The bipartisan bill introduced last year by       Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey would do just that, and       it has already received the support of 55 senators.        I'm asking you today to stand up against abuse by fixing       our out-of-date laws and passing this common-sense       legislation. Thank you for your time and I look forward to       answering your questions.     I also note that a justice from the Supreme Court of  Pennsylvania also testified on that day as the Republicans' witness.  Even though he did not agree with everything in the bill, he also said:  I absolutely agree that we should have boyfriends, dating partners as a  part. We have it in Pennsylvania, OK? It is important. As the sheriff  said, they can shoot, and they can beat up people just like anybody  else.   He was, actually, the Republicans' witness at the hearing. That is  why I am happy that in the House of Representatives it is a bipartisan  bill, but I would like to see it as a bipartisan bill here in the  Senate. Maybe they will reconsider this now. Just as the NRA has said  that it was looking at the bump stock issue, maybe they would be  willing to look at this issue because they wrote kind of a fast memo on  this--it is only a page long--back when we had the hearing and when we  were gaining support for the bill. Remember that this is very narrow  legislation that is focused on making sure that dating partners are  covered and also people who are not charged but convicted of stalking.  They wrote that the legislation ``manipulates emotionally compelling  issues such as `domestic violence' and `stalking' simply to cast as  wide a net as possible. . . .''   I want to make this very clear--and I have never addressed this on  the floor before--that this was really focused narrowly so that we  could gain Republican support. I didn't really think the NRA would  support it, but I thought that maybe they would be neutral, and, sure  enough, their witnesses at the hearing supported it. We have had  Republican Senators support it in the past, and we have also had  Republican House Members support it. In going after the bill by saying  that it manipulates emotionally compelling issues, well, I would agree  in that I am sure that a lot of people shed tears when watching what  happened in Texas, and I am sure that they have shed a lot of tears  when they have heard the stories from people in their own communities  of the victims, of the women who had died at the hands of domestic  abusers after years of abuse. So if they want to call that emotionally  compelling and manipulative, that is up to them, but I call it the  truth.   The other thing they said about this bill--and this was even more  interesting--is the part about the stalking,  [[Page S7049]]  which is a major part of the legislation as well. That part of the  bill, as I mentioned, just takes what we know as a signal for trouble  in the future and violence in the future, and you would actually have  to be convicted of stalking to have the gun protections apply.   The example they used--as I said, it did not make any sense to  include this, and it is the only example they used--was of two men of  equal size, strength, and domestic status, joined by a civil union or  merely engaged or formally engaged in an intimate social relationship,  being subject to this prohibition for conviction of simple assault  arising from a single shoving match.   Actually, this part applies to the domestic partners. I think they  are really taking this in a way that has surprised me since whom we are  talking about are boyfriends and girlfriends and domestic violence, but  they have changed it into a shoving match in a bar with people who  might have some kind of social relationship. I just do not think this  is a valid reason for my Republican colleagues to oppose this bill, and  I am going to keep bringing this up because it does not make sense to  me.   They end by saying that, whatever the case may have been 30 years  ago, domestic violence is now taken seriously by the legal and criminal  justice systems.   That was the reason they gave for opposing the bill. Really? Look at  what we just found that happened in the last week when this was not  just a minor example of domestic assault but was a felony. The person  was court-martialed, and the person was, basically, detained for a  year. Yet, somehow, this was not taken seriously enough through our  entire system to show up on a record check. How about all of the  reports that had been made by previous girlfriends and other people  about his behavior, and nothing had seemed to come up then?   As I mentioned, of the many cases that we had had in our office, even  when the victim had gotten scared and decided that she had not wanted  to pursue anything, we had felt that we had an obligation to her and to  the other women we knew would come after her to pursue those cases,  and, many times, we had done that if the police had been trained and  they had been able to get the evidence at the scene. Sometimes there  had been child witnesses and others, and we had been able to pursue  those cases and win them, and we did.   So to say that you don't want to support my bill because you think  this system is so great, is working so well, and is being taken  seriously by the legal and criminal justice systems after you saw what  just happened in Texas, I do not think is true. This memo was written 2  years ago. So I hope they will look at this again and consider  supporting my bill.   I conclude my remarks by sharing another story about yet another  tragic shooting from my State. In this one I truly got to know the  widow. She is the widow of a police officer in Lake City, MN. This was  a case in which the officer, who was a wonderful man in a small town  police department, responded to a domestic violence call from a 17- year-old girl who was being abused by her ex-boyfriend. He went to the  scene in the middle of the winter. He had a bulletproof vest on and  everything because the domestic violence cases can be much more  dangerous than people think, and officers know this. He was shot in the  head, and he was killed. The 17-year-old girl lived. This officer  literally gave his life to save another.   There was a big funeral, and there were law enforcement people there  from all over our State. I will never forget that funeral. I was  sitting there in the aisle, and I had learned that the last time that  officer had been in that church was to see his own kids--three young  children, two boys and a girl--in a Nativity play. He had been sitting  right in the front row of that same church, so proud of them at  Christmas. Shortly after that, he was shot. At his funeral, there were  those three children walking down the church aisle--the two young boys  and the little girl in a blue dress that was covered with stars. I  always think about that little girl in that blue dress that was covered  in stars. This was domestic violence gone bad. He was a police officer  who had shown up at the scene.   When you look at these cases--we can look at the numbers; we can look  at the stories; we can look at what has gone on on TV--you see this  connection between domestic violence and stalking and then, later,  either mass shootings or violence against one person, which happens  much more often. It is not a coincidence. It is something that has been  well documented.   As we extend our sympathies and prayers to all of those who were  affected by that tragedy in Texas and, of course, not too long ago in  Las Vegas and in so many other communities and to all of those, of  course, who were also victims of that act of terror in New York--we  think of all of them--we also think: What can we do to make this  better? In this case, when it comes to domestic violence and this  specific issue that I know a lot about from my past job, we can do  something. So let's pass this bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
