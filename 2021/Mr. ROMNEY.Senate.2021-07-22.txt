 As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 314, submitted  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution  with Senators Bennet, Hagerty, Klobuchar, and Coons to honor the 2020  Olympic Games that officially start tomorrow.   More than 600 of our finest athletes have traveled to Tokyo to  represent the United States. These athletes trained their entire lives  to compete this month on the world's biggest stage. They have shed  blood, sweat, and tears and have sacrificed countless hours, many while  working separate full-time jobs and raising families of their own.   Of course, no one thought the 2020 Olympics would be starting  tomorrow. COVID-19 did not just delay the Games for a year, it also  meant hundreds of qualifying events around the world had to be canceled  and relocated.   We recognize the dedication of the athletes and coaches of the U.S.  Olympic and Paralympic teams, as well as  [[Page S5039]]  the family, friends, and loved ones who support them.   We are grateful to our friends in Japan, who have committed  tremendous resources to provide safe and secure Games. I have great  gratitude for these people of Japan, the people of that great country,  for the enormous sacrifice they have made to host the world, to  demonstrate to the world that qualities of the human spirit are great  indeed, and to make their home a place where the entire world comes to  gather and celebrate the human spirit and its accomplishments.   And while these Games may look a little different this year, we stand  with Team USA and will be cheering them on as they bring many medals  back home.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
