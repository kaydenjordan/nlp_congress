 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the budget resolution put forth by the majority.   Rather than seek bipartisan consensus, Democrats are effectively  shutting out Republicans through this reconciliation process. The  Democrats are proposing to spend $1.9 trillion, one of the largest  single expenditures in U.S. history.   They will be funding this historic expenditure by dramatically  increasing our national debt, and these unprecedented and historic  obligations are being undertaken without engaging in the Budget  Committee at all.   Just because the Democrats have control of both Houses and the  Presidency does not mean they should be abusing this power, bypassing  the important and deliberative role of the legislative process instead  of working in earnest with the Republican Members.   In the 116th Congress, we were able to find bipartisan consensus on  COVID relief, and I believe we can do the same here now.   This go-it-alone approach is very unfortunate because there are many  provisions in President Biden's proposal that I could support. I have  been calling for additional aid to local governments since I arrived  here in Congress this summer. Further, we most definitely need more  resources to ensure a more robust deployment of vaccines throughout the  Nation.   This partisan approach to relief legislation is damaging and  unproductive. I hope the majority will reconsider this process.   I want to believe President Biden's calls for unity, bipartisanship,  and cooperation. I was encouraged to see the talks between the White  House and the Senate Republicans. This is exactly how we should be  working to address the needs of the American people.   During these very challenging times, I stand ready and willing to  work with the Biden administration and any of my colleagues across the  aisle to help the American people.
