 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my home  State's 158th birthday.   As we traveled thousands of miles throughout Kansas this past week  and enjoyed some time pheasant hunting countryside with my family, I  spent a lot of time reflecting on the great things that the Wheat State  has to offer.   Kansas is known for its abundance of farmland that is used to grow  crops far and wide producing the food we eat across the Nation and  across the world. It is home to the most stunning sunsets you could  ever witness and the beautiful Flint Hills that stretch over 150 miles  where I grew up working, hunting, and fishing.   But my absolute favorite part about the State I call home are the  people. Where I am from, we always put our faith in family first; we  support each other, uplift each other, and are resilient through tough  times. I am honored to represent so many wonderful people and proud to  be a Kansan.                            ____________________
