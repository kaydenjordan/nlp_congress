 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the       order for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, this past weekend, when I was home       and whether I was at church or at other activities, I would hear from       Tennesseans, and they were just so focused on what we were hearing       about the Twitter files. They are very concerned and disturbed about       the lengths to which the FBI and other government Agencies have gone to       suppress political free speech online.        The document releases to date especially give them pause because it       shows them what it looks like when the power of Big Tech and the power       of the deep state work together against the American people.        Now, most people understand that the government and law enforcement       sometimes work with private companies and, when it comes to removing       things like material depicting child sexual abuse from their platforms,       that is something that tech platforms should be doing. But in this       case, they were working together to suppress free speech on behalf of a       political narrative, a viewpoint that they held, and words they       disagreed with.        The existence of the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force is not a       secret. The Agency created it in 2017 to counteract foreign influence       operations targeting the United States. If you don't look too closely,       the task force seems like a reasonable response to an emerging threat       to our Nation's security. But, in reality, the entire scheme is       predicated on the notion that a threat is whatever the task force deems       it to be.        In a batch of documents and reporting released on Sunday, we learned       that, in the months leading up to the 2020 election, the task force       became frustrated after Twitter employees indicated they hadn't seen       much to suggest that foreign countries like Russia were using the       platform to spread propaganda.        So what did the FBI do? They went on a fishing expedition and       pressured decision makers within the company to abandon the notion that       this was about national security.        In the end, Twitter decided to let the FBI kick the door off the       hinges and widen the scope of their own influence online at the expense       of the integrity of the platform. And I say ``widen'' because the FBI,       along with the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence       community, had already engaged in a certain amount of mission creep       when it came to investigating threats online.        Both the FBI and DHS routinely preflagged content for moderation and       sent the names of accounts directly to the FBI's contacts at Twitter.       Several of the accounts sent for review were suspended or shadow       banned. Yet most of them weren't foreign propaganda at all. They were       relatively low-engagement accounts tweeting satire and jokes--and       accounts of citizens. Many of them were owned by regular people who       were obviously on the conservative side of the political spectrum.        The FBI responded to this reporting by claiming that they often work       with private companies to provide information on foreign malign       influence attempts. But, as we have seen in black and white, most of       the moderation requests made by the government didn't fall into that       category. Instead, they focused on low-follower accounts owned by       ordinary Americans who tweeted opinions that the government did not       agree with.        These revelations prompt our next question: How did an allegedly       serious investigation into influence campaigns devolve into a       censorship free-for-all?        To find your answer, you have to look all the way back to the 2016       Russian election interference story. These allegations were used as       pretext to justify the blatant censorship covered in the Twitter files       reporting.        In November 2020, the FBI used that pretext to justify flagging so       many examples of what they called ``possible violative content'' that       Twitter employees were overwhelmed.        The story still had steam in 2021, when DHS published a brief with       their assessment that ``Russian malign influencers probably will       increasingly use U.S. social media platforms that offer more permissive       operating environments.''        As I said, that is their--the DHS--quote.        And, of course, it was that pretext that led to the most infamous       instance of government-driven censorship in recent memory. When Twitter       suppressed            [[Page S9748]]            the New York Post story coverage of Hunter Biden's laptop, the platform       made it clear they had done so because the story was the product of       Russian meddling.        Of course, this weekend's reporting revealed that Twitter employees       had repeatedly informed the FBI that they had no evidence of       significant Russian meddling. Twitter told the FBI repeatedly that they       had no significant evidence of Russian meddling.        But under pressure from the government, they chose to buy into an       influence operation that originated much closer to home. The FBI had       primed the pump months before the laptop story broke by telling tech       CEOs to expect hacking operations targeting people associated with       political campaigns.        They also planted seeds with elected officials and the media and even       hosted a tabletop exercise that mimicked one of those hacking       operations.        One person they identified as a potential target? Hunter Biden. Yes,       it was Hunter Biden. And of course, his property had been in FBI       custody since December 2019.        So when the Post broke the story, it was easy--easy--for Twitter to       take the easy way out and run with the FBI narrative rather than       relying on evidence proving the story was a real scandal and not       something cooked up by a Russian hacker.        At this point in the story, it has become crystal clear that there is       a much bigger agenda in play.        When DHS tried to get away with creating an official Disinformation       Governance Board, I almost didn't believe what I was seeing. Here was       an official government Agency using national security as a pretext to       censor political speech that was at odds with the Biden       administration's policies. Fortunately, that effort collapsed under       scrutiny.        But they didn't need an official panel of bureaucrats to keep up the       pressure on these companies. Back in July 2021, I sent a letter to the       White House after we discovered that their staff was in regular touch       with social media platforms to suppress speech regarding the COVID-19       pandemic.        I figured the American people had a right to know what criteria they       were using to ask for that level of censorship and what the legal basis       for this presumed authority was. Believe it or not, I never got an       answer to the letter.        Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the       Record that letter alongside my remarks.        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in       the Record, as follows:                                                                July 16, 2021.           Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,           President of the United States,           Washington, DC.             Dear President Biden: I write regarding White House Press            Secretary Jen Psaski's recent remarks about the White House's            oversight of social media posts it considers problematic or            ``disinformation.'' Ms. Psaski noted that the White House is            ``in regular touch with the social media platforms'' and is            ``flagging problematic posts'' that they believe should be            removed relating to COVID-19 and the COVID vaccine. Ms.            Psaski also suggested that Americans who are banned from one            social media platform should be banned on others.             These revelations are deeply concerning. The blatant            actions by your administration to work with big tech            companies to censor Americans' free speech are shocking--and            arguably a violation of the First Amendment. Communist            countries such as Cuba are currently taking away their            citizens' right to use the internet to communicate; the U.S.            government should be standing up to, not looking to mirror,            authoritarian regimes such as these.             Please provide more information about your Administration's            efforts to ``flag problematic posts'' on social media            platforms, including:             1. What criteria are you directing social media platforms            to use to flag and remove posts?             2. What criteria are you directing social media platforms            to use to ban users?             3. In your July 15th press briefing, you stated that 12            people are responsible for ``65 percent of anti-vaccine            misinformation on social media platforms.'' Who are those            accounts and have they, or others, been removed at your            direction?             4. What is the legal basis for your Administration's            decision to direct social media platforms to flag and remove            posts from their sites?             5. Does the White House have staff dedicated to searching            social media for content to flag for removal?             Additionally, I request a briefing on this issue by August            2, 2021. I appreciate your attention to this urgent matter.                 Sincerely,                                                       Marsha Blackburn,                                                  United States Senator.               Madam President, the American people aren't going to       let this one go. I know Tennesseans are not going to let this go. They       have hard evidence that Big Tech and the deep state have repeatedly       suppressed legal speech to control political discourse in this country.        These companies cannot be trusted to do what is right, and we as       lawmakers can no longer wait for them to regulate themselves. They have       proven over the past decade that they will not regulate themselves.       This is why I fought so hard to pass legislation requiring privacy,       safety, and data security protections for kids and adults.        This year, the Kids Online Safety Act and the Open App Markets Act       and nationwide privacy legislation have all fallen short of the finish       line, which is really disappointing because these are policies that       have such strong bipartisan support. And I thank Senator Blumenthal for       his partnership on those policies.        But I would remind my colleagues that these issues have not gone       away, and they are not going away. The American people are waiting to       see what we do next: Will we give them a toolbox to protect themselves       online, to protect their virtual you? Will we give them the ability to       control the apps that they choose to put on their iPhone or their       Android? Will we pass legislation to make certain that our social media       platforms have to establish a duty of care for our children online?        We all know that if you give Big Tech the opportunity, they will       censor. We know that. They will suppress speech in order to favor a       narrative that they can control, and they are going to keep doing it       until we put them all in check.        I yield the floor.
