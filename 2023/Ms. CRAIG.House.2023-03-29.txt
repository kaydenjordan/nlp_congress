 Mr. Speaker, this Friday is International Transgender Day  of Visibility, a time each year when we uplift and recognize the  strength and resilience of the trans community.   The United States is home to 1.6 million trans youth and adults--1.6  million siblings, grandparents, brothers, sisters, friends, coworkers,  and loved ones.   At a moment when trans-Americans are under direct attack in States  across our Nation and in this body, I am here today to honor and  celebrate each of these courageous, inspiring human beings just trying  to live and be treated with dignity and respect.   I am here to say to each of you, no matter what you are hearing in  your communities or from some Members of this body, you are loved, you  are valued, and you are worthy.   Over the past 40 years, our country has made progress, but this is a  moment and a critical reminder that we still have work to do.   As we mark International Trans Day of Visibility, we also remember  that we must never take our feet off the gas pedal when it comes to  this critical fight.   Please know I am always in your corner.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, like many of my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle here today, I believe we need an all-of-the-above energy  approach in this country.   As a Member of Congress representing a district that is 65 percent  covered in corn and soybeans every single summer, that all-of-the-above  approach includes strong support for biofuels.    When prices at the gas pump were rising last year, I worked across  the aisle to pass legislation allowing for the year-round sales of E15  through this House. This was the first time a bill like this passed  this body.   Renewable fuels like E15 are made with a higher ethanol blend than  regular gasoline and can sell for up to 40 cents less per gallon in  Minnesota.   Investments in E15 and biofuels mean new markets for our family  farmers growing corn and soybeans in my district, and it means giving  our domestic energy supply security and reinforcement as we work to  increase U.S. energy independence.  [[Page H1549]]    I am proud to have worked last summer to pass the largest investment  in biofuels in our Nation's history through the Inflation Reduction  Act.   This is a game changer for corn growers and soybean farmers in my  district, and it is a commonsense way to help protect our environment,  strengthen our energy independence, and lower costs for Americans.   The Inflation Reduction Act included many more investments in  renewable energy and important reforms to our oil and gas leasing  practices.   Today, House Republicans are putting forth hyperpartisan legislation  to roll back the climate progress we made in the last Congress, gutting  clean air and drinking water protections and giving handouts to  polluters.   Their so-called all-of-the-above energy bill does not contain even a  discussion of biofuels. There were amendments offered by my colleague  in Iowa to include biofuels in this legislation. Republicans blocked  them.    Madam Chair, it is one thing to say you support an all-of- the-above energy approach. It is entirely another thing to actually do  it.   I will work with anyone to lower costs for my constituents and to  support Minnesota farmers, but this bill is a handout to Big Oil and a  slap in the face to family farmers.
