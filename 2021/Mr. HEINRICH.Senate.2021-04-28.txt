 Mr. President, I am proud to join with the majority  leader and with my colleagues from Maine and Massachusetts to lead this  effort to restore responsible methane emission standards at the EPA. We  can take commonsense action right now to slow climate change and  simultaneously reduce the incredible waste of a valuable energy  resource.   Methane is the primary constituent in natural gas. It is an  incredibly potent driver of the greenhouse effect. Over the short term,  it is actually 86 times more powerful than CO2 emissions. It  is estimated that about a quarter of all the human-caused global  warming that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution can be  attributed to methane emissions.   In the United States, the lion's share of these human-caused methane  emissions are from the production of oil and gas. That is due in part  to outdated--oftentimes, even faulty--equipment and pipes that leak  methane into the air, wellheads that leak methane.   Many oil and gas operators also engage in a practice known as  flaring, where operators ignite and burn off excess gas, and, worse  yet, venting, where uncombusted natural gas is simply released into the  air.   Now, beyond the obvious consequences for climate change, these types  of methane emissions waste incredibly valuable energy resources.   Fugitive methane also harms public health by polluting the air that  we breathe. When methane leaks from oil and gas wells or pipelines or  other infrastructure, harmful carcinogens--  [[Page S2260]]  carcinogens like benzene and other volatile organic compounds--also  leak into the air alongside it. That means more children suffering from  asthma attacks and more seniors having trouble breathing.   Methane pollution is real and present in many States, and it is a  real problem in my State of New Mexico. We saw clear evidence of this  over the Four Corners region in northwestern New Mexico--the San Juan  Basin--and southwestern Colorado, when a giant cloud of methane, about  the size of the State of Delaware, became so large by the mid-2000s  that it could actually be seen by NASA satellite images.   This chart right here is a map from NASA of the western United  States. You can see right here the cloud of methane over the Four  Corners, which coincides exactly with the San Juan Basin, where much of  our oil and gas has been produced over the course of the last several  decades.   You can see from this map, from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, how  real and urgent the issue is. In recent years, researchers have  detected increasing levels of dangerous methane pollution now over  southeastern New Mexico, over the Permian Basin, where oil and gas  operations have been booming for the last decade.   It is clear that this oil and gas producing region has joined the San  Juan Basin as another major contributor to our methane emissions  challenge.   Late last year, the EPA and the New Mexico Environment Department  conducted helicopter flights over both the San Juan and Permian Basins.  They used forward-looking infrared technology that can detect emissions  from oil and gas operations that would normally be invisible to the  naked eye.   I think if you could see methane, we would have solved many of these  problems a long time ago.   For an example of what this technology can help us see at an  individual oil and gas operation level, look at this side-by-side image  from the group Earthworks. As you can see, this is what the human eye  sees--simple oil and gas infrastructure, the number of tanks, some  piping. But by using infrared imaging, you can see the enormous amount  of methane simply being vented or leaking into the air. That entire  plume is invisible to the naked eye, and, were it not so, I would, once  again, suggest that we would have solved these problems a long time ago   The overflights that were conducted by the New Mexico Environment  Department found that methane leak rates over New Mexico's Permian  Basin in 2020 had increased by 250 percent over 2019 levels. It is  simply unacceptable.   Nationally, the Environmental Defense Fund has found that while oil  and gas production has not yet rebounded from a crash brought on by the  pandemic last year, methane emissions are already soaring back to  prepandemic levels.   That is completely unacceptable when companies have the knowledge,  have the technology, have the workforce to fix these leaks and stop the  wasteful practices of venting and flaring.   When we set clear rules and emission standards, most oil and gas  operators are onboard with updating their equipment and their practices  to minimize methane leaks and to bring that natural gas that they  produce to market. That is their business plan, not wasting methane.   We saw this bear out in practice in New Mexico over these past 2  years, as our State's oil conservation commission convened conservation  and public health advocates and local oil and gas producers to  establish State-level methane emissions rules.   New Mexico's new rules govern not just oil and gas production sites  but also things like pipelines and storage sites that also oftentimes  leak methane into the atmosphere.   And under our new State rules, oil and gas operators have the  flexibility to choose the best technologies to meet the target of  capturing 98 percent of their natural gas by 2026.   A spokesperson for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association recently  said that the group supports this goal and the newly finalized rules,  which promote ``safe, responsible production of oil and gas.''   New Mexico has now joined other western States--States such as  Colorado, North Dakota, and Wyoming--that have already adopted strong  State-level methane emissions rules.   Until just recently, we also had strong Federal methane rules in  place at the EPA. Now, unfortunately, these rules became one more  target of the Trump administration's reckless rollbacks of protections  of our clean air and clean water in this country. Late last year,  President Trump dismantled an EPA rule that required oil and gas  producers to monitor for methane leaks at their wells, at their  compressor stations, and at their other operations.   This rule, or rollback of a rule, is simply a disaster for our  climate and for public health. It was even rejected by much of the  industry that it was purporting to help. Many leading American oil and  gas producers and companies simply panned President Trump's rollback of  these commonsense methane standards. As just one example, Gretchen  Watkins, Shell's president in the United States, called the Trump  administration's rollback ``frustrating and disappointing,'' and  pledged to voluntarily continue reducing their methane emissions.   Why would they do that? Because it is the right thing to do, because  it makes business sense, because the rollback was, frankly,  nonsensical.   So repairing leaks and installing new leak detection technologies  will also create a number of good-paying jobs. It is really the epitome  of a win-win situation.   Without clear Federal rules in place at the EPA, however, industry- led voluntary emissions reductions simply won't go far enough to curb  the problem that we have. We need clear standards that create clear  requirements for reducing waste and harmful pollution.   And it is not just me saying this. Since we announced this effort to  use the Congressional Review Act, more and more leading companies in  the oil and gas sector have come forward to say that they would welcome  reinstating the EPA's methane emissions standards.   That includes the EQT Corporation, one of the Nation's leading  natural gas producers, which operates in West Virginia and Ohio and  Pennsylvania. In a statement, EQT's president and CEO, Toby Rice,  called the reinstating of uniform Federal methane standards ``sound  federal policies'' and committed to ``producing our natural gas in  accordance with high environmental and social standards.''   The major oil company Total USA says:         We welcome direct federal regulation of methane emissions       and support resolution via the Congressional Review Act.    Shell U.S. tweeted:         Sound policy surrounding natural gas is critical to its       role in the energy transition. We need to restore the direct       federal regulation of methane emissions--and we urge Congress       to approve the methane resolution under the Congressional       Review Act.    Not my words; Shell--one of the world's major producers of oil and  gas.   These are the words of industry leaders who welcome us setting clear  standards on methane emissions.   We are voting to reinstate the commonsense methane requirements for  the oil and gas industry's production and processing segments and the  methane and volatile organic compound requirements for oil and gas  transmission and storage facilities.   With this vote, Congress will once again affirm that the Clean Air  Act requires the EPA to take action to protect the air that Americans  breathe from dangerous and harmful pollutants like methane, just like  we did back in 2017 when the Senate came together on a bipartisan basis  to uphold similar rules that govern oil and gas production on Federal  Bureau of Land Management lands. In that vote, our former colleague  Senator John McCain and our colleagues Senator Susan Collins and  Senator Lindsey Graham joined with Senate Democrats in retaining the  BLM's methane rule that promoted responsible development of natural gas  resources on our public lands.   I would hope that all of us, and I mean all of us, sincerely--this is  an effort that should receive the support of every single Senator in  this body. I would hope that all of us can come together on a  bipartisan basis once again to restore and strengthen responsible  Federal methane standards for oil and gas operators. I am so pleased  that  [[Page S2261]]  Senator Collins has already joined us as a cosponsor on this  resolution.   Finally, I would like to point out that these rules are important not  just to the health of oil and gas producing States like New Mexico or  Wyoming or Colorado, because these rules will ensure the safety of not  just oil and gas production sites but also of the gas pipelines and the  storage sites that exist in every State in this country and in  communities across this country.   These upstream segments of the oil and gas industry are in every  single community you can imagine in all parts of the Nation. Just like  we all know we need to remove poisonous lead from our drinking water  pipes, we need to be sure that the natural gas lines that run into our  homes and into our businesses are not leaking harmful methane pollution  in the very spaces where we all breathe and live.   As we transition towards a 100-percent clean energy future, a future  without pollution, we must do all that we can to mitigate the harmful  pollution caused by our current use of fossil fuels, and that is  exactly what these rules are designed to do.   As President Biden demonstrated just last week when he convened  leaders from around the globe, Americans are ready for us to move past  former President Trump's backward and reckless vision on climate.  Restoring and strengthening methane standards at the EPA will be one of  the most powerful steps we can all take here in this Senate today to  confront the existential threat posed by greenhouse pollution and a  warming planet, and it will make the air over all of our communities  cleaner and healthier and easier to breathe.   For all of these reasons, I would encourage once again not just a few  of my colleagues but all of our colleagues to join us in voting for  this bipartisan resolution to restore some commonsense and some  responsible Federal standards for the waste and leakage of methane.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Leader Chuck Schumer, Chairman Tom  Carper of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator Angus  King, Senator Edward Markey and I are leading supporters and sponsors  of S.J. Res. 14, a joint resolution providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to Oil and  Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and  Modified Sources Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 57,018, Sept. 14, 2020, also  known as methane rescission rule. We submit these comments to provide  the Senate with additonal information regarding the intent in adopting  this resolution.   The atmospheric buildup of greenhouse gases, such as methane, is  changing the climate at a pace and in a way that endangers human  health, society, our economy, and the natural environment. Specific  public health impacts of anthropogenic climate change include  respiratory harms associated with smoke inhalation from unprecedented  climate-driven forest fires, heat stroke, and other health effects of  increasingly frequent heat waves, and more widespread vector borne  diseases. Other public welfare impacts include displacing U.S.  communities by retreating snow and ice and rising sea levels, droughts  that impact agricultural production and farming communities, and  [[Page S2283]]  changes in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, precipitation,  and extreme weather events that have a disproportionate impact on our  Nation most vulnerable.   A key chemical constituent of natural gas, methane is a leading  contributing cause of climate change. It is 28 to 36 times more  powerful than carbon dioxide in raising the Earth's surface temperature  when measured over a 100-year time scale and about 84 times more  powerful when measured over a 20-year timeframe.   Industrial sources emit greenhouse gases in great quantities, and  methane emissions from all segments of the oil and gas industry are  especially significant in their contribution to overall emissions  levels and surface temperature rise.   It is not possible to address the problem of rising global  atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations tEy achieving U.S. net  greenhouse gas neutrality. The United States cannot become greenhouse  gas neutral without reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all  industrial sources, regardless of the relative size of any one emission  source or the disparate locations of the points of emission.   Within this context, the methane rescission rule should be  disapproved by Congress. The rule finalized regulatory actions and  introduced legal interpretations that contravene the Clean Air Act and  congressional intent for EPA to take strong action to regulate and  abate greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane, from all sources.   S.J. Res. 14 renders the methane rescission rule's effect void and  demonstrates Congress's disapproval of the new findings of fact and  interpretations of law upon which this rule was based.   By adopting this resolution of disapproval, it is our view that  Congress reaffirms that the Clean Air Act requires EPA to act to  protect Americans from sources of climate pollution like methane, which  endangers the public's health and welfare.   In rejecting the methane rescission rule's misguided legal  interpretations, the resolution clarifies our intent that EPA should  regulate methane and other pollution emissions from all oil and gas  sources, including production, processing, transmission, and storage  segments under the authority of section 111 of the Clean Air Act.   In addition, we intend that section 111 of the Clean Air Act  obligates and provides EPA with the legal authority to regulate  existing sources of methane emissions in all of these segments.   In addition, we do not intend that section 111 of Clean Air Act  requires EPA to make a pollutant-specific significant contribution  finding before regulating emissions of a new pollutant from a listed  source category, although EPA could make such a finding if it chooses  to do so on a case-by-case basis.   Disapproval of the methane rescission rule does not preclude future  regulation under section 111 of the Clean Air Act of methane, VOCs or  other pollution from the oil and gas industry. This resolution  nullifies a rule that strips away public health and welfare protections  and deregulates the oil and gas industry. Any future rule that imposes  regulatory requirements on the oil and gas industry, provides  additional public health and welfare protections, or establishes or  strengthens standards on sources of methane and other pollutant  emissions would have the opposite intent and effect of the methane  rescission rule and therefore cannot be construed as ``substantially  the same'' as the methane rescission rule.   In fact, with the congressional adoption of this resolution, we  encourage EPA to strengthen the standards we reinstate and aggressively  regulate methane and other pollution emissions from new, modified, and  existing sources throughout the production, processing, transmission,  and storage segments of the oil and gas industry under section 111 of  the Clean Air Act.   The welfare of our planet and of our communities depend on it.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter  from attorneys general of New York, California, Colorado, Connecticut,  Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,  Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon,  Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of  Columbia, and the chief legal officers of Chicago and Denver on the  importance of passing this resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     April 26, 2021.      Re Senate Joint Resolution 14/House Joint Resolution 34--          Disapproval of Environmental Protection Agency Rule           Rescinding Methane Regulation.       Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Schumer, Senator McConnell, Speaker Pelosi,       and Representative McCarthy: The Attorneys General of New       York, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,       Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,       New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,       Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of       Columbia, and the chief legal officers of Chicago and Denver       support using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to       invalidate a regulation of the Environmental Protection       Agency (EPA) that eliminated important limits on air       pollution from oil and gas facilities, 85 Fed. Reg. 57,018       (Sept. 14, 2020) (Rescission Rule). Because that rule is       legally flawed and would significantly increase pollution       that harms our residents and natural resources, using the CRA       to expeditiously nullify the rule is justified. Restoring the       prior regulation will ensure that new oil and gas facilities       apply common sense, cost-effective measures to control       emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs),       and facilitate state efforts to limit pollution from existing       oil and gas facilities.              methane and vocs emitted by oil and gas facilities         Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is responsible for       about a quarter of the global warming we are experiencing       today. Oil and natural gas facilities are the single largest       industrial source of methane emissions. Methane emissions       from oil and gas sources are harming the States and our       residents by significantly contributing to climate change.       Our States are experiencing substantial injuries from climate       change, including property damage and hazards to human safety       associated with sea level rise and increased severity of       storms and flooding; increased deaths and illnesses due to       intensified and prolonged heat waves; harms to lives and       property caused by increased frequency and duration of       wildfires; and damage to public health--particularly among       our children, elderly, and those with lung ailments--due to       local air pollution exacerbated by hotter temperatures. These       injuries are often most severe in low-income communities and       communities of color. Scientists have found that substantial       reductions in global methane emissions this decade is       critical if we are to have a realistic chance of avoiding       catastrophic effects from climate change.        Oil and gas facilities are also a substantial source of       VOCs, a primary component of ground-level ozone (smog).       Several of our States experience persistent and widespread       unhealthy levels of smog, which EPA has found results in       numerous harms to public health, including triggering asthma       attacks and even premature death. The States' smog problems       are often substantially caused or exacerbated by the       transport of smog precursors, such as VOCs, from emission       sources located upwind. More than 9 million people live       within a half mile of an existing oil or gas well, including       approximately 600,000 children under the age of five and 1.4       million over 65, groups that are especially sensitive to the       health risks posed by ozone and other local air pollution.                             the rescission rule         The Rescission Rule eliminated methane emission standards       for new (including modified and reconstructed) oil and gas       facilities1 that EPA issued four years earlier pursuant to       section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. See 40 C.F.R. part 60,       subpart OOOOa, 81 Fed. Reg. 35,824 (June 3, 2016). Through       common sense, cost-effective approaches such as more       efficient technology and leak detection and repair, the 2016       rule secured important reductions of methane and VOC       pollution. EPA sensibly required that the emission standards       apply to similar equipment used in the production,       processing, and transmission and storage segments, i.e., up       to the point that natural gas is delivered for distribution       to businesses and consumers. In sum, the 2016 rule helped to       prevent and mitigate significant harms to public health and       the environment while increasing the efficiency of natural       gas operations.        Despite these substantial public health, environmental, and       economic benefits, the Trump EPA nonetheless promulgated the       Rescission Rule, which repealed the requirements that       directly targeted methane emissions at new facilities. The       Rescission Rule also eliminated pollution abatement       requirements for methane and VOCs emitted by facilities       engaged in the transmission and storage of natural gas,       despite the fact that this segment uses some of the same       equipment (e.g., compressors, pneumatic pumps) as production       and processing facilities. EPA acknowledged that the       Rescission Rule would result in increased pollution emissions       from new facilities, including 448,000 more tons of  [[Page S2286]]       methane, 12,000 more tons of VOCs, and 400 more tons of       hazardous air pollutants by 2030. 85 Fed. Reg. at 57,065.        EPA also included in the Rescission Rule a new hurdle for       limiting pollution under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act:       to adopt emission limits on any additional pollutant for       sources already regulated under section 111(b), EPA must make       a pollutant-specific ``significant contribution'' finding.       See 85 Fed. Reg. at 57,019. This new obstacle contravenes       EPA's longstanding position that the agency may require       emission limits for other pollutants from already-listed       sources provided it demonstrates a rational basis for doing       so, and creates an unjustified roadblock making it more       difficult for EPA to carry out its mission to protect public       health and the environment. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals       recently vacated a related EPA rule that sought to implement       EPA's new significant contribution finding requirement,       further undermining this theory.        As noted above, the Rescission Rule would result in       significant increases in emissions from new oil and gas       facilities. These pollution increases are just part of the       story, however, because the rule also blocks Clean Air Act       regulation of existing oil and gas facilities--facilities       that collectively emit substantial amounts of methane       pollution. Under the Clean Air Act, there must be pollutant       emission standards in effect for new facilities under section       111(b) of the Act to trigger the requirement under section       111(d) of the Act for EPA to promulgate emission guidelines       that facilitate states' developing plans that limit emissions       of the same pollutant from existing facilities.        EPA is required under its regulations to issue existing       source emission guidelines ``upon or after promulgation'' of       standards for new facilities, 40 C.F.R. 60.22a(a). Although       EPA did not issue the guidelines in 2016 when it finalized       the previous new source rule, it began work that year to       ``swiftly'' develop guidelines to limit methane emissions       from existing sources. That work ground to a halt shortly       after the Trump Administration took office, leading a group       of our States to sue EPA in on the grounds that it had       unreasonably delayed issuance of the emission guidelines, New       York v. EPA (D.D.C. No. 18-773). In that litigation, EPA       contended that it could not be compelled to issue the       guidelines because it was in the process of eliminating its       statutory obligation to regulate methane from existing       sources, a process that culminated in the Rescission Rule.        Significantly, the Rescission Rule was opposed by a wide       range of stakeholders, from independent domestic companies       such as Jonah Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources to the       largest oil and gas companies such as BP, Shell, and       ExxonMobil. These industry leaders support the direct       regulation of methane from oil and natural gas facilities       because it is the right thing to do for the environment,       will lead to consistent regulation across the U.S., and       can be cost-effectively achieved.                         The Disapproval Resolutions         Pursuant to the CRA, enacting the disapproval resolutions,       once signed by the President, results in the subject rule       ``being treated as though such rule had never taken effect.''       5 U.S.C. 801(f). Here, by restoring the 2016 rule's emission       standards for new facilities and paving the way for EPA to       facilitate state regulation of methane from existing       facilities, passing the disapproval resolutions under the CRA       would result in substantial public health, environmental, and       economic benefits. According to EPA, the 2016 rule was       expected to reduce 510,000 tons of methane, 210,000 tons of       VOCs, and 3,900 tons of hazardous air pollutants in 2025       alone. 81 Fed. Reg. at 35,827. Between the health benefits of       the 2016 rule and the increased revenues that operators would       realize from recovering natural gas that would otherwise be       released, EPA determined that the 2016 rule would result in a       net benefit of $170 million in 2025. Id. at 35,827-28.        Enacting the disapproval resolutions would also help EPA       promptly fulfill its obligation to develop emission       guidelines that states can use to craft plans to limit       methane from existing sources. Had EPA continued on the path       it began in 2016, those guidelines would have been issued       some time ago and states would now be implementing them.       Although Congress cannot turn back the clock, it can take       action now that gives EPA clear direction to promptly       discharge its overdue statutory duty to limit emissions from       these existing, polluting facilities.        Finally, passing the disapproval resolutions would not risk       invalidating any subsequent regulations pursuant to the CRA's       ``substantially the same'' language. See 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2)       (prohibiting a ``new rule that is substantially the same as       the [disapproved] rule'' unless specifically authorized by       Congress). The Trump EPA acknowledged that the Rescission       Rule is a ``deregulatory action.'' 85 Fed. Reg. at 57,067. As       discussed above, it (1) eliminates direct regulation of       methane from new facilities (removing the predicate for state       regulation of existing facilities pursuant to section 111(d)       of the Clean Air Act), (2) repeals methane and VOC limits on       new facilities in the transmission and storage sector, and       (3) creates a new legal requirement for EPA to regulate       additional pollutants from already-listed source categories       under section 111.        Disapproving the Rescission Rule thus would restore the       provisions in the 2016 rule that directly regulated methane       and VOCs from sources in the transmission and storage sector,       and would reinstate EPA's legal interpretation permitting       regulation of additional pollutants from already-listed       sources. Accordingly, disapproval of the rule would not stand       in the way of EPA using its statutory authority in the future       to promulgate more protective standards for new facilities       under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act and more protective       emission guidelines for existing facilities under its section       111(d). Indeed, it would be absurd to contend that a CRA       resolution disapproving a purely ``deregulatory action''       would bar a protective future regulation under the statute's       ``substantially the same'' language.        We urge the Senate and the House to promptly pass the CRA       resolutions disapproving the Rescission Rule. Thank you for       your consideration of this important matter.

His easy laugh and infectious  enthusiasm was always such a welcome presence, especially on excursions  onto his favorite southern New Mexico public lands. I will always  treasure the way David could put his ``engineer's brain'' to work,  diving into complex problems and looking for solutions, from public  access and wildlife habitat restoration to the siting of transmission  lines. He was also a real listener, with a rare appetite to always  learn something new. David always had time to sneak away to a quiet  corner to compare notes, share thoughts, and strategize about how to  make something better.   The decade-plus-long, community-driven effort to establish the Organ  Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument was successful because of so  many different people. But it is truly impossible to imagine it  happening without David Soules. David knew every inch of the Organ  Mountains- Desert Peaks, and his methodical documentation of historical  places, artifacts, and unique Chihuahuan desert ecosystems was  instrumental in qualifying the area for monument designation. The  National Monument and the 10 new Wilderness Areas that are now  protected forever within it will endure as an everlasting gift from  David to all of us.   David held a doctorate in mechanical engineering and became  nationally recognized expert in the field of imaging through turbulence  during his career spanning over 37 years at White Sands Missile Range.  During that same time, David became a lifelong sportsman and champion  for wildlife, serving on the New Mexico Game and Fish Commission,  coauthoring the ``Exploring Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National  Monument'' guidebook, serving as a member and supporter of numerous  nongovernmental sportsmen's and conservation organizations, including  on the boards of New Mexico Wild and the White Sands Missile Range  Historical Foundation.   David Soules was a dear friend and an incredible mentor to my boys. I  am thinking of his wife, Nancy, their two sons, Kevin and Keith, their  grandchildren, and all those who knew, loved, and will forever miss  David. Whenever I am hunting mule deer or javelina in southern New  Mexico, I will remember David and all he did to protect the wildlife  and wild places that I hold dear.
