 Madam Speaker, I was a congressional  intern on Capitol Hill when September 11 happened, and I saw my  colleagues go to the Capitol steps and sing, in a bipartisan fashion,  ``God Bless America.'' I saw a generation of people go into service  because of what they saw our first responders do in New York,  Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C., that day.   I am heartened to see today on this floor that we are uniting again  to stand up for every victim of what happened that day. I hope we can  get that passed in the Senate.   I want to honor and thank James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis  Alvarez for their work, as well as Jon Stewart. I thank him for  bringing attention to this. Also, I thank our colleague Carolyn  Maloney.   I really want to thank our chairman. This was Chairman Nadler's  district, and this has been continuing casework that the gentleman has  worked on. It has affected the gentleman, his staff, and his  constituents. I think it is fitting that the gentleman is the chairman  presiding over this today.   I am grateful the chairman has put the emotional effort and the force  of his office into making sure this happened. It means a lot to the  gentleman's constituents and us as colleagues to see his leadership.                                time  1115
