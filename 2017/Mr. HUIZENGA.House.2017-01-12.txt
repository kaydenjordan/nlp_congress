 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 78, the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act, which would improve and strengthen the  SEC's rulemaking process by requiring more rigorous economic analysis.   What exactly does that mean?   Well, an economic analysis is quite simple, frankly. It is a systemic  approach to determine the optimum use of scarce resources involving  comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective  under the given assumptions and constraints. That is a whole lot of  words and jumbo. But what we need to do is make a comparison, what is  going to be the benefit.   Economic analysis takes into account the opportunity costs of  resources employed and attempts to measure, in monetary terms, the  private and social costs and benefits of a project to a community, an  economy, or to an individual.   In its simplest terms, the SEC would have to determine the costs and  benefits of proposed regulations, as well as potential alternatives to  determine a best direction forward, basically ensuring that the SEC is  thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation and adequately  evaluating the potential consequences, both intended and unintended,  and is there a benefit.   Mr. Chairman, requiring economic analysis by Federal regulators is  not a partisan issue. In fact, both President Clinton and President  Obama issued executive orders requiring regulators to ensure that their  rules were maximizing and achieving a net benefit.   H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, would ensure  consistent and effective application of the SEC's economic analysis  guidance by building on the bipartisan effort to strengthen economic  analysis requirements, as well as require a retrospective review of  existing regulations for independent agencies like the SEC.   Specifically, the bill would enhance the SEC's existing economic  analysis requirements by requiring the Commission to first clearly  identify the nature of the problem that would be addressed before  issuing a new regulation--too often, we are just shooting at a target  that we don't even know is actually a target--and to prohibit the SEC  from issuing a rule when it cannot make ``a reasoned determination that  the benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs of the  regulation.''   Additionally, H.R. 78 would require the SEC to assess the costs and  the benefits of available regulatory alternatives, including the  alternative of not issuing a regulation, and choose the approach that  would maximize the net benefit. The SEC must also evaluate whether a  proposed regulation is inconsistent or incompatible or duplicative of  other Federal regulations.   In testimony before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and  Government Sponsored Enterprises last year, former SEC Commissioner Dan  Gallagher noted that the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would  ``promote and improve economic analysis at the SEC and make the agency  even more accountable to the investing public.'' He further testified  that this bill ``will help ensure the economic analysis conducted by  economists is firmly entrenched in every rulemaking the SEC conducts  under the Federal securities laws.''   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of New York). The time of the gentleman  has expired.    Mr. Chair, I commend the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner) for introducing this important piece of legislation,  which will equip the SEC with the necessary tools to ensure that all  future SEC regulations will meet these standards with the ultimate goal  of achieving the SEC's statutory mission of protecting investors and  facilitating capital formation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  important bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Let me point out how H.R. 78 tilts their decisionmaking process  toward Wall Street. First, let's go back and review everything the  President-elect said about Wall Street, and then we can understand  exactly what is being done here.   In August 2015, President-elect Trump told CBS: ``The hedge fund guys  didn't build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and  they get lucky. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It's ridiculous,  okay?''   In January 2016, Trump told Iowans: ``I'm not going to let Wall  Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems  for us.''   I repeat, he said: ``Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for  us.''   In February of 2016, Trump said: ``I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,  they have total control over Hillary Clinton.''   In July of 2016, Trump tweeted: ``Hillary will never reform Wall  Street. She is owned by Wall Street.''   He also told Iowans: ``I don't care about the Wall Street guys. I'm  not taking any of their money.''   Now, Trump has totally betrayed his promise to drain the swamp. He  has appointed Goldman Sachs bankers to the Treasury and the National  Economic Council, and his pick to head the Securities and Exchange  Commission is a lawyer whose career has been based upon defending Wall  Street, including Goldman Sachs. This legislation today is part and  parcel to that betrayal.   This is how you do it: cost-benefit analysis, you can attach this to  any and all monetary and financial services legislation. You can attach  it wherever you would like and, thus, cause the delays, cause the  undermining of legislation, put the SEC in the position where it has to  defend in court, costing them more money that they don't have because  they have denied them adequate funding.                                time  1445    This is what this is all about. How do we get our Wall Street friends  and cronies back into the business, because Dodd-Frank began to deal  with them and to reverse some of what had been happening for far too  long. Now they come with this attack and they talk about cost-benefit  analysis. Mr. Chairman, this is what they are going to use to ride  their way back into making  [[Page H431]]  sure that they give the protection and the advantages to all of their  friends on Wall Street.   Mr. Trump was not about draining the swamp. He is about making sure  that there is a swamp, digging it deeper and wider.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, despite the personal attacks happening on  the floor here, I am glad to see that we are making real progress.  Apparently, we are making an impact here.   With that, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  King).   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 78, the  SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. If passed, the SEC would be required  to follow President Obama's executive order that requires a thorough  cost-benefit analysis of new rules and a comprehensive review of  existing regulations. Under current law, the SEC must consider the  effect of its rules on ``efficiency, competition, and capital  formation,'' and weighing costs and benefits is necessary to meet this  requirement.   Cost-benefit analysis is not a new idea. Agencies have done this kind  of analysis for over 30 years. In fact, it is a bipartisan idea. In  1981, President Reagan issued an executive order requiring Cabinet- level agencies to engage in cost-benefit analysis, which President  Clinton expanded with another executive order in 1993.   Unfortunately, independent agencies are not subject to executive  orders and those regulated by the SEC have suffered as a result. From  2005 to 2012, SEC regulations were overturned consistently by the  courts for inadequate economic analysis and unjustified costs. While  the SEC has taken steps to improve its rulemaking process, H.R. 78 will  ensure that future rules maximize economic benefit and companies do not  face unnecessary hurdles when they access our capital markets.  Democrats and Republicans often do not agree on policy, but I hope we  can agree on the need for a fair, transparent, and informed process.   I thank my distinguished colleague for introducing this vital  legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of  my time to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 78, the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act. This bill would require the SEC to do an  absurd amount of time-consuming, duplicative cost-benefit analysis  before they can even propose a rule. This is the fourth time, Mr.  Chairman, that we are voting on this partisan bill because the previous  three times the bill has been rejected by the Senate and President  Obama has strongly opposed it.   But let's be clear about what this bill is not about. It is not about  ensuring that the SEC conducts a cost-benefit analysis on the rules. If  that were the case, then no legislation would be necessary. The SEC is  already required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and has already  adopted internal guidance on economic analysis that mirrors the exact  requirements of this bill before us today. So the problem is not that  the SEC doesn't currently conduct cost-benefit analyses or that it does  it poorly; the real goal of this bill is simply to give the industry  more chances to sue the SEC on cost-benefit grounds when it issues  rules the industry does not like. That is essentially the only thing  that would change if this bill were signed into law.   The SEC's cost-benefit analysis would be the same, but the industry  would have more opportunities to sue the SEC over alleged flaws in the  cost-benefit analysis. And the threat of a lawsuit would force the SEC  to divert even more of its scarce resources to cost-benefit analysis,  which would delay the key reforms and undermine the SEC's ability to  protect investors--their core mission.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, as they have in three  previous votes before this body.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the whip of our Financial Services Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman of the  Capital Markets Subcommittee.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to what is the balance  of the time remaining on each side?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 10\1/4\ minutes  remaining. The gentlewoman from New York has 6\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Royce), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, this has been an issue in  Europe. It has been an issue in the United States. I would like to make  the point that, with respect to looking at economic analysis and making  certain that it is bipartisan, I think there is a way to make certain  it is objective.   As I look at the underlying text and then look at the amendment that  we are accepting, we should reflect on this. We are going to have the  SEC here look at both the protection of investors and the effects to  ensure competition and efficiency. So I would explain to the Members  that adding that into what I already thought was pretty exacting rules  here in terms of an objective analysis should really succeed in our  attempt here.   And what is the attempt in this Regulatory Accountability Act?   It is to make sure that the U.S. capital markets are unmatched in  terms of their size, their depth, their resiliency, and transparency.  And this Regulatory Accountability Act gives the Commission the  opportunity to ensure that its rules and regulations, past and present,  each of those are worth pursuing when measured against their economic  costs.   Growing access to capital, protecting investors, preserving the  world's strongest capital markets are not mutually exclusive objectives  here.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.   Mr. ROYCE of California. And here is what I would like to point out.  The European Union clearly recognizes this conundrum right now. They  are launching a call for evidence to investigate the unintended  consequences created by their regulatory framework because they are  searching for balance in this, too, to make sure that they have  retrospective examination.   It is prudent. Frankly, as the effectiveness of regulation is  measured by outcomes rather than volume in a situation like this, it  drives us toward efficiency in the market.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I want to point out that with Dodd-Frank and the reforms that the  Democrats put in place, our economy bounded back faster and stronger  than all of Europe. And I must say that one of the areas that we need  to work on, where we are falling behind in our economy, is exports. We  need to support exports.   Despite all the talk that we hear from Republicans about enacting  policies that support jobs and job creation, and the slew of tweets  from the President-elect discouraging American companies from moving  U.S. jobs overseas--and I support his efforts to stop our companies  from going overseas--one proven job creator has remained on the  sidelines, and that is the U.S. Export-Import Bank. This Bank has  played a critical role in opening up international markets to U.S.  exporters, which, in turn, helps create and preserve jobs here in  America.   The export-import banks of our competitors are supported by those  countries five times more than what we do here in America. In fact, the  ability of the Export-Import Bank to even operate, even though it makes  money and has succeeded in building up American exports, has been  hamstrung by the leadership of my good friends and colleagues on the  other side of the aisle.   In recognition of the Bank's success and supporting U.S. jobs over  the past 80 years, in December of 2015 the House and the Senate voted  with overwhelming majorities to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.  Despite this broad support, the Bank has remained hamstrung because,  with three empty seats on its five-member board, the Bank lacks the  quorum it needs in order to approve transactions over $10 million.   Although President Obama nominated two individuals to serve on the  Ex-Im's bipartisan board, the Senate Republican leadership refused to  consider them, and Ex-Im's board remains without a quorum. They can not  approve these exports. I think it is a national scandal.   Indeed, it has been more than 18 months since the Export-Import  Bank's board was last able to consider transactions, which has limited  its ability to ensure U.S. workers and businesses of all sizes are able  to compete around the world for contracts, as well as support jobs for  the many small businesses that contribute to the supply chains for  these high-value exports.                                time  1515    In fact, the bank currently has 50 transactions in its pipeline  valued at nearly $40 billion, which, if approved, would support more  than 100,000 American high-skill and high-wage jobs. I intend to bring  this to the attention of the President-elect.   So, as we talk today about how these Republican bills will create  American jobs, I think it is important that we look at the GOP's full  record on job creation or, might I say in this case, job prevention. As  their record shows, Republican leaders have been all too willing to let  U.S. jobs slip away to our foreign competitors.   Until Congress restores Ex-Im to full functionality, U.S. companies  selling expensive capital goods such as aircraft, locomotives, nuclear  reactors, and turbines will remain at a unique competitive disadvantage  because their foreign competitors all enjoy ample financing from their  home-country export credit agencies--enough to easily knock U.S.  companies out of the competition. This is unfair.   We cannot compete and win in the global economy unless we support our  businesses. We will lose global market share in key sectors such as the  satellite industry, aerospace, and telecommunications. We will lose  tens of thousands of jobs as some of the biggest U.S. exports suffer  declining overseas sales, and, eventually, some of  [[Page H436]]  these companies would be forced to move jobs to where export credit is  still available. We have seen this reported in the news daily where  they are moving to our competitors.   So, in short, we need to support the Export-Import Bank. We need to  not hamstring the SEC by requiring it to have unnecessary, time- consuming, duplicative rules that are already in place and that allow  people to sue them more easily.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  care, as President-elect Trump does, about job creation to be opposed  to this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the balance of the  time remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 7 minutes  remaining. The gentlewoman from New York's time has expired.    Mr. Chairman, at this time, I do not intend to yield to  the gentlewoman from New York, even though I struggle to understand how  the Export-Import Bank had anything to do with what we are talking  about here today.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a new member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would just like to point out to those watching on TV the earlier  Democrat-sponsored hot air portion of the bill today.   You heard about the Export-Import Bank. You heard about Bernie  Madoff. You heard about the Dodd-Frank Act being the only answer to an  economic crisis that was caused by a housing crisis which, by the way,  the Dodd-Frank Act did nothing about. By the way, on the Bernie Madoff  situation, the SEC ignored a whistleblower for 10 years.   This bill has nothing to do with fraud, and it is not about a trial  of the effectiveness or lack thereof of the SEC today. This is about a  commonsense notion that we ought to actually identify the target that  these rules are trying to hit and then find out if it is the right  target and analyze that.   What you see on the other side of the aisle is the philosophy that  more is better: the more regulation that the SEC has, the more  paperwork, a bigger budget with more employees. We are not sure what  their effectiveness is, and we are not sure what exactly they are  trying to achieve here, but all we can tell you is that more is better.  Damn the costs; it doesn't matter.   That is, obviously, not the intent that we have on this side of the  aisle. We are trying to make sure that the  [[Page H437]]  proper protection of the investors is there. We are trying to make sure  that the three parts of the SEC's mandate, of which one of those is  capital formation and creating a robust atmosphere, are actually  happening.   I urge passage of the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 78         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``SEC Regulatory       Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSIDERATION BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE                     COMMISSION OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ITS                     REGULATIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER AGENCY ACTIONS.         Section 23 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78w) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Consideration of Costs and Benefits.--        ``(1) In general.--Before issuing a regulation under the       securities laws, as defined in section 3(a), the Commission       shall--        ``(A) clearly identify the nature and source of the problem       that the proposed regulation is designed to address, as well       as assess the significance of that problem, to enable       assessment of whether any new regulation is warranted;        ``(B) utilize the Chief Economist to assess the costs and       benefits, both qualitative and quantitative, of the intended       regulation and propose or adopt a regulation only on a       reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended       regulation justify the costs of the regulation;        ``(C) identify and assess available alternatives to the       regulation that were considered, including modification of an       existing regulation, together with an explanation of why the       regulation meets the regulatory objectives more effectively       than the alternatives; and        ``(D) ensure that any regulation is accessible, consistent,       written in plain language, and easy to understand and shall       measure, and seek to improve, the actual results of       regulatory requirements.        ``(2) Considerations and actions.--        ``(A) Required actions.--In deciding whether and how to       regulate, the Commission shall assess the costs and benefits       of available regulatory alternatives, including the       alternative of not regulating, and choose the approach that       maximizes net benefits. Specifically, the Commission shall--        ``(i) consistent with the requirements of section 3(f) (15       U.S.C. 78c(f)), section 2(b) of the Securities Act of 1933       (15 U.S.C. 77b(b)), section 202(c) of the Investment Advisers       Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-2(c)), and section 2(c) of the       Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(c)), consider       whether the rulemaking will promote efficiency, competition,       and capital formation;        ``(ii) evaluate whether, consistent with obtaining       regulatory objectives, the regulation is tailored to impose       the least burden on society, including market participants,       individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other       entities (including State and local governmental entities),       taking into account, to the extent practicable, the       cumulative costs of regulations; and        ``(iii) evaluate whether the regulation is inconsistent,       incompatible, or duplicative of other Federal regulations.        ``(B) Additional considerations.--In addition, in making a       reasoned determination of the costs and benefits of a       potential regulation, the Commission shall, to the extent       that each is relevant to the particular proposed regulation,       take into consideration the impact of the regulation on--        ``(i) investor choice;        ``(ii) market liquidity in the securities markets; and        ``(iii) small businesses.        ``(3) Explanation and comments.--The Commission shall       explain in its final rule the nature of comments that it       received, including those from the industry or consumer       groups concerning the potential costs or benefits of the       proposed rule or proposed rule change, and shall provide a       response to those comments in its final rule, including an       explanation of any changes that were made in response to       those comments and the reasons that the Commission did not       incorporate those industry group concerns related to the       potential costs or benefits in the final rule.        ``(4) Review of existing regulations.--Not later than 1       year after the date of enactment of the SEC Regulatory       Accountability Act, and every 5 years thereafter, the       Commission shall review its regulations to determine whether       any such regulations are outmoded, ineffective, insufficient,       or excessively burdensome, and shall modify, streamline,       expand, or repeal them in accordance with such review. In       reviewing any regulation (including, notwithstanding       paragraph (6), a regulation issued in accordance with formal       rulemaking provisions) that subjects issuers with a public       float of $250,000,000 or less to the attestation and       reporting requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-      Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7262(b)), the Commission shall       specifically take into account the large burden of such       regulation when compared to the benefit of such regulation.        ``(5) Post-adoption impact assessment.--        ``(A) In general.--Whenever the Commission adopts or amends       a regulation designated as a `major rule' within the meaning       of section 804(2) of title 5, United States Code, it shall       state, in its adopting release, the following:        ``(i) The purposes and intended consequences of the       regulation.        ``(ii) Appropriate post-implementation quantitative and       qualitative metrics to measure the economic impact of the       regulation and to measure the extent to which the regulation       has accomplished the stated purposes.        ``(iii) The assessment plan that will be used, consistent       with the requirements of subparagraph (B) and under the       supervision of the Chief Economist of the Commission, to       assess whether the regulation has achieved the stated       purposes.        ``(iv) Any unintended or negative consequences that the       Commission foresees may result from the regulation.        ``(B) Requirements of assessment plan and report.--        ``(i) Requirements of plan.--The assessment plan required       under this paragraph shall consider the costs, benefits, and       intended and unintended consequences of the regulation.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO OTHER REGULATORY                     ENTITIES.         It is the sense of the Congress that the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board should also follow the       requirements of section 23(e) of such Act, as added by this       title.       SEC. 4. ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISION RELATING TO OTHER REGULATORY                     ENTITIES.         A rule adopted by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board       or any national securities association registered under       section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.       78o-3) shall not take effect unless the Securities and       Exchange Commission determines that, in adopting such rule,       the Board  [[Page H438]]       or association has complied with the requirements of section       23(e) of such Act, as added by section 2, in the same manner       as is required by the Commission under such section 23(e).    The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except  those printed in part A of House Report 115-3. Each such amendment may  be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member  designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable  for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by  the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and  shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question.               Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Al Green of Texas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in part A of House Report 115-3.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk  as the designee of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 3, strike ``and''.        Page 3, line 8, strike the period and insert ``; and''.        Page 3, after line 8, insert the following:        ``(E) in consultation with the Office of Ethics Counsel of       the Commission, identify any former nongovernmental employer       of a Commissioner, Director, Deputy Director, Associate       Director, or Assistant Director that would receive direct or       indirect benefit from a rule or regulation, analyze the       benefits to such employer, and whether the regulation should       be amended to address any potential conflict of interest or       appearance of a conflict of interest.''.        Page 6, after line 5, insert the following:        ``(5) Conflicts of interest.--The Commission shall identify       the employers of any Commissioners, Directors, Deputy       Directors, Associate Directors, and Assistant Directors who       have left the Commission within five years of the scheduled       adoption of the final rule, and whether such employers       receive direct or indirect benefits, and whether the       Commission should amend the rule to address the identified       conflict of interest.''.        Page 7, line 19, insert after the period the following:       ``The assessment plan shall also include an analysis of       whether and how any former nongovernmental employer of a       Commissioner, Director, Deputy Director, Associate Director,       or Assistant Director, or the current employer of a former       Commissioner, Director, Deputy Director, Associate Director,       or Assistant Director who departed the Commission within five       years of the scheduled adoption of the regulation, directly       and indirectly benefits from the regulation, and a       recommendation as to whether such regulation should be       amended to address the identified conflict of interest.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Al Green) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I think it appropriate to point  out what the style of this bill is, what the words on the actual bill  say. There seems to be some confusion with my colleagues on the other  side as to whether or not this is a mom-and-pop bill.   The bill itself says, ``A bill to improve the consideration by the  Securities and Exchange Commission of the cost and benefits of its  regulations and orders.''   The Securities and Exchange Commission deals with Wall Street, deals  with megabusinesses. This is not about a mom-and-pop store. This is not  about the small business in the neighborhood. This is about  megabusinesses desiring to have access to markets without the  regulations necessary to protect investors.   This bill, if it passes, will place the SEC in a mission impossible  position because it will be impossible for the SEC to do what it needs  to do to promote regulations that will prevent fraud. Either litigation  will stop them or they won't be able to define and quantify the  benefits associated with regulation that can prevent fraud.   A good example has been presented, but some things bear repeating. If  we had produced regulations that would have prevented Bernie Madoff  from robbing the country of $64 billion, we wouldn't have known it, we  couldn't quantify it, because it wasn't knowable.   This bill puts the SEC in a position of having to do that which is  not knowable because it would prevent fraud.                                time  1530    Now, having said this, the Waters amendment will at least allow us to  curtail some of the conflicts of interest that can take place by  persons who will come from some entity that works with persons on Wall  Street or when they leave, go to an entity that works with Wall Street.  Our regulators ought not be able to take their rules and regulations to  companies and businesses that will impact Wall Street after they leave  or impact their businesses once they are on Wall Street.   This amendment that the Honorable Maxine Waters has presented would  cause the SEC to identify, analyze, and address potential conflicts of  interest in its proposed rules, and it would go on to make sure that  persons who work for the SEC do not create conflicts of interest.   We live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right;  they must also look right. It doesn't look right for these Wall Street  types, the persons from Goldman Sachs and related industries who will  come to Wall Street, take jobs, and promote rules that benefit their  former employers, nor does it look right for them to produce rules that  will benefit employers that they will go to when they leave Wall  Street.   That is what this amendment will prevent. It is simple. It is not  complicated, and it deals with conflicts of interest. I think this  amendment ought to be supported.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Palmer). The gentleman from Michigan is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I feel compelled to point out to my  colleagues that we are not paid by the word that is put into the  Federal Register. I think, once again, you are hearing this example of  more is better. It doesn't matter what the words say, just let's have  more of them.   We already have the SEC Chairman and the Commissioners covered by  both governmentwide ethics laws and regulations as well as SEC  supplemental ethics regulations which apply to all SEC employees. For  example, they cannot participate personally and substantially in any  matter that would have direct or predictable effect on his or her  financial interests or imputed financial interests in the future, as  required under the code.   Also, unless they are specifically authorized by the SEC's ethics  counsel, they should recuse from any matter in which he or she has a  ``covered relationship.'' Well, what is a covered relationship? Well, a  covered relationship includes former employees, clients, and even a  spouse's employer. Further, the SEC employees must report their  financial holdings to the SEC's ethics counsel; and this requirement  goes beyond, frankly, the governmentwide reporting requirement.   Finally, the SEC Chairman or a Commissioner must not engage in any  other business, employment, or vocation while in office; nor may he or  she ever use the power of their office to influence their name to  promote the business interests of others, as required by law.   As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have  remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me say this in my 1 minute.  It appears that the other side believes that nothing is better because  that is what this bill would cause the SEC to produce--nothing. It  would stagnate the SEC. It would place the SEC in litigation. It would  literally decimate the SEC because you cannot quantify bills or  regulations that will prevent fraud. You can't quantify it. I have  given you the example.   I know the public is listening. You need to weigh in on this, members  of the public, because this is not about mom-and-pops. It is about  megacorporations. This piece of legislation that Ms. Waters offers at  least  [[Page H439]]  will deal with conflicts of interest beyond the person who happens to  work with the SEC, which is what has been addressed. It will deal with  conflicts of interest as they relate to the businesses that they will  go to or the businesses that they have left.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will wrap up here by simply saying that  the bill before us today is intending to clarify--or have the SEC, I  should say, clarify what the goal and objective is of their proposed  rule. Let's find out what they are trying to do, and then, more  importantly, find out if it is actually effective.   There might be a rule in place already somewhere else. The other side  is trying to strike that provision. They are trying to say: No. No. It  doesn't matter what the other hand of government is saying. We are  going to just add more and more regulation added on.   We need to have a clear understanding of what the objective is, what  the target is, and whether it is an effective rule to get to that  point. I just would encourage my colleagues to oppose the Waters-Green  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will  be postponed.                   Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Velazquez    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in part A of House Report 115-3.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition to this amendment, though I am not opposed.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Michigan?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment and  support its immediate passage. I want to thank the sponsor for working  with us to draft the language that is consistent with the SEC's  tripartite mission to: number one, protect investors; number two,  maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and, number three,  facilitate capital formation.   I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the  amendment and the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).   The amendment was agreed to.               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Al Green of Texas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in part A of House Report 115-3.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 10, line 16, strike ``and''.        Page 10, line 20, strike the first period and all that       follows and insert ``; and''.        Page 10, after line 20, insert the following:        ``(iv) a regulation promulgated to maintain or support U.S.       financial stability or prevent or reduce systemic risk.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Al Green) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, this amendment would exclude from  this bill regulations that would promote financial stability and  prevent or reduce systemic risk. I have indicated previously that we  are concerned about the bill's unintended consequence--I don't think  that my colleagues are doing this with malice aforethought--the  unintended consequence of stagnating the SEC to the point that it  cannot produce regulations that will prevent fraud. Nowhere in the bill  does it exempt regulation that will prevent fraud.   I believe that this will help us because the bill needs to allow the  SEC the ability to move at the speed of innovation. These products are  coming on the market. The best way for the SEC to be able to react to  them efficaciously would be for the SEC to have rulemaking authority at  the same speed of the innovation.   I hope that we won't allow the SEC to be bogged down with a cost- benefit  [[Page H440]]  analysis that is impossible to produce and that, when produced, will  produce litigation. Again, I think this is a reasoned, thoughtful  amendment. I trust that it will be adopted.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I just find it a bit ironic that the  other side is not interested in doing this cost-benefit analysis which  is in the underlying bill here because it is too burdensome. But what  do they want to do? They want to add more paperwork and more burden in  their amendments.   Despite what you have heard, the SEC is not a systemic risk  regulator; and even the former chairman of the Committee on Financial  Services, Barney Frank, noted at the time when the FSOC was reviewing  asset managers for systemic designations, he recognized that these are  not entities that pose a systemic risk to the financial system. And  while the SEC does not regulate systemic risk, I am afraid that this  amendment could be potentially politically misinterpreted and applied  to a number of capital market participants and activities which they,  frankly, have no business regulating. So it would lead to the same  fire, aim, ready kind of situation rulemaking that we have seen from  the current administration that hinders growth and that capital market  formation that we have just talked about in the last amendment.   The bill before us will ensure that future SEC rulemakings are  prudently proposed and adopted to achieve the maximum net benefit, and  that is what we are really talking about here today. While I support  the underlying bill, I will have to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545    Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend across  the aisle that the Volcker rule does deal with systemic risk. I would  remind him that the SEC does play a role in regulating systemic risk.   Having said that, let's just talk again. And I would engage in a  colloquy with you and use my time. Explain to me how you would quantify  a regulation designed to prevent fraud such as the fraud perpetrated by  Madoff.   How would you quantify it in dollars and cents? Because that is what  you are all about, dollars and cents. How do you quantify that?    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    This has nothing to do with Bernie Madoff since the  whistleblower approached the SEC and the SEC, using its dollars, was  not able to stop him.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, it does have  to do--you are trying to divert us from the actual problem, which is  regulations that can prevent fraud.   How do you propose to quantify in dollars and cents regulations that  will prevent fraud when the fraud that can be perpetrated is not  knowable?   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Working together  on the Financial Services Committee, we know that there are actuarial  tables and analyze risk all the time. You are able to analyze fraud.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Reclaiming my time, there is no way for anyone  to have known.    You are able to analyze that risk.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I reclaim my time. There is no way for anyone  to have known what Bernie Madoff was going to do. It was not knowable.  You are imposing a mission impossible upon the SEC.   There is a real question that has to be answered today, Mr. Chair, or  at some point in the future: Does Congress regulate Wall Street or does  Wall Street regulate Congress?   Now, this is a serious question because that is what this kind of  regulation gives us the image of being a part of.   Wall Street wants this. This benefits Wall Street. It doesn't benefit  mom and pops. It doesn't benefit Main Street. It benefits  megacorporations. And you can couch the language in any clever way that  you want.   In the final analysis, this is all about megacorporations being able  to do things that would prevent--that would not be in the best interest  of investors. Investors who are listening to this. You ought to be  concerned. This impacts you. If this legislation passes, your  opportunity to participate in Wall Street with regulations that are  going to prevent fraud from being perpetrated upon you--similar to what  Madoff perpetrated--will not be possible.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to address their remarks to  the Chair.   The gentleman from Michigan is recognized.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the remaining balance  of the time.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 3\1/2\ minutes  remaining, and the gentleman from Texas has 30 seconds remaining.    At this point I am ready to close and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me simply say  this: People who are viewing this at home should become very much  concerned about the direction that we are headed in. This is a new  Congress and here we are currently trying to emasculate the SEC by  putting it in a position such that it cannot produce rules to  protecting investors; by requiring it to know the unknowable; to know  that a rule that you are putting in place to prevent fraud has a  quantifiable dollar amount that you can produce so that you can measure  that against the cost of producing the rule.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment that I propose would benefit the SEC and  investors.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out to all of  my colleagues and to the American people that currently the SEC is  under a court order to clarify how exactly they are doing their  rulemaking. And there is a staff-level rule letter.   With this underlying bill, we are trying to codify that. We are  trying to make sure, not just with a letter, but by law, that they do  what they are being ordered to do. And I will remind all of my  colleagues and those of you out watching us, the Securities and  Exchange Commission has a mission that has three parts.   The first part is to protect investors. Nothing in this bill weakens  there. Nothing in this bill takes anything away from that. We, in fact,  underscore that.   The second mission that it has is to maintain fair, orderly, and  efficient markets. Emphasis again, fair, orderly, and efficient  markets. What we are seeing is inefficiency that is being built into  the marketplace right now, and we are here to clarify that. Let's find  out, as the SEC is preparing a rule, what the goal and objective is and  what is going to be the impact on it. Yes, cost is part of that, and we  are able to look at that.   The third thing the SEC intended to do is to facilitate capital  formation.   Why is that important and what exactly does that mean?   It means making sure that there is enough money around so that  companies, big, medium, and small, are able to go in there and get the  cash and the credit that they need to go and expand and do the job that  they are trying to do, which is, by the way, employ all of us in  America.   We have talked a lot about the underlying bill and not so much about  the particular amendment that we have before us, but I do continue to  oppose the amendment and encourage the passage of the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.  [[Page H441]]         Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR.

The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, again, I think we are stumbling over the  fact that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that we  are somehow paid by the words put into the Federal Registry here.   The SEC is already covered by both governmentwide ethics laws and  regulations as well as SEC supplemental ethics regulations which apply  to all SEC employees, including the Chair.   Perhaps the sponsor of the amendment is not aware that under existing  Federal law, the SEC Chairman cannot participate personally in any  matter that would have a direct and predictable effect on her financial  interests or imputed financial interest, and I would invite the sponsor  to review the code at this point.   Additionally, SEC supplemental regulations prohibit SEC employees,  including the Chair, from holding any security in a directly regulated  entity, and they must also preclear all purchases and sales of  securities.   Further, the Chairman or Commissioner must not engage in any other  business, employment, or vocation while in office, nor may she ever use  the power of her office or the influence of her name to promote the  business interests of others.   Finally, the amendment does not seem to address what I believe  Congressman DeSaulnier's description is intending to address as it is  the Federal Reserve, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, that  regulates the too-big-to-fail banks or, as the amendment states,  financial institutions.   The SEC does not regulate financial institutions. The code defines  the term ``financial institution,'' and the definition includes ``a  bank, a foreign bank, and a savings association.''   Since the SEC does not regulate any of these entities, the amendment  would require the SEC Chair to divest of exactly zero entities. So  notwithstanding that important discrepancy here, I ask my colleagues to  join me in opposing the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I honestly respect the tutorial, but,  with all due respect, I do think that this amendment complements the  existing rules and protects the investors.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Chairman, at this time I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I really think  this is, as intended, a commonsense amendment. I do think it  complements rather than adds on to the existing requirements to protect  investors. And I really think this House, with all due respect, would  want to see the markets work efficiently. We also want to ensure that  the integrity of those markets and the investors are also strengthened.  So I think transparency in this case with the acknowledgment that there  are other already existing regulations and the belief that this  amendment complements those, I would ask for the House's support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Chairman, I would just point out again that this  [[Page H442]]  amendment does not hit the target. The SEC does not regulate financial  institutions. 15 U.S.C. 78c defines the term ``financial  institutions,'' and that definition includes a bank, a foreign bank,  and a savings association. The SEC does not regulate any of the  entities that are described in this.   In addition to that, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Chair-- Chairwoman in this instance, who will be resigning soon--is covered  under governmentwide ethics rules and laws. The SEC has additional SEC- specific rules that are in place. This amendment would do absolutely  nothing to support or diminish those because it doesn't actually  address any situation that they have.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Raskin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in part A of House Report 115-3.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I believe the sponsor of the amendment  was in the Chamber when we were discussing this on the last amendment.  Federal law, as well as SEC supplemental regulations, already govern  ethics and conflicts of interest.   It is well-known, especially if you check out my Twitter account, I  think, that most people who support this President don't believe I  support this President enough. A number of people would say that I  haven't supported the SEC Chairman to the level that I should. This,  frankly, is insulting to the current President as well as the Chair.  Implying somehow that this Chair has preyed off of poor people until  they went bankrupt, as was just sort of laid out by the sponsor of  this, is an insult.   To believe this of the SEC Chair, who is typically--and I know in  this particular case is--a very accomplished professional, is amazingly  shortsighted, I believe. Additionally, the Chair is required to receive  personal annual ethics training as well as an initial ethics briefing.  I direct the sponsor to review the statute on this.   Additionally, the Chairman and the Commissioners are required to file  an ethics agreement letter in which she will agree to divest prohibited  assets, and if she has not done so prior to the appointment, she is to  recuse herself from matters in which she has financial conflict or the  impartiality conflict, which can be found also in code.   Finally, the Chairman or a Commissioner is prohibited from engaging  in any other business, employment, or vocation while in office, or she  may never use the power of her office or her name to promote or  influence a business interest.   Once again, I think that what we are trying to do here with the  underlying bill is to make sure that the SEC follows through on what  the courts have mandated in previous rulings in that they use a cost- benefit analysis. This is not about fraud. This is not about whether  Mary Jo White needs ethics training. This is about making sure that the  SEC has an identifiable target and goal with the rules that it is  putting in place and then analyzing whether the costs and the benefits  weigh in favor of protecting the consumer. Ultimately, this amendment  does nothing to forward that. I oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand that the sponsor is a  constitutional law professor.   I direct the gentleman to 5 CFR 2638.305 and 5 CFR 2638.304, which  read:         The Chair of the SEC is required to receive in person       annual ethics training as well as an initial ethics briefing.       Additionally, Chairmen and Commissioners are required to file       ethics agreement letters in which they agree to divest.    The bottom line is that we don't need additional words in the Federal  Register to do what is already being done.   The sponsor of the amendment mentioned that cost-benefit analysis is  not in the U.S. Constitution, but neither is the SEC. However, due  process is in the Constitution, and what we are trying to get at is due  process to make sure that we have--us, as a legislative body--properly  involved and engaged in this and that we understand what the goals and  objectives of the Securities and Exchange Commission are when it is  issuing a rule and whether that rule is going to effect the change  intended.   What are those benefits? Is it going to benefit and protect the  consumer?   Again, I reiterate the three elements of the mission of the  Securities and Exchange Commission: number one, to protect investors;  number two, to maintain fair and orderly and efficient markets; and  number three, to facilitate capital formation. Those are the stated  goals and is the job of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I maintain my opposition to this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I have to commend my colleague. This is  close, but this isn't horseshoes. Words have meaning. And I have to  tell you that our underlying bill does actually do what you are talking  about.                                time  1700    I will direct you to page 4.   Page 4: ``evaluate whether, consistent with obtaining regulatory  objectives, the regulation is tailored to impose the least burden on  society, including market participants, individuals, businesses of  different sizes, and other entities, including State and local  government entities, taking into account, to the extent practicable,  the cumulative costs of regulations.''  [[Page H447]]    So, what we have here, Mr. Speaker, is a problem. We have a problem  with U.S. businesses not performing the way that they should. We have  to understand, though, why that is happening.   I have to point out to my colleague that, frankly, we have fewer  publicly traded companies in this country right now. You have to ask  yourself why.   We have virtually no IPOs happening in this country. You have to ask  yourself why.   Well, we know the answer. It is because we have overly burdened  ourselves in this country and are no longer competitive.   In fact, here is what I look forward to on January 21: I look forward  to repealing the Tax Code that we have, and then we don't have to  worry; I am looking forward to repealing ObamaCare, and then we don't  have to worry; I am looking forward to real regulatory reform, and then  we don't have to worry about that as a country.   So, while this may be close on the objective of what our sponsor is  trying to do, I would recommend voting against this motion to recommit  and vote for the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote     Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my friend Betsy DeVos,  President-elect Trump's nominee to serve as the next Secretary for the  Department of Education.   Betsy is a passionate and dedicated servant with a big heart for  kids. She is a grandmother of five who has made it her life's mission  to ensure that all children in America have access to a quality  education no matter what their ZIP Codes are. Betsy has fought for  children in classrooms to State capitals, and her efforts have given  more kids hope for a brighter future. In our shared home State of  Michigan, Betsy led the effort to pass the State's first charter school  law. According to Stanford University, Michigan's charter school  students now perform at a higher level than do their peers.   I witnessed Betsy's creativity and discipline firsthand when we  served together on the board of the Compass College of Cinematic Arts,  a Grand Rapids, Michigan-based film school and production company. We  implemented rigorous standards that set Compass up for accreditation,  and it now holds them accountable.  [[Page H453]]    I know that Betsy is up to the challenge of ensuring our children are  prepared to compete and thrive in our ever-changing world.                            ____________________
