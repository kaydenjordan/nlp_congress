 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Smith for leading this  Special Order.   The topic that we are here to discuss tonight is one of the utmost  importance. Of course, next week, we approach the 47th anniversary of  the infamous Roe v. Wade decision. With this single ruling by the  Supreme Court, abortion was legalized across the country.   While many abortion activists celebrate this time as a victory for  so-called women's health, it represents a somber occasion for those of  us who advocate for life.   It is no secret that I am unapologetically pro-life. I believe life  begins at conception, and I am opposed to abortion at any stage.   While not everyone in this body shares my convictions about life or  on certain policies surrounding the rights of unborn children, our pro- life agenda has momentum, and it is strong.   Next week, thousands of Americans will gather in our Nation's Capital  to participate in this year's March for Life. This is an annual event  where the pro-life community joins together to advocate for the  protection of unborn children.   I know that some pro-life supporters will be traveling from Alabama's  Second District, almost 900 miles, to defend the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to send a message to the  thousands of marchers who are gathering to show their support for the  pro-life movement: Thank you. Thank you for your dedication to this  most worthy cause, and know that you are not alone in this fight. As  you continue to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves,  remember that my pro-life colleagues and I stand with you.   I promise to use this platform here in Congress, and beyond, to be a  vocal advocate for the unborn. I will not stop fighting until our laws  and policies protect life at every stage, and I hope you won't either.
