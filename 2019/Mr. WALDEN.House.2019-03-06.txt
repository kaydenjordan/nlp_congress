 Mr. Speaker, due to my attendance at memorial services  following the untimely passing of Dennis Richardson, Oregon's 26th  Secretary of State, I was in Oregon and missed votes. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 106 and ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 107.                            ____________________
