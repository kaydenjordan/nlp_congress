 Mr. Speaker, as a Member who has voted  against a number of large spending bills in the past, I have to admit,  this legislation has given me significant pause. But we as a nation  face the largest threats that I have seen in my career as a doctor and,  certainly, during the short time that I have spent in Congress.   The President has declared a national emergency. Governors are  instituting shelter-in-place orders nationwide, and consumers have been  told not to consume because businesses have been told to shut their  doors and not conduct business.   If government is forcing them to shutter their doors, then our  responsibility is to help them out. The American Dream cannot be shut  down by a  [[Page H1830]]  virus, and that is why I will support this legislation, Mr. Speaker. It  is time to put political gamesmanship aside and pass legislation for  the health and safety of our Nation.
