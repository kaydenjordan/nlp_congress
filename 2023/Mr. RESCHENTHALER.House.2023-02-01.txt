 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Republican  Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 84         Resolved, That the following named member be, and is       hereby, elected to the following standing committee of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Ethics: Mr. Guest, Chair.    Mr. RESCHENTHALER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding section 1(a)(2)(A) of H. Res. 12, as amended by section  1(c) of House Resolution 78, the Select Subcommittee on the  Weaponization of the Federal Government be composed of the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary, together  with not more than 19 other Members, Delegates, or the Resident  Commissioner appointed by the Speaker, of whom not more than 8 shall be  appointed in consultation with the minority leader.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 83 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 83         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the concurrent resolution       (H. Con. Res. 9) denouncing the horrors of socialism. All       points of order against consideration of the concurrent       resolution are waived. The concurrent resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the concurrent resolution are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the concurrent resolution       and preamble to adoption without intervening motion except       one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Financial Services or their respective designees.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 76) removing a certain       Member from a certain standing committee of the House. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion except one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ethics or their       respective designees.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who is my good friend, pending which I  yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 83 provides for  consideration of two resolutions under a closed rule. They are H. Con.  Res. 9 and H. Res. 76.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying resolutions.   H. Con. Res. 9 is a simple resolution denouncing the horrors of  socialism in all forms and opposes the implementation of socialist  policy here in the United States.   This resolution should not be controversial. Socialism is a harmful  ideology that is opposed to everything the United States stands for.  Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin both described and demonstrated how  socialism is a transition period between capitalism and communism.   We have seen this time and time again. Socialist ideology creates a  concentration of power that leads to communist regimes, totalitarian  rule, and brutal dictatorships that deprive their citizens of basic  freedoms and human rights.   We have seen the horrors of communism through the tens of millions  killed by regimes in China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Cambodia,  and elsewhere, horrors that some of my colleagues across the aisle  refused to even condemn yesterday during the Rules Committee hearing on  this.   Even today, hundreds of thousands of Russians, Chinese, Cambodians,  Koreans, Cubans, and Venezuelans have fled from murderous communist  dictatorships and have legally resettled here in the United States.  They are a living testament to the barbarity of these socialist regimes  and the promise of the American Dream.   It is essential for Congress to condemn the atrocities committed in  the name of socialism and prevent any socialist policies from being  implemented in the United States.   Additionally, the rule before us provides for consideration H. Res.  76, a resolution that would remove Representative Ilhan Omar from her  seat on the Committee on Foreign Affairs.   Representative Omar has a repeated history of making deplorable and  despicable anti-Semitic remarks and does not deserve to sit on the  committee directly overseeing U.S. international policy, partnerships,  and national security.   In fact, the former chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, a  Democrat, Representative Eliot Engel, claimed that such comments made  by Representative Omar have ``no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee  or the House of Representatives.''   Compared to the actions taken by my Democratic colleagues last  Congress, I think that we Republicans are being incredibly generous in  only removing Representative Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs  Committee instead of from all her committee assignments, which we are  clearly in our right to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues support this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I remind my good friend from Massachusetts that I don't think you  will find anybody on this side of the aisle or in this Chamber that is  more of a hawk on Russia than me, and I would gladly condemn Vladimir  Putin. Let's not forget, Putin is a Communist. This is a man who  started his career as a KGB agent, so this resolution clearly covers  Vladimir Putin. We all condemn him.   Additionally, I remind the gentleman that the first time I ever spoke  on the House floor--I waited weeks to speak as a freshman. The first  time I spoke, though, was on anti-Semitism. I spoke to condemn the  shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill, Pennsylvania.  I remind my friends across the aisle that we have been mischaracterized  by some of the comments that were just said.   But let's talk about who won't condemn socialists. We had a ranking  member, Democratic ranking member in the Rules Committee hearing  yesterday who was given the chance to condemn. She would not do it. She  was given a chance to condemn Putin, would not do it; a chance to  condemn Pol Pot, wouldn't do it; and a litany of other socialists and  Communists. I just remind my friend from across the aisle that Members  on his side refuse to condemn socialists and Communist dictators.   I find it rich that there is a question over the definition of  socialism. Remember, for the last 2 years, my friends across the aisle  couldn't even define the term ``woman.'' We had that rigmarole where  they couldn't define ``woman'' and refused to acknowledge  [[Page H592]]  science, that there were different sexes. Now they split hairs between  the difference between socialism and communism? It is absolutely  laughable.   Let's just define ``socialism,'' since we are here having this  debate. Socialism is a political and economic theory of social  organization which advocates that means of production, distribution,  and exchange should be owned by the community as a whole, and it is not  me saying that socialism leads to communism. That is Marx saying that.  That is Lenin saying that. Part of their entire theory was you had a  transition period between capitalism and communism. That transition  period they called, again, Lenin and Marx, they called that socialism.  Let's be very clear what we are talking about. Let's not play games  with language, especially when you can't even define incredibly basic  terms that even kindergarten students could define.   Let's talk about what Representative Omar has said, talking about  that because I think it is important to put this in context.   In February of 2019 Representative Omar tweeted, ``It's all about the  Benjamins baby'' in reference to American support for Israel. She said  that AIPAC was buying U.S. Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  and the entire Democratic leadership actually condemned Representative  Omar for these anti-Semitic comments.   Then, again, just to show this is a pattern, this isn't some one-off  incident: February 27, 2019, she doubled down on her stance at a forum  in Washington, D.C., when she said, ``I want to talk about the  political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to  push for allegiance to a foreign country.''   Clearly, she is going back to the trope that Jewish Americans have a  dual loyalty between the United States and Israel. That offended  Chairman Eliot Engel, who at the time was the Democratic chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, and he said, ``It is unacceptable and  deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American  citizens because of their political views, including support for the  U.S.-Israel relationship. We all take the same oath. Worse,  Representative Omar's comments leveled that charge by invoking a vile  anti-Semitic slur.'' Again, that is not me saying that. That is a  former Democratic chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Further, in March 2019, Representative Omar trivialized the terrorist  attacks of September 11 that killed just about 3,000 U.S. citizens by  describing it as, ``Some people did something.'' Her words.   In 2021, a few months before the death of 13 servicemembers during  the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, Representative Omar compared  servicemembers of the United States and the Israel Defense Forces to  terrorist groups like Hamas and the Taliban. She tweeted, ``We have  seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel,  Afghanistan, and the Taliban.''   To think that a Representative here in this body would equate the  Israel Defense Forces and American servicemembers to Hamas and the  Taliban speaks volumes. It is unacceptable. That person should not be  on the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Representative Omar's Democratic colleagues sent a statement asking  her to clarify those remarks because it was offensive and misguided.  Again, the words of my colleagues across the aisle about Representative  Ilhan Omar's words, and she refused to apologize.   In May of 2021, Representative Omar accused Israel of committing war  crimes following days of conflict between Israel and Hamas, where Hamas  was launching rockets into Israel that saw thousands of missiles fired  indiscriminately at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, killing civilians. She  described Israel's defensive posture as war crimes, saying nothing  about the terrorist attacks of Hamas.   So spare me the false outrage over her comments. She has proven time  and time again that she should not be on the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Salazar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We all know why we are here today. We are here to condemn socialism.  Let's not play games. We know what socialism is.   Despite knowing what socialism and communism is, you are going to see  Democrat after Democrat come down here on the floor and refuse to vote  to condemn socialism and communism.   Let's talk about what that means. Mao Zedong, in the socialist  revolution in China, you had 55 million people starve to death in the  wake of famine and devastation caused by the so-called Great Leap  Forward in China.   You are going to have Democrats come to the floor and refuse to  condemn that.   Let's talk about Joseph Stalin. By the way, a history lesson: FDR, a  Democrat, would refer to Joseph Stalin as ``Uncle Joe'' when he was  trying to make this ruthless thug more palatable to the American  people.   Again, a Democrat praising Joseph Stalin; but I digress.   Under Stalin, tens of millions died in the Bolshevik revolution.   At least 10 million people were sent to the Gulags in the USSR; and  millions starved to death in Ukraine due to forced famine. Pol Pot  eliminated one-fourth of the population in Cambodia.   Again, you are going to have Democrats come to the floor and refuse  to condemn that.   Due to socialist and totalitarian policies, over 75 percent of  Venezuelans currently live in poverty. Only 3 percent of Venezuelans  consider themselves food secure. This was the largest GDP in South  America before Chavez took over, and now they are literally eating  their pet dogs to stop starvation.   Marxist socialist policies and communism regimes are responsible for  hundreds of millions of deaths worldwide. Again, my Democratic  colleagues  [[Page H594]]  will come to this floor later today and refuse to condemn it. It is  truly astounding.   Mr. Speaker, 3.5 million have starved to death in North Korea just  since the 1990s alone. In the current Communist regime in Cuba, the  government continues to repress and punish virtually all forms of  dissent and public criticism as Cubans endure the worst economic crisis  seen in decades.   Again, Democrats will come to the floor and refuse to condemn that.   During Castro's rule, thousands of Cubans have been incarcerated in  abysmal prisons; thousands more were harassed and intimidated; and  entire generations were denied basic freedoms.   Again, my Democratic colleagues, some of them will refuse to condemn  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Alford), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is nice to hear that people in Massachusetts are not  talking about communism. Do you know where they are talking about  communism? Places like south Florida. Places like Miami.   It is because, unlike those in Massachusetts, they have experienced  communism. They have experienced socialism. Ask any Cuban refugee.   That is why you have individuals here like Mario Diaz-Balart, like  Maria Salazar, like Carlos Gimenez who represent those districts.   This is an issue for a lot of Americans because they never want to  see the horrors of socialism and communism here on our shores.   It is not just Cuba. Let's talk about China because my friends across  the aisle always hesitate to criticize and condemn China. It is quite  remarkable.   China has deprived 1.4 billion human beings of their fundamental  human rights. Since March 2017, China has detained and persecuted 1.8  million Turkic Muslims, the Uyghurs.   They put them in so-called political reeducation camps. We all know  what those are. Those are death camps. Those are gulags. The Chinese  have them in their western province. The world is silent on it, and my  colleagues from across the aisle refuse to condemn socialism.   Those Uyghurs are being held in the western province without due  process. They are being forced to engage in labor and forced organ  harvesting. They are suffering atrocities like torture, and yet again,  my Democrat colleagues will refuse to condemn socialism today.   The CCP hasn't just violated the rights of the Uyghurs in western  China. They have also subjugated Tibet.   It used to be a cause celebre for my friends across the aisle to talk  about freeing Tibet. When I was growing up in the 1990s, you saw the  bumper stickers everywhere. Where is that outrage now from my  Democratic colleagues? Why won't they call out China?   In Tibet, the CCP has engaged in severe repression of the Tibetans'  unique religious, cultural, and linguistic heritage and is engaged in  gross human rights violations in Tibet, including but not limited to  extrajudicial detentions, disappearances, and torture.   Elsewhere, the CCP is widely alleged to be a major harvester and  trafficker of forcibly acquired organs. Organ harvesting targets  minorities, including the Falun Gong, Uyghurs, Tibetan Muslims, and  Christians in China.   Yet, where is the outrage from my friends across the aisle? Why won't  they condemn socialism here today on the House floor?   The CCP attempts to eliminate minority peoples through forced  abortion and sterilization. Where is the outrage from across the aisle?   There are 30 million more men in China than women due to forced  abortions and the one-child policy, the result of Big Government  socialism. Yet, again, my friends across the aisle will refuse to  condemn socialism.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  McCormick), my good friend and a good doctor.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this  time. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Just in the spirit of rebuttal, I would like to address some of the  comments made by my friend across the aisle.   The spending under President Trump; there was spending under  President Trump.   But you know what? He also had a pandemic, a pandemic that we haven't  seen in the last 100 years.   So where is the excuse for the $1.7 trillion that was just rammed  through?   You want to talk about closed rules, things not going through regular  order?   That $1.7 trillion was rammed through. It was architected--didn't  even go through the Senate Appropriations Committee. It was rammed  through by two Senators that are no longer here who had zero  accountability to the American public.   What about Build Back Better? Where is the excuse for that?   All Build Back Better did was increase inflation, hurt workers who  have wages that aren't keeping pace with inflation.   What about the Inflation Reduction Act? Where is the excuse for that  and why we had rampant spending there?   There is no excuse for it.   Let's talk about China. To paraphrase Marcus Aurelius, it is not  about one's words; it is about their deeds.   Let's talk about the deeds of my friends across the aisle. Three  years ago or so, my good friend, the Speaker of the House, put  together--he wanted to put together a select committee on China, and he  was strung along by my friends across the aisle.   Finally, the Speaker had to move forward on his own as the minority  Republican leader to put together the China Task Force. I was  privileged to be on the China Task Force. You know how many Democrats  were on that task force? Exactly zero. Zero Democrats joined that task  force.   So it is quite amazing how I hear that the Democrats want to condemn  China; but when they had the chance to have a select committee to  address the threat of China, they won't go along with. When they had  the chance to join a task force explicitly put together to combat China  and their malign influences on the world, zero of them joined that task  force. So spare me the talk on China. We have seen how you treated  China.   Let's talk about definitions; playing these silly games that we can't  define ``socialism'' and ``communism.'' We are all educated. We all  know what socialism is. We all know what communism is. So spare me the  fact that ``socialism'' isn't defined in this bill.   This is especially rich from the party, my friends across the aisle  who, for the last 2 years, couldn't even define basic terms like what  is a woman. That is not just me saying that.   Let's talk about Justice Brown Jackson. She was asked during  confirmation to define a woman; and you know what her response was?  ``No, I can't.''    So the party that can't define a woman now wants to sit here and say  that we can't define ``socialism'' and ``communism.'' We all know what  this is.   Let's talk about, lastly, Representative Ilhan Omar and due process.  I know there was a display put up regarding due process.   It is quite amazing how my friends across the aisle have now  discovered the principle of due process after 4 years--I'm sorry--2  years of one-party rule here in Washington, D.C., 2 years where due  process wasn't followed at all.   Where was the due process for my good friend from Georgia when she  was removed from all her committees? Again, that is all her committees.  We are only removing Representative Ilhan Omar from the Committee on  Foreign Affairs.   Where was the due process for my good friend, Dr. Gosar, when he was  removed, again, from all his committees?   There wasn't one Democrat who stood up and talked about due process.  But miraculously, now we have found due process when the Republicans  are removing somebody from a committee, one committee, for anti-Semitic  remarks, and a pattern of anti-Semitic remarks for that.   But let's just go back and talk about socialism. Let me be clear.  Socialism must never take root in America. President Trump himself said  America will never be a socialist Nation. These are words we should all  rally around. We should all support that.   But for too long, Democrats have fought this far-left authoritarian  agenda, regardless of the regimes across the globe that commit acts of  violence and oppression against their own people in its name.   Experiments with socialism have led to painful human tragedy. We are  talking about starvation, imprisonment, imprisonment without due  process, I might add, and mass murder.   Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty than any other  system. It is capitalism that is the way out of poverty, not socialism,  not communism.   Two hundred years ago, at the birth of capitalism, there were only  about 600 million people in the world who were not living in extreme  poverty. Today, due to the advance of capitalism, there are more than  6.5 billion people who are not living in extreme poverty. It was free- market capitalism that led the way here, not government-controlled  socialism.   Since 1970, the percentage of the world's population living on the  equivalent of less than $1 a day has fallen by more than 80 percent.  Instead of millions starving to death due to socialism and communism,  capitalism has pulled hundreds of millions of people out of despair.   Socialism and anti-Semitism have absolutely no place in America.   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  previous question and ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 83         Strike the first section after the resolving clause and       insert the following:        That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order       to consider in the House the concurrent resolution (H. Con.       Res. 9) denouncing the horrors of socialism. All points of       order against consideration of the concurrent resolution are       waived. The amendment printed in section 3 of this resolution       shall be considered as adopted. The concurrent resolution, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the concurrent resolution, as amended,       are waived. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the concurrent resolution and preamble, as       amended, to adoption without intervening motion or demand for       division of the question except one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services or their       respective designees.        At the end of the resolution, insert the following:        Sec. 3. The amendment referred to in the first section of       this resolution is as follows:        ``Page 3, line 4, add at the end the following:        ``For purposes of the previous sentence, the term       `socialism' does not include existing  [[Page H598]]       Federal programs and policies such as Medicare, Social       Security, TRICARE, VA Healthcare, the VA Home Loan program,       VA burial benefits, and VA homelessness programs.''.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
