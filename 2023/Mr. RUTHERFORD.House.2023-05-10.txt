 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, throughout my life, I have answered a call to public  service. For 40 years I dedicated my career to serving in law  enforcement--12 of which I led as sheriff.   I know from firsthand experience that every day law enforcement  officers put their lives on the line when they put on their uniform and  step out into their communities to keep us safe.   That kind of sacrifice is part of the commitment these officers make  to protect citizens across the country and is essential to making our  communities and neighborhoods safe.    Over the past few years, we have seen calls to defund the police  sweep across this Nation, and we have heard Members of this very  Chamber support efforts to demoralize and delegitimize the brave men  and women who enforce our laws to keep us safe.   This has made it incredibly difficult for law enforcement officers to  do their jobs--not to mention the liberal prosecutors and district  attorneys who are failing to do their job to keep criminals off the  street.   The results?   A spike in violent crime that has left cities less safe than they  were 3 years ago.   I am proud that our House Republicans, led by Speaker McCarthy, are  focusing on upholding law and order across America. House Republicans  are committed to supporting our law enforcement.   That means helping agencies hire more police officers, opposing all  efforts to defund the police, and cracking down on those prosecutors  and district attorneys who have refused to do their jobs and prosecute  crimes.   We recently voted to overturn D.C.'s soft-on-crime criminal justice  reforms that reduced penalties for people who are committing crimes  like carjacking and robbery.   Throughout my career in law enforcement, I have seen how failure to  prosecute minor crimes leads to more serious violent crimes. We need to  work with our leaders in law enforcement--work with them--not against  them.   That is why I was proud to reintroduce the ` this week. This bill  would provide small police departments, with fewer than 200 officers,  the resources that they need to hire and retain the best officers,  provide necessary training, and improve officer well-being.   Small law enforcement departments make up more than 96 percent of our  local U.S. police departments. The Invest to Protect Act would simplify  the grant process and give departments the flexibility to make  meaningful investments in their officers and communities.   Part of making grants more accessible to law enforcement agencies is  by removing strings to Federal money. I have been fighting against  President Biden's efforts to empower the U.S. Attorney General to make  training and policy decisions, moving local policing decisions from  local sheriffs and local police chiefs to the Federal Government.   That is a very scary idea for someone who understands the importance  of keeping policing local. The strength of America's domestic security  lies in the diversity of our State and local law enforcement.   We can start by defunding sections 19 and 20 of the President's  executive order on policing which require law enforcement agencies who  receive Federal money to be accredited to standards that are set by the  AG and to meet a list of policies, also decided by the Attorney  General, before they are eligible for Federal grant money.   Any move to nationalize local law enforcement must be resisted at  every turn.   Most importantly, we must do all we can to keep law enforcement  officers safe while they are on duty. That is why I reintroduced the  Protect and Serve Act again this year to strengthen penalties on  criminals who violently target our law enforcement officers. We must  hold these criminals accountable and show our officers that we have  their backs.   As we mark National Police Week and remember those who gave their  lives in service to their communities, we must come together to support  policies that make our law enforcement officers' lives safer and more  effective.   Together we can support law enforcement through sound policy and  oversight and send the message that House Republicans are committed to  passing critical legislation through the House, Senate, and the White  House.                                time  2110     Mr. Speaker, 246 officers from the State of Florida:  Officer Christopher Gibson, Detective Joseph Anthony Tripoli,  Deportation Officer William Hayes, Trooper John Sumter Horton, Deputy  Sheriff Bryan Vannatta, Officer Bart Lane Arnold, Officer Jesus Delaluz  ``Chuy'' Lara III, Officer David Leroy Ingle, Officer Franklin Joe,  Officer Bruce Eckhoff, Officer Richard Lynn Tostenson, Captain Reginald  Kamal Smith, Sergeant Gerardo Morales, Deputy Sheriff Michael Queeney,  Detention Sergeant Janell L.
