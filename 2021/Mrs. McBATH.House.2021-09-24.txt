 Madam Speaker, generations of women fought for the right  to vote, they fought for a seat in the university classroom, a seat in  the boardroom, and a seat in our government. And they fought for the  freedom for us to make our own decisions about our bodies.   Generations of women secured these gains so that we could build on  their efforts toward a just and equitable society. We cannot allow  their work to be undone. That is why I am proud to vote in favor of the  Women's Health Protection Act.
