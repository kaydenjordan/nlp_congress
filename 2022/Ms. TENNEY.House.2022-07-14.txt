 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate my good  friend, former New Hartford Police Chief Michael Inserra, who retired  at the end of June after an absolutely incredible career.   Michael has served our local communities in law enforcement over 40  years. Born and raised in my hometown of New Hartford, New York,  Michael started out in 1982 with the Whitestown Police Department and  quickly moved to the town of Kirkland Police Department. In 1988,  Michael made his big move to the New Hartford Police Department to  start a new career in law enforcement where he would serve for another  34 years.   Inserra was a sergeant in the department during one of the most  challenging times in its history, during the line-of-duty death of  Officer Joseph Corr. Inserra played a key role in apprehending the  suspects and helping the department and community navigate the horrible  tragedy and aftermath.   In 2010, Inserra was named chief of the New Hartford Police  Department. Shortly after taking charge, the department made immediate  changes, including modernizing its IT equipment, adding computers to  all of their patrol cars, testing body cameras for their officers, and  joining social media, which Inserra said helped strengthen the bond  with the community.   To this day, Michael Inserra gives credit to the department for their  continued success, commending them for professionalism and unwavering  dedication to duty.   I thank Chief Inserra for his lifetime of service and commitment to  the town of New Hartford. Our communities are grateful for his many  years of service as is the New Hartford Police Department, which  continues to thrive from his insight.                            ____________________
